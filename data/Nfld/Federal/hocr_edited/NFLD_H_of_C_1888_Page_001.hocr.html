               business of the country is carried on by the Ministers, who 
               <br />
               are responsible to this House and to the people for the acts

               at the close of a long career, which has been satisfactory 
               <br />
               alike to the people and the Government, His Excellency

               should attempt to interfere with matters that pertain solely 
               <br />
               to his advisers, and for which they are responsible. There- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               The charge that the hon. gentleman makes, or supposes

               Mr. MITCHELL. It is not a question whether the 
               <br />
               Government assumed the responsibilty of the acts of the 
               <br />
               Governor or not. The question I put is whether the 
               <br />
               Governor performed this act with the knowledge and at 
               <br />

               <br />
               that he is interfering with matters <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> which he has no
