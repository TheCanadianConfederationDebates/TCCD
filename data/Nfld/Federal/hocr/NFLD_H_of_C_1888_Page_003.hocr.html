               He said: There is a Bill before the House standing, I 
               <br />
               think, for its second reading, introduced by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Frontenac (Mr. Kirkpatrick), which relates closely 
               <br />
               to this subject, and I sincerely hepe the hon. member will 
               <br />
               press his Bill, and that it will receive the support of both 
               <br />
               sides of this House. His Bill is to permit American vessels 
               <br />
               to aid vessels which are wrecked or disabled in Canadian 
               <br />
               waters. I suppose that that Bill would not have been in- 
               <br />
               troduced by that hon. gentleman unless the Canadian au- 
               <br />
               thorities had hitherto prevented American vessels from 
               <br />
               aiding wrecked or disabled vessels in Canadian waters. I 
               <br />
               have no doubt, however, that the reason why the Canadian 
               <br />
               authorities took this exceeding harsh line was because the 
               <br />
               American Government prevented Canadian vessels from 
               <br />
               assisting vessels which were wrecked in American waters. 
               <br />
               I think it will be of considerable advantage to this 
               <br />
               House, in the consideration of the Bill to which I have 
               <br />
               referred, if these papers are bi ought down, so much, at 
               <br />
               least, as the Government feel at liberty to bring down, 
               <br />
               and I hepe they will bring them all down. The 
               <br />
               motion refers not only to correspondence and Orders in 
               <br />
               Council with reference to the refusal of the United 
               <br />
               States authorities to allow Canadian wrecking vessels 
               <br />
               and machinery to assist vessels in American waters, 
               <br />
               but also as to the refusal of the Canadian authorities 
               <br />
               to allow Americans to do so, so that we will have both 
               <br />
               features of the case before us when we have these papers. 
               <br />
               1 have no doubt, as I said before, that the Canadian author- 
               <br />
               ities could not have adopted the harsh measures which they 
               <br />
               have in this matter, and which are to be cured by this Bill, 
               <br />
               unless the Americans had done the same, but I ﬁnd in the 
               <br />
               United States Congress they do not take exactly that view 
               <br />
               of the case. They seem to think that the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern.</span> 
               <br />
               ment has acted much more harshly towards them than they 
               <br />
               have acted towards the Canadian Government. However, 
               <br />
               the ,apers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrllgshow</span> how that is. But in order to show 
               <br />

               when this correspondence is brought down. But he quotes

               “On or about the 80th day of September, 1881, I. being controlling

               owner of steam-barge Thompson Kingsford, was notiﬁed that she was

               ashore at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wellington,</span> Out., and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immediate</span> assistance was needed. I 
               <br />
               informed our wrecker, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Allan, who expressed himself ready to start,

               <br />
               in their waters. Itherefore applied by wire to the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Marine at Ottawa, and after a long delav was informed that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assist.</span>

               ance needed could be procured at Kingston, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">applicauen</span> was 
               <br />
               denied I thought the treatment was severe, especially as my tugs were

               all ready to go, and we could have got the barge out of danger <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> 24

               hours. As it was, during <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> delay, or rather by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delay.</span> in waiting 
               <br />
               for an answer, she was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subjected</span> to a severe gale, causing great damage 
               <br />
               and eventually costing us about $l,200 more than it Would if we could 
               <br />
               have done the work ourselves. A gain, about the mm de _of August 
               <br />
               1882, the same barge was sunk in the Bay of Quinté by co listen, and I 
               <br />
               again made application to go to her relief with my own appliances, 
               <br />
               and was again <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refused.”</span>

               sent to him by Albert Quonce, also of Oswego, dated lat

               February, 1888, in which Mr. Quonce stated:
