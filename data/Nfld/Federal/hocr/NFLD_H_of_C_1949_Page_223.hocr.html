               Canada due to our exports? If we do export

               <br />
               production of nails in Canada is limited by 
               <br />
               the capacity of Canada to produce wire from 
               <br />
               which nails are made. Last year, during the 
               <br />
               period June to October, there was a diversion 
               <br />
               of wire from fencing into the manufacture of 
               <br />
               nails. That diversion is to be repeated this 
               <br />
               year, but it will start one month earlier and 
               <br />
               extend to the same termination date. In other

               words there will be an extra month during
