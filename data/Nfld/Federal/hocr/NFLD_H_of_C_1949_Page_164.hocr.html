               I wonder if the Minister of Trade and 
               <br />
               Commerce could report on the discussion 
               <br />
               which took place with the delegates from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and what machinery will now 
               <br />
               exist to make it possible to continue the 
               <br />
               practice in Newfoundland that was under— 
               <br />
               taken by the St. John’s housing corporation?

               Mr. Howe: It was understood that the 
               <br />
               facilities of Central Mortgage and Housing 
               <br />
               Corporation would be available in Newfound- 
               <br />
               land, just as they are available in other parts 
               <br />
               of Canada. The building project in question 
               <br />
               differs from any plan we have in Canada in 
               <br />
               that the houses are built to be sold. The 
               <br />
               expenses in developing the land were con- 
               <br />
               siderably more than anticipated. The fund 
               <br />
               is not in good shape at the present time, and 
               <br />
               the work is being retarded. Mr. Mansur, 
               <br />
               president of the corporation, visited New- 
               <br />
               foundland some three weeks ago and had a 
               <br />
               discussion with those responsible for the 
               <br />
               fund. I visited Newfoundland last week end, 
               <br />
               and I was told that the discussions were very 
               <br />
               satisfactory. As it was not my responsibility 
               <br />
               at the present time, I did not go into detail 
               <br />
               in the matter; but I know it will be the pur- 
               <br />
               pose of the corporation to see that houses
