<head rendition="simple:centre">HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</head>    

<p rendition="simple:right">TUESDAY, Feb. 28.</p>
<p>The horse met at 3 o'clock. <lb/></p> 

<p>On motion of the hon ATTORNEY GENERAL, the <lb/>
house resolved itself into committee of the whole on <lb/>
the further consideration of the Confederation of the <lb/>
British North American Colonies, Mr Knight in the <lb/>
chair. <lb/></p>
<p><persName ref="pers:WINT1">Dr. WINTER</persName>.—That was a subject of the deepest <lb/>
importance to the county, and to which every hon. <lb/>
member should devote his greatest attention, and con<lb break="no"/>sider in all its bearings. He fully concurred in the <lb/>
testimony borne by the hon Attorney General to the <lb/>
manner in which the Delegates had discharged their <lb/>
duty at the Conference at Qnebec. They did credit <lb/>
to themselves and the colony they represented, as well <lb/>
as to the government by whom they were appointed; <lb/>
and the part they took in the deliberations of the con<lb break="no"/>ference secured them the respect of the delegates from <lb/>
the other provinces. With regard to the Report of <lb/>
the conference, there was much difference of opinion <lb/>
respecting its details. He (Dr Winter) would not <lb/>
enter into a review of the arguments of hon members <lb/>
who had spoken in opposition to the report, many of <lb/>
whose views were entitled to consideration. The hon <lb/>
member for Placentia, Mr Shea, assured the House <lb/>
that steam communication would be provided for us; <lb/>
but he (Dr. Winter) would like to have a guarantee <lb/>
for it before entering into the confederation; both for <lb/>
a second postal steamer, as for steamers to Canada, <lb/>
and steam communication with Great Britain. That <lb/>
was a matter which was too important to be left for <lb/>
<choice><sic>futnre</sic><corr>future</corr></choice> arrangement. With respect to our representa<lb break="no"/>tion in the Federal House of Commons, he must say <lb/>
that he did not see that our interests were safficiently <lb/>
protected. We were to have only 8 members in the <lb/>
House of 189, Prince Edward Island, seeming to be <lb/>
decidedly hostile to Confederation, might be left out. <lb/>
The representation was to be adjusted every ten <lb/>
years, according to the census, population being taken <lb/>
as the basis. The other Provinces, especially Upper <lb/>
Canada, increased, much more rapidly in population <lb/>
than we did, so that we would lose members, while <lb/>
Upper Canada got an increase every ten years. Taking <lb/>
Lower Canada, under Confederation, as one of the <lb/>
maritime provinces, as that province is interested in <lb/>
the fisheries, he still found that, according to the ratio <lb/>
of increase between 1851 and 1861, Upper Canada <lb/>
would, at no very distant period, have a larger popula<lb break="no"/>tion, and consequently a larger number of members <lb/>
than all the maritime colonies reckoned together. <lb/>
He looked upon Lower Canada as being a maritime <lb/>
Province; but still that was not sufficient to maintain <lb/>
the balance of power against the increasing numbers <lb/>
of Upper Canada. That province increased every ten <lb/>
years at the rate of 40 per cent., while the ratio for <lb/>
Lower Canada was under 26 per cent, for the same <lb/>
period. Now Lower Canada was always to have 65 <lb/>
members, and as the Upper Province progressed at <lb/>
the rate of 15 per cent for every ten years, over the <lb/>
Lower, it would receive an accession of members <lb/>
every ten years. When he came down to Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, he found that by reference to the increase of our <lb/>
population between the census of 1845 and that of <lb/>
1857, the increase, reduced to a period of ten years, <lb/>
was slightly under 20 per cent. Taking the relative <lb/>
population of the several colonies as at the census of <lb/>
1861, and looking at Lower Canada as having fisheries <lb/>
and other interests identical with Newfoundland and <lb/>
the other maritime colonies. <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>He</corr></choice> at first considered that <lb/>
the combined influence of these colonies would be <lb/>
sufficient to <choice><sic>proteet</sic><corr>protect</corr></choice> them in the Federal Parliament; <lb/>
but looking to the future, he apprehended that would <lb/>
not be the case. The arrangement, so far as related <lb/>
to the representation given to Upper and Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da, appeared just, but its application to the maritime <lb/>
colonies would have the effect of lessening their nu<lb break="no"/>merical as well as their relative representation, to such <lb/>
an extent, that in a short period, the majority of 25 <lb/>
over Upper Canada, given to Lower Canada and the <lb/>
Maritine Provinces, exclusive of Prince Edward <lb/>
Island, on entering the union, will soon become, <lb/>
"small and beautifully less," until, in 36 years hence, <lb/>
Upper Canada will have a majority of 20 over all the <lb/>
other Provinces of the Confederation combined. This <lb/>
would be seen on reference to the tabular statement <lb/>
which he held in his hand, and which he would read <lb/>
to the house. (Here the hon member read the sub<lb break="no"/>joined tabular statement.) That statement was based <lb/>
upon the census returns of the several Provinces, for <lb/>
1851 and 1861, the latter of which was taken by the <lb/>
Conference as the basis on which they apportioned the <lb/>
representation of the several Provinces, the average <lb/>
population for each representative being about 17,000. <lb/>
In 1871, the average for all the Provinces, taking <lb/>
Lower Canada, with 65 members, as the basis, will be <lb/>
21,495 for each member. In 1871, the total number <lb/>
of members will be 196, Upper Canada gaining 9 mem<lb break="no"/>bers and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland losing 1 <lb/>
member each; the total population being 4,226,949, <lb/>
five per cent. on which is 211,347, which divided by <lb/> 
196, the number of members, will give 1078 as the <lb/> 
five per cent. to each member. Newfoundland, to hold <lb/>
her 8 members, will require 8 times 21, 495, the basis <lb/>
of increase with 65 members for Lower Canada, or a <lb/>
population of 171,960; but as the population of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will be only 154,227, which divided by 8, <lb/>
gives only 19,278, or a decrease of 2,217 for each <lb/>
    member—whole decrease 17,733,—which being more <lb/>
than 10 per cent, or over double 1,078, "relatively <lb/>
to the population of the whole union;" consequently, <lb/>
by the operation of the 21st Resolution of the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, Newfoundland will lose one member, and Nova <lb/>
Scotia one, without taking into account the gradual loss <lb/>
of influence arising from the rapid increase of the Upper <lb/>
Canadian section of the union. He (Dr Winter) was in<lb break="no"/>ducted to go so much into detail, as there existed a <lb/>
difference of opinion as to the construction of the 21st <lb/>
resolution, more from a desire to elicit the logical <lb/>
opinious of hon members, than with the wish or in<lb break="no"/>tention of pronouncing dogmatically on the point. <lb/>
However, in the mulitude of counsel which sur<lb break="no"/>rounded him, it was not too much to expect that he <lb/>
would be more correctly advised, and that if his views <lb/>
were not tacitly assented to, they would be "let down" <lb/>
gently by those hon gentlemen who differed from him. <lb/>
By referring to the tabular statement, it would be <lb/>
seen that Upper Canada enters the confederation with <lb/>
82 members, Lower Canada and the Martime Prov<lb break="no"/>inces (not including Prince Edward Island), with a <lb/>
representation of 107, being a majority of 25 members <lb/>
over Upper Canada—total 189 members. In 36 years <lb/>
from, this time the additional increase of popula<lb break="no"/>tion in Upper Calada will be 3,921,477, which will <lb/>
give her 42 additional members, in all 124 being a <lb/>
majority of 20 over Lower Canada and the other <lb/>
one provinces whose increasel population of 2,<lb break="no"/>635,302 will have 3 members fewer than the number <lb/>
allowed to then (107) when they enter the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, or, in other words, 4,567,644 in 36 years <lb/>
hence, will have 104 members, whilst in 1861 when <lb/>
their whole population amounted to only 1,822,384 <lb/>
they were alotted, on entering the Confederation, <lb/>
107 members, there, giving Upper Canada a major<lb break="no"/>ity of 29 over Lower Canada and the other Maritime <lb/>
Provinces. Surely if Upper Canada's increase of 3,<lb break="no"/>921,477 gives her 42 additional members, or 1 to <lb/>
93,361 the increase of Lower Canada and the other <lb/>
maritine provinces, (not including Prince Edward <lb/>
    
    <cb/>
    
Island,) of 2,635,362, ought to recieve 28 members <lb/>
at the same rate of 1 member to 93,361, making a <lb/>
total of 124 for Upper Canada, and 135 for Lower <lb/>
Canada and the maritime provinces being 259 in <lb/>
all, 36 years hence. Even this would reduce the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of Lower Canada and the maritime provinces <lb/>
from 25 to 11, and be a gain to Upper Canada of 14. <lb/>
With regard to the observations of some hon members, <lb/>
that Canada had to apprehend the hostility of the <lb/>
United States, and that thus we would be involved in <lb/>
a large expenditure, which we might avoid by keeping <lb/>
out of the Confederation, and that our young men <lb/>
would be drafted to defend the frontier of Canada, he <lb/>
did not attach any importance to that matter. If <lb/>
there should be a war with the United States, of <lb/>
which he (Dr. Winter) was not apprehensive, it would <lb/>
be a war between England and the United States, in <lb/>
which we, as a Colony of England would, in any case, <lb/>
be involved. Confederation or no Confederation, it <lb/>
was our duty, as well as our interest, to aid in protect<lb break="no"/>ing ourselves. . He (Dr. Winter) felt convinced that <lb/>
the House would not adopt the Quebec Resolutions <lb/>
in their present shape; but he had no doubt they <lb/>
would be so modified as to meet the views of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces generally. He had, therefore, much pleasure <lb/>
in supporting the resolution before the chair, that the <lb/>
matter be referred to the constituencies before any de<lb break="no"/>cision shall be had in the matter. <lb/></p>

Friday last, when His Excelſency the Governor, ac<lb break="no"/>companied by his suite, came down to the Council <lb/>
Chamber, and having given his assent to the Bills <lb/>
passed during the session, addressed the members of <lb/>
both branches in the following Speech: — <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. President and Honorable Gentlemen of the <lb/>
Council: <lb/>
Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Honorable House <lb/>
of Assembly: <lb/>
The period has arrived at which I may with pro<lb break="no"/>priety relieve you from further Legislative occupation, <lb/>
and enable you to return to your personal duties and <lb/>
business, which in their diligent fulfilment are not less <lb/>
import,nt than your Sessional labors to the general <lb/>
welfare of the community of which you are members. <lb/>
I have been acquainted with the Resolution passed <lb/>
by the Honorable House of Assembly on the snbject <lb/>
of the proposed Confederation of the British North <lb/>
American Colonies, to the effect that for the reasons <lb/>
set forth the House deems it desirable to submit the <lb/>
question to the consideration of the people before the <lb/>
decision of the Legislature ts taken upon it; and that <lb/>
for this purpose final determination i. this impor<lb break="no"/>tant subject should be deferred until the next meeting <lb/>
of the Legislative bodies <lb/>
Under other circumstances I might perhaps have <lb/>
viewed with regret any delay in dealing with a subject <lb/>
on which Her Majesty's Imperial Government have <lb/>
exhibited so warn and get erous an interest. . But, <lb/>
as it is almost certain that some of the other Colonies <lb/>
concerned in the proposed arrangement will not dur<lb break="no"/>ing the Session of the present year declare y de­ <lb/></p> 

<p>£d Confederation being comprehended and appreciated <lb/>
by the people whom it is designed to *rve, I am not <lb/>
now disposed to dissent from the view which you <lb/>
have taken of the matter, or the course you have <lb/>
adopted. Her ajesty's Government would not, de; <lb/>
sire to force any important modification of the local <lb/>
constitution upon the acceptance of the people of the <lb/>
Colony, against temperate and deliberate declaration <lb/>
of unwillingness to receive it; and it is desirable that <lb/>
the community should fully understand the advantages <lb/>
of that to which their assent is sought. But the <lb/>
Nation has a right to expect the Colonies to accept, <lb/>
and does look to them to assume, their legitimate <lb/>
portion of those charges and responsibilities which are <lb/>
the inevitable concomitants of self-government and <lb/>
free political institutions; and Her Majesty's Min<lb break="no"/>isters jusly regard with favor, a project of Union <lb/>
which will mutually and matérially strengthen each <lb/>
for sustaining the burden which must be borne by all. <lb/>
I observe with much satisfaction the several important <lb/>
and valuable measures which you have adopted during <lb/>
the present Sessiºn. In some of them you have built <lb/>
solid foundations for future improveme it in different <lb/>
departments of public affairs; and in others you have <lb/>
provided for immediate local requirements, such as <lb/>
the proposed Light-House at Burgeo and the Bridges <lb/>
over the Rocky River in Placentia Bay, which are in <lb/>
themselves elements of progress. By the Act for the <lb/>
Registration of Births and Deaths you will have, I <lb/>
hope, established the means of procuring statistical <lb/>
data of which the Colony has hitherto, been utterly <lb/>
destitute, respecting the population, and their <lb/>
sanitary and social condition, and of which the value <lb/>
will not perhaps be appreciated fully until the know<lb break="no"/>ledge is acquired which can only be obtained from <lb/>
them. <lb/>
I trust at no distant period the wisdom will be ob: <lb/>
vious of the amendments which you have made in the <lb/>
previous system with regard to the repair and main<lb break="no"/>tenance of highways, by transferring to the Board of <lb/>
Works the superintendence and control of expenditure <lb/>
on the main postal rout-s. . . And by making perma<lb break="no"/>nent the legal provisions which are necessary for this <lb/>
branch of the public service, you have left only to be <lb/>
furnished annually the grant of money necessary to <lb/>
carry them out, which may simply form an item in the <lb/>
Bill of Supply. <lb/>
The amendments and continuance of the Wolunteer <lb/>
organization Act, and the encouragement which you <lb/>
have bestowed upon the establishment of local Pro<lb break="no"/>tective Forces by the grant on account of Clothing to <lb/>
the existing Corps, will I have no doubt effect much <lb/>
towards the development of that patriotic spirit and <lb/>
self-reliant tone of feeling which eommands respect <lb/>
for communities. You may depend upon my cordial <lb/>
solieitude in my office as Commander in Chief to use <lb/>
the powers and the means which you have placed at <lb/>
my disposal for the credit of the Colony, and in the <lb/>
manner best ealculated to effect the improvement of <lb/>
the Corps. <lb/>
Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Honorable House <lb/>
of Assembly * <lb/>
I readily acknowledge the enlightened liberality <lb/>
with which you have granted, not only the usual <lb/>
amounts for the ordinary public service, but in ac<lb break="no"/>cordance with the suggestions contained in my Speech <lb/>
when opening the present Session, have placed grants <lb/>
at the disposal of the Executive authority for the en<lb break="no"/>couragement of the Bank fisheries;–the introduction <lb/>
of the culture of Flax, and for the compilation of the <lb/>
local Laws. Guided by the counsel of my Constitu<lb break="no"/>tional advisers, you may rely upon my sedulous care <lb/>
being bestowed to ensure the judicious application of <lb/>
the funds so entrustcd to the local Government. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. President and Honorable Gentlemen of the <lb/>
Council: <lb/>
Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Honorable House <lb/>
of Assembly: <lb/></p> 

<p>In compliance with an Address which I have receiv<lb break="no"/>ed on the subject of the Sahmon Fisheries, attention <lb/>
shall be given to enquiry respecting the best mode of <lb/>
proceeding for their protection, with the view of rub<lb break="no"/>mitting a measure at the next Session of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture embodying the provisions which may appear ne<lb break="no"/>cessary. <lb/></p> 

<p>Although the result of the Seal Fishery is not yet <lb/>
fully known, the success enjoyed by some vesse's which <lb/>
have already returned justifies the belief that the com<lb break="no"/>munity may be congratulated upon at , least a fairly <lb/>
profitable season in this branch of our local industry. <lb/></p> 

<p>The mildness of the Winter and the apparent prom<lb break="no"/>ise of a fine and early Spring would seem to encourage <lb/>
hope for an equally successful Cod Fishery, and on <lb/>
on separating now I trust that I may be permitted to <lb/>
cherish the cheerful anticipation that when I again <lb/>
have the pleasure of meeting the Council and Assem<lb break="no"/>bly in Session, it will be under circumstances more <lb/>
propitious than those which ushered in the present <lb/>
year. <lb/></p> 

<p>The following is a list of the Bills:–<lb break="maybe"/>1—An Act to Indemnify His Excellency the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor of Newfoundland for certain Sums of Money <lb/>

<p>pâssed in the 27th <lb/></p> 

<p>It will be observed that the leading featue of the stati. <lb/>
manlike address of His Excellency is the subject of Co<lb break="no"/>lonial Unicn; and we are glad to see the view which <lb/>
His Excellency propounds on this great question as <lb/>
well as the fitting position accorded to it in his closing <lb/>
Speech. There cannot, we think, be a doubt of the <lb/>
wisdom of the course adopted by the Legislature in <lb/>
postponing its decision upon so momentous a change, <lb/>
until the opinion of the constituencies shall have bº <lb/>
maturely formed; and it is satistaetory to see that His <lb/>
Excellency considers this proceeding justified by those <lb/>
circumstances under which the proposition came before <lb/>
the local public. Nothing can be more obvious than <lb/>
that an endeavour to precipitate such a measure upon <lb/>
a people who had never before given it a serious <lb/>
thought, and amongst whom fears and prejudice wers <lb/>
arrayed against it to a large extent, would have been <lb/>
in any case a very hazardous experiment. The very <lb/>
idea of haste would have prompted to their mind, <lb/>
conclusions the least favourable to the new order of <lb/>
things, and the designs of dishonest opponents would <lb/>
have found large and rapid promotion in the furors <lb/>
thus created. It was quite possible, we know, that the <lb/>
course of events should have so placed us as to have <lb/>
forced the choice of braving the danger to which wº <lb/>
refer–of accepting Confederation in the face of it, or <lb/>
of excluding ourselves indefinitely from a place in the <lb/>
Union. Had the other colonies been prompt to form <lb/>
the league, the alternaive of keeping Newfoundlend <lb/>
outside it "in the cold" would have involved a re. <lb/>
sponsibility which few of us perhaps would have had <lb/>
the herdihood to assume. The probability is that in <lb/>
that event the Legislature at all events would have <lb/>
adjudged it the lesser evil to accept the proposed con<lb break="no"/>ditions, and to trust to time and to the practical work: <lb/>
ing of Confederation to windicate their conduct to <lb/>
those whose true interests they felt they were con<lb break="no"/>serving. Happily we have been spared this trying <lb/>
ordeal. The delay which had arisen in the sist-r prº<lb break="no"/>vinces in connexion with this matter has made our <lb/>
course an easy one; and the Consequent postpoesment <lb/>
of a final judgment here insures that object which <lb/>
His Excellency Judly holds to be so desirable—" that <lb/>
the community should fully understand the advantages <lb/>
of that to which their assent is sought." <lb break="no"/> </p> 

<p>And while agreeing fully in this opinion, we canno <lb/>
but approve of the eandour with which His Excellency <lb/>
has indicated the expectation of the Imperial G -<lb break="maybe"/>vernment as to the part these colonies should <lb/>
assume. It has bêen clear enough to most <lb/>
readers of the views of British statesmen and the <lb/>
British press that Confederation was not only an <lb/>
anxious desire of our Imperial rulers, but that it couli <lb/>
hardly be regarded as less than their foregone con<lb break="no"/>clusion.Its opponents have laboured hard to shut their <lb/>
own and other mens' eyes to the many plain evi<lb break="no"/>dencáš of this state of feeling which have come under <lb/>
view; and the dreamiest delusions have been wrought <lb/>
up to make-believe that the mother country desired <lb/>
nothing more than that the colonies should please <lb/>
themselves in the affair, and least of all would she <lb/>
for a moment think of crossing any predilection of <lb/>
her "old and loyal". Newfoundlandſ However egre<lb break="no"/>gious these absurdities, there are those amongst us <lb/>
who cherish them, as people so commºnly do cherish <lb/>
favourite conceits notwithstanding all that light can <lb/>
do to dispel them. We therefore think it weil an! <lb/>
judicious that the recognised Hepresentative an I expo. <lb/>
nent of Imperial policy has so explicitly de-la-e t <lb/>
the judgment of the Imperial authorities on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and we do trust that His Excellency's emphatic <lb/>
pronouncement will work with salutary effect in the <lb/>
correction of misapprehensions and in preparing the <lb/>
mind of the country for that change whose fore<lb break="no"/>shadowings are certainly neithér few nor indis<lb break="no"/>tin:t. <lb/></p> 

<p>-º-º-º<lb break="no"/>Tha Rev. Dr. Howley lectured on Friday evening at <lb/>
the Catholic Institute on the subject of the Pontificate <lb/>
of Pius the Ninth. It was no easy task to impart new <lb/>
interest to a historical and personal narrative with <lb/>
which most Catholic readers are already so familiar; <lb/>
yet it is most justly due to the Reverend lecturer to <lb/>
say that he reached this high pitch of excellence with<lb break="no"/>out the least apparent effort and as if by some special <lb/>
aptitude for the theme of his selection. We feel sure <lb/>
that not one of his audience, however conver<lb break="no"/>sant with the subject, could say at the close of the <lb/>
lecture that he had not gathered from it some new <lb/>
matter or had not had old incidents and characteristicº <lb/>
presented in c'earer and more attractive light than he <lb/>
had known before. The lecture was evidently the <lb/>
product of a thorough, exact knowledge of the eyents <lb/>
of this most eventful Pontificate and of the various <lb/>
causes and springs in which they had their origin. Ins' <lb/>
allusions to the character and virtues of the Holy <lb/>
Father, and the profound admiration with which they <lb/>
had inspired the lecturer, possessed that peculiar <lb/>
freshness and glow which personal acquaintance with <lb/>
His Holiness could alone have given. The Reverend <lb/>
lecturer's own views, and his deductions from the <lb/>
events he grouped together, evinced acute judgment <lb/>
as well as deep learning; addin whatever respect we <lb/>
consider this production, we feel how favoured is the <lb/>
Institute in being presided over by one whom thos" <lb/>
members who would excel as lecturers may so fit? <lb/>
select as their model, <lb/></p>

<p>By means of its Allocation of Profit in Cash towards <lb/>

portion (one-third or one-fourth) of the premiums tie<lb break="no"/>cessary to keep the policy in force. The unpaid part <lb/>
is allowed to remain in the hands of the Assured as <lb/>
long as he pleases, and he is not asked to pay intërest <lb/>

will be deducted from the sum assured at death, New <lb/>

<p>Consolation for The Suffering.—There is no <lb/>
little consolation in the thought that, however the im<lb break="no"/>postor may flºurish for the season, he cannot long <lb/>
continue to delude mankind. How many men con<lb break="no"/>trive to acquire a brief and flashy reputation, and <lb/>
then sink into disrepute and oblivion! . This is espe<lb break="no"/>clally true of the pretenders to medical skill, who, in <lb/>
an age when diseases abound, seek to inveigle them<lb break="no"/>selves into the confidence of the public, and to im<lb break="no"/>pose upon it with their noxious nostrums... We con<lb break="no"/>fess that years ago, when we first heard of the univer<lb break="no"/>sal celebrity of Professor Holloway, we distrusted his <lb/>
lofty claims, and arrogated to ourselves a superiority <lb/>
discernment which would not allow him to entrap our <lb/>
judgment. Most heartily do we beg his pardon for <lb/>
the unjust imputation. A careful study of his system <lb/>
convinced us that we were indeed mistak-n, and that <lb/>
the world, to do him justice, should immediately, as it <lb/>
undoubtedly will hereafter, rank him foremost amongst <lb/>
its benefactors, He has solved the mystery of human <lb/>
diseases, and proved that all medical freatment, from <lb/>
the time of Hunter, hes been based upon false princi<lb break="no"/>ples. Jenner did not effect a greater revolution in the <lb/>
method of dealing with the small-pox, than Holloway <lb/>
has done in the ordinary medical routine of the present <lb/>
day. The human blood is not a mere fluid, coursing <lb/>
through the veins and arteries, and partaking of the <lb/>
mere qualities of other fluids. It is—startling as the <lb/>
statement may appear—alive. It is, in plain words, <lb/>
"the life of man." All physiological diseases, such as <lb/>
indigestion, deranged kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, <lb/>
*tomach, all impure secretions in the body, and a <lb/>
large majority of epidemic and endemic diseases <lb/>
have their origin, or at least their exciting cause <lb/>
in the impure state of the blood. Cleanse that and <lb/>
tep it cleansed, and no sickness can prostrate, or <lb/>
even assail the system. Tris splendid discovery has <lb/>
given a lustre to Holloway's name, transcending the <lb/>
renown of heroes and statesmen. We do not wonder <lb/>
at the great fame he has acquired in Europe, Asia, <lb/>
Africa, and Australia. We rejoice that he has visited <lb/>
Sur own country and opened an establishment in New <lb/>
York, which will be a very Temple of Health, to our <lb/>
own citizens. His Pills and Ointment are the most <lb/></p>

<p>The house met at 4 o'clock, <lb/></p> 

<p>On motion of hon J. O. FRASER, the Bill to provide <lb/>
for the erection of Bridges across the Colinet and Rocky <lb/>
Rivers, on the Placentia main road, was read a third <lb/>
time and passed;—and it was ordered that it be taken <lb/>
to the lawer house with a message announcing the con<lb break="no"/>currence of the Council thereto, <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. N. STABB, in reply to hon. J. S. CLIFT, laid on <lb/>
the table of the house the Report of the Physician ef <lb/>
the Luñatic Asylum for 1864;-\-Report of the Physician <lb/>
of the St. John's Hospital for 1864;-Report on the <lb/>
sewerage of the town for 1864; and statement of expen<lb break="no"/>diture under the Road Act for 1864. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon JAMEs S. CLIFT, thanked the organ of the go<lb break="no"/>vernment for his courtesy and promptitude in laying the <lb/>
documents asked for before the house. He (Mr. Clift) <lb/>
had moved for them because he understood they had <lb/>
already been furnished to the lower house, The institu­ <lb/></p> 

<p>tions to which they have reference are all regulated <lb/>
under Statute, and be believed it was an obligatory con<lb break="no"/>dition that each should furnish an annual report to the <lb/>
legislature, giving a detailed account of their respective <lb/>
management and expenditure. Now the legislature <lb/>
does not, he took it, mean the lower house alont, and <lb/>
he considered that this house was equally entiled to be <lb/>
provided with them and in manuscript form, and not <lb/>
printed copies as some of these were; because experi<lb break="no"/>ence has shown us that we can't always depend upon <lb/>
the accuracy of printed copies of Bills and documents <lb/>
that come before us. He thought that all returns and <lb/>
reports, &amp;c. laid before the Assembly should be inserted <lb/>
in its Journals for the use of hon members, so as not to <lb/>
oblige them to have reference to the records of the other <lb/>
branch when information is required by them respecting <lb/>
the various matters concerned. These we e the reasons <lb/>
that induced him to move for these document, <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon R. J. PINsent agreed with the remarks of hon <lb/>
Mr. Clift that it was necessary that copies of all such <lb/>
documents as those now laid before the house should be <lb/>
supplied to this as well as the other branch, and in <lb/>
manuscript form; for it was not a Parliamentary course <lb/>
to place before it printed papers when moved for. Now, <lb/>
one of those documents was marked on the outside as <lb/>
" ordered by the hon the House of Assembly to be <lb/>
printed," and to lay a paper betore this Jhamber in that <lb/>
condition was an improper course, altnough he perfectly <lb/>
acquitted the hon the organ of tue government of any <lb/>
intention of discourtesy to the Chamber. He thought <lb/>
the government should always have duplicates of all <lb/>
such returns prepared, that, when laid betore the lower <lb/>
branch, they might also be supplied to this house. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon N. STABB-These returns are all in manuscript, <lb/>
except one which is printed. It being a very long <lb/>
uocument, and as it would take a cousiderable time to <lb/>
copy it, he unuught he suould supply it with the others. <lb/>
There was no discourtesy at all intended by him (Alr. <lb/>
S.) If the hon gentle.uan is satisfied to wait until to<lb break="no"/>murrow the priuted papers can be copied into manu<lb break="no"/>Script. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon Mr. CLIFT was satisfied, He did not impute any <lb/>
discourtesy to the hon gentleman, nor did he desire te <lb/>
give annoyauce or unnecessary trouble to the goveru<lb break="no"/>duent. <lb break="no"/> </p> 

<p>The house then adjourned until Monday next. <lb/>
Monday, April 3, <lb/>
The house met at 4 o'clock. <lb/></p> 

<p>A deputation from the lower house brought up for <lb/>
concurrence of the Council the Revenue Bill —s Bill to <lb/>
provide for the retirement of the present Chief Justice <lb/>
of the Colony; and a Bill to provide for the erection of <lb/>
a light-house in the district of Burgso and LaPoile. <lb/>
Also, a message stating that the Assembly had agreed <lb/>
to the Council's amendments on the Volunteer organiza<lb break="no"/>tion Bill; and that it had also agreed to the Bill sent <lb/>
down from the Council to amend the Practice of the <lb/>
Courts, with some amendments, to which the con<lb break="no"/>uurrence of the Council was requested. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon the President intºmated to the house that it was <lb/>
the intentiou of his Excellency the Governor to close <lb/>
the Assembly on Frinay next. <lb/>
Hon N. STABB gave notice to move the suspension of <lb/>
the 35th rule of the house for the remainder of the <lb/>
Session. <lb/></p> 

<p>The house then adjourned until to-morrow. <lb/></p> -->

<p>TUESDAY, Feb. 28.</p>
        <p>(<hi rendition="simple:italic">Continued.</hi>)</p>

<p><persName ref="pers:WHIT6">Mr. WHITEWAY</persName> had heard the remarks of the hon. <lb/>
and learned member for Trinity, who had just spoken with <lb/>
regard to a decrease of our representation, which he seem<lb break="no"/>ed to fear would take place in the course of time, in the <lb/>
lower branch of the proposed confederate parliament. <lb/>
He (Mr. W.) must confess that he failed to comprehend <lb/>
the hon gentieman's long array of figures. The resolu<lb break="no"/>tion in the report of the Delegates referring to this <lb/>
subject appeared very simple. It was this—"No reduc<lb break="no"/>tion shall be made in the number of members returned <lb/>
by any section, unless its population shall have decreased <lb/>
relatively to the population of the whole Union, to the <lb/>
extent of five per centum." Now, to illustrate the case, <lb/>
assuming the whole population of the Union to be 4,000,<lb break="no"/>000, (which was near the present numbers) five per cent <lb/>
on this would be 200,000. Our present population <lb/>
must therefore decrease 280,000 before we could be de<lb break="no"/>prived of a member. Our population was now only <lb/>
130,000, therefore the Island must be depopulated be<lb break="no"/>fore we could lose a representive. But he (Mr. W.) <lb/>
would read what Mr. Galt said upon this subject, when <lb/>
addressing his constituents at Snerbrooke, C. E.; and <lb/>
surely his was an opinion on the construction of the <lb/>
resolutions which the hon member for Trinity would <lb/>
respect. He said, "The house would never have less <lb/>
than 194 members, but it would increase at a very slow <lb/>
rate, &amp;c." There was no ground for anticipating that <lb/>
our representation would ever be reduced below 8. If <lb/>
he (Mr. W.) concured in the resolution now before <lb/>
the house, he should probably at present offer no obser<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

vations upon the subject inasmuch as it proposed to <lb/>
postpone the consideration of the question of confeder<lb break="no"/>ation for a twelvemonth, until the next session <lb/>
of the Legislature, and as there appeared to be a major<lb break="no"/>ity of the house favourable to that view, he deemed it <lb/>
would be a wise policy to avail oneself of all the time <lb/>
thereby afforded, reserving his opinion until called <lb/>
for. But he differed from hon gentleman as to the <lb/>
advisability of adopting this resolution, for reasons which <lb/>
he would state presently, After the very ab e argumentative <lb/>
and eloquent speeches which he had heard within the <lb/>
last two or three days, from the hon the Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral and the hon member for Placentia and St. Mary's, <lb/>
Mr. A. Shea, it would seem at first almost impossible for <lb/>
any one entertaining a favourable opinion of the proposed <lb/>
scheme for confederation, to discover any topic connected <lb/>
with the subject which had not been fully treated by <lb/>
these gentlemen. They had reviewed and discussed it <lb/>
by the light of history, political philoso<lb break="no"/>phy, and the laws which govern <choice><sic>mank nd</sic><corr>marked</corr></choice> in their rela<lb break="no"/>tions to each other individually, collectively and as na<lb break="no"/>tions. Reference had been made to the solid advantages <lb/>
inveriably derived from the union of petty states on fair <lb/>
and equitable terms under one firm and enlightened <lb/>
government. We had heard every union spoken of, <lb/>
from the days of the Saxon Heptarchy down to the <lb/>
union of the two Canadas. They had treated it in its <lb/>
moral, social, physicial financial and commercial aspects. <lb/>
But still, if every hon gentleman in the House had spok<lb break="no"/>en upon the subject, it was one of such vast importatice <lb/>
and so varied in its ramifications, that he (Mr. W.) ven<lb break="no"/>tured to say there would remain some point untouched. <lb/>
He (Mr. W.) had heard the hon member for St. John's <lb/>
West (Mr. Renouf) compare our position under the pro<lb break="no"/>proposed union to that of Poland and Hungary under <lb/>
Russia and Austria. Such a comparison needed no com<lb break="no"/>ment, and he could not believe the hon gentleman was <lb/>
sincere in comparing the union of free states on equal <lb/>
terms, with equitable representation, with that which <lb/>
was no union at all, but a compulsory binding of the <lb/>
oppressed to the despot. He (Mr. W.) gave the hon <lb/>
gentleman credit for sincerity in the determined <lb/>
opposition he had shewn, and for the zeal and industry <lb/>
which he had displayed; but in doing so he thought his <lb/>
remarks, as applied to the hon Attorney General and <lb/>
Mr. Shea, that "it must be a very bad cause which re<lb break="no"/>quired to be advocated by such long epeeches," were <lb/>
peculiarly applicable to the honorable gentleman himself <lb/>
or he had occupied the time of the House for a longer pe<lb break="no"/>riod than either of them. He (Mr. W.) believed that <lb/>
considerable advantage to this colony would result from <lb/>
the free intercommunication which would be brought <lb/>
about between the several Provinces now separated, and <lb/>
to a certain extent antagonistic. Free intercourse with <lb/>
our neighbours would tend to elevate our minds from <lb/>
those narrow and selfish views which invariably prevail <lb/>
with men living in an isolated condition. If it were <lb/>
calculated to do no more than to raise our thoughts <lb/>
above and draw them away from our present sectarian <lb/>
differences, and give us something to think about outside <lb/>
of ourselves and our petty disputes, it would be a benefit, <lb/>
and promote social happiness. If we looked around <lb/>
among those who had expressed opinions upon the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, we shoula find but very few who were opposed to con<lb break="no"/>federation in the abstract; the difficulty seemed to be <lb/>
altogether on matters of detail; and parties inside and <lb/>
outside this house appeared dissatisfied with the Quebec <lb/>
resolutions as the basis. A little time and reflection <lb/>
would probably have the effect of doing away with many <lb/>
of these objections: a reaction, to a certain extent, alrea<lb break="no"/>dy had taken place in the public mind. When the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions were placed on the table some gentlemen had <lb/>
rushed fom the House, it may be actuated by political <lb/>
motives, and endeavoured to alarm the people and raise <lb/>
a popular clamour, saying that the government were <lb/>
about to force the adoption of these resolutions upon the <lb/>
House at once, that they were going to sell the country to <lb/>
Canada, to forsake the British flag for a Canadian, &amp;c., &amp;c. <lb/>
Great excitement prevailed for a day or two, and a pub<lb break="no"/>lic meeting was called, at which, however, (the agitation <lb/>
having been somewhat calmed) not a single objec<lb break="no"/>tion was expressed as to the principle of Conderacy <lb/>
and it resulted in a petition in which time was asked <lb/>
for consideration of the subject, it being new and of such <lb/>
great importance to our future. This was a reasonable <lb/>
request. Although he (Mr. W.) fully concurred in the <lb/>
principle of confederation; he was, like many others, <lb/>
not prepared to accept the report in its totality. He <lb/>
believed it was laid duwn as a consequence necessarily <lb/>
involved in the adoption of this report, that a uniform <lb/>
tariff would follow. If such was the case, he felt hostile <lb/>
to such a measure, for when we compared the condition <lb/>
of the Canadian peasants who consumed but few dutiable <lb/>
articles, with that of the fisherman of <choice><sic>New<lb break="no"/>found</sic><corr>Newfoundland</corr></choice>, who consumed little else but duitable <lb/>
articles, a uniform tariff would at first operate unfairly <lb/>
upon our people. But whilst he entertained these views now <lb/>
he was free to confess that in the course of time, when <lb/>
Canadian manufactures found their way into our markets, <lb/>
and we had our local manufactures this objection would <lb/>
be overcome. Some parties had said that Canada could <lb/>
not manufacture enough for herself, and that it was <lb/>
absurd to suppose she could supply us. This certainly <lb/>
contrasted with the outcry raised in Nova Scotia by the <lb/>
anti confederates, where they seemed to be afraid of <lb/>
being flooded by Canadian manufactured goods. We <lb/>
had, however, heard undeniable proof from the hon <lb/>
member for Carbonear, Mr. Rorke, of what Canada can <lb/>
do as regards leatherware. But why should not New<lb break="no"/>foundland become a manufacturing country? We had <lb/>
all the facilities for it. We had good water power and <lb/>
cheap labour. Why should all our hides and seal skins <lb/>
be exported? Although fer soune time he (Mr. W) <lb/>
had been sceptical as to the bright prospects watch some <lb/>
entertained respecting the number of sneep which might <lb/>
be kept on the island, still atter the retuns which had <lb/> 
recently been obtained, it must be evident that by the <lb/>
destruction of the dogs, the breeding of sheep could be <lb/>
raised to an important interest. Supposing, for instance, <lb/>
a million of sheep were kept, and this was a small esti<lb break="no"/>mate, we might calculate on between three and four <lb/>
millions pounds of wool. Why then might not woollen <lb/>
factories be put in operation here to great advantage? <lb/>
And why not cotton factories. We could import, the <lb/>
raw material as cheaply as our neighbours. All we <lb/>
wanted was a market, and this confederation would give <lb/>
us. There were other portions of the report of the <lb/>
delegates which he (Mr. W.) could not assent to. First <lb/>
—it was resolved in the 66th sec. that Newfoundland <lb/>
should cede all her Crown lands, mines and minerals to <lb/>
the General Government, aud receive in lieu therefore an <lb/>
annual allowance of $10,000 whilst Canada, New <lb/>
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and P. E. Island retained theirs <lb/>
for the purpose of uneir local governments. Wny was <lb/>
this distinction made? We were told that in the other <lb/>
provinces the Crown lands, mines and minerals were <lb/>
sources of revenue, which they could not give up, and <lb/>
that in each of these provinces there existed systems of <lb/>
direct taxation and municipal regulations, that the 80 <lb/>
cents per head mentioned in sec. 64, watch runs thus: <lb/> 
        </p>
        
        <cb/>
        
        
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"64-In consideration of the transfer to the <choice><sic>Genera</sic><corr>General</corr></choice> <lb/>
Parliament of the powers of Taxation, an annual grant <lb/>
in aid of each Province, shall be made equal to 80 cents <lb/>
per head of the population, as established by the Census <lb/>
of 1861, the population of Newfoundland being estimated <lb/>
at 130,000. Such aid thall he in full settlement of all <lb/>
further demands upon the General Government for local <lb/>
purposes, and shall be paid half yearly in advance to each <lb/>

</quote>
        
        
        
<p>was not enough for their local expenditure unless these <lb/>
provinces were allowed to retain these sources of revenue. <lb/>
Now we had no direct taxation, and at present were <lb/>
deriving nothing from our mines; but all our expenses <lb/>
were defrayed out of the customs' revenue, which we <lb/>
were to give up to the General Government. 80 cents <lb/>
per head for our population would therefore supply an <lb/>
amount insufficient, by $150,010, for the wants for our <lb/>
local, Government and it was proposed to raise this <lb/>
sum by transferring our Crown Lands, &amp;c, to the Con<lb break="no"/>federate Government. It appeared to him (Mr. W.) <lb/>
to involve the conclusion that we must submit to be <lb/>
taxed to the extent of $150,000, in order that we might <lb/>
enter the Confederacy, on an equal footing with the <lb/>
other Colonies, or, in other words, because we were taxed <lb/>
relatively $150,000 less than the other Colonies, we <lb/>
must give up our Crown Lands and mines; and hence<lb break="no"/>forth we should be ever debarred from looking to them <lb/>
as a source of revenue, no matter what our requirements <lb/>
might be. This was manifestly unjust to Newfoundland <lb/>
which was made to suffer because not so heavily taxed <lb/>
as the sister Provinces at the time of Union. It had <lb/>
been said that our Crown Lands, mines and minerals <lb/>
were worth nothing. If that was the case those gentle<lb break="no"/>men were correct, who said we gave nothing, and that <lb/>
the $150,000, was a gilt. But he (Mr. W.) differed <lb/>
from these hon gentlemen. He believed them to be of <lb/>
great value, and looked forward to the time when the <lb/>
mines of this Ireland would be one of its riches resources. <lb/>
It must be remembered that very lately attention had <lb/>
not been directed generally to the subject. It was only <lb/>
last year that the first money was voted hy this House <lb/>
for a geological survey; and the report of Mr. Murray <lb/>
gave us reason to believe we had much mineral wealth. <lb/>
That very enterprising gentleman whom we all so highly <lb/>
esteemed, Mr. Bennett, was the only one, until within <lb/>
the last half dozen years who had done anything to<lb break="no"/>wards developing this resource; and he (Mr. W.) be<lb break="no"/>lieved that Mr. Bennett, now had fair prospects for an <lb/>
ample return. Again, those parts of the report which <lb/>
propose to define the powers of the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and those of the Local Governments, were not <lb/>
sufficiently clear and explicit. There seemed to be <lb/>
ample room for cailving upon this point, and for a <lb/>
conflict of opinion upon that which should be as clear an <lb/>
the light. He (Mr. W.) observed that the London <lb/>
Times had an article upon this subject, which we would <lb/>
take the liberty of reading. <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

<p>"But the most important clause in the whole Reso<lb break="no"/>lutions, and, unfortunately, by no means the easiest to <lb/>
understand, is the one which defines the powers of the <lb/>
Central Federative Legislature. We have expressed <lb/>
the opinion, which we believe is generally held in the <lb/>
American Colonies, that while certain subjects should <lb/>
be delegated to the Local Legislatures, the Central <lb/>
Legislature should have full power of making laws on <lb/>
every thing relating to the Federation, in strict anology <lb/>
to the powers possessed by the Imperial Parliament; or <lb/>
that if there be any exception to those powers, it should <lb/>
be only with regard to those subjects which are es<lb break="no"/>pecially delegated to the Local Legislatures. We are <lb/>
sorry to say that neither of these plans has been adop<lb break="no"/>ted. By Resolution 29, 'the General Parliament shall <lb/>
have power to make laws for the peace, welfare, and <lb/>
good government of the Federated Provinces (saving the <lb/>
sovereignty of England) and especial laws respecting the <lb/>
following subjects.' Then follow thirty-six heads of <lb/>
legislation, and a thirty-seventh, which is as follows:–<lb break="yes"/>'And generally respecting all matters of a general <lb/>
character, not specially and exclusively reserved for the <lb/>
Local Government, and Legislatures." We cannot find <lb/>
that the Local Legislatures have any exclusive power of <lb/>
legislation given them. They have power by the 43rd <lb/>
Resolution to make laws respecting seventeen subjects, <lb/>
the eighteen being—'And generally all matters of a <lb/>
private or local nature not assigned to the General <lb/>
Parliament.' It is exceedingly difficult to construe these <lb/>
provisions. First, general powers of legislation are <lb/>
given in the widest terms to the General Parliament; <lb/>
then a power is given especially to make laws on thirty-<lb break="yes"/>
    seven subjects, one of those being all matters of a general <lb/>
character not exclusively reserved to the Local Legisla<lb break="no"/>tures. Nothing is exclusively reserved to the Local <lb/>
Legislatures, and it would seem, therefore, that the effect <lb/>
of this clause is to cut the power of central legislation <lb/>
down to matters of a general character—a most vague <lb/>
and unsatisfactory definition, and one sure, if it be <lb/>
retained, to produce conflict and confusion. In the <lb/>
aaze way, what are matters of a private and local nature <lb/>
not assigned to the General Parliament? We have <lb/>
failed to discover any matters of a private and local <lb/>
nature which are so assigned, and therefore the power <lb/>
will be limited by the words 'private' and 'local;' so <lb/>
that the effect of these clauses will be that, beyond the <lb/>
subjects attributed to each, the Central Legislature will <lb/>
have jurisdiction over general matters, whatever they <lb/>
are, and the Local Legislature over local matters, what<lb break="no"/>ever they are; while it is in the highest degree doubt<lb break="no"/>ful what the Courts would consider general and what <lb/>
local, and whether the Central Legislature, has any <lb/>
concurrent jurisdiction over private and local matters <lb/>
or no. <lb/></p> 

<p>"The inaccuracies are probably the result of a suc<lb break="no"/>cession of compromises, and we can do ng better ser<lb break="no"/>vice to the Federative movement than by thus early <lb/> 
pointing them out. The Resolutions ask for the co<lb break="no"/>operation of the Local and Imperial Parliaments for <lb/>
the purpose of giving them effect, and we have no <lb/>
doubt that, before they assume, the form of law, they <lb/> 
will have undergone consideration and scrutiny fully <lb/>
commensurate to their importance. Of the wisdom of <lb/>
the principle involved, we have no doubt, and we have <lb/>
much pleasure in, giving our tribute to the ability with <lb/>
which, on the whole, that principle has been worked <lb/>
out, in spite of difficulties and oostructions, of which <lb/>
our own negotiations for the union of Scotland and <lb/>
Ireland can furnish us only with a very faint idea." <lb/></p>

believed, at less than a week's notics. The subject of <lb/>
Confederation was one which had not heretofore en<lb break="no"/>gaged much of the attention of the public men of this <lb/>
country, whilst it had been before the Legislatures of <lb/>
the adjoining provinces for years. These gentlemen, <lb/>
therefore, went under great disadvantages, but the <lb/>
ability which they had displayed at the conference re<lb break="no"/>flected credit upon themselves and our Government, <lb/>
in their judicious selection. The Solicitor General had <lb/>
complained that our fisheries were to be under the <lb/>
control of the General Government. He (Mr. W.) <lb/>
considered it the best thing that could happen, Then <lb/>
we might hope for some legislation which would result <lb/>
in their encouragement and protection. We had at<lb break="no"/>tempted legislation as regards our cod-fishery, and had <lb/>
done nothing. We had enacted laws respecting our <lb/>
salmon and herring fisheries, which were a dead letter <lb/>
upon our statute book, because we had no means to <lb/>
provide for sufficient superintendency and police regu<lb break="no"/>lations to carry these laws into execution; and the re<lb break="no"/>sult  is that our salmon fishery is all but destroyed, and <lb/>
our other fisheries are declining. How unfavourably <lb/>
did our action regarding our fisheries contrast with the <lb/>
policy adapted by Canada, notwithstanding that in <lb/>
Canada they were only a minor staple ef industry, <lb/>
whilst in this country our fisheries were all we had at <lb/>
present to rely upon. A reference to the annual report <lb/>
for 1863 of the superintendents of the Canadian fish<lb break="no"/>eries will show their watchful anxiety over this branch <lb/>
of industry. The report is in a pamphlet of some 76 <lb/>
pages, closely printed, containing much that is of deep <lb/>
interest to ourselves. Here we have from the pen of <lb/>
one of these Superintendent's a scientific view—the <lb/>
full description of every fish found in Canadian waters, <lb/>
seas and rivers; accurate statistical information as to <lb/>
the general products, and as to each particular branch; <lb/>
vessels, boats and men, where and how engaged, and <lb/>
in fact most elaborate details of ail that is interesting <lb/>
concerning the subject. We find that the whole pro<lb break="no"/>duce of the Canadian fisheries in the Gulf and Lower <lb/>
St. Lawrence in 1863, including seal and whale oil, <lb/>
was $329,160, and that the amount expended in super<lb break="no"/>intending, encouragement and protection,was $30,658 <lb/>
or over £6000 sterling, the amount paid by the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Government in bounties, for one year, is over <lb/>
$9000. They have made Gaspe a free port, solely with <lb/>
a view to the encouragement of their fisheries; in fact, <lb/>
so fully alive do they seem tº be to the advantages <lb/>
which must flow from a watchful care over this inter<lb break="no"/>est that nothing appeals left undone in order to devel<lb break="no"/>ope it. He (Mr W.) would take the liberty of reading <lb/>
a paragraph from this <choice><sic>reyort</sic><corr>report</corr></choice> of Pierre Fortin, Esq., <lb/>
showing that although some in this country are under <lb/>
the iupression that Canada can supply nothing for <lb/>
our fisneries, the French and others are of a different <lb/>
opinion.</p>
        
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The port of Gaspé has had this year the visit of <lb/>
three foreign men-of-war. First the French steam <lb/>

board Mr. le Baron Gauldrèe Boilleau, French Consul, <lb/>
who was proceeding to study on the spot the resources <lb/>
of the country bordering the waters of the Gulf of St. <lb/>
Lawrence, with the intention of creating, or rather <lb/>
developing the trade with the French possessions of <lb/>
Newfoundland; and it is by making better known to <lb/>
the French merchants and outfitters the different kinds <lb/>
of produce supplied by Canada and the other British <lb/>
provinces, in order to supply the numerous wants of <lb/>
their immense fisheries, and establishing the articles <lb/>
the can give in exchange, that this desirable end can <lb/>
be attained in a safer manner. There is no doubt but <lb/>
that this trip of Mr. Boilleau, whose intelligence and <lb/>
capacity have been so well appreciated in Canada, will <lb/>
produce in a future period advantageous results to the <lb/>
trade of our country, as well as to that of France. <lb/></p>

            "The United States, armed schooner <hi rendition="simple:italic">George Mag<lb break="no"/>num</hi>, Commander Collins, (carrying 7 guns and a <lb/>
crew of 70 men), which, according to rumour, had <lb/>
cruised during a while in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, <lb/>
expecting to meet cruisers from the Confederate States, <lb/>
also came in the basin of Gaspe, but remained only a <lb/>
few days. This vessel was of nearly the same tonnage <lb/>

di Bruno, with a crew of 360 men, stayed there from <lb/>
the middle of August till the end of September. The <lb/>
populaticn welcomed this vessel with pleasure, for it <lb/>
was seen that her presence was a proof that the princi<lb break="no"/>pal branch of trade of this part of Canada, that of cod<lb break="no"/>fish, had, since a few years, by its extensive develop<lb break="no"/>ment, dawn the attention of foreign countries, and <lb/>
especially Italy, where so great a quantity of our dried <lb/>
fish is consumed. <lb/></p>

"Already an Italian consulate had been established <lb/>

to come and purchase at our free port of Gaspe a part <lb/>
of the codfish they require, and bring us in exchange <lb/>
the products of their country, such as olive oil, dried <lb/>
and preserved fruits, and especially hemp, which is <lb/>
cultivated on a large scale in the centre of Italy, and <lb/>

the agency of the Italian Consul, provisions, and a <lb/>
good deal of other stores, for a six months' cruise, <lb/>
amounting to $12,000; the good quality and cheap<lb break="no"/>ness of which was well appreciated by the commissa<lb break="no"/>riat on board. <lb/>
"The urbanity and politeness of the commander <lb/>

The report concludes as follows:–<lb/></p>
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p> "I will conclude by stating that our fisheries are, <lb/>
compared to what they formerly were, in a state of <lb/>
properity, thanks to the liberal encouragement and <lb/>
effectual protection of the Government, and I hope <lb/>
that this encouragement, either in the snape of boun<lb break="no"/>ties, or free ports, will not fail, so that the fisheries <lb/>
may soon acquire a development which will cause <lb/>
them to be considered all over the country as one of <lb/>
the largest and most productive industries of Canada." <lb/></p>

The Canadians are fostering, in every way possible, <lb/>
their fisheries, whilst we are asleep and allowing our <lb/>
<choice><sic>so e dependence</sic><corr>independence</corr></choice> to be destroyed without an effort to <lb/>
sustain it. Compare this able report with the meagre <lb/>
documents which emanate from our friend who goes to <lb/>
the Labrador in <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> every summer; and <lb/>
the sum, apended by the Canadians, with the paltry <lb/>
£500 which is all we afford to lay cut in protecting <lb/>
        
        <cb/>

this all important interest. If then, the Canadians <lb/>
now are so zealous in promoting their fisheries, was <lb/>
there not ample reason to believe that the same policy <lb/>
would dictate the action of the Confederate Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, particularly when we consider how deeply con<lb break="no"/>cerned in the same direction are the provinces of New <lb/>
Brunswick and Nova Scotia with their extensive fish<lb break="no"/>eries. But out of the Confederacy, what would be our <lb/>
condition in relation to foreign countries where existed <lb/>
our principal fish markets? Is it not likely that every <lb/>
effort would be made to benefit so important an inter<lb break="no"/>est in the adjoining provinces, when they would bring <lb/>
the powerful influence of a great Confederation, backed <lb/>
by Great Britain, to bear, in order to procure advan<lb break="no"/>tages; and is it at all probable that we should be <lb/>
admitted to share in those privileges whilst we <lb/>
remained separate and opposed to them? We were <lb/>
evidently impotent of ourselves, as to advancing this <lb/>
interest; and the sooner we had assistance, the sooner <lb/>
we should progress. It had been stated that this <lb/>
project of Confederation had its origin in a fear, on <lb/>
the part of Canada, of invasion from the United States. <lb/>
Whether this was true or not, it mattered little what <lb/>
was the immediate cause of the scheme. The time, <lb/>
he (Mr. W.) believed, had arrived, when these Colo<lb break="no"/>nies were bound to provide towards their defence. <lb/>
Nay more, there was a resolution on the Journals of <lb/>
the House, by which the country was pledged to do <lb/>
so. But supposiog Canada was attacked, should we <lb/>
not be bound at the call of Great Britain, to go to her <lb/>
assistance, whether united under Confederacy or not? <lb/>
Even, for our own safety, should we not be obliged <lb/>
to do so? If Canada became a prey to the United <lb/>
States, we may rest assured that we should soon <lb/>
follow; and certainly, should we now refuse to adopt <lb/>
a measure highly approved by the British Government, <lb/>
and prefer remaining in our selfish isolation, we could <lb/>
hardly expect that Great Britain would make such <lb/>
exertions to preserve our Island, as some gentlemen <lb/>
had said, "as a bright jewel in the Imperial Crown." <lb/>
We, no doubt thought a great deal of ourselves; but <lb/>
in reality, we were very small. Why, last year Great <lb/>
Britain had sent nearly double our population as <lb/>
emigrants to other countrys. In case of war between <lb/>
Great Britain and the United States now; from <lb/>
whence would we obtain our supplies of provisions? <lb/>
Some would say—from Europe, as we did in days <lb/>
gone by. But what would we have to pay for them? <lb/>
By confederacy we were building up within ourselves <lb/>
a grand emporium, from whence to supply our re<lb break="no"/>quirements, regardless of the tumults which might <lb/>
convulse other nations. He [Mr W.] would take the <lb/>
liberty of reading articles from the Colonial Presbyte<lb break="no"/>rian and St. John N. B. Courier, interesting upon <lb/>
this subject. The former says—"In a political point <lb/>
of view, every one will admit that, other things being <lb/>
equal, union, unless physical and geographical con<lb break="no"/>sidenatious hinder, would be desirable. Now it can<lb break="no"/>not be denied, and no candid reasoner will deny, that <lb/>
in Federation we should have to contend with serious <lb/>
physical difficulties, but it might give the ability to <lb/>
help to 'annihilate time and space,' and muke five <lb/>
Federated provinces 'happy.' Defence must gain <lb/>
by centralizition; it must gain by British cooperation <lb/>
with colonial spirit and manliness, and, if need, be, <lb/>
sacrifice.—We have a country which we should pre<lb break="no"/>serve from anarchy within, or aggression without; we <lb/>
have a noble free-hold domain, in which no hereditary <lb/>
burdens need crush the efforts, blight the hopes, or <lb/>
quench the aspirations of future freemen. This inhe<lb break="no"/>ritance is worth the price of insurance, even if that <lb/>
should be high. The millennium has clearly not yet <lb/>
arrived, so we must insure, be the cost what it may. <lb/>
We do not know that any power will ever attack us; <lb/>
we are not aesolutelp certain that we could, even with <lb/>
British aid, repel all attacks without tearful loss and <lb/>
damage to our cities and country, but it surely will <lb/>
not be found easy to smite down, and keep down <lb/>
millions of patriotic men, resolved to repel invasion, <lb/>
in a country walled with gunboats and ships of war, <lb/>
with an old, rich and powerful nation at their back, <lb/>
fighting in self-defence, for national existence. On <lb/>
our own account we should at least make the attempt, <lb/>
on account of old England we should do so.—Those <lb/>
who tell us that she is ready to part with her colonial <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">prestige</hi> may represent a certain portion of English <lb/>
sentiment; but there is no reason to think they re<lb break="no"/>present the views of the British Government. English <lb/>
statesmen are too wise not to recognise the fact that <lb/>
British America, shielded in its youth, might, as its <lb/>
millions increase to tens and twenties, and upwards, <lb/>
to be able to rally to the defence of the old flag, should <lb/>
the despots of Europe ever combine to trample it in <lb/>
the dust. Here the navies, the armies of England <lb/>
might find men and material resources, but if no spirit <lb/>
of self-sacrifice can now be evolved, we would be of <lb/>
little value to England, and do little credit to our<lb break="no"/>selves." <lb/></p>

and there can be little question as to which of the two <lb/>

adopt. This is an important point, but it is one which <lb/>
the careful student of past history and the thoughtful <lb/>
observer of present realities will find little difficulty <lb/>
in deciding. A Federal Union such as is in operation <lb/>
in the States, where the powers oi the Central and the <lb/>
State Governments clash, and where there is no Ex<lb break="no"/>cutive responsibility, would not work harmoniously; <lb/>
nor would a Legislative Union operate satisfactorily <lb/>
over a wide extent of territory and among people <lb/>
whose interests are so diversified as those of the <lb/>
British Provinces. What we require is a Union that <lb/>
will give to a Central Government the control in mat<lb break="no"/>ters of general interest; and leave to the Local Legis<lb break="no"/>latures the power of regulating matters of a purely <lb/>
local character; the former body to take cognizance <lb/>

<cb/>

of all new matters for which special provision has not <lb/>
been made. This appears to be the kind of Union <lb/>
which is developed in the Confederation scheme, and <lb/>
it is the one most likely to meet the approval of the <lb/>
whole people. There may be some defects in the <lb/>
details; there may be sone inequalities which will re<lb break="no"/>quire rectifying; but shall we neglect the scheme on <lb/>
that account? As yet the opponents of the sheme <lb/>

<p>He (Mr W.) was surprised at the statement of the <lb/>
hon member for Ferryland, Mr Glen, that our ex<lb break="no"/>penditure for the last 8 or 10 years averaged £13,000. <lb/>
He (Mr. W.) believed that statement to be incor<lb break="no"/>rect. The hon member had applied the present Cana<lb break="no"/>dian tariff to Newfoundland, and had told us that, <lb/>
under it, our revenue would be £145, whilst we <lb/>
should only receive from the Confederate Government <lb/>
£112,000. It was not fair to apply the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian tariff. He may just as well apply the tariff of <lb/>
New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, and tell us what <lb/>
our revenue under these would be. The Confeder<lb break="no"/>ate tariff would be altogether a new one, adopted by <lb/>
the Confederate Parliament, having due regard to <lb/>
each part of the Union; and when we saw that Canada, <lb/>
New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia produced within <lb/>
one-fourth as much fish as we did, and the desire <lb/>
evinced by Canada to promote her fisheries at present, <lb/>
we might fairly augur well for the protection of our <lb/>
fishery interest. Would not the prosperity of New<lb break="no"/>foundland be the prosperity of Canada also. Could it <lb/>
be supposed for one moment that a policy would be <lb/>
would be adopted <choice><sic>inimical</sic><corr>mimical</corr></choice> to the interest of any one <lb/>
province? Of what advantage would it be to the <lb/>
whole, to work an injury to any of its parts? Is not <lb/>
the prosperity of Burged and LaPoile, although far <lb/>
away from St. John's,the prosperity of Newtoundland? <lb/>
It has been said that Newfoundland is too remote <lb/>
from the seat of Government to profit in any equal <lb/>
degree with the other Provinces; and hon gentlemen <lb/>
who are opposed to Newfoundland entering the union, <lb/>
say it would be of advantage for the other Provinces <lb/>
to do so, because they are on the main, but we are <lb/>
isolated. He (Mr. W.) believed that we were not <lb/>
nearly so much isolated from QUebec as the district <lb/>
of Twillingate and Fogo is from St. John's. With <lb/>
Quebec we now have means of communication, and <lb/>
under confederation facilities would be afforded by a <lb/>
regular line of steamers in summer, and by steamers <lb/>
and railroads in winter. But as regards Twillingate <lb/>
and Fogo, during the winter months we could not <lb/>
even convey a letter thither; and although he (Mr. <lb/>
W.) had been for the last four sessions urging upon <lb/>
the government the establishment of a system of <lb/>
couriers for the conveyance of mails through the <lb/>
country to these <choice><sic>extern</sic><corr>external</corr></choice> districts, he had always been <lb/>
met by the cry of poverty and of inability from want <lb/>
of funds to carry out his views. A change of some <lb/>
whether it was confederation or something else, was <lb/>
devously to be wished for. It had been also stated <lb/>
that Canada wanted our revenue to enrich her impov<lb break="no"/>arished exchequer. Nothing could be more ridiculous. <lb/>
Canada with her $60,000,000 of debt, was better off <lb/>
than we are with our small debt. There they have <lb/>
large public inprovements to shew for it; while ours <lb/>
has been incurred in the relief of poverty, without a <lb/>
single vestige of improvement remaining to the coun<lb break="no"/>try. Canada, in return for her debt, has 2000 miles <lb/>
of railway in operation, which have cost $100,000,000 <lb/>
—one bridge alone has cost £12,000,000; she has <lb/>
4500 miles of telegraph wire, over which three quar<lb break="no"/>ters of a million of messages are annually sent; she <lb/>
has 250 miles of canal, which cost $16,000,000, and <lb/>
through which 3,000,000 tons of freight passed last <lb/>
year; she has 15,000 miles of mail routes, 2000 post <lb/>
offices, the income of which exceeds the expenditure. <lb/>
This is what Canada has to show for her debt. What <lb/>
have we to show for ours? No one who has ever <lb/>
visited Canada but has been astonished at her in<lb break="no"/>mense resources, and the opportunity which is every<lb break="no"/>where presented for the investment of money, Why <lb/>
is it that her debantures are at a discount? Simply <lb/>
because no one is desirous of investing money at 6 or <lb/>
7 per cent. when there are opportunities in all direc<lb break="no"/>tions for investing it at from 14 to 15, upon excellent <lb/>
security. Here the reverse was the case. We had no <lb/>
means of investing our money in any direction, and <lb/>
were glad of the opportunity of paying a premium of <lb/>
4 to 5 per cent. for the privilege of investing it in 5 <lb/>
per cent. debentures. A party with a few hundred <lb/>
pounds here was afraid to lend on mortgage. Our <lb/>
landed property had become so frightfully depreci<lb break="no"/>ated, and there was no sign of improvement. Our <lb/>
public debt had increased, since 1855, from £111,<lb break="no"/>000 to £213,000, and what public works had we to <lb/>
shew? One vast pile of pauperism. We had spent <lb/>
our reveaue in relieving the distressed, and now pov<lb break="no"/>erty had become an institution in the country; and <lb/>
this was all we had to shew for our debt. Could the <lb/>
hon. the Solicitor General, or other gentlemen <lb/>
who opposed the principle of confederation, point <lb/>
out a remedy for our difficulties? Each party had <lb/>
been in power during the last nine years, and he has <lb/>
been associated with both; yet he had failed to <lb/>
introduce any measure calculated to remedy the <lb/>
evils which exist. Our middle class and our trades<lb break="no"/>people are fast disappearing. He says we want good <lb/>
fisheries and factories; but can we expect large fac<lb break="no"/>tories to be establishment when there is only a limit<lb break="no"/>ed market? The difficulties which manufacturers have <lb/>
to coutend with, was aptly illustrated in the case of <lb/>
Mr. Wall's bakery at River-head. Such was the pre<lb break="no"/>judice in favour of Hamburg bread, together with <lb/>
the limited market in which he could operate, that it <lb/>
took him years before he could convince the people <lb/>
that he could give them as good an article, at a cheap<lb break="no"/>er rate, than they could import. None but a man <lb/>
of Mr. Wall's indomitable perseverance would have <lb/>
overcome these obstacles. Now we have several baker<lb break="no"/>ies established, and most of the bread used is made in <lb/>
the country. Had no benefit been derived therefrom? <lb/>
Had Mr. Wall at first a more extended sphere for ac<lb break="no"/>tion, his success would have been more rapid, or com<lb break="no"/>petition would have been produced, resulting to the <lb/>
public good. Complaints were frequently heard that <lb/>
capital realized in this country was withdrawn from <lb/>
it, and expended elsewhere; and that as soon as a <lb/>
man had made a little money he always left us. Well, <lb/>
every man had a right to spend his money where he <lb/>
pleased; but if we could afford inducement for men <lb/>
of means to continue among us, by offering them op<lb break="no"/>portunities for political advancement as our representa<lb break="no"/>atives in the Confederate Parliament, is it not proba<lb break="no"/>ble that, in course of time, it would have the effect of <lb/>
retaining capitalists in the country? They would pre<lb break="no"/>fer such positions to retirement and private life on <lb/>
the banks of the Clyed in England. No doubt this <lb/>
scheme would be opposed by those who were desirous <lb/>
of perpetuating our present Local Legislature, in all <lb/>
<corr><sic>ts</sic><corr>this</corr></corr> little grandeur, for the sake of the simall crumbs <lb/>
that might be picked up within the circle of its patro<lb break="no"/>nage; for under Confederation the business of ex<lb break="no"/>pending the £79,000 we should get from the General <lb/>
Government, which was, after all, more than our <lb/>
present revenue, would be done by a much smaller <lb/>
body than our present very expensive Legislature; <lb/>
but it would be at less cost, and consequently there <lb/>
would be more money for public improvements. It <lb/>
should be remembered that this subject did not come <lb/>
before us without authority. It had been approved of <lb/>
by the first satesmen in the worid, and strongly re<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

commended; among whom he might name Lord <lb/>
Durham who was most eminently qualified to give an <lb/>
an opinion. He advised Union of the Provices, and <lb/>
he (Mr. W.) might refer back as far as 1814, when <lb/>
the father of Her Majesty, the Duke of Kent, had, in <lb/>
a letter to Mr. Sewell, then Chief Justice of Lower <lb/>
    Canada, highly approved of a similar proposition.— <lb/>
Again, the Duke of Newcastle urged the accomplish<lb break="no"/>ment of this grand idea. We also saw the leading <lb/>
Colonial politicians in each province, burying their <lb/>
party differences, and anxious to promote the general <lb/>
good, by carying the union into effect. We saw it <lb/>
among ourselves. Our leading politicians, men gen<lb break="no"/>erally opposed in their politicial views, and represent<lb break="no"/>ing various interests in the country, were agreed upon <lb/>
this subject, and he (Mr. W.) thought that the opin<lb break="no"/>ion of men of this stamp, both out of the country and <lb/>
in it, would have a little more weight than those who <lb/>
raised the cry that the country was going to be sold <lb/>
to Canada. The project for confederation received <lb/>
his firm support; but not upon the terms of the Re<lb break="no"/>port of the Delegates. He (Mr. W.) thought better <lb/>
terms might be obtained, and he was opposed to a <lb/>
postponement of the consideration of the Report until <lb/>
next year. He thought we should now be engaged <lb/>
in discussing the details and the conditions upon <lb/>
which we were prepared to enter the union,and having <lb/>
come to an understanding upon these points, we <lb/>
should adopt resolutions expressing our views, <lb/>
and containing our reasons; and the Government <lb/>
should be authorised to take such steps as may be <lb/>
expedient for protection our interests, in the shape <lb/>
of a delegation to the Imperial Parliament or other<lb break="no"/>wise, as occasiou required. Canada had already adopt<lb break="no"/>ed the report; New Brunswick would in all probabili<lb break="no"/>ty do the same, and although Nova Scotta seemed to <lb/>
be hesitating, there was every reason to believe that <lb/>
it would be carried in the Legislature of that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince by a large majority. What, then, would be <lb/>
our position, should they go to the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment for an act to perfect the union during the present <lb/>
session, after this house had been dissolved? Our in<lb break="no"/>terests would be neglected, and he (Mr. W.) thought <lb/>
we should be recreaut to the interests of our contitu<lb break="no"/>ents, if we did not arm our Government with power to <lb/>
act upon any emergency that might occur. He was <lb/>
sorry that in the discussion of this matter allusion had <lb/>
been made to the depressed coniition of the Colony. <lb/>
It made us feel ashamed at our poverty; but it was <lb/>
absolutely necessary that facts should be stated. He <lb/>
trusted that we should embrace the opportunity now <lb/>
afforded us, of rising from our degrafed and isolated <lb/>
condition, that we should extend the hand of friend<lb break="no"/>ship to our brethern in the sister Provinces, and unite <lb/>
in forming the nucleus of what, not long hence would <lb/>
be a great and powerful nation. <lb/></p>

<p>ST. JOH.V'S: <lb/>
THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1865. <lb/></p> 

<p>We have had no further arrivals from the Seal Fishery <lb/>
at this port than those we have already announced, <lb/>
and, naturally enough, the prospects of the voyage <lb/>
form the chief subject of public anxiety. It was a <lb/>
great relief to have heard of the arrival at Carbonear <lb/>
on last Monday, of the Superior, which, though in a <lb/>
leaky state, brought in 2800 seals, and wih them <lb/>
favourable accounts of several St. John's and Goncep<lb break="no"/>tion Bay vessels which were seen doing well with <lb/>
seals. Since then we also learn of the arrival of the <lb/>
Rosina at Harbor Grace, to Messrs. Ridley &amp; Sons, <lb/>
with 2,100 seals. Our weather eontinues somewhat <lb/>
more molerate than is desirable for the interests of <lb/>
the sealers, and a lively breeze is much wished for on <lb/>
their account. <lb/></p> 

<p>The last arrival from England brought the intelligence <lb/>
that the Hon. Hugi W. Horles, Attorney General, <lb/>
had been gazetted as Chief Justice of this colony, in <lb/>
the place of Sir Faancis Bradr, who has resigned the <lb/>
position from ill-health. This announcement is re<lb break="no"/>ceived by the community with great and sincere satis<lb break="no"/>faction. The appointment of our first Native Julge <lb/>
would of itself be a subject of gratulation, as <lb/>
evidencing the progressive results of the work<lb break="no"/>ing of our representative institutions; but Mr. <lb/>
Horles's case involves other considerations which <lb/>
we are no less glad to see justly recognised. He <lb/>
belongs to one of the oldest and most respect<lb break="no"/>able families in the island: he has for many years been <lb/>
a leading member of the Bar and has worn its highest <lb/>
honours with a reputation for distinguished ability and <lb/>
integrity. He has, it is true, been foremost in the <lb/>
political arena; but while broadly differing from most <lb/>
of his views on public affairs, we nevertheless concur <lb/>
in that estimate of his mind and character <lb/>
which holds him fully capable of rising, in his <lb/>
new sphere of duty, superior to party bias or <lb/>
predilections, and adjusting himself without effort to <lb/>
the rigid obligations of even-handed justice imposed <lb/>
upon him by his elevation to the judicial seat. That <lb/>
such should be the feeling of the public in his regard, <lb/>
all ci idered, is itself high praise, but <lb/>
his deservings rest on indisputable gro inds. <lb/></p> 

<p>In acknowledging the following communication, wº <lb/>
can assure the members of the Agricultural Society <lb/>
that we are exceedingly gratified by the high though <lb/>
unmerited compliment they have bestowed upon our <lb/>
humble efforts in the discharge of a public duty; and <lb/>
we must injustice add that it was the alarming statiº" <lb/>
tics brought to light through the seal of the Society <lb/>
which most forcibly prompted our endeavour on bºr <lb/>
half of the object they have had in view:<lb break="no"/>st John's, Nää., 12th April, 1865. <lb/>

the legislature than he was. A more independent, up<lb break="no"/>rght #. never sat upon the bench of Justice, and he <lb/>
ºr himself the confidence and respect...of all per<lb break="no"/>... and every class in the community. He was sure <lb/>
he but echoed the sentiments of this Council in regret; <lb/>
iſing the separation from us of one whº, whether regarded <lb/>
...hief administrator of the law or as a private gentle<lb break="no"/>man, discharged so well his official and social duties, <lb/>
ºrg himself to every one. When we reflect upon <lb/>
the troubious times we have passed through it was no <lb/>
iſitesidence of the impartiality, justice and wisdom <lb/>
of his official conduct, that there was but one opinion <lb/>
as to its faithful discharge. His judicial conduct and <lb/>
private character remain unimpugned 5–without, flaw, <lb/>
Without reproach. He (Mr. Stabb) earnestly hoped that <lb/>
the removal of the Chief Justice to a more genial. clime <lb/>
would restore him to renewed health, and that he would <lb/>
long live to enjoy the pension which this Bill proposes to <lb/>
grant him, which was so well deserved, and which he <lb/>
believed would be most cordially assented to by every <lb/>
member of the Council. He would now move that the <lb/>
Bill be read a seco.d time. <lb/>
Hon R. J. PINsent, in supporting the motion, said he <lb/>
filt it especially became him, as a member of the pro<lb break="no"/>ſession of which tha Chief Justice was such an ornament <lb/>
and distinguished member, to offer a few observations <lb/>
uffin the Bill before the house. He felt that too much <lb/>
cºuld not be said of the worth of Sir Francis Brady. In <lb/>
whºever capacity we consider him, whether as ab able <lb/>
and abstute lawyer, and upright and highly gifted Judge, <lb/>
—member of society or an exemplary private citizen, <lb/>
we have -eep cause to regret his removal from amongst <lb/>
us. We hate had experience of that gentleman, for a <lb/>
period of about 18 years, during, which he presided over <lb/>
the hightest legal tribunal in the land; and in ail that <lb/>
ume there was not one decision of his that could be <lb/>
pointed at with the imputation of partiality, much less <lb/>
corruption; and although no person, no matter how <lb/>
exalted his position or deep and extensive his learn g, <lb/>
or vigorous and well balanced his mind, can be wholly <lb/>
exempt from liability to errors of judgment, yet he <lb/>
(Mr.P.) believed that few were more free from this <lb/>
natural and common lot of the best of men than he was. <lb/>
It would be difficult to point out one who has adminis<lb break="no"/>tered justice with such unflinching integrity and impar<lb break="no"/>ta.ly, aed with such high respect, for the laws, and <lb/>
consummate ability as he had done. It might be <lb/>
difficult, he repeated, in these respects to find his equal, <lb/>
—he believed it would be impossible to meet with his <lb/>
superior. It must be a matter of regret to this house, <lb/>
as it is to the bar, and (he ſelt he was warranted in say: <lb/>
ing) to the community generally, tha; the ſailing health <lb/>
of Sir Francis Brady stould make it necessary for him to <lb/>
retire from the cºlony; and while we all must feel <lb/>
deeply upon this circumstance, it is gratifying to find <lb/>
that the government and the legislature is so liberally <lb/>
disposed to make a generous provision for him, now <lb/>
that from physical infirmity he is no longer able to con<lb break="no"/>tinue to the colºny the benefit of his valuable services, <lb/>
and is compelled to take leave of a people to whom in <lb/>
every relation of life his retirement will be felt to be a <lb/>
ºrious loss. The pension is a handsome one for a <lb/>
Colonial officer, one-half of the original salary; yet it <lb/>
is not more than commensurate with the deserts of him <lb/>
for whom it was intended. He (Mr. P.) hoped he would <lb/>
long enjoy it in a more genial situation, and with the <lb/>
blessings of recovered health, and in the repose of a <lb/>
peaceful and happy retirement; and he had great plea<lb break="no"/>sure in supporting the second readug of the Bill. <lb/>
The Bill was then read a second tims and committed, <lb/>
-hon Mr. Tessier in the chair. <lb/></p> 

<p>After a short deliberation the house resumed, the <lb/>
tommittee having reported the Bill without amendment, <lb/>
t was then read a third time and passed, and it was <lb/>
ordered that it be taken to the Assembly with a message <lb/>
signifying the Council's concurrence. <lb/></p> 

<p>On motion of hon R. J. PINSENT, the amendments of <lb/>
the Assembly on the Practice Bill were read a second <lb/>
time and committad, hon J. O. Fraser in the chair, <lb/>
The committee soon after rose and reported the amend. <lb/></p> 

<p>the committee reported the Bill without amendment. <lb/>
It was then read a third time and passed, and it was <lb/>

on motinn received. The house then went into com. <lb/></p> 

<p>ºmittee on privilege, and after a short time resumed, and <lb/></p> 

<p>adjourned until to-morrow. <lb/>
WEDNESAY, April 5. <lb/>
The house met at 4 o'clock. <lb/></p> 

<p>Immediately after the house met a deputation from the <lb/>
Assembly brought up for concurrence of the Council a <lb/>
Bill to indemnify his Excellency the Governor for cer. <lb/>
tain sums advanced by him from the Colonial treasury <lb/>
for services of the Colony. Also, a Bill to continue an <lb/>
Act passed in the 27th year of the reign of her present <lb/>
Majesty, entitled an Act to establish the standard weight <lb/>
of grain, pulse, and other vegetables, and to regulate the <lb/>
sale of bread, coal and other articles. Also, a message <lb/>
requesting the Council to furnish the lower house with <lb/>
the account of its contingent expenses. <lb/>
On motion of hon N. STABB, the Indemnity Bill was <lb/>
read a first and second time, and committed,—hon R. J. <lb/>
Pinsent in the chair. <lb/>
The first section was read and adopted. <lb/>
Upon the item of $14,923 for the relief of shipwrecked <lb/>
crews being read, Hon P. G. Tessier said that amount <lb/>
appeared to him a most exorbitant one. In fact, the <lb/>
Bill as a whole was the largest Indemnity this house in <lb/>
his reco lection had ever been called upon to assent to. <lb/>
Hon J. S. Clift observed that there were several <lb/>
amounts in the Bill for expenditure on account of re<lb break="no"/>pairs, &amp;c. of public buildings. He (Mr. U.) thought <lb/>
those matters were provided for in Acts containing <lb/>
special provision for them. He merely asked for infor<lb break="no"/>* how these amounts appear in the Indemnity <lb/>
ill, <lb/>
Hon N. STABB-\-There are sums estimated to defray <lb/>
the expenditure on public buildings and other matters, <lb/>
voted each year under the regular Acts; but it is fre<lb break="no"/>quently found that the amounts so estimated are deficient <lb/>
for the purposes required, and as it would be unwise and <lb/>
injurious to stop before the completion of the various <lb/>
repairs and works undertaken, it sometimes becomes <lb/>
necessary to exceed the amounts voted by the legislature. <lb/>
Such was the case with reference to these matters. As <lb/>
regards the vote for shipwrecked crews, the expenditure <lb/>
has been found necessary. There were 35 or 36 vessels <lb/>
wrecked at the Northward last spring, whose crews, with <lb/>
many other crews who were obliged to abandon their <lb/>
vessels, were in a starving condition when they got on <lb/>
shore. There were thousands of men so circumstanced <lb/>
#. had to be brought on to their homes from White <lb/>
ay. <lb/>
Hon P. G. Tess[ER—It appears to me that that vote <lb/>
of £3,500 currency for shipwrecked crews. is a most <lb/>
exorbitant tax upon the resources of the colony. <lb/>
The remaining portions of the Bills were then adop<lb break="no"/>ted, and the committee rose and reported. <lb/></p> 

<p>On motion the report was received, and the Bill was <lb/>
read a third time and passed,—to be taken to the As<lb break="no"/>sembly with a message intimating the Council's concur<lb break="no"/>rence. <lb/></p> 

<p>On motion of hon E. MoRRIs, the weights and measu<lb break="no"/>res' Bill was read a first and second time, and committed, <lb/>
—hon N, STAbb in the Chair. <lb/></p> 

<p>After a short deliberation the committee rose and re<lb break="no"/>ported the Bill, which was then read a third time and <lb/>
passed. <lb/>
Hon R. J. Pinsent said he observed that this Bill <lb/>
was merely a continuation for another year of the Act <lb/>
which had been passed last session to operate for one <lb/>
year only. He was glad to see that law revived, for al<lb break="no"/>though the Bill when it came up to this hºuse, last Ses<lb break="no"/>sion contained some defective provisions which the ad<lb break="no"/>vanced period of the Session did not afford sufficient <lb/>
time to consider maturely, with the view to practical <lb/>
amendments, yet the measure in general, bearing and <lb/>
object was of such an useful and necessary character that <lb/>
it was agreed that it be allowed to go into operation for <lb/>
one year. The effect of its operation his, he believed, <lb/>
revealed its imperfection in more points than those which <lb/>
were anticinated at the time of the enactment; and he <lb/>
regretted that the matter was not dealt with more tho<lb break="no"/>roughly now than this Bill contemplates. He hoped that <lb/>
next Session a measure will be matured of a more com<lb break="no"/>prehensive and perfect character. He had not offered <lb/>
objection to this Bill, as the general object of the Act <lb/>
of last year, as well as many of its provisions, are of so <lb/>
beneficial a kind, <lb/>
Hon J. S. CLIFT said he was in hopes that the gentle<lb break="no"/>man who brought in this Bill would have made provision <lb/>
in it to remedy some of the defects which the operation <lb/>
of the Act of last year has shown it to contain, and which <lb/>
it would benecessary to amend. He thought the object <lb/>
of the weights and measures' Bill a good and useful one, <lb/>
and hoped that next session those provisions in it which <lb/>
require alteration will be rectified. <lb/>
A deputation from the Assembly brought up for con<lb break="no"/>currence of the Council a Bill for granting a supply to <lb/>
her Majesty; which on motion of hon N. STABP, was <lb/>
read a first and second time and committed,—hon E. <lb/>
Morris in the chair. <lb/>
After some time the house resumed, the chairman hav<lb break="no"/>ing reported the Bill which was read, a third time and <lb/>
passed, and ordered to be taken to the Assembly with a <lb/>
message stating the Council's assent. <lb/></p> 

<p>The house then adjourned until to-morrow. <lb/></p> 

<p>THURSDAY, April 6th. <lb/>
The house met at 4 o'clock. <lb/></p> 

<p>monts without amendment. On motion the report was <lb/>
received, and the Bll was read a third time and passed;; <lb/>
and it was ordered that it be taken to the Assembly j <lb/>
with a message acquainting that body that the Council i <lb/>
had agreed to the menuments, <lb/>
. Second reading of Bill to provide for the erection of a <lb/>
light-house in the district of 'Burgeo and LaPoile. -<lb break="maybe"/>Alaº. R. J. Pissest briefly explained the object of <lb/>
this Bill. Its intention was to provide for the erection <lb/>
of a light house in the dis rict of Burgeo and LaFoile, on <lb/>
the Western coast of the island,-4 matter of great im<lb break="no"/>Pºrtance to the people trading to the Westward, but <lb/>
* Especially to those inhabiting the neighborhood <lb/>
where it is proposed to erect the light. This desirable <lb/>
* necessary object had long attracted the attention and <lb/>
* the great political aspiration of the people of the <lb/>
30 ºtern shore. It had been persistentiy urged for <lb/>
º: years upon the notice of tie legi lature, and he <lb/>
. glad to see that the wishes of the district chiefly <lb/>
*ined are at length acceded to. He begged to <lb/>
* that the Bill be red a second time, <lb/></p> 

<p>i <lb/></p>

<p>Hon the President notified the house that it was the <lb/>
intention of His Excellency the Governor to close the <lb/>
eight General Assembly of the colony at 2 o'clock, P. M., <lb/>
to-morrow. <lb/></p> 

<p>A deputation from the Assembly brought up for concur<lb break="no"/>rence of the Council a Bill to make further provision <lb/>
against the destruction of sheep and cattle, and injuries <lb/>
to the person by dogs. This Bill was on motion of hon <lb/>
N. Stabb, read a first and second time and committed,— <lb/>
hon P. G. Tessier in the chair. <lb/></p> 

<p>Some additional sections and and important amendments <lb/>
moved by hon R. J. Pinsent were adopted, and the com<lb break="no"/>mittee rose and reported the Bill, which was read, a <lb/>
third time and passed; and it was ordered that it be <lb/>
taken to the Assembly with a message informing that <lb/>
body that the Council had passed the Bill with amend<lb break="no"/>ments, to which concurrence was requested. <lb break="no"/> </p> 

<p>A Bill to provide for the contingent expenses of <lb/>
the legislature was then brought up from the Assem<lb break="no"/>bly. <lb/></p> 

<p>Oa motion of hon N. STABB, it was read a first and <lb/>
second time, and co.umitted,—hoa J. O. Fraser in the <lb/></p> 

<p>chair. After a short deliberation the committee ri se" <lb/>
report;d progress, and asked leave to sit again. <lb/>
It having been ascertained that the Assembly had in<lb break="no"/>serted. in its Contingencies a half Sessional allowance <lb/>
for its officers and servants, which had been withheld <lb/>
from them in the seednd Session of 1861, hon R. J. Pin<lb break="no"/>sent moved, and it was agreed, that a message be sent <lb/>
to the lower house requesting permission to amend the <lb/>
Contingency report of the Council, by providing for its <lb/>
officers and servants in the same manner. <lb/></p> 

<p>The committee then resumed its sitting and proceeded <lb/>
with the Bill. <lb/></p> 

<p>In a short time, a message was brought up from the <lb/>
lower house consenting to the insertion in the Council's <lb/>
contingencies of the half sessional allowances to the offi<lb break="no"/>cers and servants for the second Session of 1861. <lb/></p> 

<p>The committee having made the necessary amendment, <lb/>
rose and reported. <lb/></p> 

<p>On amotion the report was received, end the bill was <lb/>
read a third time and passed,—to be taken by the Mass <lb/>
ter in Chancery to the lower house, with a message <lb/>
intinating the Council's concurrence. <lb/></p> 

<p>A deputation from the lower house brought up for <lb/>
concurrence of the Council a Bill to regulate the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of the Road service;—also, a message stating that <lb/>
the Assembly had passed without amendment the Bill <lb/>
to provide for the protection of sheep and cattle, &amp;c. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Itegulation Road Service Bill was then, on motion <lb/>
of hon Mr. Stabb, passed through its various stayes, and <lb/>
sent to the lower house with a message stating the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil's concurrence. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Road appropriation Bill and a Bill to consolidate <lb/>
a portion of the Public debt of the colony were then <lb/>
brought up from the lower house. They were severally <lb/>
read a first and second time, committed and passed <lb/>
without discussion, and were then sent to the Assem<lb break="no"/>bly. <lb/></p> 

<p>The house then adjourned until One o'clock to-mor<lb break="no"/>ro?. <lb/></p> 

<p>FRIDAY, April 7th. <lb/>
The house met at One o'clock. <lb/></p> 

<p>At 2 P. M., according to announcement, his Excellency <lb/>
the Governor, attended by the usual suite, arrived at the <lb/>
Council Chamber and took his seat upon the throne. <lb/></p>

<p rendition="simple:right">Tuesday, Feb. 28.</p>
    
    <p>(<hi rendition="simple:italic">Continued.</hi>)</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LEAM2">Mr. LEAMON</persName>.—That question had been debated with <lb/>
a great deal of ability, and very little was left for him to <lb/>
say upon the subject. Still , he would not give <lb/>
a silent vote upon it. In his opinion a union with the <lb/>
other colonies, on fair terms, would have a tendency to <lb/>
better our condition. We want other means of employ<lb break="no"/>ing and sustaining our people besides the fisheries; and <lb/>
he (Mr. Leamon) concurred in the views of those who <lb/>
believed that Confederation would give us these means. <lb/>
Here we are with a small cod fishery, which if not decli<lb break="no"/>ning, is certainly not improving, and with those, who <lb/>
are supported from it increasing in numbers. And not<lb break="no"/>withstanding all that had been said against it, and the <lb/>
discussion in that house and the evidence taken upon the <lb/>
subject, still they were hauling caplin for manure, which <lb/>
rendered the fishery still more precarious; and there <lb/>
was no legislation to prevent it. The caplin went into <lb/>
deep water, where the codfish were glutted with them, <lb/>
regaining there and not coming in on shore as formerly. <lb/>
If fish were as abundant as formerly, then our people <lb/>
might be supported comfortably by it; but now it was <lb/>
impossible. It was the same with the seal fishery. Halt <lb/>
the men had not got berths this spring. There were <lb/>
not sufficient vessels to to take them; and if all the ves<lb break="no"/>sels going out came in loaded, what good, would that be <lb/>
to those who had remain a shore, many of whose families <lb/>
were in a condition of severe destitution? And how <lb/>
could the government carry out improvements, with a short <lb/>
revenue, and so much distress to mitigate? In his opinion <lb/>
we could not to hetter than enter the confederation, <lb/>
and he only regretted that, the resolutions were not, to <lb/>
be at once taken into consideration, that they might judge <lb/>
whether they would be accepted as they stand, or that <lb/>
some other stipulation should be insisted on; and then <lb/>
let them be sent to the constituencies for their decision <lb/>
upon them. These were his opinions, and they were <lb/>
entirely based upon the presant state of the colony, and <lb/>
the impossibility of our people going on much longer, as <lb/>
at present, while the other colonies were propetous. Our <lb/>
able bodied people would leave us, and, we would <lb/>
have the aged and it firm to support. Better see if <lb/>
we could now improve the circumstances of all, so that <lb/>
there should not be inducements for any to go away. <lb/>
These were his sentiments. Let his constituents judge <lb/>
of them. He believed, as the question was more fully <lb/>
discussed and better unuerstood, it would the more con<lb break="no"/>mend itself to the people of the country. For his (Mr. <lb/>
Leanon's) part, he never indulged in clap-trap. He ap<lb break="no"/>proved of confederation, and he did not hesitate to say <lb/>
so. Whenever small states had been united, on fair <lb/>
terms, it was found that general properity was the result; <lb/>
and why snould it not be so in this instance? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SHEA1">Mr. E. D. SHEA</persName> said that although on a former occa<lb break="no"/>sion he had expressed his views on the subject of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, there were a few points that had come out in <lb/>
course of the discussion, on which he would now offer <lb/>
some observations. This Resolution of the Attorney <lb/>
General, postponing to next session any final decision of <lb/>
the quation, seened to him (Mr. Shea) to have operated <lb/>
like a spell in the extraordinary effect it had produced on <lb/>
hon members. He was at a loss to understand how it <lb/>
was that the framer of this resolution had contrived to <lb/>
impart a magical influence to words which of themselves <lb/>
presented no unusal or striking characteristics. But the <lb/>
effect was plain, and not a little remarkable. Up to the <lb/>
time that this wonderful concoction made its appearance, <lb/>
we who were favourable to the scheme of confederation, <lb/>
were threatened by our opponents with the direst conse<lb break="no"/>quences if the question were continued to be pressed upon <lb/>
the public mind. It was declared to be a theme hateful <lb/>
to the people, because it bodied, nothing to this country <lb/>
but the most hateful results, and the aunthilation of all <lb/>
those privledges and possessions which we most prize and <lb/>
    
    <cb/>

cherish. But the same hon gentlemen who uttered these <lb/>
wholesale sweeping condemnations, are now found joined <lb/>
hand in hand with us on the other side of the question <lb/>
in praying only for a little time to enable the people to <lb/>
consider the subject and pronounce their verdict upon it. <lb/>
The most unquiet spirits had suddenly been hushed to <lb/>
tranquility by a few scratches from the pen of the hon <lb/>
mover of this resolution; and the dread convulsion of <lb/>
of the country was marvelously averted. He (Mr. Shea) <lb/>
had heard of a quack who had advertised pills, which, <lb/>
he said, were good against earthquakes, and he was now <lb/>
reminded of him by this prescription that had saved us <lb/>
from the political earthquake which was to have been our <lb/>
punishment. Now if there was a particle of sincerity in <lb/>
the denunciations of hon members on Colonial union, <lb/>
how was it that they have so soon come round to the <lb/>
notion of making it a question of time and conditions? <lb/>
He could clearly see why those who favoured the measure <lb/>
approved of the present resolution, because it only em<lb break="no"/>bodied the view they had expressed, since the opening <lb/>
of the Legislature. But how it had come to take the <lb/>
uncompromising opponents of the proposal from <lb/>
their very high ground of opposition was a problem <lb/>
yet to be explained. Was it because they had lost <lb/>
    their guide, philosopher and friend of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Bullfrog</hi>, <lb/>
    who, it was said, had become a <hi rendition="simple:italic">unionist</hi>? Or was it <lb/>
that changes of opinion had taken place nearer home, <lb/>
and even amongst the constituences of hon members <lb/>
in this town? Was it the influences of the late public <lb/>
meeting that was acting upon their minds—that meet<lb break="no"/>ing which, got up against Confederation, had resulted <lb/>
in making many converts to the measure? It was <lb/>
notorious that the gentleman who advocated Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion on that occasion had received the best and most <lb/>
attentive hearing from the audience; and so chagrined <lb/>
were some anti-confederation members who attended <lb/>
that meeting, at seeing that the feeling of the people was <lb/>
in accord with our view, and that they only asked time <lb/>
to think the matter over, that these hon members had <lb/>
actually allowed their friends of the meeting to fall into <lb/>
the absurd mistake of presenting a petition to the House <lb/>
which the house could only receive as the petition of the <lb/>
two persons who signed it though it was intended to be <lb/>
the petition of the citizens of St. John's! It was well <lb/>
however, that the wholesome agency of public opinion <lb/>
had brought hon members into acquiesence in this <lb/>
reasonable proposition, and that they had been shown <lb/>
how far behind the views of their constituents were the <lb/>
stand still, do-nothing notions which they themselves <lb/>
entertained on this subject. Much stress had been laid <lb/>
by some hon members on the motives and objects of <lb/>
Canada in deserving Confederation; but he (Mr. Shea) <lb/>
thought these were points which it did not at all concern <lb/>
us to consider. What we had to reflect upon was not <lb/>
whether it might suit Canada to further union, but <lb/>
whether it did really suit our own interests to enter into <lb/>
it, and to govern our decision by regard to our own <lb/>
peculiar case and circumstances; for though it might <lb/>
prove highly beneficial to Canada, it did not follow from <lb/>
this that it would be on object the less beneficial to us. <lb/>
But hon members, in endeavouring to bolster up their <lb/>
bad case, were driven to strange saifts and very garing <lb/>
contradictions. Take, for example, their reference to <lb/>
the Delegates. They had all told us that the conduct <lb/>
of these Delegates in Canada had been must priseworthy, <lb/>
that it had reflected the hightest credit on their charac<lb break="no"/>ters as public men and, indeed, that the country that <lb/>
sent them, might be proud of them. But scarcely had <lb/> 
they exhausted the vocabulary of eulogium than they, <lb/> 
one and all exhibited those same Delegates as betrayers <lb/>
and traitors who had done their worst to sell the country, <lb/> 
and blight for ever the prospects of her people. There <lb/> 
was a sample of the cousistency which marked the <lb/>
opinions of hon members on his subject, and which <lb/>
showed what weight ought to belong to their opinions in <lb/> 
the judgment of the public. He (Mr. Shea) had been <lb/> 
much suprised, by a statement put forward the other <lb/> 
day, that our expenditure for the last eight years had <lb/> 
been at the rate of £113,000 per year, and it was urged <lb/> 
from this that we should gain nothing if we accepted <lb/> 
the £112,000 proposed for us under Confederation, in <lb/> 
lieu of our present revenue. He could not see how it <lb/> 
was, if we had been spending this rate, that our debt on <lb/> 
current account was not much more than £36,000. If <lb/>
we had only received, in that time, £100,000 a year of <lb/> 
revenue, and had spent £113,000, we ought to be <lb/>
£104,000 in debt, instead of £36,000. But assuming, <lb/>
for argument's sake, that our expenditure had been as <lb/>
large as was stated, what then? It told strongly against <lb/>
the position it was intended to support. It was clear, <lb/> 
on this supposition, that we had been annually spending <lb/> 
a large sum of money which, was not our own, whereas <lb/> 
if we accepted the terms now proposed to us, and re<lb break="no"/>ceived over £112,000, this together with more than <lb/>
£4,000 of revenue from local sources, which we should <lb/>
retain, would give us a surplus even over the assumed <lb/>
expenditure of which hon members had spoken. It had <lb/>
been said that the tariff of Canada was a protective one; <lb/>
but experience had shown that it was no such thing, that <lb/>
it was a tariff adjusted to revenue alone, and producing <lb/>
only a sufficiency of means for the demands of the public <lb/>
service. It was extraordinary that hon members con<lb break="no"/>ceived such, horror of this protective tariff, as they <lb/>
called it, and were so indiffernt about the danger of the <lb/>
really hostile tariff which stared us, in the face if we <lb/>
choose to stick to our present isolation, and forfeit all <lb/> 
claim to consideration from the neighbouring provinces <lb/> 
We were told that the Canadian tariff of 1864 must <lb/>
necessrrily be imposed upon our trade by the Confedera<lb break="no"/>ted Legislature and this statement was repeated and <lb/>
repeated, for want of argument, in the teeth of the ex<lb break="no"/>planation that, had been given by the Delegates, who <lb/>
showed that the tariff of 1864 was an entirely exceptional <lb/>
one, that it had been so proved to them by the Canadian <lb/>
Finance Minister, who declared it to have been raised <lb/>
for special emergencies, and who also declared that it <lb/>
would be reduced in the coming seesion of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. It was on this account that the tariff of 1863 had <lb/>
been selected as the fairest basis for their calculations. <lb/>
But this basis did not suit the purpose of hon members <lb/>
opposed to the principle of Confederation, and they <lb/>
therefore refused to adopt it, But he (Mr. Shea) con<lb break="no"/>tended that it was a fallacy to assume that either of <lb/>
these scales of duty was to be outs under Confederation. <lb/>
It was much more rational, inuch more in accordance <lb/>
with all we had seen and heard, to believe that the <lb/>
Confederation tariff would be a tariff revised and ad<lb break="no"/>justed to the trade and circumstances of the colonies <lb/>
comprising the Confederacy, as a whole. This belief, he <lb/>
said, was what common sense affirmed; for what possi<lb break="no"/>ble object could the Confederate Government have in <lb/>
maintaining a tariff injurious to us or to any other por<lb break="no"/>tion of the league? Would it not rather be its interest <lb/>
to accommodate its legislation to our peculiar require<lb break="no"/>ments? But in all they had said on this, subject, hon <lb/>
gentlemen had chosen to forget that change in our <lb/>
trade under Confederation which would make it next <lb/>
to impossible that we could raise the revenue they <lb/>
spoke of even in the worst view of the case, it <lb/>
the Canadian tariff of 1864 were put in force here. <lb/>

They had ignored the fact that Canadian manufactures <lb/>
of woolens, leather, hardware, &amp;c., would be imported <lb/>
here duty free, and that in proportion as we consumed <lb/>
these goods must the revenue from the same class of <lb/>
goods from England decrease. He thought we should <lb/>
be gainers by our free importation from Canada, not <lb/>
only in a fiscal point of view, but as affording employ<lb break="no"/>ment to our women of the labouring classes in spin<lb break="no"/>ning, weaving and making up matrials for clothing; <lb/>
and any arrangement which wouid provide suitable <lb/>
occupation for the female population ought to be wel<lb break="no"/>comed by every one interested in our common pros<lb break="no"/>perity. It was impossible to believe hon members <lb/>
serious in their apprehension on the score of taxation <lb/>
in view of the necessary change of condition under <lb/>
Confederation, and bearing in mind the interest of the <lb/>
General Government in making as light as possible <lb/>
those burdens which it would have to share. The as<lb break="no"/>surance given by the Secretary of State for the Colon<lb break="no"/>ies on this head, and the security we should have in <lb/>
the watchfulness of members representing the other <lb/>
maritime colonies, as well as of those who should be <lb/>
sent trom Newfoundland, ought to satisfy hon mem<lb break="no"/>bers that there need be no anxiety as to excessive tax<lb break="no"/>ation. It was very remarkable how nervous hon. <lb/>
members became in mere anticipation of most impro<lb break="no"/>bable burdens, while they were willing to bear actual <lb/>
and heavy burdens of present taxation, in the shape <lb/>
of puperism, depreciation of property, and other <lb/>
evils that prostrate the energies of the country. And <lb/>
they further seem to forget that, even if we take their <lb/>
advice and stay as we are, we must submit to further <lb/>
taxation, though only for the purpose of paying off our <lb/>
existing debt. It had been pretended that Canada was <lb/>
eagerly bent upon securing us to help to pay her <lb/>
debt. The idea seemed to him (Mr. Shea) to convey <lb/>
a bitter mockery of our financial position. It should <lb/>
be first known that we could pay our own debts, before <lb/>
its being at all likely that we could excite the cupidity <lb/>
of other countries. And even if our condition in this <lb/>
respect were improved, why, to talk of Canada having <lb/>
designs upon us to help her out of any difficulties, was <lb/>
as reasonable as to suppose that our own Government <lb/>
should make a raid upon Quidi Viid, or Goat's Cove, <lb/>
to compel the inhajitants of those classical localities <lb/>
to discaarge our present liabilities. Great alarm <lb/>
seemed to exist that we should part with the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of our fisheries; but a moment's reflection would <lb/>
show that our fisheries were more likely to he better <lb/>
managed and protected by a powerful government <lb/>
interested as well as ourselves in their conservation, <lb/>
than by any small efforts of our own. We should then <lb/>
have a chance of having our salmon and herring fisher<lb break="no"/>ies turned to good account; and this surely would be <lb/>
a vast improvement on the present plan of consigning <lb/>
these valuable resources to neglect. But the hollow<lb break="no"/>ness of some of those outside doors, who now made <lb/>
stock of this cry about the fisheries, was manifest when <lb/>
we remember that if these very people had their way, <lb/>
our fisheries would long since have been wrested from <lb/>
us by the French convention; for they had done their <lb/>
worst to oppose that self-government which alone <lb/>
gave us the power to resist the spoilation. The Solici<lb break="no"/>tor General waxed pathetic over what he called the <lb/>
loss of our local Legislature, and told us the people <lb/>
had much more regard than formerly for our local <lb/>
institutions. The hon gentleman had related an in<lb break="no"/>stance of very hard things said years ago by some <lb/>
one he had met in the street at a very late hour of the <lb/>
night. It must have been on some very rare occasion <lb/>
indeed, to account for the Solicitor General having <lb/>
been at large at an unseasonable time. But he (Mr. <lb/>
Shea) much feared that if the people judged of the <lb/> 
Legislature by the amount of good of a practical kind <lb/>
that we had since done for them, their opinion of us <lb/>
would not be found much more flattering than that <lb/>
which had greated the ears of the Solicitor General on <lb/>
his nocturnal perambulations. The same hon gentle<lb break="no"/>man had also ridiculed the idea of our eight members <lb/>
being effective in the Confederate Legislature. Well, <lb/>
if they only exercised there anything like the influence <lb/>
brought to bear on our own Governinent by one <lb/>
member from Harbor Grace, we need never fear for <lb/>
the sustainment of our interests in the Confederate <lb/>
Parliament. Reference had been made to those politi<lb break="no"/>cal distractions in Canada which had caused such fre<lb break="no"/>quent changes of government; but the hon member <lb/>
who made this allusion should have seen that it only <lb/>
told against his own view, because these differences <lb/>
there would render the combined efforts of our eignt <lb/>
members all the more powerful and available to the <lb/>
interests of the colony. We were threatened with <lb/>
losing the protection of England; but we had only to <lb/>
read the views of British statesmen and the British <lb/> 
press to see that the union would cement and consul<lb break="no"/>idate our connection with the parent state; and that it <lb/>
would be in rejecting it that we should run the risk of <lb/>
forfeiting our right to Imperial consid ration. It was <lb/>
plain beyond any possible doubt that Great Britain <lb/>
earnestly desired this measure; and it was absurd to <lb/>
suppose that we were likely to conciliate her favour by <lb/>
flying in the face of her advice and admonitions. The <lb/>
union with Ireland had been held up to scare us away <lb/>
from this proposition. But had the Irish union with <lb/>
England been a real and honest one, had Ireland only <lb/>
been governed as was Yorkshire, Lancashire, or any <lb/>
other county of England, the agitation for repeal would <lb/>
never have been raised. That agitation was the result <lb/>
of despair of a true union; and it was monstrous to <lb/>
pretend any parallel in the present case, where there <lb/>
were no causes existing, as in the instance of unhappy <lb/>
Ireland, to prevent fulfilment of the union which we <lb/>
were invited to enter. The horrors of the draft were <lb/>
also pictured to our imaginations by hon members; but <lb/>
they must be well aware that, in this respect, our po<lb break="no"/>sition would not be in any degree changed by Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. The draft was never resorted to but in those <lb/>
extreme national emergencies which suspend even law <lb/>
itself.—Any such crisis as regarded us was highly im<lb break="no"/>probable. But if it ever arose, even in our present <lb/>
relations with the mother country, Great Britain her<lb break="no"/>self would have that power which we are now asked to <lb/>
believe could only be exercised by the Confederate <lb/>
Government. This was but another of the scarecrows <lb/>
set up to alarm the people with imaginary dangers, <lb/>
and turn their minds from the real evils of their pre<lb break="no"/>sent condition. Hon members had argued that even <lb/>
though advantageous to the sister colonies, union <lb/>
could not benefit Newfoundland, so different were our <lb/>
circumstances from theirs. He (Mr. Shet) regretted <lb/>
to be obliged to agree with them, that our circum<lb break="no"/>stances are indeed very different from those of New <lb/>
Brunswick or Nova Scotia; but this very difference, so <lb/>
far from being a reason against Confederation, was a <lb/>
strong one in its favour. These colonies were prosper<lb break="no"/>ous and progressing. Pauperism, as it is with us, was <lb/>
wholly unknown to them; and they could afford, it they <lb/>
thought fit, to go on, as they have shown themselves <lb/>
able to do, on their own account. Ours was a condi<lb break="no"/>tion opposite of this—the Colony had been for years <lb/>
going down the hill; and the best of the labouring <lb/>
classes were fleeing its shores to seek bread. Our <lb/>
resources, though confessedly good, required an aid <lb/>
that we could not give them; and a reliable prospect <lb/>
of this and was afforded by our junction with older and <lb/>
    <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> thier cuminunities. If the measure suited the <lb/>
other Colonies, it appeared to him that it was all the <lb/>
more desirable for us, in proportion to our greater <lb/>
need of a helping hand. We are told our isolation <lb/>
is a reason against it. It is, if we desire to perpetuate <lb/>
this isolation, which we all agree to consider so inju<lb break="no"/>rious to our interests. A poor man offered a means <lb/> 

<cb/>

of living might as well say that while the offer might <lb/>
suit his better off neighbour, it was useless to him, <lb/>
because of his poverty. The steam communication to <lb/>
be provided for us by the Confederate government, <lb/>
some hon members regard as very uncertain. He <lb/>
(Mr. Shea) did not so consider it. It seemed to him <lb/>
to be a necessary consequence of the union; but on <lb/>
this view he certiny would not rely altogether; and <lb/>
ha would have steam secured by agreement, for he <lb/>
regarded this as an indispensible condition. It was <lb/>
supposed by some that we were not interested in the <lb/>
railroads, canals and such public works of the other <lb/>
provinces. But it must be evident, on a moment's <lb/>
thought, that we had an important interest in what<lb break="no"/>ever means tended to cheapen produce and enhance <lb/>
the value of labour. Oor mines and minerals, it was <lb/>
still said, would be lost to us; but hon members knew <lb/>
well that this statement was groundless, that these <lb/>
mines would be always just as free and open to our <lb/>
people as now, and with the greater probability, under <lb/>
Confederation, of being made practically open and <lb/>
valuable to them, instead of being useless, as they are <lb/>
now, from want of means or enterprise to work them. <lb/>
We were told of the all-sufficiency of our fisheries for <lb/>
the support of the people; but the wretchedness and <lb/>
want around us answered and refuted that grossest of <lb/>
fallacies. Confederation was considered by some a <lb/>
too speculative project for us to entertain. It was not <lb/>
to be denied that about all such changes there was <lb/>
something more or less speculative. None of us could <lb/>
pretend to guarantee the beneficial operation of the <lb/>
measure, no matter how just and strong were the <lb/>
grounds of our expectations. It might as well have <lb/>
been objected that Responsible Government, Free <lb/>
Trade or any other change we have known, ought not <lb/>
to have been advocated, because no security could be <lb/>
given that it would realise its promises. In such ca<lb break="no"/>ses we were compelled to rely upon certain principles <lb/>
the safety of which had been tested by the experience <lb/>
of other countries; and these had been shown to be <lb/>
conclusively in our favour on the subject under consi<lb break="no"/>deration. But he would remind those who cavilled <lb/>
about the point of a speculation, that not even this <lb/>
mush could be said in favour of the course they had <lb/>
    recommended.—There was nothing, even speculative, <lb/>
about the results of their choice to remain as we are, <lb/>
for that plainly meant, to pass from bad to worse, <lb/>
even into the slough of Despond itself. That was a <lb/>
    clear, inevitable certainly before us,—and yet it was <lb/>
preferred to the proposed change, because we could <lb/>
not guarantee that this change would work all the <lb/>
good we anticipated from it. We are admonished to <lb/>
trust to Providence; and far be it from him (Mr. <lb/>
Shea) to gainsay this proposition, under any and all <lb/>
circumstances, but let us well weigh its meaning. <lb/>
Providence provides us with sense and reason, and, in <lb/>
worldly affairs, manifestly intended these attributes <lb/>
to be our guides as far as they can reach our require<lb break="no"/>ments. If, then, we choose not to use these guides, <lb/>
and will run our heals against walls, can we complain <lb/>
that our trust in Providence has been misplaced, it our <lb/>
heads get the worse for the contact? To him (Mr. <lb/>
Shea) it seened something worse than profane to talk <lb/>
of trust in Providence to avert from us the consequen<lb break="no"/>ces of our own deliberate and designing folly. It was, <lb/>
however, most satisfactory to find in all the allegations <lb/>
put forward by the oppone its of union, how unsub<lb break="no"/>stantial was all the material they could urge against <lb/>
it. The futility of their so-called arguments was so <lb/>
far useful, that the country would see how unassail<lb break="no"/>able was our position by any stronger or more legiti<lb break="no"/>mate means. He (Mr. Shea) would now repeat the <lb/>
challenge to hon unenbers oposed to him, to suggest <lb/>
something better themselves, if they were determined <lb/>
to resist the measure now offered to our acceptance. <lb/>
It would not do to tell as we could stay as we were. <lb/>
It was an itsult to the understanding of the public, <lb/>
and it was a cruel insult to the thousands of our la<lb break="no"/>bouring population and our tradesman of all sorts, <lb/>
now piling away for want of employment. But, if it <lb/>
    turned <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> that hon members were only aloud object<lb break="no"/>ors, and were incapable of proposing one single step <lb/>
of themselves to which the country might look with <lb/>
the faintest, hope, it would behove that country to <lb/>
decide whether, in view of the circumstances around <lb/>
us, it will accept the advice to do nothing but sink <lb/>
deeper and deeper in wretchedness and degradation, <lb/>
or whether, moved by manly energy and the progres<lb break="no"/>sive spirit of the day, it will put fortn its best efforts <lb/>
to emancincipate itself from the causes of desline, and <lb/>
enjoy its place and share in the advanced civilization <lb/>
of British North America. He concluded by support<lb break="no"/>ing the Resolution whicn committed this momentous <lb/>
question to the muture reflection of the country. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:MOOR3">Mr. MOORE</persName>.—A remark made by the hon member <lb/>
who had just sat down (Mr. E. D. Shea) was that <lb/>
Confederation would drive poverty from our <lb/>
shores, and raise our people from their present state <lb/>
of destitution to a state of prosperity. Now if these <lb/>
prophecies of the hon gentleman should prove to be <lb/>
not more correct than similar assertions made by him <lb/>
and others on the introduction of Responsible Go<lb break="no"/>vernment into this country, certainly Confederation <lb/>
will be any thing but the boon represented; and will <lb/>
fall far short of the sanguine expectations of those <lb/>
who are so unuch in favor of it. What has been the <lb/>
experience of the last ten years, since the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of Responsible Grovernment? Why, we never <lb/>
before had such, destitution amongst our operative <lb/>
population, as during the latter half of that period. <lb/>
He (Mr. Moore) did not wish to infer that the same <lb/>
result would follow Confederation, if caried into effect, <lb/>
nor did he say that Responsible Government contri<lb break="no"/>buted much to the depressed circumstances of the <lb/>
country, although well known to be too expensive a <lb/>
machinery for so small a population as we are com<lb break="no"/>posed of. Neither did he think that any system of <lb/>
governmert would produce prosperity in the face of <lb/>
prevailing bad fisheries. He (Mr. Moore) was not <lb/>
opppsed to Confederation in the abstract. He believ<lb break="no"/>ed it was a principal which must be established and <lb/>
brought about in the course of time. There were <lb/>
causes in operation which would necessarily lead to <lb/>
the burden of their defence being thrown on the North <lb/>
American Colonies, to a greater extent than hitherto. <lb/>
The British taxpayers are crying out for a reduction <lb/>
of taxation. The products of the British artizans' <lb/>
labour have no longer protection in the markets of <lb/>
the more important Colonies; and they reasonably <lb/>
object to be taxed for the protection of those who deal <lb/>
with them only as far as it suits their convenience. <lb/>
And why should the British artizan be taxed for the <lb/>
benefit of the colonist, whose trade is entirely free, <lb/>
and who, besides, is rolling in comparative wealth, <lb/>
whilst many of the operative population in England, <lb/>
Scotland and Ireland are struggling for the bare means <lb/>
of subsistence? The statesmen of England see the <lb/>
necessity of yielding to opposition raised against the <lb/>
military expenditure in the colonies. Besides, there <lb/>
is reason to believe that the expenditure has some<lb break="no"/>times been largely increased by the colonists them<lb break="no"/>selves,in order that they may profit by it; for instance, <lb/>
that the war in New Zealand was provoked by the <lb/>
colonists, contrary to the desire of the British Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were involved in it, and were in honour <lb/>
bound to support the colonists, whether they were <lb/>
right or wrong. But, for the future, it is evident, <lb/>
from the tone of leading statesmen, if these colonists <lb/>
involve themselves with the aborigines, or with any <lb/>
neighbouring nation or people, on imaginary or <lb/>
other causes, contrary to the policy of the British Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, they must defend themselves. The same, in <lb/>
        
        <cb/>

effect, is now said to the North American Colonies. <lb/>
From the fact of the Canadians countenancing, to all <lb/>
appearance, the late raid across the United States' <lb/>
border by Southern sympathizers, robbing the Banks <lb/>
and firing upon and mortally wounding citizens of <lb/>
St. Albans, Canada has now to turn out a portion of <lb/>
her militia and Volunteers for the protection of her <lb/>
frontier. The British Government very properly <lb/>
said, if you conduct yourselves towards, your neigh<lb break="no"/>burs in such a manner as to excite their hostility, you <lb/>
must take the consequences. And there could <lb/>
be no doubt that, for the future, these large <lb/>
Provinces must make provision for their own defence; <lb/>
by making their militia efficient, and that they will <lb/>
also be called upon to contribute towards the main<lb break="no"/>tenance of a regular army, and will have to provide <lb/>
themselves with a navy. He (M. Moore) did say <lb/>
that in the face of circumstances involving such an <lb/>
enormous expenditure as will inavitably be entailed <lb/>
upon Canada, it would be unwise to pledge this colo<lb break="no"/>ny to join such an alliance on the basis proposed in the <lb/>
report of the Quebec Conference Neither did he be<lb break="no"/>lieve that Newfoundland was originally included in the <lb/>
proposed scheme, or expected to join therein. Nor <lb/>
did he see that we would be benefited commercially by <lb/>
entering into Confederation on such terms. The <lb/>
geographical position of New Brunswick and Nova <lb/>
Scotia, contiguous to Canada, placed them in a very <lb/>
different and more favoarable position in regard to <lb/>
Confederation than this Island; and still it was seen <lb/>
that these provinces hesitated about entering the union <lb/>
and taking upon themselves their share of the im<lb break="no"/>mense responsibility. And was not that enough to <lb/>
warrant us to keep back? It had been said that we <lb/>
are not so far advanced in population, wealth, or <lb/>
material improvement as the other colonies, and that <lb/>
the union would confer great benefit on Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, that we would derive great advantages from the <lb/>
railroads, canals, and other improvements of Canada. <lb/>
He admitted that we would, and will benefit, whether <lb/>
we enter confederation or not; in the same ratio as <lb/>
we have benefited, and will benefit by every improve<lb break="no"/>ment in other countries wherever our commerce ex<lb break="no"/>tends. For instance, by the extension of railroads in <lb/>
Spain, which has tended to facilitate the transport of <lb/>
goals and merchandise required for the interior of <lb/>
that country, the article of codfish being largely con<lb break="no"/>sumed by the inhabitants. Hence the facilities afford<lb break="no"/>ed by these railroads have greatly tended to increase <lb/>
the demand, and enhance the price of that staple <lb/>
product. Canada had constructed ber railroads <lb/>
and canals for her own advantage —for the <lb/>
conveyance of her produce to the seaports, <lb/>
and of the produce of other countries into the interior; <lb/>
also to induce customers from other countries to resort <lb/>
to her markets to purchase of the abundance of her <lb/>
products, in preference to that of the United Sates. <lb/>
In this way Newfoundland will derive great benefit by <lb/>
these improvements, without being compelled to pay <lb/>
for them. We might, in the course of years, find it <lb/>
for our advantage to go into the Confederation; but <lb/>
would not now, under the constitution laid before us, <lb/>
unless some far more favourable terms are offered <lb/>
than the present. A great deal had been said about <lb/>
steam communication. It had been a great boon to <lb/>
every country; and he granted it would be good for <lb/>
us if established. One of the arguments put forward <lb/>
of the advantages of steam communication between <lb/>
this Island and Canada was what it would affold facili<lb break="no"/>ties for our operative population to proceed to Canada <lb/>
where there was a field for their labour. But he did <lb/>
not see how the prosperity of this country was to be <lb/>
promoted by the more energetic of our working <lb/>
classes leaving us, some of whom would no doubt <lb/>
prosper in Canada. But it was not a portion of the <lb/>
most energetic of our population going elsewhere and <lb/>
prospering that would restore the prosperity of this <lb/>
country. For the mater of any of our people pro<lb break="no"/>ceeding to Canada, what is there to prevent them <lb/>
going now? The general colonial policy is to induce <lb/>
people to settle in the respective colonies; but it would <lb/>
seem, by what some hon gentlemen have stated, <lb/>
that the policy of this unfortunate country should be <lb/>
to banish and send our people out of it as fast as they <lb/>
can go; and by their exertions in Canada we are to <lb/>
be raised from our present depressed state. If we <lb/>
require steam communication, it will be better for us <lb/>
to pay for it directly, and then we shall have it; but <lb/>
there is no guarantee in the Quebec resolutions that <lb/>
we would have it under Confederation. The tariff of <lb/>
Canada on which the calculations for the proposed <lb/>
union were based, is protective. It was denied by <lb/>
the hon member for Pacantia, Mr Shea, that the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian tariff is protective, or that it should now be a <lb/>
matter of consideration, as a different tariff would be <lb/>
adopted by the Confederate Legislature. But he <lb/>
(Mr Moore) could not look upon the matter in that <lb/>
light. That tariff is protective; and he (Mr Moore) <lb/>
considered it a matter of vital importance to this <lb/>
Colony, that we should well consider and understand, <lb/>
before entering Confederation, the position we would <lb/>
be placed in with regard to it, and the affect it would <lb/>
have on the country. A protective tariff would not be <lb/>
beneficial to Newfoundland at present. For example, <lb/>
our duty upon manufactured leatherware, at present, <lb/>
is 11 per cent; but under the Canadian tariff it is 25 <lb/>
per cent. Would not this difference of 14 per cent <lb/>
be a bounty to the Canadian manufacturers? It was <lb/>
idle to say that they would not take advantage of it. <lb/>
        Another consideration—supposing the question of <lb/>
union had not been thougnt of, and that our govern<lb break="no"/>ment proposed a tariff similar to that of Canada, <lb/>
would it receive any support in this House? He <lb/>
believed no government in this colony would dare to <lb/>
introduce such a tariff; and, if not, why should we <lb/>
put it in the power of another government to do so? <lb/>
That tariff would produce at least £50,000 over the <lb/>
amount guaranteed to us by the Quebec resolutions. <lb/>
Why should we send £50,000 a year to Canada, and <lb/>
more than probable have to submit to a direct taxa<lb break="no"/>tion of £20,000 a year besides to support our poor <lb/>
and for other purposes? If Confederation would re<lb break="no"/>move the barriers of ice that sometimes block our <lb/>
coast, regulates the winds, and give us more prosperous <lb/>
fisheries, then that would be an advantage. New<lb break="no"/>foundland requires free trade; and can we have it to <lb/>
a greater extent by confederation than we have at <lb/>
present? The Canadian markets are as free to us now <lb/>
as we can desire. Some few articles of Canadian <lb/>
manufacture might suit us; but we cannot afford to <lb/>
shut ourselves out from the British or any other mar<lb break="no"/>ket for the purpose of fostering Canadian manufac<lb break="no"/>tures at our expense. It would be more for our advan<lb break="no"/>tage to continue our present relation with Great <lb/>
Britain, even if we should have to pay, according to <lb/>
our population, a small amount towards the mainte<lb break="no"/>nance of a military force for our defence. And when <lb/>
the British government saw the desire of the people <lb/>
of this Colony to establish Volunteer Companies, as <lb/>
they are doing with such spirit and ardour, to be <lb/>
ready to aid and assist in their own defence, they <lb/>
would not compel us to join the Confederation con<lb break="no"/>trary to our expressed wishes and interests. What <lb/>
the trade of Newfoundland requires is that we should <lb/>
be as free to go to the markets of the world as possi<lb break="no"/>ble, and with as little taxation ſaid on out imports as <lb/>
practicable, and try to keep foreign markets open to <lb/>
our exports-to-endeavour to encourage the people to <lb/>
devote more of their attention to agriculture, which <lb/>
must prove more profitaole to the contry than Con<lb break="no"/>federation. The prosperity of the country must <lb/>
depend upon the energies of the people, and the re<lb break="no"/> 
    
    <cb/>

sources within themselves, and not on the prosperity <lb/>
or resources of another country. It is patent that <lb/>
the fishermen generally have a reluctance to betake <lb/>
themselves to agriculture, from the very nature of its <lb/>
pursuits being so vastly different from the pursuit of <lb/>
the fisheries. But necessity would show and teach <lb/>
them that it is their best alternative; and from that <lb/>
and other resources he anticipated more effective and <lb/>
permanent relief for the present destitution of a <lb/>
portion of our operative population, than from a <lb/>
union with the other British North American Colo<lb break="no"/>nies. </p>

Ordered that these petitions lie on the table. # <lb/></p> 

<p>On motion of the hon. ArroRNEY GENERAL, pur. <lb/>
suant to order of the day, the house resolved itself <lb/>
into committee of the whole on the further consider. <lb/>
tion of the Confederation of the British North Aumers <lb/>
ican Colonies, Mr. KNIGHT in the chair. <lb/></p> 

<p>Dr. WINTER—The critical remarks of the hon and | <lb/>
learned menoer for Fogº, Mr. Whiteway, on the dº. . <lb/>
crease of the representation of Newfoundland in 1871, º <lb/>
under Confederation, required reply, as they wer. <lb/>
specially directed against his (Dr Winter's) views of § <lb/>
#. operation of the 21st Resolution of the Quebec || <lb/>
Conference. The hon and learned member, Mr. White. <lb/>
way, said that he "must confess that he failed to con. <lb/>
prehend the hon gentleman's long array of figures." <lb/>
The resolution in the Report of he Delegates on this <lb/>
subject appeared very simple. It was this:– "No <lb/>
reduc'ion small be made in the number of members <lb/>
returned by any section, unless its population shall tº <lb/>
have decreased relatively to the population of the <lb/>
wnole union, to the extent of 5 per centum." Now, <lb/>
(said Mr. W ), to illustrate the case, assuming the <lb/>
whole population to be 4,000,000, (which was near tº <lb/>
present number) 5 per cent on this would be 200,000. <lb/>
Qur present population was only 130,000. Therefoº # <lb/>
the island must be depopulated before we could lose a <lb/>
representative. But he (Mr. W.) would read what <lb/>
Mr. Galt said on the subject, when addressing hit #3 <lb/>
constituents at Sherbrouke, C. E., and surely his wai <lb/>
an opinion, on the construction of the Resolution, which <lb/>
the hon and learned member for Trinity would respect. <lb/>
IIe said —"The House would never have less thin 194 k <lb/>
members; but it would increase at a very slow rate." <lb/>
This latter remark applied truly to Lower Canada and <lb/>
the other Maritime Provinces, and fully bore out his <lb/>
(Dr Winter's) argument, that whilst the represen a. <lb/>
tion of the whole union would appear to increase "at ſº <lb/>
a very slow rate," the upper section—Canada West <lb/>
—would, in 36 years, have an unjustly preponderating <lb/>
majority over Lower Canada and the other Maritime <lb/>
Prºvinces, although these latter will have a majority <lb/>
of 23 on entering the union. But Mr. Gaſt gave nº <lb/>
opiniºn on the constitution of the 21st Resolution, <lb/>
which runs thus:– "No reduction shall be made in <lb/>
the number of members returned by any section, <lb/>
unless its population shall have decreased relatively <lb/>
to the population of the whole union, to the extent 0 <lb/>
five per cent im" Mr. Gºlf comprehends the effect of . <lb/>
the 21st Resolution, as well as its construction; and #3 <lb/>
certainly would not commit himself to an shsurjity, by <lb/>
telling bis constituents a: Sherbrooke,Canada Eust,that <lb/>
the population of Upper Canada, N wroundland, or; <lb/>
any other section of the union must decrease 200,000, <lb/>
being 5 per cent on 4'000,000, before any reduction <lb/>
shall be mada in the number of members returned by <lb/>
that section of the Confederatton. So much for the <lb/>
authority quoted by the hon and learned in ember for <lb/>
Fogo, Mir. Whiteway, to illustrate the case submitted <lb/>
by him to the House, and the country. Now toil &amp; <lb/>
lustrate his . (Dr. Winter's) view, 5 per cert on <lb/>
4,000,000—the whole population—is 207,000, which <lb/>
divided by the total number of members (194) give: <lb/>
1,003, as per cent for each member. This multiplied <lb/>
by the number of members for each section or Pro<lb break="no"/>vince will show the relative amount of decrease of <lb/>
population required by the 21st Resolution before <lb/>
any of them will lose a member: as shown in the ſok <lb/>
lowing tabular statement. <lb/></p> 

<p>Upper Canada,82:41003 <lb/>
Nova Scotia, 19 " <lb/>
NewBrunswick, 15 " <lb/>
P. E. Island, 5 " <lb/>
Newfoundland, 8 " <lb/></p> 

<p>Now Newfoundland will, in 1871, have increased from <lb/>
130,000 to 155,740; but as the ratio of Lower Canada <lb/>
will give 21,495 for each of her 65 members, New<lb break="no"/>foundland will require 8 times 21,495, or 171,960, tº <lb/>
enable her to return 8 members. But having decreased <lb/>
16,221-more than double the amount of 5 per cent, <lb/>
or 8,024, relatively to the proportion of the whol, <lb/>
union, consequently will lose a member, and will tº <lb/>
tain 7, in place of 8. Such was his (Dr. Winterº <lb/>
view of the matter, to which he would adhere until <lb/>
some suund and logical reasons were given to continº <lb/>
    him to the contrary.—<lb/></p>
    
    <p>M1. WHITeway—What he had stated was that." <lb/>
might possibly have been from his (Mr. W.'s) dº <lb/>
tuseness, but he could net understand the hon <lb/>
learned member's long array of figures or his mode." <lb/>
calculation. Now his (Mr. W.) figures were wº <lb/>
simple. If the hon gentlemán would only tº <lb/>
4,000,000, the present estimated population of th; <lb/>
Confederacy, at 5 per cent, he would find that to co" <lb/>
stitute a reduction sufficient to deprive us of a męż" <lb/>
ber, we would lose exactly 200,000, or in other words, <lb/>
the colony must be entirely depopulated before wº <lb/>
could lose a member. He (Mr. W.) was confirme <lb/>
in this view of the matter by the opinion of Mr. Galt, <lb/>
who said that the house would never have lºss thº <lb/>
134 ºn-mbers,but it would increase et a very slow tº <lb/>
Now tortified by such an opinion as that, he (Mr. W]; <lb/>
must adhere to what he before stated, that he?" <lb/>
not, understand the learned Doctor's figurºs wº <lb/>
mode of calculation.: <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:WYAT1">Mr. WYATT</persName> was sorry that he was not present when <lb/>
this Resolution was laid before the house, and that he <lb/>
had not heard the speeches of the Hon Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral and Mr. A Shea. He also regretted that he had <lb/>
not up to this time seen a report of the hon Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General's speech. He (Mr. Wyatt), felt that <lb/>
on a matter involving such vital interests to the country, <lb/>
it was necessary for every representative to give the <lb/>
question his most serious consideration, to calmly weigh <lb/>
every particular, so that he might be enabled to arrive <lb/>
at a just conclusion. He saw that the hon member for <lb/>
Placentia and St Mary's, Mr. Shea, found fault with the <lb/>
hon Attorney General for saying that the advantages <lb/>
which Confederation would bestow were entirely specu<lb break="no"/>lative. He (Mr. Wyatt) quite <choice><sic>agrred</sic><corr>agreed</corr></choice> with the opinion <lb/>
of the hon and learned Attorney General on this point, <lb/>
and thought that before we hastily entered into any <lb/>
great speculation of this kind, we should see whether <lb/>
its working would be practicable or not. Now in the <lb/>
return which had been laid before the House, shewing <lb/>
the difference between the Canadian tariff and our own <lb/>
he believed there were some mistakes. During then he <lb/>
observed that no allowance had been made for the <lb/>
difference between the Imperial and Old English gallon, <lb/>
which would of itself produce a difference in the esti<lb break="no"/>mate of some £3,000. Now it was very clear that not<lb break="no"/>withstanding the advocacy that had been given to this <lb/>
project by hon members, they were not agreed among <lb/>
themselves as to the terms on which they would join <lb/>
this union. There were very few who would accept <lb/>
the report of the Conference as it stood, and there were <lb/>
many others who had particular objections to each <lb/>
paragraph in that Report. He (Mr. Wyatt) must say <lb/>
that he felt some diffidence in standing up to speak on <lb/>
so important a question as this, before gentlemen so accus<lb break="no"/>tomed to debate. It had been stated that when these <lb/>
Resolutions were laid before the House, some hon mem<lb break="no"/>bers were said to have rushed out and clamorously in<lb break="no"/>formed the people that the country, was to be sold to <lb/>
Canada, and the result was the public meeting which had <lb/>
lately been held in the town. He (Mr. Wyatt) believed <lb/>
that that meeting had only been called for the express <lb/>
purpose of petitioning for a postponement of a decision <lb/>
on this question. He had the honor of presenting a <lb/>
petition from the Commercial Society, that, simply <lb/>
prayed for a postponement. The hon the Speaker had <lb/>
the second time thrown down the gauntlet to the mer<lb break="no"/>chants, and had singled him (Mr. Wyatt) out as their <lb/>
champion. Now he (Mr. Wyatt) was not there in any <lb/>
such capacity, but merely as a representative of the <lb/>
people of Bonavista Bay. As a junior member of this <lb/>
house, he had waited for his colleagues to first express <lb/>
their opinions on this question. He regretted that up to <lb/>
the present time the Surveyor General had not placed <lb/>
his opinions before the public. Now he (Mr. W.) <lb/>
could not perceive what the advantages were which were <lb/>
to be received by this country when we joined this Con<lb break="no"/>federatin. It appeared, however, that we were to be <lb/>
driven into it by threats. It was stated that if we did <lb/>
not join, we would be compelled to pay for our military <lb/>
defences. In the event of a war under this Coufedera<lb break="no"/>tion, would not Canada have quite enough to do to <lb/>
defend her own territory? Our share of the expense <lb/>
of the new nation would be more than we would be able <lb/>
to pay. He did not see, in the financial statements put <lb/>
forth, an adequate allowance for the maintenance of an <lb/>
army and navy for Canada. The hon member for Pla<lb break="no"/>centia and St. Mary's, Mr. Shea, would lead us to be<lb break="no"/>lieve that such would not be necessary. That hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber said—"As regards the burdens the confederation <lb/>
would entail, an army and a navy were held out in pro<lb break="no"/>minent relief, and the alarm of tax payers is sought <lb/>
to be excited. He had already on a former occasion <lb/>
explained his views on this head, and they are not <lb/>
changed by further consideration. The colonies are ex<lb break="no"/>pected to assist themselves, but no intention exists of <lb/>
placing on them so great a burtheu as an army and navy <lb/>
would create. While we are dependencies, manifestly <lb/>
unable to sustain so great an obiigation, its imposition <lb/>
would be imposed to all sense of justice, and the relation <lb/>
we hold to the mother country. No doubt the day will <lb/>
come when the Confederation will, from increase of <lb/>
population and wealth, necessarily cease to be a depen<lb break="no"/>dency, and with the best wishes of the mother country, <lb/>
from which these colonies will never voluntarily separate, <lb/>
an independent national position will be assumed. When <lb/>
that time does arrive, an army and a navy, and the other <lb/>
obligations of national existence will doubtless become <lb/>
necessary, and the country will have the ability to sus<lb break="no"/>tain these burdens. But at present we have no need to <lb/>
deal with such considerations. Mr. Mill, the great <lb/>
writer he had already quoted, though belonging to the <lb/>
school that holds the colonies of light value to England, <lb/>
yet admits that "as the mother country claims the <lb/>
privilege, at her sole discretion, of taking measures or <lb/>
pursuing a policy which may expose then to attack, it <lb/>
is just that she should undertake a considerable portion <lb/>
of their military detence, even in times of peace; the <lb/>
whole of it so far as it depends on a standing army." <lb/>
    That this is the view entertained by H. M. present Go<lb break="no"/>vernment is evident from the paragraph in Mr. Card<lb break="no"/>well's dispatch:—</p>
    
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
    <p>
    "A very important part of this subject is the ex<lb break="no"/>pense which may attend the working of the central and <lb/>
local goveruments. Her Majesty's Government cannot <lb/>
but express the earnest hope that the arrangements which <lb/>
may be adopted in this respect may not be of such a na<lb break="no"/>ture as to increase, at least in any considerable degree, <lb/>
the whole expenditure, or to make any material addition <lb/>
to the taxation, and thereby retard the internal industry <lb/>
or tend to impose new burdeus on the commerce of the <lb/>
country.' <lb/></p>
        
<p>These words would be an idle mockery if it were <lb/>
contemplated to impose on the Confederation the heavy <lb/>
obligation an army and a navy would involve. We <lb/>
may therefore conclude that the just and equitable <lb/>
policy which leaves this charge for the present at least <lb/>
with the Imperial Government, is that which it is pro<lb break="no"/>posed to follow, and that we need not indulge in any <lb/>
serious objection on this account." Now how did that <lb/>
agree with the statement in the speech of the hon <lb/>
George Brown? He (Mr. W.) would read an extract 
    <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> New Brunswick <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> on this subject: </p> 

<cb/>

<p>"In Mr. Tilley's estimate of expense nothing had been <lb/>
allowed for the Army and Navy. The hon A. S. Smith <lb/>
puts down its cost at $2,500,000 per annum". Mr. <lb/>
Smith, states that he had examined the resolution of <lb/>
the Conference carefully, and could find no such item <lb/>
provided for, and, during all the discussions of Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, he never heard it proposed to establish an army, <lb/>
and construct a navy." <lb/></p>
        
        <p>"The Hon George Brown, at the dinner already re<lb break="no"/>ferred to, at which the New Brunswick Delegates were <lb/>
present, said: 'I cannot conclude without referring to <lb/>
some other things which have received the grave atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Conference. And the first point to which I <lb/>
desire to call attention is, the fact that the delegates have <lb/>
unanimously resolved that the United Provinces shall be <lb/>
placed at the earliest moment in a thorough state of <lb/>
defence. The attacks which have been made upon us <lb/>
have created the impression that those Provinces are in <lb/>
a weak and feeble state; if, then, we would do away <lb/>
with this false impression, and place ourselves on a firm <lb/>
and secure footing in the eyes of the world, our course <lb/>
must be to put our country in such a position of defence <lb/>
that we may fearlessly look our enemies in the face. It <lb/>
is a pleasure to me to state, and I am sure it must be a <lb/>
pleasure to all present to be informed, that the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence at Quebec did not separate before entering into a <lb/>
pledge to put the Military and Naval defences of the <lb/>
united provinces in a most complete and satisfactory <lb/>
position.' <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
"To prove the correctness of Mr. Brown's statement <lb/>
we have only to refer to the Published Scheme, Article <lb/>
13 is as follows: "Militia—Military and Naval Ser<lb break="no"/>vice and Defence," Mr. Smith then was fully justified <lb/>
in adding $2,500,000 for the Military and Naval Ser<lb break="no"/>vice." <lb/></p>
</quote>
    
    
    
<p>The military and naval defence of the confederation <lb/>
could not be provided for without very great expense, <lb/>
of keeping an Army and Navy would be very large; and <lb/>
we would have to pay our proportion of the cost. How<lb break="no"/>ever grand the idea of Coufederation might be, the true <lb/>
basis of the question was the pounds, shillings, and pence, <lb/>
no matter how much hon gentlemen might sneer at that <lb/>
view of the question. Every one had admitted that <lb/>
the expense of the new nation, at first, would be very <lb/>
great. He (Mr. W.) considered that we were going to <lb/>
obtain all our manufactures from Canada, was a purely <lb/>
speculative one. We certainly had the testimony of <lb/>
the hon member for Carbonear, Mr. Rorke, that leather<lb break="no"/>ware could be imported at a cheaper rate from Canada <lb/>
than from England, and that the articles imported were <lb/>
as good as the home manufacture. But again we must <lb/>
not forget what had been universally admitted, that <lb/>
during at least six months of the year the Navigation of <lb/>
the St. Lawrence would be closed. And would hon <lb/>
gentlemen say that that would not tell against us <lb/>
Again, it was held out to as an inducement to join the <lb/>
Confeueration, that the Canadians would establish a dock <lb/>
here. He (Mr. W.) believed that if we had one, it would <lb/>
be of great advantage to us. He, however, thought that <lb/>
it was very questionable whether we would ever be <lb/>
indebted to the Canadians for one Again, he thought <lb/>
it would be years before Agriculture could be made <lb/>
anything more than a mere auxiliary to the fisheries.— <lb/>
And now, that the fisheries have been unproductive for <lb/>
years; and although large prices have been obtained for <lb/>
produce, those persons engaged in the fisheries who <lb/>
have been only partially successful are in absolute want. <lb/>
How would it be if we joined the confederation, and the <lb/>
fisheries were unproductive? would we be able to obtain <lb/>
a grant from the Federal Government for the relief of <lb/>
our poor? Or would we not be compelled to raise the <lb/>
means of relief by direct taxation? It had been admitted <lb/>
on all sides that the system of local assessment for the <lb/>
relief of the poor could now be carried out here. He <lb/>
was surprised to hear the hon. the Speaker say that the <lb/>
delegates had obtained as good terms for Newfoundland <lb/>
as could be expected. He (Mr. W.) must say that it <lb/>
these were the best terms that could be obtained for us, <lb/>
we should boldly state at once that we could not join the <lb/>
Confederation. The question had been proposed to us <lb/>
at a very unfavourable time, when the country was to be <lb/>
at its lowest ebb. He would like to know whether the <lb/>
stamp tax which existed in Canada was to be applied <lb/>
here? And if so, in what shape or form? The people of <lb/>
this country could not bear direct taxation. See how dif<lb break="no"/>ficult it was to collect the present water rates. Wny. <lb/>
in many instances, the ground landlords were compelled <lb/>
to pay the rates, from the extreme poverty of the tenants. <lb/>
Then it must be remembered that we would also have <lb/>
to pay the sewerage rates, and further direct taxation was <lb/>
out of the question, even in the capital; and still less in <lb/>
the outports could direct taxation be resorted to. His <lb/>
own impressions, from the first, were decidedly favour<lb break="no"/>able to Confederation, which he regarded as a very grand <lb/>
and imposing question. But the terms proposed in the <lb/>
Resolutions of the Conference at Quebec were not such <lb/>
as he considered for the advautage of Newfoundland to <lb/>
accept. So far he had seen nothing that could induce <lb/>
him to go into it. He would be sorry to deprive his <lb/>
constituents of any benefits which might flow from it, <lb/>
if really there would be any to counterbalance the dis<lb break="no"/>advantages under these Resolutions. He was very glad <lb/>
indeed that the Resolution before the chair had been <lb/>
proposed, which provided that the question should be <lb/>
submitted to the constituencies previous to a final deci<lb break="no"/>sion being come to upon it. He thought the aduministra<lb break="no"/>tion of our affairs and resources would be much better <lb/>
in our own hands than in those of any eght gentlemen <lb/>
whom we might send to Canada. A delegation to Eng<lb break="no"/>land on that question had been suggested. He was not <lb/>
in favour of sending home a delegation; because he <lb/>
thought the interests of the country were safe in the <lb/>
hands of the gentlemen interested in Newfoundland <lb/>
resident there, who had an intimate acquaintance with <lb/>
our circumstances and wants; and who were deeply <lb/>
interested in the prosperity of the country. They would <lb/>
bring much parliamentary influence to bear on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and would watch the progress of affairs. In the <lb/>
meantime, until we had more reliable information, and <lb/>
could obtain better terms, we had better abstain from any <lb/>
proceedings committing the country to any course. <lb/>
Holding these views, he had much pleasure in supporting <lb/>
the Resolution before the chair. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
<persName ref="pers:MCGR3">Mr. McGRATH</persName> had listened with the greatest attention <lb/>
to the speecres of hon members on both sides of the <lb/>
House on the great and important question before <lb/>
the Confederation of the British North <lb/>
American Colonies. This was a vital and important <lb/>
subject to the future interests of Newfoundland, <lb/>
and one that he thought should be dealt with <lb/>
houestly by every hon. member of the House. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion has been so ably and full discussed that it was not <lb/>
his intention to go into it at any great lengeth. After <lb/>
            listening to the many lengthy, able and eloquent speech<lb break="no"/>es of hon. members who had addressed the House, <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
for and against Confederation, he must say that, to his <lb/>
mind, the arguments in favor of Confederation were the <lb/>
more convincing. Still there were some modification <lb/>
which he thought were most necessary before we should <lb/>
agree to accept to terms of the Quebec Resolutions. <lb/>
</p> 
        
<cb/>    
    
<p><choice><sic>Ohe</sic><corr>One</corr></choice> most necessary condition he (Mr. McGrath) consid<lb break="no"/>ered to be a guarantee for the establishment of steam <lb/>
communication, both with Canada and England. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved hon. members were agreed that without steam <lb/>
communication with Canada, the Union could not be ef<lb break="no"/>fectively or beneficially carried out. He fully concurred <lb/>
in the Resolution before the chair, that no decision be<lb break="no"/>come to on the question until after it is submitted to the <lb/>
constituencies. This would give the people ample time <lb/>
for the consideration of the question, which would thus <lb/>
be submitted to the whole country; and the House <lb/>
would be relieved from tha great responsibility of deci<lb break="no"/>ding a question of such vital importance to the present <lb/>
and future generations. He, for one, could not have <lb/>
agreed to any other course; for he would not have taken <lb/>
the responsibility of voting for the union without its <lb/>
being previously sanctioned by his constituents. There <lb/>
was no anticipation of so important a question coming <lb/>
before the House, when hon. members were returned by <lb/>
their constituents; and therefore the electors throughout <lb/>
the Colony should have the privilege of pronouncing <lb/>
upon the question, previous <choice><sic>tc</sic><corr>to</corr></choice> a vote of that House being <lb/>
taken upon it. Looking at the present depresed condi<lb break="no"/>tion of this colony, and contrasting it with the general <lb/>
prosperity prevalent in the other British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Provinces, he (Mr. McGrath) anticipated a favorable <lb/>
result from the appeal to the people. He believed they <lb/>
would be most anxious for union. He must say that <lb/>
he could not see how otherwise this country was to be <lb/>
raised from its present state of depression. The fisheries <lb/>
were from year to year becoming gradually less produc<lb break="no"/>tive, the country was falling into debt, pauperism ab<lb break="no"/>sorbing the revenne, and leaving no surplus to be ap<lb break="no"/>plied to public improvements and the development of <lb/>
our resources. Taking these circumstances into conside<lb break="no"/>ration, one would imagine that almost any change for <lb/>
Newfoundland would be for the better. If we visited <lb/>
many harbors along our coast, we would find establish<lb break="no"/>ments, once flourishing, now falling into decay, the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of the fishing population losing all energy, owing <lb/>
to bad fisheries, and no appearance, as in former years, of <lb/>
attention to agriculture or any other pursuit from which <lb/>
they could gain an independent livelihood. Considering <lb/>
all these matters, he thought a union with the other <lb/>
Provinces afforded the best prespect of elevating the con<lb break="no"/>dition of the people and promoting the best interests of <lb/>
this Colony. But, as he nad already observed, the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was one for the decision of the people themselves, <lb/>
whether they would go into the union, or return a ma<lb break="no"/>jority to the next House opposed to Confederation. He <lb/>
had, therefore, much pleasure in supporting the Resolu<lb break="no"/>tion before the chair. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
<persName ref="pers:KAVA1">Mr. KAVANAGH</persName> rose, not for the purpose of throwing <lb/>
any additional light on the great question now before the <lb/>
country, but merely to show his constituents how he felt <lb/>
in the matter; and it would be for them to judge of his <lb/>
conduct. Many and powerful arguments had been put <lb/>
forward, both for and against Confederation. He (Mr. <lb/>
K.) was glad to find that the people were alive to the <lb/>
question, in which their interests are so deeply involved. <lb/>
The public mind was much agitated upon it, and jusly so, <lb/>
for if that question of Confederation was carried, it might <lb/>
entail great and permanent ruin on the country. He was <lb/>
glad, however, that the decision of the question, was to <lb/>
be referred to the people themselves. The whole coun<lb break="no"/>try would thus have time for its consideration, and its <lb/>
discussion by the people would, no doubt, have the best <lb/>
results. They would have an opportunity of considering <lb/>
it deliberately and in all its totality. It would be well <lb/>
that they should consider how far it would be prudent on <lb/>
their part to transfer to strangers the power of enacting <lb/>
their laws and levying upon them any amount of taxa<lb break="no"/>tion they pleased; also to consider how far it would be <lb/>
wise to give up to Canadians the control of the Crown <lb/>
lands, mines and minerals of this lsland, and more than <lb/>
that, whether they would submit to additional taxation to <lb/>
meet the outlay for improvements in the other colonies, <lb/>
and for the military expenditure of the Confederation. <lb/>
These improvements can be of little or no benefit to the <lb/>
people of this Colony, while many improvements are ur<lb break="no"/>gently required here, which would be of the greatest be<lb break="no"/>nefit to them. Would the people consent to their rights <lb/>
and privileges passing from them for ever? Should they <lb/>
consent to all this, they would deserve the blackest ser<lb break="no"/>vitude. The British Government had, in their wisdom, <lb/>
conferred upon us a free constitution, fully satisfied that <lb/>
we were able to manage our own affairs. Were we, then, <lb/>
going to give up that great boon? He (Mr. K) said no, <lb/>
Let our heart's blood flow to preserve our free constitu<lb break="no"/>tion under the British flag. Much had been said on that <lb/>
great and important question. Some hon. members spoke <lb/>
of the great benefits conferred on Scotland by the union <lb/>
with England. No doubt Scotland was a great gainer <lb/>
by that union. But he would ask permission to turn to <lb/>
another question, and ask how Ireland has been under <lb/>
her union with England? Had she gained any benefits <lb/>
by that? How has it fated with that lovely land of the <lb/>
sun, which might be said, or its fertility, to be flowing <lb/>
with milk snd honey—that land whose sons are brave, <lb/>
and its daughters virtuous, who sent forth saints and he<lb break="no"/>roes to instruct man and combat tyrants–heroes who <lb/>
never struck their flag to an enemy, and the plains of <lb/>
Waterloo could bear testimony to that fact, in the person <lb/>
of the late distinguished Duke of Wellington, who was a <lb/>
son of that misruled Island. He (Mr. K.) would ask the <lb/>
question again.—Was Ireland benefited by the union? <lb/>
On the contrary, she lost every thing that was dear to her <lb/>
people. Let any person take up Sir Jonah Barrington's <lb/>
Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation, read it with care, and let <lb/>
him say what Ireland lost by her union with England. <lb/>
No country ever rose so quickly, in the short space of <lb/>
eighteen years—more that Ireland did, whilst she had <lb/>
the full control of her own affairs. But when she lost <lb/>
that she sank far below tue level of a petty province; <lb/>
and is now steeped in misery and want; and her hardy <lb/>
and industrious race deserting her every day, and leaving <lb/>
her green fields a barren waste. All this must be <lb/>
attributed to her union with England. With this fact <lb/>
before our eyes, let us, in the name of everything that is <lb/>
good, retain that great book which the mother country <lb/>
besowed upon us; and let us look to a kind Providence <lb/>
for better times.—Let the people stand firm together, <lb/>
and preserve the freedom and independence of their <lb/>
country: for this is not the work of party or of faction, <lb/>
but the united work uſ the country; and when a people <lb/>
become blended and inseparable, their power cannot be <lb/>
resisted, but must be acknowledged. Then before New<lb break="no"/>foundland is committed, he (Mr. K.) trusted that no <lb/>
man would shrink from his duty. In supporting the just <lb/>
claims, and doing justice to the people. And the man <lb/>
that would, let him be branded as one unfit for the con<lb break="no"/>fidence of any constituency, and let him be scorned from <lb/>
power at the next general election; for the man would <lb/>
willingly barter away the liberties of his country for a <lb/>
mess of pottage, should not be tolerated. Then with his <lb/>
whole heart and soul he (Mr. K) opposed confederation, <lb/>
until the people are fully convinced that by entering <lb/>
into the scheme their interests would be promoted. And <lb/>
in doing do he based his objections on the following <lb/>
reasons:—First, our <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> and <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
            
pass away for ever from our hands, and must be entirely <lb/>
placed under the control of the Federal Government, <lb/>
which would tend to destroy the prospects of our peo<lb break="no"/>ple; and should it suit the whim of the Federal Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, they would place such restrictions on our <lb/>
fishing population as would entirely cripple our great <lb/>
staple trade; and having no guarantee to the contrary, <lb/>
such restrictions might be imposed. Secondly,–the <lb/>
General Government will have the power of taxing to <lb/>
any amount our imports and exports, even our houses, <lb/>
lands, cattle, and all other property we possess, in order <lb/>
to raise a revenue, which would press heavily upon the <lb/>
people. The steam communication is named, but no <lb/>
guarantee is given for its being carried into effect. We <lb/>
have merely the promise of the existing government of <lb/>
Canada for its being carried out. The regulation of our <lb/>
trade and commerce would be under Federnl control, <lb/>
and we knew full well, if the mercantile interests of this <lb/>
Island came in contact with those of Canada, that ours <lb/>
would have to give way. That, in itself, was a great <lb/>
objection which had to go into Confederation. Our <lb/>
Lighthouses, buoys and beacons would be under the <lb/>
control of the Commissioners of the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment; in fact every institution now under our own sole <lb/>
management would pass into Federal hands; and over <lb/>
them we would not he allowed the smallest control. The <lb/>
paltry sum of £80,000, with £32,000 assumed on our <lb/>
account was all we were to receive annually, whatever <lb/>
amount of revenue might be collected at our ports; and <lb/>
with this sum of £80,000 a year we would have to <lb/>
defray the whole of our local expenditure, including the <lb/>
making and repairing of local roads and bridges. If this <lb/>
sum would prove inadequate, we must have recourse to <lb/>
direct taxation. Then our Crown lands would pass from <lb/>
under our charge, with our mines and minerals. A <lb/>
Canadian Surveyor General would be sent down to take <lb/>
charge of the Crown lands department, who would re<lb break="no"/>ceive his instructions from the Federal Government, and <lb/>
have a regard solely to their interests and wishes in the <lb/>
management and disposal of these lands as well as of <lb/>
mining licenses. Considering all this, was it a matter of <lb/>
surprise that there was such a strong public feeling <lb/>
against Confederation? There was no guarantee, on the <lb/>
other hand, that our circumstances would be in any <lb/>
respect improved under Confederation; but, on the <lb/>
contrary, he (Mr. K.) thought they would be much <lb/>
damaged. Therefore he considered that Confederation <lb/>
would not suit the country. But should the people <lb/>
think otherwise, with them the decision would lie. Let <lb/>
them declare at the approaching General Election in <lb/>
favour of union, taking the responsibility on themselves; <lb/>
and then no blame would attach to their representatives. <lb/>
But until his constitueots were satisfied that it would be <lb/>
for their benefit to enter into the Confederation, he (Mr. <lb/>
K.) was determined to oppose it. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
<persName ref="pers:BARR3">Mr. BARRON</persName>.—The subject of Confederation which <lb/>
has been so long before the house and so ably discussed <lb/>
on both sides, was now very nearly exhausted. He had <lb/>
listened with great attention to the arguments which had <lb/>
been adduced for and against the proposed union. But <lb/>
notwithstanding the able and eloquent speeches which <lb/>
had been made, he saw no reason to <choice><sic>ehange</sic><corr>change</corr></choice> the opinion <lb/>
which he had held for a long time, but had never publicly <lb/>
expressed, that Confederation must prove of substantial <lb/>
benefit and advantage to Newfoundland. The Resolu<lb break="no"/>tions of the Conference did certainly seem objectionable <lb/>
in some minor matters of detail. The most important <lb/>
subject which he considered it necessary to refer to, and <lb/>
without which, in his opinion, there could be no Con<lb break="no"/>federation, because there would be no reciprocity of inter<lb break="no"/>est or equality of benefit, was steam communication. He <lb/>
saw that provision had been made for the intercolonial <lb/>
railway, which, in itself, would confer more advantages <lb/>
upon the sister Colonies than upon Newfoundland. He <lb/>
thought, therefore, that we were entitled to direct steam, <lb/>
and that a provision guaranteeing it to us should have <lb/>
been inserted in these resolutions He, however, did <lb/>
not see how it was possible for us to have direct steam <lb/>
with Toronto. It must be evident to any reflecting mind <lb/>
regarding the present condition of the country, and com<lb break="no"/>paring it with its progress and uncertain prosperity in <lb/>
the past, that if we are left to our own unaided resources, <lb/>
there can be no possible hope of our ever bettering our <lb/>
condition, but that with the ever increating burden of <lb/>
pauperism, and consequent social demoralization, nation<lb break="no"/>al insolvency must inevitably follow. We have nothing <lb/>
to depend upon but our fisheries, which are of the most <lb/>
precarious character; we have no other resource to em<lb break="no"/>play the industry of the people; and when our fisheries <lb/>
failed, we had nothing to hope for. Hon. gentlemen <lb/>
had spoken about the good fisheries of the past; but <lb/>
any one acquainted with them must know that if they <lb/>
were good one year, they were bad the next. The his<lb break="no"/>tory of the country, shewed a succession of good <lb/>
and bad fisheries; an he (Mr. B.) firmly believed that <lb/>
twenty years hence, we would be in the same state of <lb/>
poverty and degradation that we are in at present. The <lb/>
great cry that was raised against Confederation, was ad<lb break="no"/>ditional taxation. He (Mr. B.) believed that that was a <lb/>
bugbear, a species of political clap-trap, that was only <lb/>
resorted to, to mislead and deceive the people. He felt <lb/>
assured that our imports from Canada, coming in duty <lb/>
free, would more than counter-balance any increase in our <lb/>
tariff. Hon. gentlemen who were opposed to this Con<lb break="no"/>federation had taken the tariff of 1864, and roundly as<lb break="no"/>served that it would be applied to us. Did they not know <lb/>
that that tariff was an exceptional one, and that it was <lb/>
to be remoddelled? Hon. gentlemen had also said that <lb/>
the Reciprocity Treaty would not be done away with. He <lb/>
(Mr. B.) knew that it would. He was as well informed <lb/>
on this point as any other hon, member—the notice for <lb/>
its abrogation had passed the United States Senate some <lb/>
time ago; and a settled determination existed not to <lb/>
continue it. From the time of its inception up to the <lb/>
present, the farmers of the United States had always been <lb/> 
opposed to it; and now that the influence of the Western <lb/>
States was more powerful in the Senate than formerly, <lb/>
on account of the Southern Confederacy, there was no <lb/>
possibility of its continuance, And the raids from Cana<lb break="no"/>da had so incensed the people of the States, that they <lb/>
were desirous of hasteniug its abrogations. The loss, <lb/>
therefore, of the Reciprocity treaty must be regarded as <lb/>
settled. It would be greatly felt by this Colony, which <lb/>
had derived great advantages from it. It was necessary <lb/>
therefore, that, in our present position, we should have <lb/>
something else to depend upon. He did not see that we <lb/>
could get terms much better than these offered to us. <lb/>
We are not in a position to dictate terms. Poverty and <lb/>
misery are rife among us, and unless we join in this Con<lb break="no"/>federation, we could hope for no improvement in our so<lb break="no"/>cial coudition. He did no know much at out the value <lb/>
of our mines and minerals; but as General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were giving us the large sum of £37,300 per an<lb/>num for them, he certainly thought that we should not <lb/>
reject such an offer. These mines would then be work<lb break="no"/>ed, and as necessary consequence, a new branch of indus<lb break="no"/>try would be opened up for our laboring population, <lb/>
and great substantial benefit conferred on the country. <lb/>
Up to this period our mines had been in the hands of one <lb/>

of the country had been given to him, and in many places <lb/>
the Agriculturist was precluded from settling on some of <lb/> 
the finest lands in the country, because they were in the <lb/>
hands of a private individual, who had obtained posses<lb break="no"/>sion of them. He perfectly coincided with the wisdom <lb/>
and prudence of this Resolution, which left the constitu<lb type="no"/>encies of the country to decide the question. Already we <lb/>
found great change of opinion in the ranks of the anti<lb break="no"/>confederates. One gentleman, who at the first was op<lb break="no"/>psed to the principle altogether, had now so modified <lb/>
his views as only to object to the details. He (Mr. Bar<lb break="no"/>ron) would have voted against any Resolution that would <lb/>
have operated to bind the country without appealing to <lb/>
the people. He had only heard the closing remarks of <lb/>
the hon. member for Bonavista, Mr. Wyatt. That hon. <lb/>
gentleman had such an exalted idea of the power and in<lb type="no"/>fluence of the mercantile body, that he believes that in<lb type="no"/>fluence will be sufficiently strong to snuff out all those <lb/>
who have had the manly independance of fearlessly speak<lb break="no"/>ing their sentiments in opposition to the opinions of <lb/>
the merchants of St. John's, who are not themselves <lb/>
agreed on the measure. That hon, member had indulged <lb/>
in similar remarks before, and he had been very properly <lb/>
snubbed for it. That should have taught him a lesson in <lb/>
modesty. With reference to the suggestion that it <lb/>
would be well to send delegates to England to watch <lb/>
proceedings there, he saw no necessity for it, he would <lb/>
oppose it. The Resolution before the house definitely <lb/>
settled the question until the next session; and he con<lb break="no"/>ceived nothing more was required. He had much plea<lb break="no"/>sure in supporting the Resolution. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PARS1">Mr. PARSONS</persName>.—The subject of a Confederation of <lb/>
the British North American Colonies has now been <lb/>
tolerably well discussed by this House; and no doubt <lb/>
the effect of that discussion upon the public mind has <lb/>
been useful, in enabling indifferent persons to arrive <lb/>
at a satisfactory conclusion as to the advantages or <lb/>
disadvantages—the good, or evil—which might result <lb/>
to this country by forming a part of the proposed <lb/>
aliance. Before I proceed farther, however, I should <lb/>
like to inquire how this question has presented itself <lb/>
for our consideration. We are aware that the Legis<lb break="no"/>latures of the neighbouring Provinces deputed each <lb/>
several of their members to attend a Couvention held <lb/>
last year at Quebec, to deliberate on the expediency <lb/>
of uniting with the Canadas to form a Colonial Confe<lb break="no"/>deration. To this Convention the Executive Govern<lb type="no"/>ment of Newfoundland despatched two gentlemen as <lb/>
Deleagtes. The Assembly was no party to the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment. The people, or the representatives of the <lb/>
people, knew nothing of the mission upon which they <lb/>
were sent. It appears, however, that a suite of Reso<lb break="no"/>lutions was drawn up as the basis of a constitution for <lb/>
the formation of a new nation to be created by a union <lb/>
of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Priuce Edward <lb/>
Island and Newfoundland with the Canadas. These <lb/>
Resolutions were passed in secret, that is, the public <lb/>
were not admited to the deliberations of the conclave. <lb/>
The Executive Oelegates from Newfoundland sigued <lb/>
these Resolutions, several of which were only carried <lb/>
by a majority of one, ahd that one the casting vote of <lb/>
an instrument of Canada, thereby pledging the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Newfoundland, whose special plenipoten<lb break="no"/>tiaries the Delegates from this colony were, to all the <lb/>
stipulations contained in them. Now, this being the <lb/>
case, how came these Resolutions before the House <lb/>
in the illegitimate shape in which they appear? The <lb/>
act of signing these Resolutions was certainly the <lb/>
act of the Government, whose commissioners the Dele<lb break="no"/>gates were, and the transaction should either have <lb/>
been rejected by the Government altogether, or have <lb/>
been laid upon the table of the House as a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment measure. Had the Resolutions at Quebec been <lb/>
agreed to by delegates duly appointed by this house, <lb/>
the matter would have been quite different; then their <lb/>
<choice><sic>Roport</sic><corr>Report</corr></choice> would have come before the house in a con<lb break="no"/>stitutional manner, and might be ratified as the act of <lb/>
Deputies rightfully appointed to do certain things on <lb/>
the part of the Assembly. As it is, it is well to dis<lb break="no"/>abuse the British Government of any impression it <lb/>
may entertain, that this house recognises, in any way, <lb/>
the proceedings of the Delegates, or that their signa<lb break="no"/>tures commit them, in the sightest particular to their <lb/>
views; that, therefore, the question is an open one, <lb/>
and that this Legislature is not in a position to come <lb/>
to a conclusion upon it. With these views I heartily <lb/>
support the Resolution before the chair. As to the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity or expediency of this Colony joining the pro<lb break="no"/>posed Confederacy, I am entirely opposed to it, on any <lb/>
plea. It has been urged that we ought to do so, on the <lb/>
score of self-protection. I deny that there is any fear <lb/>
whatever to be apprehended on that point. We have had <lb/>
in all the wars in which Great Britain has been engaged, <lb/>
ample protection from the mother land; and is her <lb/>
strength so decayed,that she cannot still throw the shield <lb/>
of her defence around us, as she has hitherto done? I <lb/>
do not believe it. I have that unswerving confidence <lb/>
in her naval superiority, as to believe that she <lb/>
is as able, and as willing now as ever she was, to pro<lb break="no"/>tect us against her foes, no matter from what quarter <lb/>
they may come. Surrounded as our rock-girt coasts <lb/>
are by the broad Atlantic, our soil is secure against <lb/>
any invasion which could uot be successfully met and <lb/>
rendered abortive by the navy of England. In the <lb/>
name of the people Newfoundland, I therefore repudi<lb break="no"/>ate the idea that we shall be more secure against ag<lb break="no"/>ression by entering the contemplated Union with <lb/>
Canada, than we are at the present moment, a col<lb break="no"/>ony with a millstone of forty millions of dollars of <lb/>
debt about her neck, whose credit is doubtful at home, <lb/>
and whose debentures are at a discount in the foreign <lb/>
market. Let me now call the attention of the house <lb/>
to the moving causes which operated to induce the <lb/>
Canadians to devise a union with the Mariine Colonies; <lb/>
and I shall quote from a writer seemingly well posted <lb/>
up in Colonial politics:— <lb/></p>
        <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
        <p>
"In Nova Scotia Legislature, last spring, resolu<lb break="no"/>tions were carried recommending that delegates be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed to consider the subject of a Union of Nova <lb/>
Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island <lb/>
(but not Canada) to be under one Government and <lb/>
Legislature. Similar resolutions were passed in the <lb/>
Legislatures of New Brunswick and Prince Edward <lb/>
Island, and accordingly delegates were appointed by <lb/>
the Provinces named, who, in September, met at <lb/>
Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. They were <lb/>
either, unable to agree, or did not desire to carry <lb/>
out the instructions of the different legislatures <lb/>
which authorised their appointment.—Previously, <lb/>
however, to the meeting of the delegates, a number <lb/>
of leading Canadians arrived at Halifax, upon <lb/>
the invitation of some of the people of that city, <lb/>
and being very well treated there, fell into such love <lb/>
towards that province as the crow is said to have for <lb/>
the corrion. A few Haligonians, who imagine that <lb/>
they can control the whole province, seemed ready <lb/>
to sell us for to promise of an intercolonial railroads. <lb/>
The Upper Canadians, a shrewd and calculating peo<lb break="no"/>ple, saw at once that the intercolonial road would <lb/>
be vastly more beneficial to themselves, and, <lb/>
moreover, that if they could get Nova Scotia <lb/>
with New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, <lb/>
under their control, they would materialy help to <lb/>
prop up their tottering credit, and better still, enable <lb/>
them to surmount the troubles and difficulties which, <lb/>
for years, existed between Upper and Lower Canada, <lb/>
and which destroyed the stability of their several suc<lb break="no"/>cessive Governments. What that difficulty was it may <lb/>
not be out of place briefly to mention. In 1827 the <lb/>
population of Lower Canada, which was then and for <lb/>
some time after a separate povince, numbered some <lb/>
600,000. Of this number 525,000 were of French <lb/>
        
        <cb/>

descent, and professed the Catholic religion. With <lb/>
upwards of five of French to one of British origin, the <lb/>
number of salaried offices held by frenchmen was only <lb/>
47, while the fraction (75,000) of British descent held <lb/>
157 offices of emolument. This, with numerous other <lb/>
grievances, produced the irritation and discontent <lb/>
which resulted in the rebollion of 1837. In 1840, <lb/>
after the rebellion was put down, as if to avoid fu<lb break="no"/>ture difficulty, the two provinces of Upper and Lower <lb/>
Canada were united under one government and legis<lb break="no"/>lature, both sections having an equal number of re<lb break="no"/>presentatives in the General Assembly. The popu<lb break="no"/>Iation of Lower Canada about the time (by the census <lb/>
of 1844) was 690,892, while that of Upper Canada (in <lb/>
1842) was but 486 255, and it will be seen that if the <lb/>
principle of representation according to population <lb/>
were then adopted, Lower Canada would have a vast <lb/>
majority in the House of Assembly; but that right was <lb/>
conceded to Lower Canada. Upper Canada possessing <lb/>
an extensive and fertile territory unoccupied, soon at<lb break="no"/>tracted a considerable stream of emigration, and ra<lb break="no"/>pidly increased in population and wealth, so that now, <lb/>
the population of that part of the country is 1,395,222 <lb/>
against the 1,166,148 of Lower Canada. Upper <lb/>
Canada, therefore, now exceeds Lower Canada in point <lb/>
of population, as much as the latter exceeded the <lb/>
former at the time of the Union. No sooner did the <lb/>
Upper Canadians find themselves considerably strong<lb break="no"/>er in point of numbers than they demanded represent<lb break="no"/>ation according to population, in the hope that, having <lb/>
obtained that end, the institutions, laws, nationality, <lb/>
and religion of the Lower Canadiars would be at <lb/>
their mercy and under their control. George Brown, <lb/>
the arch-bigot of Upper Canada, did not hesitate to <lb/>
declare publicly that this became a public necessity, <lb/>
for the reasons just mentioned, and by indulging in <lb/>
the grossest abuse of everything Cathoic inflamed the <lb/>
minds of the people on the one side and the other. <lb/>
The French and the other Catholics of Lower Canada <lb/>
very correctly answered the Upper Canadians to this <lb/>
effect:—'At the time of the Union our majority over <lb/>
you was over two hundred thousand, and hid the <lb/>
principle of representation by population, which you <lb/>
now seek to establish, been then coaceded to us, we <lb/>
would long have had a large majority in the House <lb/>
of Assembly, and our political status would have now <lb/>
been better than it is. That privilege was denied us, <lb/>
and you entered the Union with the understanding <lb/>
that we were to continue to have an equal number <lb/>
of representatives. We both had to agree to it under <lb/>
an Imperial enactment, and it is now part of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of our country., While we had a majority <lb/>
you claimed and received an equality of representation <lb/>
and the rule which was applied to you then should <lb/>
equally apply to us now. With your hereditary hatred <lb/>
of our laws, our institutions, and, what is dearer to <lb/>
us, our religion; with your strong, numerous, and <lb/>
well-organized body of Orangemen and others equally <lb/>
desirous to curtail our rights, if not trample us out of <lb/>
existence, we will not agree to give you the power <lb/>
which will enable you to do so while the constitution <lb/>
and the laws of the country and our own position in <lb/>
the Legislature protect us. We are tired of your com<lb break="no"/>pany, as we have received nothing but injustice at <lb/>
your hands since the Union. If you are not prepared <lb/>
to carry out the arrangement upon which we became <lb/>
united, let us take steps to sever the connection. Let <lb/>
us again become two separate provinces, each having <lb/>
its own Legislature and Government. We are both <lb/>
powerful, and we may be both prosperous and happy <lb/>
under separate Governments.' It will be seen that, in <lb/>
this respect, Lower Canada had both right and justice <lb/>
on her side, but Upper Canada was not content to <lb/>
separate. Leading men continued to agitate the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of representation according to population. Sev<lb break="no"/>eral governments were form d within a limited number <lb/>
of years, but they were destined to rule the country <lb/>
but for brief periods. At last the danger was that no <lb/>
efficient government could be formed, and that Upper <lb/>
Canada would not get the system of representation <lb/>
which she desired. Mr George Brown, ever-watchful <lb/>
to effect the darling object of his life, saw that if the <lb/>
proposed union of New Brunswick, Prince Edward <lb/>
Island and Nova Scotia could be defeated, and a more <lb/>
comprehensive one could be effected, to include Can<lb break="no"/>ada, his mission would be complete. And that then <lb/>
Lower Canada as well as the other provinces would be <lb/>
very soon under the absolute control of Upper Canada <lb/>
and that his dear Orangemen would have it all their <lb/>
own way. He came to Charlottetown where it appears <lb/>
that he met more than one sympathiser, and the only <lb/>
union which the delegates were authorized by the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent Legislatures to effect was abandoned. Brown <lb/>
got our delegates to follow him to Canada, where they <lb/>
met with a continued ovation; and no doubt every <lb/>
glass of champagne which they swallowed brightened <lb/>
the prospects of Upper Canadian ascendancy, and <lb/>
assured the Toronto Orangemen that they may reason<lb break="no"/>ably expect soon to occupy a position, not only to hiss <lb/>
and insult a Prince of Wales with impunity, but to <lb/>
beard the British Lion in his den if he decsides to <lb/>
carry out their behests and trample on the religious <lb/>
feelings and rights of millions of loyal British subjects. <lb/>
To carry the scheme successfully into operation, it <lb/>
became necessary to declare Lower Canada, nominally, <lb/>
a separate province, with the expenses incident to a <lb/>
government and legislature, but without the power <lb/>
which legitimately belong to them; and Nova Scotia, <lb/>
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had to be <lb/>
thrown into the scale, just in such a manner as was <lb/>
necessary to effect the union and sabserve Canadian <lb/>
interests." <lb/></p>

<p>MAIL INTELLIGENCE. <lb/></p> 

<p>(From Willmer and Smith's European Times, April 1.) <lb/></p> 

<p>A great and unexpected calamity has overtaken the <lb/>
a.º. town of É. Qne of the oldest, <lb/>
and, in the judgment of a large portion of the inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants, one ºf the most staple provincial, banks-bas <lb/>
closed its doors, never to re-open them, failed to the <lb/>
ºnt ºf a million sterling; and this has occurred at <lb/>
a time when the tendency to gloomy apprehensions in <lb/>
the Money Market is greater than it has been for sev<lb break="no"/>eral years past—greater than the gloºm in the vely <lb/>
dept of the Crimean war, ten years ago.or.in the midst <lb/>
of the Indian mutiny. An incident like this, occurring <lb/>
at such a time, produces influitely more mischief than <lb/>
it would have caused when the funds were steadier, <lb/>
and mens' minds less oppressed by considerations <lb/>
about the future. One of the partners in this unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate establishment—it dates as far back as the last <lb/>
century—was well known as a prominent member of <lb/>
what is called the Exeter-hall School of Theology, <lb/>
whose annual motion about the Government grant to <lb/>
Maynooth generally emptied the House of Commons. <lb/>
But the uneasiness caused by the failure of the Bank <lb/>
has been a little lessened by the announcement that <lb/>
the assets are likely to amount to ten or twelve shil<lb break="no"/>lings in the pound. <lb/></p> 

<p>The distress amongst the cotton operatives in Lan<lb break="no"/>cashire is st li considerable. The number relieved by <lb/>
the unions on the 4th March, the tims when the last <lb/>
returns were made up, was 100,322. In the corres<lb break="no"/>ponding week of 1864, the number was 138,432; <lb/>
as compared with the working population the number <lb/>
then relieved amounted to seven per cent, and at <lb/>
present the number is five per cent. Local charity <lb/></p> 

<p>was largely employed then, and is still, to aid the <lb/></p> 

<p>poor. One fact came out which bears a painful signi<lb break="no"/>ficance, namely, that out of four men in the cotton dis<lb break="no"/>tricts who are said to be "able-bodied," only one is <lb/>
fit to work at a hill side or on public works. A state<lb break="no"/>ment like this shows the enervating effect of the mills <lb/>
on the physical system of those who labour in them. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Queen of Spain was really in earnest in offering <lb/>
to present the magnificent domains of the Crown to <lb/>
the nation, for the purpose, as far as possible, of re<lb break="no"/>trieving the public credit. Such conduct, it must be <lb/>
confessed, is very unusual amongst crowned heads; but <lb/>
it must be remembered that the Queen's mother is one <lb/>
of the richest women in Europe. Has this fortunate <lb/>
parent been consulted about the excess of liberality, <lb/>
or has the reigning Sovereign come to the decision by <lb/>
her own generous impulses P. The latter, we believe, <lb/>
will turn out to be the fact. <lb/></p> 

<p>Prussia, by her selfishness in the affair of the <lb/>
Duchies, has disgusted the two great empires of Aus<lb break="no"/>tria and Russia, and the trio of royal brothers appear <lb/>
likely to quarrel, like so many housebreakers, over <lb/>
the division of the ill-obtained booty. Austria, being <lb/>
the pet of Federal Germany, has emphatically pro<lb break="no"/>tested against the proposed arrangement, which is <lb/>
quite irreconcilable with the creation of a really inde<lb break="no"/>pendent Federal German State; and Russia has a <lb/>
grievance of her own in the shape of a pledge, the <lb/>
violation of which by Prussia is said to have caused <lb/>
intense disrust at St. Petersburg. It is now declared <lb/>
that the Autocrat of the North was induced to wink <lb/>
at the dismemberment of Denmark by the offer that <lb/>
when the war was over, certain frontier districts in the <lb/>
Grand Duchy of Posen should be ceded to him, but <lb/></p> 

<p>Prussia having over, eached Austris, is now equally <lb/></p> 

<p>unmindful of her pledge to the Russian Bear. Good <lb/>
faith has not always been the characteristic of <lb/>
Princes, and this is a remarkable proof of their want of <lb/>
faith in each other. <lb/></p> 

<p>There has been no debate in the House ef Commons, <lb/>
for several years, which will excite more general at<lb break="no"/>tention on the western shores of the Atlantic than the <lb/>
one which occurred in that assembly on the evening <lb/>
of the 13, h inst. It related to Canada and its de<lb break="no"/>fences; but it opened up still greater questions—our <lb/>
relations with Federal America and the policy which <lb/>
Engi.nd is bound to pursue with regard to the latter <lb/>
country. In this debate the Secre ary for the Col<lb break="no"/>onies, Mr. Cardwell, took part: so did Lord Palmer<lb break="no"/>ston: so also did Mr. Seymour Fitzgerald, the Un<lb break="no"/>der Secretary for Foreign Affºrs in the last Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive Government; and so did Mr. Disraeli, the Con<lb break="no"/>servative leader of the Tory party in the Lower Cham<lb break="no"/>ber. However much these gentlemen may usually <lb/>
differ on the great public questions of the day, noth<lb break="no"/>ing could exceed the expressed desire of one and all <lb/>
to preserve, if we can, amicable relations with the <lb/>
Government of which President Lincoln is the accept<lb break="no"/>eq chief. But there were other speakers-Mr. Fos<lb break="no"/>ter, a rising member of the Radigaſ party, Ms. Bright, <lb/>
its head—and several others. Here, then, were the <lb/>
representatives of Whigism, as personified in the ex<lb break="no"/>isting Government; of Toryism, as we may expect to <lb/>
find it reflected in the Government that is to come; <lb/>
and of the thinking men and astute politicians, who, <lb/>
agreeing with neither, consider strong common sense <lb/>
and worldly wisdom to be very efficient substitutes for <lb/>
the craft of statesmanship. These eminent men, with <lb/>
scarcely an exception, wish for the continuance of <lb/>
peace, and can see no cause why peace should not be <lb/>
preserved, if reason, and not passion rules the hour. <lb/></p>

<p>The New CARDINAL.-I am enabled to state that <lb/>
there is no truth whatever in a paragraph which has <lb/>
been going the round of the papers with reference to <lb/>
the episcopal and other arrangements which have to be <lb/>
made in consequence of the death of the Cardinal Arch<lb break="no"/>bishop of Westminster. All predicuons on the point <lb/>
are idle, as the chapter which met to select three inadºes <lb/>
to be forwarded to Rome from which the Supreme <lb/>
Pontiff might, if so minded, select a successor to <lb/>
Cardinal Wiseman, were all solemnly sworn to secrecy, <lb/>
and it is quite impossible for outsiders to learn the <lb/>
facts. I may state, however, as in some degree con<lb break="no"/>nected with the subject, though not in any way with <lb/>
the duties or functions of the Chapter of Westminster, <lb/>
that the Hon and Rev. Mr. Talbot will, in all proba<lb break="no"/>bility, be raised to the dignity of a Cardinal Prince of <lb/>
the Church. The hon and rev gentleman (who is <lb/>
brother of the popular Lord Talbot de Malahide) has <lb/>
long held a high official appointment at the Court of <lb/>
Rome. He is also the personal friend of his Holiness <lb/>
the Pope, who has the most perfect reiiance in his <lb/>
judgment and general knowledge of affair; at Rome. <lb/>
His elevation to the Cardinalate will be hailed with <lb/>
satisfaction not only in Rome, where his learning and <lb/>
amiability have endeared ulu to all classes, but also in <lb/>
the Uni.éd Kingdoin, where his erudition and piety are <lb/>
well known.—Freeman's London Correspondent. <lb/></p>

purpose, at any point agree ble to you, for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of arranging definitely the terms upon which the <lb/>

General,—I received at a late hour your no.e of ta<lb break="no"/>day in answer to mine of yesterday. I did not intend <lb/>
to propose the surrender of the Army of Northern Wir. <lb/>
ginia, but to ask the terms of yo ºr propolition. To be <lb/>
trank I do not think the emergency has arisen to call <lb/>
for the surrender, but as the 1e toration of peace should <lb/>
be the sole object of all, I desire to know whether <lb/>
your proposals would tend to that end. I cannot, <lb/>
therefore, meet you with a view to surrender the army <lb/>
of Northern Virginia, but as far as your proposition <lb/>
may affect the Confederate States forces under my <lb/>
command and tend to the restoration of peace, I <lb/>
should be pleased to meet you at 10 A.M. to-morrow, <lb/>
on the Old Stage Road to Richmond, between the <lb/>
picket lines of the two armies. <lb/>
Very respectfully, <lb/>
º. obedient Servant, <lb/>
R. E. LEE, Gen. C. S. A. <lb/></p> 

<p>April 9–To Gen. Lee, commanding Confederate <lb/>
States armies—General,—Your note of yesterday is <lb/>
received. As I have no authority to treat on the <lb/>
subject of peace the meeting proposed for 10 A.M. <lb/>
to day could lead to no good. I will state however, <lb/>
General, that I am .." anxious for peace with <lb/>
yourself, and the whole North entertain the same <lb/>
feeling. The terms upon which peace can be had are <lb/>
well understood. By the South laying down their <lb/>
arms they will hasten that most desirable event, save <lb/>
thousands of human lives and hundreds of millions of <lb/>
property, not yet destroyed. Sincerely hyping that <lb/>
all our difficulties may be settled without the lºss of <lb/>
another life I subscribe myself. <lb/>

ascertain what terms were embraced in your proposi<lb break="no"/>tion of yesterday with reference to the surrender of <lb/>
this army. I now request an interview in accordance <lb/>
with the offer contained in your letter of yesterday for <lb/>
that purpose. <lb/>

<p>THE PROFITS REALISED <lb/></p> 

<p>During the period from 25th May 1859 to 25th May <lb/>
1864, ascertained in the manner now explained,amount <lb/>
to the large sum of £73,581, 19s. stellirg, and the <lb/>

<p>The directors propose to divide the above sun of <lb/>
78,581, 19s, stellig, in the following proportions, <lb/>
between the Policy-holders and the Shareholders:— <lb/>
To the Policy-holders, <lb/>
To the Shareholders since last In­ <lb/></p> 

<p>#53,022 3 1: <lb/></p> 

<p>łocal proceedings. But in the case of any one who <lb/>
looks forward with prudent anxiety to the future, long <lb/>
deferred as the lifetime of an individual may be, th:: <lb/>
Colonial seek a preference as standing on a wider <lb/>
basis, their character and position being as well known <lb/>
and recognised in every British Colony as in Edin. <lb/>
burgh, London, or Dublin. <lb/>
... In coming to the resolution not to reduce Rates <lb/>
the Directors have proceeded on the advice of their . <lb/>
Actuºry, and the Investigation into the Company's <lb/>
Mortality has been the basis of that resolution. "It <lb/>
would be prematura to publish these curious and in. <lb/>
structive results, as the Directors are anxious to add <lb/>
to their experience before giving them to the world, <lb/>
but it may be stated that the proportion which the <lb/>
actual number of Deaths bore to the expected number <lb/>
had increased very consideratly during the period of <lb/>
five yers from 1859 to 1864, beyond that exhibited <lb/>
during the period of thirteen years from 1846 to 1859 <lb/>
-in Great Britain, in America, in the East Indies . <lb/>
(civil life,) in Ceylon, and in the West Indies—show<lb break="no"/>ing that the Mortality increases relatively in a greater <lb/>
degree as a Company advances in age, -taat is to say, <lb/>
the Mortality among lives which have been connected <lb/>
with the Company for ten, fifteen, or twenty years, <lb/>
will be increasingly greater than among lives of the <lb/>
same age in the first five years of their connection with <lb/>
the Company; or otherwise, that the mortality among <lb/>
a certain number of persons of the same age in the <lb/>
second, third, or fourth periods of five years respec<lb break="no"/>tively, after joining the Institution, will have gradual<lb break="no"/>ly increased, affording less favourable results as we <lb/>
recede from the period at which the lives were ex<lb break="no"/>cepted, <lb/>It is on these grounds that the Directors have de<lb break="no"/>clined to reduce their Rates. These Rates were <lb/>
originally adopted after much study and much inquiry, <lb/>
No Institution has had access to better sources of <lb/>
nformation than the Colonial, and the Directors have <lb/>
determined not to run any hazard for the purpose of <lb/>
popularity or to swell their amount of business. <lb/>
These are the results of the Investigation, and the <lb/>
Directors hope they may now return to the chord first <lb/>
struck as the key-note of their Report, and repeat their <lb/>
congratulations on the success which has attended the . <lb/>
Uompany's operations during the last five years, as <lb/>
well as during the whole period of the Company's <lb/>
existence, <lb/>By Order of the Directors, <lb/>

<p>The sum of £53,022, 3s. 1d. sterling, apportioned <lb/>
to Policy-holders, will give them an Annual Bonus of <lb/>
£1 10s, sterling per cent. for each year since last In<lb break="no"/>Westigation, or for each year the Pºlicy has existed in <lb/>
the case of those which may have been opered since <lb/>
25th May 1859, and the Directors are happy to be able <lb/>
to continue this rate, which was that given at the last <lb/>
Investgation in 1859. They have on this occasion <lb/>
again given the subject of Division of Profits with <lb/>
reference to the different classes of risks their most <lb/>
serious attention; but aſter reviewing it carefully, and <lb/>
hearing the views of the Actuary on the subject, they <lb/>
ºre satisfied that the addition of a reversionary sum <lb/>
for each premium pºd is as fait a method in the <lb/>
circumstances of the case as could be adopted. <lb/>
Before concluding, the Directors think it necessary <lb/>
to ask your particular attention, to the Statements <lb/>
elerred to in a previous part of this Report, relating <lb/>
9 the Mortality of the Company, as bearing more par<lb break="no"/>on the rates charged for Assurance. <lb/>
irectors have been frequently urged to re<lb break="no"/>duce their Rates for various climates, and they have: <lb/>
* they were bound to do, given these appeals their <lb/>
Fost serious consideration; but after weighing well <lb/>

<p>"We have the honor to submit, for the consideration <lb/>
    of Her Majesty's Government, that the Governor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral of Canada, <hi rendition="simple:italic">acting under the advice of his responsible <lb/>
advisers</hi>, has been pleased to recommend that the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of a federative union of the Provinces of British <lb/>
North America should form the subject of discussion by <lb/>
delegates from each Province, to be appointed under the <lb/>
orders of Her Majesty's Government; and we have been <lb/>
    instructed to urge the importance of his step, <hi rendition="simple:italic">as well <lb/>
upon grounds peculiar to Canada</hi>, as from considerations <lb/>
affecting the interests of the other colonies and of the <lb/>
whole Empire. <lb/></p> 

        <p>"It is our duty to state, <hi rendition="simple:italic">that very grave difficulties now <lb/>
present themselves in conducting the government of Can<lb break="no"/>ada in such a manner as to shew due regard to the wishes <lb/>
of us numerous population</hi>. The union of Lower and <lb/>
Upper Canada was based upon a perfect equality being <lb/>
preserved between these Provinces, a condition the more <lb/>
necessary from the differences in their respec ive lan<lb break="no"/>guages, laws, and religion—and although there is never <lb/>
            a large Fnglish ponulation in Lower Canada, <hi rendition="simple:italic">still there <lb/>
differences erist which perent any perfect and complete <lb/>
assimilation of the views of the two sections</hi>. <lb/></p> 

<p>"At the time of tue union act, Lower Canada pot<lb break="no"/>sessed a much larger population than Upper Canada; <lb/>
but this produced no difficulty in the government of the <lb/>
united Povinces under that act; since that period, how<lb break="no"/>ever, the progress of population has been more rapid <lb/>
in the western section, and claims are now, made on <lb/>
behalf of is inhabitants for giving them representation <lb/>
in the Legislature in proportions to their numbers— <lb/>
which claims, involving, it is believed, a most serious <lb/>
        
        <cb/>
        
interference with the principle upon which the union was <lb/>
based, have been and are stennously resisted by Lower <lb/>
Canada. The result as shewn by an agitation, fraught <lb/>
with great danger to the peaceful and harmonious work<lb break="no"/>ing of our Constitutional system, and consequently, <lb/>
detrimental to the progress of the Province. <lb/>
        </p> 
        

<p>"The necessity of providing a remedy for a state of <lb/>
things that is yearly becoming worse, and of sllaying <lb/>
feelings that are being daily aggravated by the conten<lb break="no"/>tion of political parties, has impressed the advisers of <lb/>     
Her Majesty's Representative in Canada with the im<lb break="no"/>portance of seeking for such a mode of dealing with their <lb/>
difficulties as may forever remove them. In this view, <lb/>
it has appeared to them advisable to consider how far <lb/>
the Union of Lower with Upper Canada could be ren<lb break="no"/>dered essentially federative, in combination with the <lb/>
Provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfound. <lb/>
land, and Prince Edward Island, together with such <lb/>
other territories as it may be hereafter desirable to in<lb break="no"/>corporate with such Confederation, from the Possessions <lb/>
of the Crown in British North Amerca. <lb/></p>  

<p>"The undersigned are convinced that Her Majesty's <lb/>
Government will be fully alive to the grave nature of <lb/>
the circumstances referred to, which, are stated by them <lb/>
under the full responsibility of their position as advisers <lb/>
of the Crown in Canada. They are satisfied that the <lb/>
time has arrived for a constitutional discussion of all <lb/> 
means whereby the evils of internal dissensions may be <lb/>
avoided in such an important aependency of the Empire <lb/>
as Canada." <lb/></p>

<p>These extracts let in a flood of light upon the Con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme, and clearly show that the interests <lb/>
of the Maritime Colonies were to be made subservient <lb/>
to effect the ascendency of Upper over Lower Canada. <lb/>
If the people of Newfoundland were so besotted as to <lb/>
give up their independent position, and the government <lb/>
of their country to Canada, they must consent to be sub<lb break="no"/>jected to a state of taxation hitherto unknown in this <lb/>
Colony. We are already taxed at the rate of about five <lb/>
dollars a head. By one of the Quebec Resolutions, <lb/>
signed by the Newfoundland Delegates, the General, or <lb/>
Canadian Government, sitting at Ottawa, are empowered <lb/>
to levy taxes on the people in every shape and in every <lb/>
form, and upon property of every description, thus the <lb/>
fisherman's craft and gear, and the farmer's land and <lb/>
stock, as well es that of the tradesman, will all alike be <lb/>
subject to taxation;—nay the Canadian Government <lb/>
may even, if they like, impose an income tax, or an ex<lb break="no"/>port tax; upon our fish and oil. The <lb/>
supporters of the Confederate scheme, and particularly <lb/>
our so-called Delegates, affect to smile at our fears of <lb/>
taxation. If we are taxed at all; they say the impost <lb/>
will be so-light as to be almost imperceptible. I en<lb break="no"/>tirely disagree with them. Any tax on this colony, <lb/>
however light, could not be borne, in addition to the <lb/>
taxes under which the people already labour. Look at <lb/>
the hardship now felt and expressed in consequence of <lb/>
the water-rates; and if the comparatively small burden <lb/>
of the Water Company be almost unbearable, how will <lb/>
the enormous taxes which, as a member of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, this Colony must pay for the sustenation of the <lb/>
General Government, be eudured? As to the extent of <lb/>
taxation to which we should undoubtedly be liable, let <lb/>
us hear what Judge Marshall says upon the subject. In <lb/>
a phamphlet on Confederation, Mr. Marshall says:— <lb/></p>
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>
"This rate, when so made, may look small, by an <lb/>
addition of 2 or 5 per cent; but it must be remembered <lb/>
    that when it is so estimated,—it includes all in poor or <lb/>
destitute circumstances, even every pauper and begging <lb/>
child throughout the land. Deduct first, thousands of <lb/>
all those who pay nothing of the duty, as they are con<lb break="no"/>sumers of very little, if any, of the articles on which the <lb/>
    duties are imposed. Then divide the rest of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion into families; and supposed each of these be com<lb break="no"/>posed of six persons—the usual estimate—the husband, <lb/>
wife, and four children, all dependent on the labour of <lb/>
the man. Apply this estimate to our population of <lb/>
about 340,000, and it will be seen that there are about <lb/>
56,000 families; and according to the admitted estimate <lb/>
of $3,60c for each one of our population, the amount of <lb/>
duty on each head of a family, instead of $2,60c is <lb/>
$13. Then add 5 per cent to the 10 at present, <lb/>
making 15 per cent, and there will be $6 50c in<lb break="no"/>crease, either important additon to the expense <lb/>
of the small farmer, and trademen, and others of the <lb/>
working class, whose payment of duties, instead of <lb/>
$13, will thus be $19 50c. These are plain estimates <lb/>
and conclusions of facts, and which all may comprehend; <lb/>
and which none, by any sophistries or fallacies, can con<lb break="no"/>trovert or explain away. And moreover, as Canada, <lb/>
from its embarrassed circumstances, cannot afford to <lb/>
reduce its taxation to 15 per cent, but must remain at <lb/>
20, ours must be the same, which would make $6 60c <lb/>
more, making the whole tax on each head of a family, <lb/>
throughout our whole population, $26, or £6 10s. But <lb/>
    when it is considered that there will inevitably be in<lb break="no"/>creased taxation for the inter-colonial railway—the ex<lb break="no"/>penses of the General Parliament and Government at <lb/>
    Ottawa—for canal extensions and improvements—all in <lb/>
    Canada—also for fortifications, many hundreds of miles <lb/>
    along the great rivers and lakes of Canada—for a navy <lb/>
of some respectable, adequate number, on those lakes; <lb/>
and for a like adequate military force in each of the <lb/>
Province; besides for many miscellaneous and expensive <lb/>
sevices, the whole taxation on each head of a family—as <lb/>
already given—can scarcely be that $40 or £10. It <lb/>
is true, it will be paid by what is call indirect taxation, <lb/>
or increased prices of the articles on which duties are <lb/>
imposed; but the expense to the man is the same.— <lb/> 
* * We are told by the advocates for Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion that we should think of our posterity and secure a <lb/>
heritage or our chidren. Well as this is right enough, <lb/>
to a certain extent; and it is right the living, acting per<lb break="no"/>sons of this generation, should look to their present <lb/>
interests. If, they neglect these, and suffer themselves <lb/>
to be placed at the mercy of extravagant Canadian poli<lb break="no"/>ticians, who have brought their own country into deep <lb/>
embarrassment, and will bring themselves under heavy <lb/>
and appressive taxation, they will have but a poor ber<lb break="no"/>itage for their posterity, even that of the same or even <lb/>
greater burdens. There is also held furth, in support of <lb/>
Confedation; visions of what is called "prestige," or a <lb/>
name of greatness for the country to which, by that <lb/>
change, we shall be said to belong. But these are but <lb/>
visions, and if realized, will be a sorry compensation for <lb/>
that heavy increase of taxation and other evils. Such <lb/>
visions, realized or not, will not answer in the place of <lb/>
bread and other necessaries for a family, or avert embar<lb break="no"/>rassments or want. * * The Canadian rulers, for a <lb/>
course of years, instead of increasing general taxation by <lb/>
duties on importations, and thereby so enlarging their rev<lb break="no"/>enue,as to coine moderately near meeting their extravagant <lb/>
and often corrupt expenditures, have gone on borrowing <lb/>
money for those purposes, until, in that way, their debt <lb/>
became so ruinous as it now is, and almost ruined their <lb/>
    credit, But, in the meantime, they kept their popula<lb break="no"/>tion tolerably quiet, as they were not feeling any burden<lb break="no"/>some weight of taxation,—partly through there being so

<cb/>

many articles imported free of duty. This is a common <lb/>
expedient, and for a time a seccessful one, with corrupt <lb/>
or extravagant public ruler. By the proposed Confede<lb break="no"/>ration, the General Parliament and Government will <lb/>
have the power to borrow money to any extent fot public <lb/>
purposes, and as they will require very large sums for <lb/>
the numerous service and objects already specified, and <lb/>
as thier credit will be low, owing to their present enor<lb break="no"/>mous debt, they will, in order to raise funds for these ob<lb break="no"/>jects, be obliged to resort to greatly increased taxation, <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">indirect</hi> or <hi rendition="simple:italic">direct</hi>, or both; and we shall have to pay our <lb/>
part of it, equally with Canada. They are to have, in <lb/>
addition to Customs, and Excise duties, the power of <lb/>
'raising money by all or any other modes or systems of <lb/>
    taxation.' They may, therefore, lay it upon the <hi rendition="simple:italic">head</hi>, <lb/>
    the <hi rendition="simple:italic">farm</hi>, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">house</hi>, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">ship</hi>, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">mill</hi>, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">stock</hi>, the <lb/>

    </quote>
<p>Hon. Gentlemen in favor of Confederation, have ran<lb break="no"/>sacked even ancient English history as far back as the <lb/>
Heptarchy, to shew us the advantage States have derived <lb/>
from union; but I do not think they have been happy <lb/>
in their references. "It has been so long a common <lb/>
saying, and made applicable to every subject (<choice><sic>savs</sic><corr>save</corr></choice> the <lb/>
writer whom I have before quoted) that union is strength; <lb/>
that it has come to be thought by most persons a maxim <lb/>
universally and invariably true. On the contrary, how<lb break="no"/>ever, in many cases instead of being a cause of power, it <lb/>
is one of weakness, decay and ultimate dissolution; and <lb/>
partial or general injuries and unhappiness. This is <lb/>
especially, and, indeed, almost universally true, in in<lb break="no"/>stances of a national or political nature, where the ele<lb break="no"/>ments or chief constituent parts of the Union are of an <lb/>
incongruous or dissimilar description, as to country; reli<lb break="no"/>gion, pecuniary or other interests; and in the habits of <lb/>
life. This has been nearly the result of the Union be<lb break="no"/>tween Upper and Lower Canada, and would undoubtedly <lb/>
be the case on a wider scale, if a Confederation of the <lb/>
Maritime Colonics was consummated. It would lay the <lb/>
basis of strifes and contentions unknown to us at present; <lb/>
our sectional Legislatures—or state parliaments—would <lb/>
be in constant antagonism and general discontent would <lb/>
prevade the peoples of the maritime states, until, perhaps, <lb/>
as a remedy for the evil, the yoke of Canada would be <lb/>
thrown off, and annexation to the neighboring Republic <lb/>
preferred." The reference to Scotland is equally as ab<lb break="no"/>surd as that of the Heptarchy—there is no possible simi<lb break="no"/>larity in the Canadian scheme and the union of Scotland <lb/>
with England—and even if there were, it is a question <lb/>
whether Scotland would not be better off to-day than she <lb/>
is, if she were governed by her own Legislature, without <lb/>
the interference of the General Government, "The case <lb/>
of Scotland (says a colonial writer) to which the advo<lb break="no"/>cates of Confederation are so fond of referring, differs <lb/>
very widely from ours. England. Scotland, and Wales <lb/>
do not form an unwidely, nor even a large country, taken <lb/>
altogether, and the inducements offered to the Scotch at <lb/>
the time of the Union were very much greater than any <lb/>
now offered to us. At that time the policy of England <lb/>
was almost the very reverse of what it now is. Not only <lb/>
did it not allow foreign nations to trade with its colonies<lb/>
and foreign possessions, but it would not allow Scotland, <lb/>
although a part of the empire, to share the trade. Scot<lb break="no"/>land, eager for a Colonial trade, had essayed the work of <lb/>
colonization on its own behalf, sending costly expeditions <lb/>
to the Istmus of Darien. and, we believe, to the coast of <lb/>
Africa also, to found other colonies. These proved <lb/>
most disastrous failures. The commercial community of <lb/>
Scotland had also engaged largely in some of the wild <lb/>
speculations of the period, and were much embarrassed in <lb/>
consequence. The Union offered them not merely the <lb/>
right to trade with England, where they could hope to <lb/>
sell little, but with all the English possessions. To a <lb/>
trading people this was a great temptaion. Of the bene<lb break="no"/>fits to result from such an expansion of trade there could <lb/>
be no doubt. Swarms of the feedy aristocracy of Scot<lb break="no"/>landhad followed James to the English Court, and learn<lb break="no"/>ed to long for some better share in the wealth of that <lb/>
country than the favoritism of that Monarch, or his de<lb break="no"/>cendents, could give them. The Scotch aristocracy were, <lb/>
to a very great extent, in favor of the Union. Yet the <lb/>
people of Scotland—the vast majority of the people—<lb/>
were opposed to the measure, which was carried by bribe<lb break="no"/>ry, corruption and fraud. Amidst all these evil practi<lb break="no"/>ces, however, the advocates of the Union preserved at <lb/>
least the semblance of constitutional action. The first <lb/>
step was to appoint through Parliament Commissioners to <lb/>
consider the terms of the Union, which were afterwards sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the Parliament for approval. Self-appointed <lb/>
delegates did not in that case undertake so great a work. <lb/>
But it is said we will do better than Scotland did; we will <lb/>
have representaion according to population, which Scot<lb break="no"/>land did not obtain. True; but Scotland was really no <lb/> 
party to a measure of which almost the whole people dis<lb break="no"/>approval, and which was carried by the most corrupt <lb/>
means. And it was specially provided that Scotland was <lb/>
to be taxed less than England. The elements of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation then taken into account were population, pro<lb break="no"/>bable wealth and revenue. In our case if we go into <lb/>
Confederation we will pay more taxes then the people of <lb/>
Canada, and have only equal representation according to <lb/>
numbers; while the benefits offered to us are at best <lb/>       
but small and doubtful when compared to those then <lb/>
offered to Scotland. The only trade offered to us is a <lb/>
trade merely in domestic manufactures. But is the pre<lb break="no"/>sent condition of Scotland owing to the Act of Union? <lb/>
Would it not be as well off to-day, if not better off, were <lb/>
its own Parliament and Government sitting in Edinburgh? <lb/>
Those who refer to the state of Scotland look only at the <lb/>
busy factories and shipyards in the Clyde, and in a few <lb/>
other districts. They never speak of the depopulation of <lb/>
the Highlands, from which so many of the clans were <lb/>
driven, to make room for deer and grouse, for sheep. The <lb/>
Act of Union, which, in course of time, made men an in<lb break="no"/>cumbrance on these mountains, led directly to the con<lb break="no"/>version of that part of Scotland into a wilderness; but it <lb/>
would he hard to prove that the people of the Lowlands <lb/>
would be less active, less industrious, less enterprising <lb/>
than they now are, if they had their own Parliament as <lb/>
we have, and were at the same time at liberty to trade <lb/>
with all the world as we are. Scotland pays a larger am<lb break="no"/>ount of taxation. Can any of the advocates of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation tell how much of that taxation is expended in Scot<lb break="no"/>land, and how mucn is taken off to add to the wealth of <lb/>
England? Can any one tell where the Imperial <lb/>
dockyard, or foundry, or manufactory of arms is to be <lb/>
found in Scotland? The Imperial protection is, perhaps, <lb/>
an equivalent for the money taken from the country; but <lb/>
would we like to to see all the revenue raised in this <lb/>
province for all time to come transferred to the same <lb/>
way to Ottawa, and expended in Canada? The advocates <lb/>
of Confederation say it would stop the emigration of <lb/>
young men from the Provinces. Did the union stop the <lb/>
emigration from Scotland? Did it not rather give <lb/>
that emigration an impetus which it teel to this day, so <lb/>
that except ireland—another country deprived of is <lb/>
Legislause independence—no country in Europe sends <lb/>
out so macy emigrarts in proportion to its population? <lb/>
The case of Scotland proves nothing in favor of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration" </p>

<p>If Scotland, proves nothing in favour of Union, <lb/>
what does the state of Ireland and the contition of <lb/>
her people prove? Has not the Union of Ireland <lb/>
with England proved the greatest curse that ever <lb/>
afflicted a noble and brave and generous people? Did <lb/>
not the great O'Connell wear out the best years of his <lb/>
life in his endeavours to obtain a repeal of that odious <lb/>
compact in view? Were not some of her most talent<lb break="no"/>ad sons not many years sine —aye, even Mr. McGee <lb/>
himself—driven by law from the land of their birth as <lb/>
felons, for protesting against the injustice of her Con<lb break="no"/>federate sister England, and ought not the social con<lb break="no"/>dition of that unfortunate country for the last cen<lb break="no"/>tury to stand out in bold relief as a warning to us to <lb/>
avoid this confederation scheme as fraught with untold <lb/>
dangers not only to the present generation, but to <lb/>
successive ones for all time to come. That Union <lb/>
was brought about by duplicity, bribery, and treach<lb break="no"/>ery, and if ever these colonies are compelled to wear <lb/>
the Canadian chain, it will only be by similar means; <lb/>
and here I will take the liberty of presenting an ex<lb type="no"/>tract in reference to the Union of Ireland with England <lb/>
from the pen (I think) of a Nova Scotia Statesman, <lb/>
rife in historic facts, couched in language far superior <lb/>
    to any that I could use:— <lb/></p>
    
<p>Was Ireland's connexion with England voluntary? <lb/>
No. Strongbow partially conquered the island in <lb/>
1169, and by slow degrees the country was overrun <lb/>
and mastered, till Henry the Eighth received from <lb/>
its Parliament the title of King of Ireland. How <lb/>
irksome an I hateful this domination was, is to be <lb/>
read in the whole dreary and bloody history of Ireland. <lb/>
The people were always ready to rise, and often did <lb/>
rise, to throw off the Saxon yoke. They were as often <lb/>
overpowered and trodden down. Then penal laws <lb/>
were enacted and enforced, under which every species <lb/>
of tyranny and injustice were perpetrated. Why need <lb/>
we dwell on the long and bloody record of mutual <lb/>
slaughter, perfidy, bigotry and confiscation? To be <lb/>
ruled by a people a long way off Mr. Tobin, must <lb/>
think a great luxury. Perhaps "distance lends en<lb break="no"/>chantment to the view." Cromwell's Ottawa was only <lb/>
330 miles away, yet he sold 20000 Irish as slaves in <lb/>
America, and drove 49,000 more into foreign service. <lb/>
What would he have done had the seat of his govern<lb break="no"/>ment been 500 miles further off? <lb/></p>

"The Parliament of Ireland, like the powerless <lb/>
Legislature which we are to retain, served to amuse <lb/>
the conquered country. So long as it was subservient <lb/>
to that of England, it was permitted to exist. But as <lb/>
soon as it began to show a national spirit, it was <lb/>
bought up, overawed, and wiped out of existence, as <lb/>
ours will be, if it ever dares to maintain the rights of <lb/>
Nova Scotia, and ceases to be servile and trueulent <lb/>
to the Grand Parliament of Ottawa. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
"But we are told that when the Union of the two <lb/>
countries became complete, Ireland began to pros<lb break="no"/>per, and that we should be encouraged by her exam<lb break="no"/>ple. In the first place let us show that we are not <lb/>
pressed by the necessities which compelled Ireland to <lb/>
surrender her Legislature. George Brown is not <lb/>
Strongbow, or Oliver Cromwell, or William the Third. <lb/>
The Upper Canadians have never conquered us. We <lb/>
are therefore under no necessity to surrender to them <lb/>
our Legislative independence, if we desire to retain it, <lb/>
Castlereagh's mode may be tried; but, if it is, let us <lb/>
hope there is virtue enough in Nova Saotia to resist <lb/>
the temptations. The Legislative Union, which we <lb/>
are asked to copy, was consummated in 1800. For <lb/>
64 years Ireland has enjoyed the supreme felicity of <lb/>
having her affairs managed by by a Government and <lb/>
Parliament only 300 miles off—What have been the <lb/>
results? Read them in the history of the dominant <lb/>
Church, fastened upon the Irish majority by the En<lb break="no"/>glish majority over the sea; read them in the tithe <lb/>
exactions, military enforcements of tithe, and murders <lb/>
of the proctors; read them in the hostile <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> of <lb/>
Orangemen and Ribbonmen—in the eternal divisions <lb/>
among the public men of the country that was sold, <lb/>
and by which the country that parchased has always <lb/>
been able to divide and rule Ireland at her good will <lb/>
and pleasure. <lb/></p>
        
<p>"We are told that the Canadas will quarrel among <lb/>
themselves, and that, we shall hold the balance of <lb/>
power. But let us take warning from history. How <lb/>
often have the Irish bean abla to do this? Only once <lb/>
in the whole dreary half century of their Union with <lb/>
    the stronger country—when O'Connell, a man of a <lb/>
style of mind rarely matured oftener than once in a <lb/>
hundred years, by the labor of a life; and by a combi<lb break="no"/>nation of popular qualities seldom controlled by a <lb/>
judgment so sagacious, succeeded in uniting his coun<lb break="no"/>trymen and dictating to the English Cabinet. But <lb/>
presently came divisions, and jealousies, and conceit<lb break="no"/>ed pretenders, and the Liberator's heart was broken; <lb/>
and since that time we have had Young Irelanders <lb/>
and premature insurrection; and then we have had <lb/>
brigades, and parliamentary combinations, broken or <lb/>
bought up almost as soon as formed; and now we <lb/>
    have the Belfast riots and Fenians, and secret socie<lb break="no"/>ties, foreign aud domestic,—the vague yearning of the <lb/>
national heart being ever for the restoration of that <lb/>
self-government which a few corrupt legislators bur<lb break="no"/>tered away. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
"If anybody wants to understand what Ireland I lost <lb/>
and how little she gained by the union, let him read <lb/>
her chequered stories of famines and fevers; of evic<lb break="no"/>tions and midnight murders; let him see her helpless <lb/>
minority strugling in Parliament, an her beggars <lb/>
wandering in the streets. Let him see her emigrants <lb/>
flooding by thousands and by millions from a country <lb/>
where patriotism brings no distinction, an I labor will <lb/>
bring no reward, and then let him come and ask Nova <lb/>
Scotians who have been thirty years struggling for <lb/>
self-government to go and follow her example. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
"We have examined the Parliamentary returns <lb/>
from 37 counties in Ireland to see how much richer <lb/>
the people of that country have become by having all <lb/>
their clever men, and rich men, drawing their revenues <lb/>
from the soil, spending them in London, which they <lb/>
do for eight or ten months at least, of almost every <lb/>
year. The rate of wages is lowest in Tipperary, where <lb/>
men earn on an average throughout the year but 5s. <lb/>
7d. per week, and highest in Roscommon, where they <lb/>
earn 10s. 2d. per week. For a short time in the spring, <lb/>
and for about a month in harvest, man can earn from <lb/>
12s. to 15s. per week, the highest rates being not more <lb/>
than half a laborer's wages in British America. The <lb/>
strog; woman of Ireland can earn from 3s 6d to 5s. <lb/>
per week for field work. Children unier sixteen years <lb/>
of age are hired at from 2s 6d to 3s 6d The common <lb/>
diet of the people is milk and potatoes.—They rarely <lb/>
eat meat or fish, and yet Ireland is naturally one of <lb/>
the most fertile, and is confessed one of the most <lb/>
beautiful countries in the world. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
"Now how is it that Irishmen can prosper in every <lb/>
country but their own? How is it that London has <lb/>
grown to be more than half as populous as Ireland? <lb/>
How is it that this city increased within the last ten <lb/>
years 19 per cent, or 440,788, while Ireland not only <lb/>
did not increase at all, oat had a less population by <lb/>
787,842, in 1861, than it had ten years before? The <lb/>
answer is not far to seek. The union draws every <lb/>
eminent and every aimbitious man out of Ireland and <lb/>
up to London, for eight or ten months in the year; <lb/>
the wealthy and fashionable take the same road. Their <lb/>
routs and revenues go after then, so that there is a <lb/>
perpetual drain out of Ireland and into England, as <lb/>
there will be out of Nova Scotia and into Canada, so <lb/>
soon as like causes produce the state effects. The fox, <lb/>
when invited to the lion's banquet, paused when he <lb/>
saw all the tracks of other animals leading into the <lb/>

<cb/>

den, and none of them conng back. Let us pause, <lb/>
            <hi rendition="simple:italic">there are millions of Irishmen's tracks to guide us</hi>, <lb/>
all going one way, and bones enough, God knows, <lb/>
mouldering all over the world to show what has be<lb break="no"/>come of the victims. <lb/></p>

"But we are told that the railroad would counteract <lb/>
and cure all this centralization. Would it? How many <lb/>
lines of fine railroads and steamsrs connect Ireland with <lb/>
            England—but what then? Everything goes from the <lb/>
circumference to the centre, and not from the centre <lb/>
to the circumference. Don't let us be gulled about the <lb/>
railroad, which would be a very useful thing to have <lb/>
on fair terms, but we have lived and prospered with<lb break="no"/>out it, and we would rather never see it built if we <lb/>
can only have it at the cost of our most sacred rights <lb/>

        <p>
Our "isolated condition" is alleged as another rea<lb break="no"/>son why we should join the Confederation. There are <lb/>
few colonies in the world less isolated than this island. <lb/>
We have free communications with almost every part <lb/>
of the globe; a union with Canada could not possibly <lb/>
increase our facilities in this respect; we are already <lb/>
part and parcel of the United Kingdoms of Great <lb/>
Britain and Ireland, and wherever the "Meteor flag" <lb/>
of Elglund flowrs, we have free access wind the fullest <lb/>
protection. The ships of oar merchants carry our <lb/>
produce. The "world is all before us, where to <lb/>
choose," and any one anong us, if he desire it, and <lb/>
can afford it, has opportunities to proceed to any part <lb/>
of the world that may suit his fancy. How, in this <lb/>
respect, then, can a union with, Cunada better our <lb/>
condition? It would open up a field, say its advocates, <lb/>
for our young men. The field for our young men. I <lb/>
say, is as much opened up now as it ever can be. They <lb/>
are as much at liberty to proceed to Canada now as <lb/>
they would be under Confederation; but I much doubt <lb/>
if our young men went to Canada to-morrow for the <lb/>
purpose of securing political offices, or governmental <lb/>
situations, they would be successful. I question very <lb/>
much whether if our eight members in the Canadian <lb/>
Parliament would possess sufficient influence to sway <lb/>
the General Gpvernment to bestow the most trivial <lb/>
appointment upon one of our young men, in prefer<lb break="no"/>ence to one of their own. It would be silly to imagine <lb/>
such a thing. The Canadius would look with a deal <lb/>
of jealousy upon a Newfoundlander who want to that <lb/>
country to usurp an of a which rightly belonged to <lb/>
themselves. We all vividiy recollect the excitement <lb/>
that occurred here some few years ago when a gentle<lb break="no"/>man was sent from London to fill the office of Clerk of <lb/>
the Supreme Court here. The entire Bar role as one <lb/>
man, and indignantly rose against the usurpation. <lb/>
would not the same feeling of justifiable jealousy be <lb/>
aroused in the bosoms of Canadians if a Newfound<lb break="no"/>lander presumed to occupy posts of honour and emi<lb break="no"/>lument in Canada? Assuredly it would; what non<lb break="no"/>sense to talk of Confederation opening up a more <lb/>
expansive field of employment, for our young men <lb/>
than they now possess. In whatever light I view <lb/>
that scheme of Union I can discover nothing advan<lb break="no"/>tageous in it. We surrender everything we posses; <lb/>
by these resolutions, and have nothing in return ex<lb break="no"/>cept a future of taxation and difficulties. The benefits <lb/>
to be derived from our connection with Canada are <lb/>
well satirized in the following dialogue said to have <lb/>

in proportion as that sum becomes inadequate,or make <lb/>

jollification with our intended friends and fellow <lb/>
countryman the Esquimaux of the North West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory of British Columbia, which might lead to thou<lb break="no"/>sands of marriage unions between our sons and their <lb/>
daughters, the effect of which would virtually unite <lb/>
both ends of the Empire, largely improve our race, <lb/>
and produce a thorough British North American peo<lb break="no"/>ple, who woull be a terror to the Fenians, a check <lb/>
upon the Yankees, and the means of ultimately render<lb break="no"/>ing the British North American nation one of the <lb/>
most powerful, magnifice it, and stupendous Empires <lb/>
            the world ever produced.—On Duncan, how I regret <lb/>
that my knowledge of human nature, the history of <lb/>
            the psst, and the doctrine of cause and effect, pre<lb break="no"/>clude me from thoroughly appreciating those <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>, <lb/>
disinterested, expansive, and patriotic views, which <lb/>
            gave rise to that masterpiece of statesmanship—the <lb/>
Confederation Scheme." <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
The debt of Canada at the present moment amounts <lb/>
to aboat seventy-five millions of Dollars; to which <lb/>
inmense sums must be added the local debts of the <lb/>
several municipalities (not included in the general debt) <lb/>
amounting probably to sixteen millions more. In all <lb/>
about ninety-one millions of Dollars, or thirty-two <lb/>
for every man, woman and child in the country. This <lb/>
fact I gather from a letter written by the editor of the <lb/>
            St. John, (N. B.) <hi rendition="simple:italic">Telegraph</hi> from Qaebec, who fur<lb break="no"/>ther states that the local debt bears heavily in cer<lb break="no"/>tain sections.

Loadan, Port Hope, and Quebec, in the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>
        
        <cb/>

vince, with one or two other localities, are about bank<lb break="no"/>rupt. In view of those difficulties, it would be absurd <lb/>
to imagine that she could afford us any aid in opening <lb/>
up our resources, or lend us any assistance to culti<lb break="no"/>vate our waste lands. She is unable to open up her <lb/>
own, for it is a strange fact, that all the capital invest<lb break="no"/>ed in her mines and oil springs belongs to the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans. I do not deem it necessary trepass longer <lb/>
upon the time of the House, and will conclude by re<lb break="no"/>iterating my belief that we need no closer union with <lb/>
Canada than that we have already, that though we are <lb/>
now in no very cheering circumstances, yet that "'tis <lb/>
better to endure the ills we have, than flee to others <lb/>
that we know not of." We have all the essentials <lb/>
            within ourselves to make our people contented, peace<lb break="no"/>ful and wealthy. Our waters teem with riches—super<lb break="no"/>ir to the mines of Mexico and Peru—our lands are <lb/>
fertile as any on this side of the Atlantic. With a <lb/>
prosperous seal fishery, followed by a successful cod <lb/>
fishery. I trust this mad dream of Confederation, this <lb/>
selling of ourselves and our country, this disposal of <lb/>
our birthright for less than a "mess of pottage" will <lb/>
be dissipated; and that we shall all labor under our <lb/>
own government, to progress without the assistance <lb/>
of Mr. Brown's "general government" at Qttawa. <lb/>
As to the signing of the Quebec Resolutions by the <lb/>
Newfoundland Delegates. I am not astonished that <lb/>
they should have been seduced to do so. They were <lb/>
            outed and flattered to such an extent that they be<lb break="no"/>lieved Canada to be a perfect, elysium—and her wily <lb/>
statesmen angels of light; they were danced, and, I <lb/>
verily believe "drugged" into forgetfulness of their <lb/>
country, its freedom and its liberty;—from the time <lb/>
they landed in Canada till their departure, it was one <lb/>
continued ovation; and it therefore does not surprise <lb/>
me that they placed their signets to that document, <lb/>
and did not awake to the reality till the voice of their <lb/>
indignant countrymen aroused them. With these re<lb break="no"/>marks, I beg to support the Resolution belore the <lb/>
chair. <lb/> </p>

<p>The decision of the Upper House of the Canadian <lb/>
Parliament in favor of a º has a definute <lb/>
and important bearing upon the Imperial policy. It <lb/>
is only from the existing carcumstances that it could <lb/>
be necessary to discuss the question at all. Our <lb/>
American colonies are so differently situated both as <lb/>
to their physical geography, their history, race and <lb/>
social character, that we cannot be surprised at the <lb/>
levity, as we must call it, with which a Union has been <lb/>
proposed and rejected, or laid aside or simplv for<lb break="no"/>gotten many times since the separation of the United <lb/>
States. Bºit tor war and the fºrays, raids and other <lb/>
outrages that lead to it, there is no reason why each <lb/>
Province should not be politically independent of its <lb/>
neighbour. We unite for security; and he greater <lb/>
the danger or the more power'ul the pºssile aggres<lb break="no"/>sor, the larger the Union necessary for self-defence. <lb/>
To England it is a matter of very little importance <lb/>
whether she sends one G ºvernor or half a dºzen to <lb/>
her American Colonies, and the relation of these co n<lb break="no"/>munities one with the other are only a matter of local <lb/>
convenience. But we are aoproaching a very differ<lb break="no"/>ent state of things. The government at Washington <lb/>
sees, as it believes, the b-ginning of the end, and now <lb/>
announces with more confidence than ever that this is <lb/>
the last campaign, and that this very summar wil see <lb/>
Federal unity not only restored, but ready for Federal <lb/>
action. They make no secret of their intention to <lb/>
present an enorm us list of demands, which they are <lb/>
a lite aware we shall not acknowledge, and which, in<lb break="no"/>deed, they do not wish us to acknowledge. Their <lb/>
own pånlic writers admit that the law as stated by the <lb/>
chief American authorities, is against them, and the <lb/>
precedents of Ameriean practice are against them, <lb/>
but they hold that the unexampled magnitude of the <lb/>
occasion removes the question out of law and prece<lb break="no"/>dent, and justifies the Americans in making a new <lb/>
precedent in place of following an od one. This is <lb/>
equivalen: to telling us that submission is denºn':ed <lb/>
as a tribute to superior force; and such a sub mission <lb/>
we are not prepared to make. Upo 1 out refu'll they. <lb/>
avow their intention of sizing a material guarantee. <lb/>
Our Colonies lie stretched along a frontier two thou<lb break="no"/>sand miles long, and within a day's journey, by tin<lb break="no"/>table, of their most populous cities. To steam down <lb/>
the grand natural highway of river and like that, for <lb/>
the most part, separate the neighbours is equivalent to <lb/>
a voyage across the Atlantic; but you my breakfast <lb/>
one day at New York, Philadelphia, or , Washington, <lb/>
and the next in British America. Sach is the pos<lb break="no"/>sible foa, such the mºnace, a 1d suzº we m 1st con<lb break="no"/>sider the danger. In the fice of it the first question <lb/>
we ask on selves is, whether the Cºlonies will defend <lb/>
their territory and stand by their allegiance. That <lb/>
intention is to be gathered not from words but from <lb/>
deeds, and the first practical prof they can of er is <lb/>
Union of Confederation. Heuce the significance of <lb/>
the news just received. <lb/>
In the event of a war with the States, it is clear <lb/>
that all our Provinces must be placed under one <lb/>
miliary command. Do what we will, no unity of <lb/>
Alministration that we can establish will be eq 14 to <lb/>
that of the invader. If this disadvantage be urged as <lb/>
an argºnent against the very atte'mpt it is our du y <lb/>
sto reply that the Provinces farthest outlying from <lb/></p> 

<p>the Cotonial-centre and mºst obnoxinus to the attack <lb/></p> 

<p>of the foe, are just thºse which would mºst depend <lb/></p> 

<p>upon our aid. That gives us a special voice in their <lb/></p> 

<p>case. If the Maritime Provinc is seriously intend to <lb/>
adhers to the British Crown, it is impossible to say <lb/>
what fleets, what garrisons, what iron clais, what <lb/>
ordnance we shall have to pour into Halifax and other <lb/>
ports, all at our cost. Havin; then an additional right <lb/>
to speak in this case, we venture to say that if Nova <lb/>
Scotia and New Brunswick seriously inten l to be <lb/>
loyal, they ough tº act accordingly and declare for <lb/>
Confederation. Their holling of can only be ascribe <lb/>
to a lurking wish to reserve their decision for the pres<lb break="no"/>ent, and see which way the wind blows. ºld the tour <lb/>
of actual resistance there m ist be naion, and that <lb/>
union will be all the more cºsy and effectual from. <lb/>
some previous use. Indeed the matter is so plain that <lb/>
vacillation ou this puint can only by interpreted as <lb/>
wavering loyalty. Toe reasons. that have been given <lb/>
against a Confederation, even in the old form of a <lb/>
Zyllverein, are of the most mercantile character. The <lb/>
trade of the Maritime Provinces, it is said; naturatly <lb/>
runs to New England and the populous Northern <lb/>
States. It is here that they sell their coal and other <lb/>
commodities. This, of course, is an equal reason for <lb/>
giving up their allegiance altogetner; and if the Le<lb break="no"/>gislatures of these Provinces cannot make up their <lb/>
minds to forego for our sake some of their coumercial <lb/>
advantages, it is better that they should speak out <lb/>
more plainly at once. It is most important that we <lb/>
should know whether our Provinces will fisht for our <lb/>
allegiance. It they will not take the requisite steps <lb/>
now, we cannot expect them to do more in the hour <lb/>
of approaching cooflict, when the result of an honor<lb break="no"/>able decisiou will be no longer problematical. <lb/>
It cannot be necessary to remind any of our fellow<lb break="no"/>subjects on the American continent that if they are <lb/>
invaded, no submission, no trimming policy, no mid<lb break="no"/>die course, will deter their new masters from pasning <lb/>
tne rights of conquest to the utmost. The govern<lb break="no"/>ment at Washington may, for aught we know, charge <lb/>
upon England all the costs of the war, on tae argu<lb break="no"/>ment—if argument be necessary—that the terrible <lb/></p> 

<p>dissentions and saurifices of the war are owing to the <lb/></p> 

<p>course we have taken. It has been repeatedly pr <lb/>
posed to discharge the costs of the war out of º <lb/>
and other property of the rebels themselves, anº. <lb/>
the same reason, supposing us to share the cinº <lb/>
fate of the rebels, the whole soil of British Amstic <lb/>
may be confiscated and sold to satisfy the holders . <lb/>
Federal paper. Imagination itself cannot pictur, th <lb/>
condition of those Provinces, with all the intº. <lb/>
varieties of race, handed over to administrators sºlº <lb/>
ed for the very purpose of stamping out every vestº, <lb/>
of British feeling, and making their alienation ani. <lb/>
sult to this country. But is it indeed necessary to <lb/>
warn any British subjects of this certain fate if ha <lb/>
gives up his field', his altars and his heirths into tº <lb/>
hands of masters fresh from the decimation of thir <lb/>
own people? Does anybody there think it possible, <lb/>
purchase by compromise the equality of citizens, and <lb/>
to get off with even a moderate contribution to tº <lb/>
warſ? The Americans, we all see, can be true snough. <lb/>
to their rulers so long as the interests of the struggle <lb/>
require a share of confidence and continuity of m. <lb/>
agement. But we see, also, that they will bear tºo <lb/>
check to their cupidity, their triumph or theirº. <lb/>
venge. Once in possession of British soil, "vae victiºn <lb/>
will be the cry, and neither President Lincoln nor <lb/>
any other President will be able tº prevent it. In <lb/>
dependence is the only hope of the Golonist—indepen. <lb/>
in its present form—or if it must be at some distant: <lb/>
day formal, literal or absolute selfgovernment. For <lb/>
the present there is only question, and only one way <lb/></p> 

<p>It is not to sentimental or interested consideration, <lb/>
that a project of high political promise should be sac. <lb/>
rificed. Nobody can well doubt that on all important <lb/>
points this union or consolidation under a §. <lb/>
Government would be of vast benefit to our North <lb/>
American colonies, and that the greatest advantage of <lb/>
the greatest number would ensue upon its realization. <lb/>
In fact, the dissentients hardly venture to allege the <lb/>
real motives of their opposition. Their arguments <lb/>
against the schene are ostensibly based on other and <lb/>
less interested views, among which that of loyalty to <lb/>
tne British connexion is conspicuously advanced. The <lb/>
project is denounced as tending more or less directly <lb/>
to the absolute independence of the new Confederacy. <lb/>
Federal Government, it is urged, is but a step towards <lb/>
self government, and the old ties will soon belonvenel <lb/>
and lost. To this we may reply that we are not in<lb break="no"/>s-nsible to the good-w ll expressed, but that the obr; <lb/>
jection can hardly have much weight atter the cordial <lb/>
assent which has been given by this country to the <lb/>
scheme. If we see no danger in the project, the cul<lb break="no"/>onists need hardly take alarm. In our eyes they can<lb break="no"/>not be too strong or too united. Our only wish is to <lb/>
see them in the position which shall most conduce to <lb/>
their prosperity aud security. We know that in tºur <lb/>
case, as in all others, union must be strength. This <lb/>
much must at least be gained, and there will be ample <lb/>
oppportunity for insuring that notaing be lost. ... <lb/></p> 

<p>It is, indeed, not on the gro ind of mºre political <lb/>
safety that the advocates of the Confederacy are nºw <lb/>
recommending it. They argue very reuso a ly tº it, <lb/>
as regards commercial nego istions with their neigh. <lb/>
bours, a Federal Government disposing of the interes's <lb/>
of all the five provinces would enter a conference with <lb/>
hands greatly strengthened. At present the fisheries <lb/>
and o'lier maritime rights are under one Administri<lb break="no"/>tion, the chief agricultural interes's under another, <lb/>
Nova Sco ia and Newfoundland have the set men," <lb/>
Canada the militia. Place all these elements of pro<lb break="no"/>ductiveness and power under on- c-niral Govern me t <lb/>
and it is obvious that such a Government wrill be <lb/>
better able not only to make itself respected bit tu <lb/>
negotiate for mutual concessions in the w y of inter-, <lb/>
course and trade. The gain would be the gain of the <lb/></p> 

<p>cºmparatively few. The few. too, can mike reasonable <lb/>
terms. It is the very object and purpose oi the prº<lb break="no"/>liminary debates to adjust conflicting intereste, and: <lb/>
make fair dis ributio 1 o' advant ges. That each coa <lb/>
stituent member of the Confederition should look tº <lb/>
interests of its own is perfectly natural, but it woulſ' <lb/>
be wrong to allow such considerations to injure the <lb/>
grand result. . We rejoice, therefore, to see that the <lb/>
promo ers of the project are not discouraged by the <lb/>
issue of the New Brunswick elections, and that ths <lb/>
Canadian Parliament will be moved to a vote upon the <lb/>
proposal as originally designed. We cannot put any <lb/>
foice upon a dissentient population, but it will bs open <lb/>
to us to observe that the contributions made from the <lb/>
Imperial treasury towards colonial administration may <lb/>
be regulated by our conceptions of true colonial <lb/>
interests.- March 21. <lb/></p>

MONDAY, APRIL 24, 1865. <lb/></p> 

<p>The tone of public feeling in England on the subject <lb/>
of Confederation is prety clearly manifested in the <lb/>
articles we transfer to-day from the Times. There is <lb/>
nothing whatever new in this indication, for from the <lb/>
first mention of the project in the mother country iſ <lb/>
has been impossible to mistake the decided character <lb/>
of the opinions of British statesmen and the British <lb/>
press in its favour. Their pronouncements indeed <lb/>
have amounted to nothing short of a determination <lb/>
that the present relations between the parent country <lb/>
and these colonies should not be permitted to con' <lb/>
tinux, and that they saw no solution of the question <lb/>
so acceptable to them in all its aspects as the proposal <lb/>
agreed to at the conference at Quebec. The present <lb/>
views of the Times are therefore confirmatory of those <lb/>
which have already come before us, and evident" <lb/>
the consistency and fixedness of a foregore conclusiºn" <lb/>
It is worthy of note that in Halifax, judging ... froſti <lb/>
fatest accounts, opinion seems to be veering round in <lb/>
relation to this subject. When the canaſian Delº <lb/>
gates arrived there the other day on their way 40 En<lb break="no"/>gland, they were received with enthusiasm at , pº <lb/>
demonstration at Temperance Hall. A torch-light <lb/>
procession and other significant expressions of 8 <lb/>
wil to the object of their mission were very speedſ. <lb/>
got up in the Nova Scotia capital; and though." " <lb/>
not pretended that these exhibitions spoke with the <lb/>
unanimous voice of the population, they must o! <lb/>
necessity have been the testimony of a sufficient P* <lb/>
