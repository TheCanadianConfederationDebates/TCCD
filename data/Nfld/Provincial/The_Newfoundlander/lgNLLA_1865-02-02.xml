<p>British government we would yet see brighter days. He <lb/>
felt proud of being a British subject, and desired no other <lb/>
connection. It was not the rule of a race of French and <lb/>
Dutch Canadians that he would substitute for the liberty <lb/>
we now enjoyed under the best government in the world. <lb/>
He (Mr. March) had every confidence in the leader of <lb/>
the present government, but he wished more had been <lb/>
done to settle the people in those fine Bºys where the <lb/>
land was so productive, and where there was abundance <lb/>
of manure from the sea weed that washed up on the <lb/>
beaches, and grass grew higher than a man's head...It <lb/>
was only now that we were coming to know the capabili<lb break="no"/>ties of our country, and he hoped that the hardships we <lb/>
had gone through would render our people more careful <lb/>
to husband their means when prosperity returns, and to <lb/>
invest them in those agricultural improvements which <lb/>
would be an inheritance to their children. <lb/>
Ordered that the petition lie on the table. <lb/>
On motion of Mr. Wyatt, pursuant to order of the day, <lb/>
the House resolved itself into Committee of the whole on <lb/>
the addrass in reply to his Excellency's speech, Mr. <lb/>
KNIGHT in the chair. <lb/>
On motion of Mr. Wyatt, the next section of the ad<lb break="no"/>dress in reference to education, was read. <lb/>
Mr. Wyatt moved that the section be adopted. <lb/>
Mr. TALBoT —The Governor in his speech had refer<lb break="no"/>red to Education and to the necessity of establishing a <lb/>
training school. There were aiready two or three such <lb/>
schools in existence here, and it was very remarkable <lb/>
that his Excellency the Governor was not aware of it. <lb/>
Why did not his constitutional advisers inform him of <lb/>
it? . He (Mr. Talbot) was aware of their existence, and <lb/>
they were provided according to the principle of the Edu<lb break="no"/>cation Act, on the denominational basis—The Roman <lb/>
Catholics had one and the Protestants had two or three, <lb/>
and he (Mr. Talbot) had yet.to learn that they were not <lb/>
satisfactory, or that they did not fully answer the purpose <lb/>
for which they were established. He could positively <lb/>
assert that the Roman Catholic one was as good and <lb/>
efficient as it was possible to establish. It was in con<lb break="no"/>nection with St. Bonaventure College, and was placed in <lb/>
charge of a teacher eminently fitted by the excellent <lb/>
training he had himself received at the Dublin training <lb/>
Institution, to train young men for teachers.-There <lb/>
were always from six to nine pupils under a course <lb/>
of training in this college, and he (Mr. Talbot) presu<lb break="no"/>med that it was the same with the Protestant institu<lb break="no"/>tions; and that the most satisfactory results were attain<lb break="no"/>ed. And was it proposed now to establish another <lb/>
school, in the place of one which could not possibly be <lb/>
exºelled P What, therefore, could be the motive for <lb/>
suggesting the establishment of a Normal School P. If <lb/>
it was intended that a central training School for all <lb/>
religious denominations should be established, it would <lb/>
be necessary that a school-house should be built for <lb/>
the purpose, and a staff of teachers employod; and <lb/>
thus a very large amount of unnecessary expense would <lb/>
be incurred, thus reducing the general grant now given <lb/>
for Educational purposes.—The only thing which he (Mr. <lb/>
Talbot) saw that would be beneficial was to increase <lb/>
the grant, so as to provide adequate salaries for the <lb/>
teachers. The great eivil in this country was that the <lb/>
teachers did not receive that compensation for their ser. <lb/>
vices to which they were entitled, or which would rens <lb/>
der them satisfied with their position. It was <lb/>
not worth training them, if they only received a paltry <lb/>
25 a year. Let hon members just reflect for one <lb/>
moment on that subject. You give a liberal education <lb/>
to these young men who are designed for teaching in the <lb/>
outports. You raise them intellectually and morally, <lb/>
instil into their minds a laudable ambition, and then you <lb/>
send them to the Qutports on the pitiful stipend of £25 <lb/>
a year. Under this system the great difficulty was in <lb/>
retaining the services of these teachers. In the out<lb break="no"/>orts they found young men in mercanule establishments, <lb/>
intellectually far their inferiors, and yet receiving <lb/>
salaries double the amount they received. Hence they <lb/>
become dissatisfied with their position, and on the first <lb/>
opportunity they give it up and seek for employment iſ, <lb/>
which they may receive adequate return for their services. <lb/>
The least salary such men should get was he (Mr. Talbot) <lb/>
would say, Łb0 a year, with whateyer else they were able <lb/>
to make. That would render them satisfied with their <lb/>
positions; and being satisfied, they would remain and <lb/>
do their work well. Unless this change was effected, it <lb/>
would be useless to incur expense in further training <lb/>
teachers, for the better educated our young men became, <lb/>
the less inclined would they be settler permanently in the <lb/>
outports on such starving salaries as they at present <lb/>
received. The second point which he (Mr.Talbot) would <lb/>
rifer to, was the prºposition to compel the people to <lb/>
contribute to the support of their schools. The principle <lb/>
was a sound and unexceptionable one; but he was satis<lb break="no"/>fied it would not work well. It was notorious that in <lb/>
some of the Outports the people were so indifferent to <lb/>
education, that they would do without a school lor:yer <lb/>
rather than contribute one penny to its support. The <lb/>
Inspectors had loudly complained of the indifference of <lb/>
the parents, who in many instances did not send their <lb/>
children to school at all; while others only sent them <lb/>
when they could not employ them at home. But surely <lb/>
if the people were unwilling to contribute to the support <lb/>
of their schools, you would not, on that account, take <lb/>
away from them the blessings of education altogether. <lb/>
Aid Education as much as you can, foster it, improve i , <lb/>
but do not strike at the root of the present system, and <lb/>
sweep it away altogether. He (MIr, ſaloot) felt it neces. <lb/>
sary to make these observations, in anticipation of any <lb/>
Bill that might be introduced on the subject. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. KENT was perfectly satisfied the leader of the <lb/>
government would do nothing to disturb the denomi<lb break="no"/>national arrangements which we all knew tended very <lb/>
much to allay the sectarian feeling wi. h at one time <lb/>
ran so high in the country,and under which education <lb/>
has made some progress. The duty of the goveri<lb break="no"/>ment consisted in supplying the nueans for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of education,and exercising a severe surveillance <lb/>
over its expenditure, but to leave the carrying it out, <lb/>
especially as respected the religious feelings of the <lb/>
people, to parents aud pastors; and if th–y had the <lb/>
uneans to increase the grant, parents and all who were <lb/>
interested in education would not object. He knew <lb/>
nothing else that was required. As to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment setting up a normal school for the training of <lb/>
teachers for all denominations in the colony, he did not <lb/>
believe it would be attempted. He agreed entirely <lb/>
with the hon. member, Mr. Talbot, that unless suffi<lb break="no"/>cient emolument were provided for the teachers, any <lb/>
improvement wou.u prove nugatory, as the teachers <lb/>
would be dissatisfied when they saw others, perhaps <lb/>
in.erior to them in attainments, in the enjoyment of <lb/>
much more ample salaries. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. ATTRRNay GENERAL was satisfied that <lb/>
when the measure proposed to be introduced by the <lb/>
government was submitted to hon members, it wou d <lb/>
prove sausfactory to both sides of the House. With <lb/>
Reference to the expense of the proposed tormal school, <lb/>
he did not think any ad-itiºnal expenditure would re. <lb/>
suit from its establishment. There could be no doub: <lb/>
whatever that a norinal school was one of the first ne<lb break="no"/>ºsities of an educational system for the training of <lb/>
those who were to teach the people. Teachers who <lb/>
were uneducated could not instruct others. The reports <lb/>
of the Inspectors and of the Boards of Education <lb/>
showed the necessity of a better instructed class of <lb/>
teachers than many of those now employed, and the <lb/>
experience of all who were acquainted with the state <lb/>
9 our elementary schools sustained that view. The <lb/>
hºn. member opposite objected to any interference <lb/>
with the existing arrangements for the training of <lb/>
Rºman Catholic ºachers. He said they had a training <lb/>
* "" already. The hon gentleman aiso objected to <lb/></p> 

<p>sº­ <lb/></p> 

<p>T H E N E W F O U N D L AND E R. <lb/></p> 

<p>the salaries provided for the teachers. But still he <lb/>
admitted that notwithstanding the inadequate salaries, <lb/>
young men came to be trained, and the Boards ºom<lb break="no"/>manded the services of parties, after being trained, <lb/>
although their emoluments were certainly much les: <lb/>
than it was desirable they snould be. This showed <lb/>
that it was not necessary to inerease the grants to cº<lb break="no"/>ble the Boards to secure the services of efficient teach<lb break="no"/>ers. The hon member was mistaken when he said we <lb/>
had training schools already. The hon membº" <lb/>
ferred to the arrangements for training Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic teachers in St. Bonaventure College. The Educa<lb break="no"/>tion Act provided for the training there, and in ºr <lb/>
ral Protestart institutions. But it was found that the <lb/>
teachers trained in these institutions were inefficient, <lb/>
and it was thought expedient to have a nºrmal school, <lb/>
in which the training of the toachers might be con<lb break="no"/>ducted. Last summer circulars were sent to the sev<lb break="no"/>eral outports, and to the head of the Colonial andCºn. <lb/>
tinental Church Society, and important information <lb/>
had thus been obtained which would be laid before <lb/>
the House. It was not a training school only that <lb/>
was required. Several of the Boards were in the habit <lb/>
of keeping large sums of money unemployed. Reforam <lb/>
was necessary in that respect. The limits of the Edu<lb break="no"/>cation districts were not found 80 convenient as was <lb/>
desirable. There were also some other improvements <lb/>
required, and an arrangement had been entered intº <lb/>
by the Government for the supply of a uniform *t of <lb/>
school books at a cheaper rate than they could be pro<lb break="no"/>cured by depending on the book-sellers for their im<lb break="no"/>portation. That should be providel for by law. With <lb/>
respect to the normal school, there was an appropria<lb break="no"/>tion under the existing Act for the training of teach<lb break="no"/>ers at the several Protestant institutions. It was <lb/>
thought that the training could be made more efficient <lb/>
by combining the money thus expended in one sam; <lb/>
and that it would be sufficiant for the maintenance of <lb/>
a normal school. They did not propose to interfers <lb/>
wish the existing denominational arrangements. From <lb/>
the opinions expressed by those who might be consi<lb break="no"/>dered as expressing Roman Catholic opinion, they <lb/>
appeared to be satisfied with the system of training <lb/>
which they had already at St. Bonaventure College, <lb/>
and they would not be interfered with, and the appro<lb break="no"/>priations for training Protestant teachers would be <lb/>
combined for the support of a Protestant normal school. <lb/>
Mr. KENT—Would any portion of the Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic grant be touched P <lb/>
Hun. Attorney GENERAL-Nct without the con<lb break="no"/>sent of the It man Uatholic members. <lb/>
Mr. KENT—They might do what they pleased with <lb/>
their own. <lb/>
The motion that the section be adopted was then <lb/>
put and carried. <lb/>
The several sections of the address down to that in <lb/>
reference to the currency were aead seriatim and <lb/>
adopted. <lb/>
The section respecting the currency having been read, <lb/>
Air. WYATT moved that it be adopted. <lb/>
Mr. GLEN said the measure introduced by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and passed the session before last, was un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly a good one. But in order to perfect the <lb/>
arrangements it should be made compulsory on the <lb/>
merchants and all engaged in the trade of the country <lb/>
to keep their accounts in dollars and cents. At pre<lb break="no"/>sent there was a good daal of misun ters: anding and <lb/>
discontent among poor people relative to the copper <lb/>
currency, as they were under the impression that they <lb/>
lost two pence on every shilling. It was absolutely <lb/>
necessary that it should be made incumbent on the <lb/>
trade to keep their accounts in accordance with the <lb/>
provisions ºf the Act, otherwise we would have to <lb/>
go back to the old system of pounds, shillings and <lb/>
pence. <lb/>
Hon. Attorney GENERAL–The observations of <lb/>
the hon memner were well worthy of the attention and <lb/>
serious consideration of the Government and the <lb/>
Leº islature. The law, however, had only been a few <lb/>
weeks in operation. <lb/>
The motion was then put and carried. <lb/>
Some othar sections, d., rn to t., 11th, on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of confederation, were read seriatim and adoptwd. <lb/>
The Comm.ttee then rºse, and the Chairman report<lb break="no"/>ed progress.-\-To sit again to-morrow. . <lb/>
Mi ReNour gave notice that on to-morrow he <lb/>
would ask the Acting Colonial Secretary to lay on the <lb/>
table of the House a copy of tenders, notice and <lb/>
agreement, for the hire of the vessel to carry the <lb/>
Commissioner of Fisheries, Judge, and Collector of <lb/>
Revenue to the coast of Labrador in 1864. <lb/>
The house then adjourned until Thursday at three <lb/>
o'clock. <lb/>-->

        <p>
        "The subject of the proposed Confederation of the <lb/>

    <p>
<persName ref="pers:SPEA1">The SPEAKER</persName> said he had not hitherto had an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of making any observations respecting his <lb/>
Excellency's speech; and perhaps it was scarcely ne<lb break="no"/>cessary for him to say anything regarding a speech <lb/>
which was so very satisfactory to hon gentlemen on <lb/>
both sides of the House. For the first time since he <lb/>
(the Speaker) <choice><sic>rhad</sic><corr>had</corr></choice> the honor of a seat in that House <lb/>
had he heard the members on the opposition side <lb/>
praise the speech from the throne. Hon members on <lb/>
the opposition benches indorsed in complimentary <lb/>
language the important practical suggestions of his <lb/>
Excellency's speech. It was evident, however, that <lb/>
these hon gentleinen, in their ignorance of constitu<lb break="no"/>tional usages, regarded the speech as emanating from <lb/>
the Governor himself, and not the embodiment of the <lb/>
policy of his constitutional advisers; and it was not <lb/>
until that experienced parliamentary tactician, the <lb/>
hon member for St. John's East, Mr Kent, set these <lb/>
hon members right, that they became aware that they <lb/>
were bestowing the most unqualified commendation <lb/>
upon the policy of his (the Speaker's) hon friend, the <lb/>
leader of the government. One hon member said it <lb/>
was a parliamentary fiction that the speech was the <lb/>
speech of the ministry. He (the Speaker) must say <lb/>
that this was novel constitutional doctrine emanating <lb/>
from a professed admirer of responsibie government. <lb/>
Next day, however, there was some attempt to find <lb/>
fault, but it was so feeble that it was not entitled to <lb/>
notice. He (the Speaker) did say the members of the <lb/>
Government had reason to congratulate themselves <lb/>
upon this unqualified indorsation of their policy by <lb/>
the opposition. With respect to his Excellency's <lb/>
speech, he (the Speaker) would observe that he had <lb/>
listened to few speeches couched in more elegant lan<lb break="no"/>guage, and he must congratulate the House and the <lb/>
country upon the choice Her Majesty had made of a <lb/>
Governor of so much ability and intellectuality, to <lb/>
administer the affairs of this ancient and loyal colony. <lb/>
His Excellency came here in the prime of life, and he <lb/>
must have been highly appreciated by Her Majesty's <lb/>

<cb/>

Government when he was appointed to such a high <lb/>
and responsible office as the government of this im<lb break="no"/>portant dependancy of the Crown. There was scarcely <lb/>
a subject of public interest in the colony which was <lb/>
not referred to in that speech. The subject of pauper<lb break="no"/>ism occupied a prominent place. There was scarsely <lb/>
a session but they had to take that question into con<lb break="no"/>sideration. Poverty, in one part of the island or <lb/>
another, was almost of annual recurrence, showing the <lb/>
necessity of providing some other means of subsistence <lb/>
for the people besides precarious fisheries. There <lb/>
were no people who worked harder or toiled more <lb/>
incessantly than did many of the fishermen of this <lb/>
colony, or who poured more wealth into the treasury <lb/>
of their employers, while, at the same time, they were <lb/>
subject to the recurrence of seasons of wide spread <lb/>
destitution. Some remedy was required to reach this <lb/>
evil, and if any remedy was devised, it must come <lb/>
from this House, for it would not come from those <lb/>
who profited by the fishermens' toil: The encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of the Bank and Mackerel fisheries, and the <lb/>
promotion of agriculture were calculated to prove most <lb/>
beneficial in furnishing profitable employment to our <lb/>
people and thus improving their circumstances. But <lb/>
the question which chiefly engrossed public attention <lb/>
was that referred to in the section just read. He (the <lb/>
Speaker) would act with impartiality in regard to that <lb/>
matter. It was a question on which he had no party <lb/>
views to subserve. He came to its decision fearlessly <lb/>
and independently, and cared for no clamour raised <lb/>
by interested parties cut of doors; and he did say that <lb/>
he would discuss it without feeling. It was a matter <lb/>
which had agitated the country for some months, and <lb/>
was the most important question which could occupy <lb/>
the attention of the Legislature. A day was fixed for <lb/>
the discussion of that question; and he (the Speaker) <lb/>
would not now anticipate what he might then have to <lb/>
say on the subject. But having had the honour of <lb/>
being appointed one of the delagates to the confer<lb break="no"/>ence held on this subject at Quebec, he would be ex<lb break="no"/>pected to take the earliest opportunity of entering into <lb/>
explanations respecting the proceedings of that con<lb break="no"/>ference. When he considered that there were parties <lb/>
out of doors who, from interested motives, were desir<lb break="no"/>ous of defeating the object of that conference, and <lb/>
when we found them indulging in such clap-trap with <lb/>
a view to excite a clamour against the proposed con<lb break="no"/>federation, charging the Delegates with selling the <lb/>
country, as if there were in his mind or in that of the <lb/>
gentleman associated with him any desire except to <lb/>
promote the best interests of their native land—when <lb/>
he found such calumnies resorted to he would take that <lb/>
opportunity to nake a few observations. His co-delegate <lb/>
and himself had not been pitchforked into the country. <lb/>
They had not traded on the interests of the people. <lb/>
They went to the Conference with an earnest resolu<lb break="no"/>tion to benefit their native land to the utmost of their <lb/>
ability, feeling the deep responsibility of the duties <lb/>
they had undertaken. They were determined to do <lb/>
nothing which, in their opinion, would be calculated <lb/>
to prejudice the country in which they had such a <lb/>
deep interest. And who should feel a deeper interest <lb/>
in the prosperity of Newfoundland than they did? <lb/>
Both natives of the Island, in which all their interests <lb/>
centred, was it to be supposed that either of them <lb/>
would do anything calculated to prejudice the true <lb/>
interests of their country? He (the Speaker) ex<lb break="no"/>pected to spend his life in the country, and he did <lb/>
not anticipate any personal advantage from the pro<lb break="no"/>posed federation, farther than it would promote the <lb/>
prosperity of the land of his nativity and the home of <lb/>
his children. If was said they were giving away the <lb/>
fisheries. Now those who said so knew it was not <lb/>
true. They knew that the people of all British North <lb/>
America had the same interest in the fisheries as we <lb/>
have. But at the conference it was stipulated, which <lb/>
was readily conceded, that we should reserve the <lb/>
power to make such enactments as might be necessay <lb/>
for the protection of the fisheries. Again, it was said <lb/>
we were destroying the liberties of the people. He was <lb/>
surprised to hear such a statement put forward. Would <lb/>
any person have his liberty curtailed by taking up his <lb/>
residence in Great Britain, in Nova Scotia, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, or Canada? These countries all had responsible <lb/>
government before we had it. And it was the very first <lb/>
decision come to at the Conference that with a view <lb/>
to the perpetuation of our connection with the mother <lb/>
country, and the promotion of the best interests of the <lb/>
people, the model of the British government should <lb/>
be followed, so far as circumstances would permit, the <lb/>
Government being vested in Her Most Gracious <lb/>
Majesty and administerod by her representative in <lb/>
accordance with the well understood principles of the <lb/>
British constitution. He (the Speaker) was surprised <lb/>
when he heard yesterday a member of that House say <lb/>
that he wanted to be British, and not to be ruled by <lb/>
French or Dutch Canadians—what an absurdity our <lb/>
British connection would be guaranteed by an Act of <lb/>
the Imperial Parliament. With responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, the ministry of the day responsible to the people <lb/>
not merely of Canada, but also of New Brunswick, <lb/>
Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward <lb/>
Island, would not our liberties be as well secured as <lb/>
at present, and our British connection perpetuated for <lb/>
ages to come? Again, we were told of the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of a militia, as if the people were to be marched <lb/>
to the frontier of Canada to repel invasion from that <lb/>
province. When he found gentlemen, from whom <lb/>
better might be expected, getting up clap-trap of that <lb/>
kind, he regarded it as the best evidence that they <lb/>
had nothing substantial to urge against the proposel <lb/>
confederation. Where was there anything in the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions to indicate any such purpose? How could we <lb/>
have a militia force in this Colony. Our fishermen, <lb/>
from the very nature of their occupation, could not be <lb/>
organized into a militia. During the summer season <lb/>
the greater number of them were absent from their <lb/>
homes prosecuting the fishery. It was only amongst <lb/>
an agricultural population that a militia could be or<lb break="no"/>ganized. But, he (the Speaker) would ask, whether <lb/>
every man of right feeling in the country would not be <lb/>
ready to arm in defence of his family and his home <lb/>
and the land of his nativity or adoption, should the <lb/>
necessity arise? The triumphs of the British navy <lb/>
were not achieved without ine powerful aid of the <lb/>
fishermen of Newfoundland, and we had now a body <lb/>
of fishermen who in valour and physical vigour were <lb/>
not inferior to their aucestors, and who were as ready <lb/>
to defend their country as any class of Her Majesty's <lb/>
subjects. There might be some legislation with res<lb break="no"/>pect to the Volunteers, but he (the Speaker) was cer<lb break="no"/>tain that Britain would continue to use the protection <lb/>
of her troops, and that the navy would not be with<lb break="no"/>drawn. He had authority for saying that all that the <lb/>
statesmen of Great Britain required was that the <lb/>
people of the colonies should show a disposition to <lb/>
protect themselves, and that protection which had <lb/>
hitherto been accorded them would not only be con<lb break="no"/>tinued, but increased But it was said "you are going <lb/>
to bind us to Canada." Now we had heard that said <lb/>
by persons who had never seen Canada, who had <lb/>
never been out of this Colony; and perhaps it would <lb/>
be as well for some of them to travel a little and visit <lb/>
that magnificent province, as well as Nova Scotia and <lb/>
New Brunswick, which were advancing so rapidly in <lb/>
material prosperity, and in all that tended to make a <lb/>
people great and respected. How many had emigra<lb break="no"/>ted from this Colony to Canada, and found there a <lb/>
home where their industry was rewarded with Compe<lb break="no"/>tence for themselves and their families? But we were <lb/>
to be united, not merely to Canada, but to Nova <lb/>
Scotia and New Brunswick, and in the Legislature of <lb/>
the union we would all be represented according to <lb/>

<cb/>

our population. It was a treaty, which, if carried out, <lb/>
would give us all one great country, extending from <lb/>
the Atlantic to the Pacific, in whose onward course <lb/>
and prosperity we <choice><sic>wonld</sic><corr>would</corr></choice> participate, and whose glory <lb/>
and renown would be the inheritance of your child. <lb/>
Our alliance was not to be with Canada alone, but alsº <lb/>
with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. These coun<lb break="no"/>tries were all more prosperous than we are, for it must <lb/>
be admitted that we are at the lowest point of depres<lb break="no"/>sion. It was useless to talk of the 600,000 seals, or <lb/>
the 400,000 that we are to have this spring. Would <lb/>
one successful seal fishery reestablish our prosperity? <lb/>
But hon gentlemen would retain their isolation. Did <lb/>
they recollect 1857, two years after the establishment <lb/>
of responsible government, when a convention was <lb/>
entered into with France, giving away our best fishing <lb/>
grounds, and when a few hours after the Convention <lb/>
was made public here, property was depreciated 40 <lb/>
per cent.? What did we do then? Did we contemn the <lb/>
aid of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Canada? No, <lb/>
but a deputation was appointed consisting of the hon. <lb/>
member for St. John's East, Mr. Kent, and himself <lb/>
(the Speaker) to proceed to these provinces, whose al<lb break="no"/>liance some hon, members would now contemn, and <lb/>
we received their warmest sympathy and cooperation <lb/>
to defeat that convention, which, if carried into effect, <lb/>
would have transferred our most valuable fisheries to <lb/>
the French. What was the result? Out came the cir<lb break="no"/>cular dispatch of the Colonial Minister, announcing <lb/>
that the convention was withdrawn. Hon. members <lb/>
said we would never again have such a convention, <lb/>
But how did they know? Was not the influence of <lb/>
France as potent at Downing Street now as then? <lb/>
And were not our proceedings vigillantly watched by <lb/>
the emissaries of the French Emperor? And would <lb/>
not our isolation, if we persisted in it, give the desired <lb/>
opportunity of endeavouring to obtain frem the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Government what it has long been his policy to <lb/>
<choice><sic>secare</sic><corr>secure</corr></choice>? And supposing the convention of 1857 should <lb/>
be renewed, what were we to do? Would we send to <lb/>
the neighbouring Provinces? If we did, they would <lb/>
most likely reply—"We assisted you once, and when <lb/>
subsequently we proposed a federation which would <lb/>
have secured the protection of your interests in all <lb/>
time coming, you refused to become parties to it. You <lb/>
may now protect yourselves." But the union was ob<lb break="no"/>jected to on the plea of increased taxation. Could any <lb/>
hon member recollect when, a few years ago, the <lb/>
great leader of the opposition to this confederation <lb/>
proposed to lay an export duty on fish and oil? And <lb/>
now he came forward, as the professed friend of the <lb/>
fisherman, to oppose the union on the plea of increas<lb break="no"/>ed taxation. And how much would they be taxed? <lb/>
Would they feel 2, 3, or 4 per cent over the present <lb/>
taxation? Were they not sufficiently taxed already? <lb/>
Did they not receive their supplies at an advance of <lb/>
50 or 63? Did not the fisherman at present get flour <lb/>
imported, duty free, under the reciprocity treaty,and <lb/>
was there any reduction in their accounts in conse<lb break="no"/>quence? But we must bear in mind that a notice has <lb/>
been given to abrogate the reciprocity treaty, and <lb/>
with it we would lose our free trade with the other <lb/>
colonies, for we could not expect, if we refused to join <lb/>
in this confederation, that the other provinces would <lb/>
continue the admission of our produce duty free. But <lb/>
under this confederation, not only the products of the <lb/>
fisheries and of agriculture, but also the manufactures <lb/>
of the several provinces would pass duty free from one <lb/>
to the other. Now, Canada, New Brunswick, and <lb/>
Nova Scotia were extensive in manufacturing, and <lb/>
the very articles required by our fishermen were ma<lb break="no"/>nufactured in these provinces at a cheaper rate. Let <lb/> 
this convention be carried out, and food and clothing <lb/>
for our fisherman would be brought in duty-free from <lb/> 
the neighbouring provinces. Again, they should <lb/>
support this confederation on account of their children. <lb/>
Was there no regard for them? What future was <lb/>
there for any young man brought up in this country? <lb/>
If his object was to engage in commercial pursuits, <lb/>
where was he to get his training? How were we to <lb/>
get a mercantile education for many of our sons, with <lb/>
the importations which were annually made from <lb/>
Britain? Some must go to another country, and <lb/>
where were they to go to, with the British provinces <lb/>
broken up into fragments? To the United States? <lb/>
Every feeling of patriotism dictated that they should <lb/>
remain under the British flag. Supposing they now <lb/>
went to Canada, who were they to apply to? But if <lb/>
we formed part of the same country, they would find <lb/>
our members there, and if we were careful in their <lb/>
selection, they would be such as would make them<lb break="no"/>selves felt, limited as was the number to which our <lb/>
population entitled us. Our young men could apply <lb/>
to these members, whose interest would oe made avail<lb break="no"/>able to forward their views. Look at Scotland, for in<lb break="no"/>stance. How many went from Scotland, and on appli<lb break="no"/>cation to their members in the Imperial Parliament, <lb/>
got appointments, which enabled them by the proper <lb/>
exercise of their talents to rise to eminence? And he <lb/> 
(the Speaker) was aware that many young men who <lb/>
came over to England from Ireland, were equally suc<lb break="no"/>cessful, through the influence of the Irish members. <lb/>
And it would be the same under this convention, <lb/>
while, at the same time, the recommendation of of our <lb/>
Representatives, to whom they might be known, or <lb/>
bring introductions, would be influential in procuring <lb/>
situations for our young men in mercantile establis<lb break="no"/>ments. There was abundance of room in the neigh<lb break="no"/>bouring Provinces for all our young men who might <lb/>
not find employment here, for hundreds of years to <lb/>
come. Then were we not in a state of the deepest <lb/>
depression? And what would raise as from it so <lb/>
effectually as union with the neighbouring provinces? <lb/>
How often have we heard the wish expressed for year, <lb/>
past for union with these provinces? And now when <lb/>
we had the opportunity, many amongst us would <lb/>
prefer isolation. The financial arrangements entered <lb/>
into would give a batter revenue than we had on the <lb/>
average of the last ten years, securing sufficient means <lb/>
tor the road service, so much complained of, as being <lb/>
inadequately provided for. We wauld also be provided <lb/>
with direct steam communication at the expense of <lb/>
the Federal Government, as well as steam communi<lb break="no"/>cation with Canada, which, no doubt, would induct <lb/>
the visits of capitalists, and stimulate enterprise, <lb/>
leading to competition, which, while it would benefit <lb/>
the community, was not, perhaps, desired by some. <lb/>
But although it might be the means of reducing profits, <lb/>
anything that would promote employment must prove <lb/>
beneficial to the working classes. Ít was said they <lb/>
were giving away the Crown lands and the minerals <lb/>
of the island. From the clamour raised by some <lb/>
gentlemen on this subject, one would imagine that <lb/>
the Canadians were to send down a number of vessels <lb/>
with pickaxes and shovels to carry away the land. It <lb/>
would be a rather arduous task to take away the rock <lb/>
of this Island—to take away even Chain rock, and at <lb/>
for Signal Hill, who was to attempt its removal But <lb/>
what did we want? What had we been wishing for <lb/>
years? Did we not want our wild lands improved? <lb/>
Who was to do it? Was it not wel, to induce the people <lb/>
who were willing to pay so handsomaly for them, to im<lb break="no"/>prove them, so as to repay them for their outlay? We <lb/>
knew we were to get a handsome sum for the surren<lb break="no"/>der of our Crown lands, and we also knew that to <lb/>
render them productive of revenue a large expenditure <lb/>
would be involved in surveys, and the working of <lb/>
our mines, which would be all for our benefit, while <lb/>
there could be no interference with local enter<lb break="no"/>prise, for the lands were as available to us as to any <lb/>
other portion of the Confederation, and local capital<lb break="no"/>ists had greater facilities than those who came from a <lb/>
distance. But our own capital is, with the exception <lb/>

of Mr. Bennett, had hitherto shown no desire to en<lb break="no"/>gage in mining operations. And was it not as well <lb/>
that our mines should be worked with Canadian cap<lb break="no"/>ital, as with British or American? And hitherto but <lb/>
little of either had come. And if we could induce <lb/>
Canadian capitalists to come their enterprise sould <lb/>
not fail to prove advantageous to our people, while if <lb/>
they did not come, we would be no worse off than at <lb/>
present. The sum of $150,000 a year which we were <lb/>
to receive for our Crown lands was almost a free gift. <lb/>
Again, some hon members were constantly speaking <lb/>
about providing employment for our people, and <lb/>
establishing factories. Factories, to be conducted <lb/>
economically, should be established by private enter<lb break="no"/>prise, and the best means to encourage them was to <lb/>
provide an extended market for their products. Now <lb/>
the Confederation would provide four millions of con<lb break="no"/>sumers, a number which was rapidly increasing; and <lb/>
with our extensive water power and cheap labour we <lb/>
could offer inducements to enterprising capitalists to <lb/>
establish manufactures, once free access to the British <lb/>
American market was opened up by the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. We had a large consuming population in the <lb/>
Island for whom everything had to be imported. If <lb/>
Confederation was carried out it would be the means <lb/>
of depriving some of our local politicians of the posi<lb break="no"/>tions they had occupied for some years past; and we <lb/>
all know how difficult it was for small politicians to <lb/>
give up that from which they derived a certain local <lb/>
importance. They knew how difficult it was for those <lb/>
who traded on the passions and prejudices of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple to submit to an arrangement by which their occu<lb break="no"/>pations <choice><sic>wonld</sic><corr>would</corr></choice> be gone. They did not like the pros<lb break="no"/>pect of it, and therefore they pretended great zeal for <lb/>
the interests of the people, our fisheries, the militia <lb/>
that is to be, and increased taxation, while all the time <lb/>
they regard their own private interests, for which they <lb/>
are ready to sacrifice the best interests of the country. <lb/>
Our House of Assembly would be much reduced in <lb/>
importance, and ought also to be considerably reduced <lb/>
in numbers. Subjects of much less importance would <lb/>
occupy the attention of the House than we are accus<lb break="no"/>tomed to deal with, and he (the Speaker) would be <lb/>
much less important than he had been for some years <lb/>
past. But we ought all to regard the public good, and <lb/>
not private and personal considerations. Another <lb/>
beneficial result of Confederation would be that the <lb/>
ascerbity of feeling which had marked our political <lb/>
contests would be done away with. For a long time <lb/>
past there had been a constant struggle tor power be<lb break="no"/>tween the two religious parties into which our popula<lb break="no"/>tion is divided, and election after election was sought <lb/>
to be carried in certain districts by means which we all <lb/>
deprecated. With Confederation the effort would be <lb/> 
to return to the federal House of Commons the ablest <lb/>
men, and those who possessed the greatest share of <lb/>
public confidence, irrespective of creed. Did hon. <lb/>
gentlemen wish to see election riots again? Confed<lb break="no"/>eration would bring larger questions to occupy the <lb/>
attention of politicians. There were parties in this <lb/>
community who traded on their piety, and when they <lb/>
wanted a relative provided for they claimed an ap<lb break="no"/>pointment for him, not on account of his fitness, but <lb/>
said—"it is our right as a religious community." Was <lb/>
that the way to promote the efficiency of the public <lb/>
service? When we were told of the giving away of <lb/>
our Crown lands it appeared to be forgotten that we <lb/>
gave the Telegraph Company fifty square miles of land <lb/>
for the express purpose of having them settled; and <lb/>
the Company, so far as he (the Speaker) knew, had <lb/>
heen unable to induce a single person to settle on these <lb/>
lands; and now we were blamed for giving our Crown <lb/>
lands for a large annual subsidy to the only parties <lb/>
likely to get them settled. But we were told we were <lb/>
giving the Canadians the power to tax us at their <lb/>
pleasure. The power of taxation was necessarily con<lb break="no"/>ceded to the General Parliament, in which there would <lb/>
be representatives from all the colonies. Was it to be <lb/>
supposed that the other Provinces were so much in <lb/>
love with taxation that in order to draw a large reven<lb break="no"/>ue from Newfoundland they would tax themselves <lb/>
heavily? There would be a uniform tariff for the <lb/>
whole Confederation and all would pay alike. But <lb/>
some said there ought to be a stipulation that we <lb/>
should not be required to contribute over a certain <lb/>
amount. The result of that would almost certainly be <lb/>
that as population advanced, and the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment was in a condition to reduce the tariff, we would <lb/>
still be called on for our stipulated amount, much in <lb/>
excess of what we would be required to pay under the <lb/>
then tariff. There was much unreasonable clamour on <lb/>
the subject of taxation, as if wealthy and populous <lb/>
Canada desired to get this impoverished Colony to <lb/>
squeeze out of us the means of augmenting her own <lb/>
large revenue. The very same parties who said this <lb/>
were those who opposed the establishment of consti<lb break="no"/>tutional government here. When a local Legislature <lb/>
was granted after considerable opposition it was con<lb break="no"/>tended that the House of Assembly had no power of <lb/>
taxation, and the then Chief Justice lost his office for <lb/>
having declared that our local Parliament had no pow<lb break="no"/>er of taxation. With responsible government we had <lb/>
no reason to apprehend that the federal administration <lb/>
would propose a high tariff, for no people were in love <lb/>
with being taxed higher than was absolutely necessary. <lb/>
And when he spoke of responsible government, he <lb/>
must admit that he had opposed its introduction here, <lb/>
and he lost his office for it. But he would not now go <lb/>
back to the days of irresponsibility. Who would go <lb/>
back to the tunes preceding 1832? See what advances <lb/>
the country had made since, notwithstanding many <lb/>
disasters. But he was satisfied that under confedera<lb break="no"/>tion we would find such progress as no person at pre<lb break="no"/>sent contemplated. Allied to an extensive, populous <lb/>
and prosperous country, and enjoying frequent com<lb break="no"/>munication by steam, we would be relieved from that <lb/>
isolation which had so long retarded our progress, and <lb/>
then if our import duties should be samewhat higher <lb/>
than now, we would have more means of paving them. <lb/>
One word more on a a subject on which there was a <lb/>
good deal of misapprehension. It was said there had <lb/>
been a concession to other Provinces which we did not <lb/>
get, by which these Provinces would be relieved from <lb/>
the necessity of having recourse to direct taxation. <lb/>
The misapprehension arose from the construction of <lb/>
the following section of the resolutions of the confer<lb break="no"/>ence defining the power of the General Pariiament to <lb/>
make laws for "the imposition or regulation of du<lb break="no"/>ties of Customs on Imports and Exports, except on <lb/>
Exports of Timber, Logs, Masts, Spars, Deals, and <lb/>
Sawn Lumber, and of Coals and other Minerals."— <lb/>
It was inferred from this that it might be contempla<lb break="no"/>ted to impose an export duty on our fish and oil, <lb/>
and that the Delegates from this colony should have <lb/>
stipulated from their exemption from export duty.— <lb/>
But the other Provinces had numerous other exports <lb/>
besides the articles exempted; and the reason why <lb/>
these were especially named was because Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia and New Brunswick now collect export duties on <lb/>
them, which they are entitled to retain, as part of their <lb/>
territorial revenue. In New Brunswick the timber <lb/>
exported is cut on the Crown lands, which are to be <lb/>
retained by the Province, and as a matter of conveni<lb break="no"/>ence, the government of that province, about twenty <lb/>
years ago, discontinued the collection of stumpage, <lb/>
substituting for it an export duty on timber. In the <lb/>
same way in Nova Scotia the Government collect the <lb/>
Royalty on Coal and other minerals by an export duty <lb/>
payable at the Custom-house; and the stipulation <lb/>
referred to merely provided that these provinces <lb/>
should retain that revenue which rightly belonged to <lb/>
them. But as to imposing an export duty on fish and <lb/>
    
    <cb/>
    
oil as a fiscal measure, he (the Speaker) was satisfied <lb/>
no statesman would ever venture to have recourse to <lb/>
it. It would be as reasonable to propose an export <lb/>
duty on flour, which was largely exported from Canada, <lb/>
the effect of which would be to reduce the price of <lb/>
wheat to the farmers of the province, which would de<lb break="no"/>prive any ministry of public confidence and support. <lb/>
He (the Speaker) had no desire by any act of his to <lb/>
hasten the decision of the question; and, he was satis<lb break="no"/>fied, the more the question was considered, the more <lb/>
numerous its supporters would become. He believed <lb/>
also that there was no desire on the part of the <lb/>
government to press the matter, for in the Governor's <lb/>
speech it was not prominently put forward, but came <lb/>
up towards its close. When he (the Speaker) and his <lb/>
colleague returned from the conterence? there was <lb/>
no attempt made on their part to influence public <lb/>
opinion. They did not call meetings. They said they <lb/>
would attempt to influence no man but that when the <lb/>
government convened the Legislature they would be <lb/>
prepared to go into the whole question. The report <lb/>
of the convention had been assailed through the press, <lb/>
and not a single argument was brought forward against <lb/>
it. It was said that the Delegates were influenced by <lb/>
pecuniary motives, that they were to go to the Fede<lb break="no"/>ral Legislature as Councilors, with £1,000 a year for <lb/>
life. There was not one word of truth in the state<lb break="no"/>ment. Whoever went up, would get $6 a day for his <lb/>
services during the season,and his travelling expenses. <lb/>
For his (the Speaker's) own part, he intended to <lb/>
remain in this island all the days of his life; and ex<lb break="no"/>pected no benefit from the Confederation except so far <lb/>
as it would promote the general prosperity, in which <lb/>
he expected to participate. But he did say that it <lb/>
would open up a prospect for the youth of the country, <lb/>
which in his younger days he could not have anticipa<lb break="no"/>ted. He said further, that when the fishermen of the <lb/>
country come to understand it, without whose consent <lb/>
it would not be fair the measure should be passed, they <lb/>
would heartily thank the Delegates for what they had <lb/>
done for them. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:GLEN1">Mr. GLEN</persName> said there were some points in the speech <lb/>
of the Speaker which he thought it necessary to re<lb break="no"/>mark briefly upon. One of those points was that <lb/>
under the Confederation his children and those of <lb/>
others would be benefitted, by having a large field in <lb/>
which to exercise their abilities. But he does not tell <lb/>
us how the children of the fishermen are to be benefit<lb break="no"/>ed. What matters the benefit which may accrue to <lb/>
the few, if the great bulk of the fishermen of the <lb/>
country, who make up its real wealth, are not benefited. <lb/>
I cannot see however that our young men will be any <lb/>
better off under Confederation. than they are now. <lb/>
Canada is as open to them now as it ever can be. There <lb/> 
is nothing whatever to prevent them going there. He <lb/>
says that the assertion that by the resolutions we have <lb/>
given away our fisheries is not true. I say we have <lb/>
given them away. You cannot make a single law in <lb/>
reference to them without the consent of the <lb/>
Federal Parliament. You have no control over <lb/>
them whatever. Is now this giving them away? <lb/>
And to whom do you give them? To Canada, a <lb/>
country which is continually in hot water. She <lb/>
has once rebelled , against Britain, and may do so <lb/>
again. But recently she had again been in difficulty <lb/>
and is at this moment at loggerheads with the United <lb/>
States. And is this the country with which we are <lb/>
asked to ally ourselves, and to whom we are to give <lb/>
up our fisheries? I am satisfied the people will new<lb break="no"/>er consent to any thing of the sort. The Speaker <lb/>
scouts the idea of a militia in this country, but the <lb/>
thing is too serious to be treated in that way. If we <lb/>
adopt the resolutions of the Quebec Conference, we <lb/>
place in the hands of Canada the power to do just as <lb/>
they please with us. Should any difficulty arise be<lb break="no"/>tween that Colony and the United States, we may de<lb break="no"/>pend upon it we shall have to pay our share of the ex<lb break="no"/>penses either in men or money. It is true that our mili<lb break="no"/>tia could not be removed from the Island, but the <lb/>
Canadians might adopt the system of drafting, just as <lb/>
had been done in the United States? There is nothing <lb/>
to prevent their doing so, and it was idle to say they <lb/>
would not. Why should they spare us, and send their <lb/>
own people to the frontier? The best way to secure <lb/>
ourselves against any such contingency is to keep out <lb/>
of the Contederation altogether. In reference to plac<lb break="no"/>ing a tax upon our exports, it was the duty of the de<lb break="no"/>legates to protect us against any such tax. By the re<lb break="no"/>solutions, the exports of Canada, Nova Scotia, and <lb/>
New Brunswick are protected, while our fish and oil <lb/>
are liable to be taxed. I should iike to know what <lb/>
our delegates were thinking about when they assent <lb/>
to such a clause as that? Did they suppose the people <lb/>
of this country would ever agree to such a thing? And <lb/>
then these gentlemen talk of the very good terms we <lb/>
are getting. Why, under the Confederation we will <lb/>
give up to Canada £140,000 or £150,000 a year, be<lb break="no"/>sides our waste lands, mines and minerals, and will <lb/>
receive in return £112,000. They only give us what <lb/>
will pay our necessary expensas, and in years hence <lb/>
may get from us not less than £400,000 a year. <lb/>
As for Canada supplying us with manufactures at <lb/>
a cheaper rate than we get them now, the state<lb break="no"/>ment is preposterous. Canada cannot manufacture <lb/>
sufficieut for her own wants, and it was therefore <lb/>
morally impossible that she could supply us. Besides, <lb/>
they are unable to compete with British manufactures, <lb/>
having, in 1863, imported $16,000,000 of British ma<lb break="no"/>nufactures, and exported about £6000 worth. So <lb/>
that the idea of their supplying us with manufactures <lb/>
at a cheaper rate than we get them now is all non<lb break="no"/>sense. Then they tell us we shall have no extra tax<lb break="no"/>ation. I say we must have it. It is impossible that it <lb/>
can be otherwise. When the expense of an army and <lb/>
navy are considered, when you remember the im<lb break="no"/>mense public works to be carried on, such as railroads, <lb/>
canals and other improvements, and for which we <lb/>
shall have to pay our proportion, our taxes must go <lb/>
up to twenty or twenty-five per cent. In asserting the <lb/>
contrary you are only trying to mystify and humbug <lb/>
the people. You want us to affirm those resolutions, <lb/>
and alterwards, when all the mischief is done, go to <lb/>
the country. My opinion is we had better go to the <lb/>
country first, and let the people affirm the resolutions <lb/>
if they like, Let us know exactly what you do want. <lb/>
Put a resolution in, black and white before the House, <lb/>
so that we may see what you wish us to do. Then <lb/>
we will be prepared to vote upon it. But I am not <lb/>
willing to give away the country yet. Even in the <lb/>
figures attached to your late report you have attempt<lb break="no"/>ed to deceive us, You have got down two sums of <lb/>
£500 each for the Receiver General. First you put <lb/>
down £500 for that official, and then you put down <lb/>
the Custom House expenditure of £6,600 besides, <lb/>
which includes that same £500. Do you mean to <lb/>
have two Receivers General? You had better take <lb/>
back your report and amend it. Whether you do or <lb/>
not, I will uever consent to have those resolutions <lb/>
affirmed until we go to a general election and give <lb/>
the people an opportunity to express their opinions. <lb/></p>

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1865. <lb/></p> 

<p>In the Assembly on Morday last the Address in <lb/>
reply to the opening Speech of His Excellency the <lb/>
Governor passed its final stages, and on the day fol<lb break="no"/>lowing it was presented to His Excellency by the <lb/>
whole House. <lb/></p> 

<p>The following was His Excellency's reply:— <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Honorable the <lb/>
House of Assembly: <lb/>
I receive with great satisfaction your cordial ad<lb break="no"/>dress; I have no doubt that you will bestow careful <lb/>
consideration, upon the several topics which I have <lb/>
recommended to your notice. <lb/>
It will at all times be no less a pleasure than my <lb/>
duty to seek your counsel, to strive to win your con. <lb/>
fidence, and so obtain your co-opeartion, that when <lb/>
our official connection shall terminate, we may look <lb/>
with mutual satisfaction to our common labors for a <lb/>
geºt end, permanently to advance the public welfare <lb/>
of the people among whom we live. <lb/>
I desire to remember that the various classes-of <lb/>
Society are interwoven by a web of such subtle char. <lb/>
acter that they never can be wholly separated, and <lb/>
it cannot be the true interest of the community to <lb/>
Prºmºte the views of any one section at the expense <lb/>
ºf injury to others. I am well aware that it is only <lb/>
by careful investigation of the bearing of questions of <lb/>
social importance upon the general good, keeping in <lb/>
mind those disturbing influences which in smail sºcie<lb break="no"/>fie; will vary the operation of the great laws of Poliſ<lb break="no"/>ical Economy, that the true principles which should <lb/>
govern ſiegislative action can be be ascertained. <lb/>
And I beg you to be assured that it is in this spirit <lb/>
ºf impºrtial enquiry that I have entered upon the new <lb/>
field of duty confided to my discretion. <lb/>
On yesterday the Receiver General laid his finan<lb break="no"/>sial statements on the table. They show on increase <lb/>
of Revenue for 1864, the total being somewhat over <lb/>
£104,000; and an increase of the Floating Debt by <lb/>

The Address of the Council and his Excellency the <lb/>

<p>To His . Excellency ANTHoxy Musgrave, <lb/></p>

<p>- Chief in and over the Island of Newfound. <lb/>

<p>MAY IT PLEASE YoUR ExcELLENCY, <lb/>
We, the Legislative Council in Session convened, thank <lb/>
your Excellency for the gracious Speech with which you <lb/>
have been pleased to open the present Session of the <lb/>
Legislature. <lb/>
Thus meeting your Excellency for the first time, we <lb/>
gladly avail of the occasion to offer our respectful con<lb break="no"/>A gratulations npon your Excellency's assumption of the <lb/>
tº overnment of the British Crown. <lb/>
In the appointment of your Excellency to the office <lb/>
of administering the public affairs of Newfoundland, we <lb/>
recognize another evidence of the desire of Her Majes, <lb/>
ty's Government to consult the best interests of Her <lb/>
Majesty's loyal subjects of this Colony; and we therefore <lb/>
confidently as well as gratefully accept your Excelleney's <lb/>
expession of the deep interest you feel in all that con<lb break="no"/>cerns the welfare of this community, and ot, the anxiety <lb/>
by which you are moved, the motives and feelings by <lb/>
which you will be actuated, and the principles which <lb/>
will guide you in the regulation of your official conluct <lb/>
for the promotion of the common good. <lb/></p> 

<p>| We, on our part, assure your Excellency, that it shall <lb/>
ever be our chief pleasure, as it is no less our bounden <lb/>
duty, in our sphere, to afford to your Excellency, as the <lb/>
Representative of the Crown, that Consututional aid and <lb/>
those loyal, and we trust, wise counsels which you ex<lb break="no"/>press the confident hope will be thoughtfully tendered <lb/>
by the guardians of the public interests and liberties. <lb/>
And we shall at all times esteem it a high privilege to <lb/>
be aided in our deliberations by the fruits of your Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency's thought and observation. <lb/>
We unite with your Excellency in deploring that <lb/>
succession of failures and misfortunes in our chief means <lb/>
industry and our principal sources of wealth which h,s <lb/>
caused unprecedelitea depression and distress; and while <lb/></p> 

<p>is the duty of the Government to afford, such eleemosy<lb break="no"/>nary assistance as will save the most destitute, of our <lb/>
people from the horrors of starvation, we are also im<lb break="no"/>pressed with the necessity of reform in the mode by <lb/>
which pauper relief has been so long administered, and <lb/>
we are of opinion, that in any measure to be proposed <lb/>
for the correction of this evil, provision should be made <lb/>
for requiring a return in labor for relief rendered to the <lb/>
able-budied poor. <lb/>
We look forward with pleasure to the introduction of <lb/>
Bills having in view encouragement to the more exten<lb break="no"/>sive prosecution of the fisheries, and we regard the re<lb break="no"/>sumption of the Bank fishery as an object of the highest <lb/>
importance. <lb/>
Agriculture and those industrial occupations connected <lb/>
with it, which your Excellency commends, might we be<lb break="no"/>lieve be made very valuable auxiliaries to our staple <lb/>
industry, and the legislature should, to the utmost of <lb/>
its power, lend to those objects its encouragement and <lb/>
support. <lb/>
Facilities for communication, both by means of fligh<lb break="no"/>ways and Steaun, we believe to be of the first importance. <lb/>
We regret the iuability of the Government to have aided <lb/>
them to a greater degree than it has, and we lament <lb/>
the fact that failure should have attended some of its <lb/>
efforts to effect improvement in Steam communications <lb/>
We shall endeavour to aid the popular Branch of the <lb/>
Legislature in the Enactment of any Laws tending to the <lb/>
promotion and extension of means of intercourse. <lb/></p> 

<p>We observe with satisfaction that amongst the mea<lb break="no"/>sures of public utility which the Government is about to <lb/>
introduce, there will be one, the aim of which <lb/>
will be a more efficient Educatioual system, and <lb/>
we regard the establishment of a Normal School for <lb/>
the preparation of Teachers as one of great utility, and <lb/>
likely to raise the standard of Education and place it on <lb/>
a much more satisfactory footing. . <lb/>
we concºr with your Exce:1ency in your recommenda. <lb/>
tions regarding the Volunteer organization and Currency <lb/>
Acts, and we are especially favourable to the proposal for <lb/>
the Cousolidation of the Local Laws. - - - <lb break="no"/>The question of Confederation of the British North <lb/>
American Colonies is oue which has now for the first time <lb/>
been submitted for our consideration. - <lb break="no"/>We shall await the further information on which <lb/>
it appears we are to be funished, and we assure you. <lb/>
Excºlency that we shall approach the consideration ºf <lb/>
this subject and of the Report of the lyelegates to which <lb/>
your Excellency refers, impressed with the grave impor: <lb/>
lance the proposition, and in a spirit of caian examina<lb break="no"/>ion a reful enquiry. <lb/>
*:::::. ...i.a to hear of the favourable re<lb break="no"/>sult of the Geological Survey. We concur with jour <lb/>
Excellency in all the observations upon the important <lb/>
subject of Mines and Minerals, and we are forcibly im: <lb/>
pressed with the sense of the obligation which rests <lb/>
alike upon the Government and Legislature to use the <lb/>
amplest and most effectual means within their *. for <lb/>
the encouragement of resources which are of so hopeful a <lb/>
character. <lb/>
We are sensible of the benefits likely to accrue by the <lb/>
successful accomplishment of that great work, the lay<lb break="no"/>ing of the Atlantic Telegraph, which has already been <lb/>
shewn to be a feasible object by its once temporary ºu" <lb/>
tead. <lb/></p> 

<p>Almighty Ruler may bless our common efforts and guide <lb/></p> 

<p>we are sensible that under the present circumstances it' <lb/></p> 

<p>We shall rejoice if closer sommunication with the <lb/>
Mother Country should shortly be permanently establish<lb break="no"/>edin this way j-we shall not fail to value the prominent <lb/>
positiºn we shall then occupy, and we hope it will be <lb/>
regarded as an additional incentive to the cultivation <lb/>
ºf that good understanding amongst ourselves, and that <lb/>
healthful rivalry with other countries which may pro<lb break="no"/>mote the welfare and happiness of our people. We <lb/>
inite with, your Excellency in the prayer that the <lb/></p> 

<p>them to results which may promote the good order, <lb/>
peace, and prosperity of the community to which wi <lb/></p> 

<p>belong. <lb/>

Mr. President and Honorable Gentlemen of the Council, <lb/>
I thank you for your Address, and anticipate with con. <lb/>
fidence the continuance of that cordial feeling with which <lb/>
the . of my administration has so auspiciously com<lb break="no"/>menced, <lb/></p>

        <p rendition="simple:centre">(<hi rendition="simple:italic">Continued</hi>.)</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TALB3">Mr. TALBOT</persName> said he was delighted with the excellent <lb/>
speech which, had just been delivered by the Speaker. <lb/>
He thought, however, when the delegates returned they <lb/>
should have informed their fellow colonists of what they <lb/>
had done in the Conference, and not permitted them to <lb/>
remain in doubt upon so important a matter. Now, for <lb/>
the first time, the Speaker vouchsafes to inform the <lb/> 
public through the House of the proceedings of our <lb/>
delegates at that convention. He had three months to <lb/>
consider what he had to tell us, and to-day has given <lb/>
us the result of his three months' study. He sets out <lb/>
by denying that the speech delivered by His Excellency, <lb/>
on opening the Legislature, was the speech of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernor himself. Now what I said upon that subject was <lb/>
this—I said that the views of the Governor, as expressed <lb/>
in that speech, were diametrically opposed to the views <lb/>
of the ministry, and consequently it was the duty of the <lb/>
latter te resign their seats. It is a principle of Responsi<lb break="no"/>ble Government that when a difference of opinion arises <lb/>
between the Governor and the Executive, when they <lb/>
hold different views in reference to any measure of pub<lb break="no"/>lic policy, then it is the duty of the latter at once to <lb/>
resign their places. This difference of opinion is appar<lb break="no"/>ent bere. The Governor expresses, his belief that the <lb/>
people of the several districts should be taxed for the <lb/>
support of their own poor. The Government say such <lb/>
a system is impracticable, and they decline to entertain <lb/>
it. Under such circumstances it is evident that so long <lb/>
as the present Administration retain power, their Go<lb break="no"/>vernment must be a mere farce—a mockery, a delusion, <lb/>
and a snare. The Speaker spoke of those men who had <lb/>
formerly bolstered themselves into position at the ex<lb break="no"/>pense of the Government and the people. But why does <lb/>
the Speaker recall that? Did he not himself stand at <lb/>
these men's backs, and by his voice do his utmost to <lb/>
sustain them? He says a great deal of clap-trap has <lb/>
recently appeared in the newspapers against confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. What newspapers does he refer to, may I ask? <lb/>
The only published clap-trap I have seen has appeared <lb/>
in these papers which favor his view of the question, and <lb/>
they have contained little else than clan-trap since the <lb/>
hon. Mr. Glen, published some letters in one of the <lb/>
newspapers, which he did over his own signature. He <lb/>
was not afraid to put his views fairly and boldly forward, <lb/>
witn his name attached to them. I apprehend there <lb/>
is no clap-trap about that. The Speaker tells us he <lb/>
expects to live always in the country, that he has <lb/>
children whom he hopes will also spend their days in it, <lb/>
and he asks why, then, should he do anything to injure <lb/>
it? Well, I do not believe he would intentionally do <lb/>
so. Nevertheless, he might do so by an error of judg<lb break="no"/>ment. He might do that which no doubt he would be<lb break="no"/>lieve to be beneficial to the country, yet it might prove <lb/>
exactly the reverse. So that I do not consider that any <lb/>
argument whatever. Nay, I might be justified in re<lb break="no"/>garding it as part and parcel of the clap-trap to which he <lb/>
referred just now. Again, he indignantly asks—would a <lb/>
native be likely to sell his country? Why, of course <lb/>
he would. Who else but a native could sell it? Surely <lb/>
a foreigner would have no right to do it. What does <lb/>
the Speaker mean, then, by so ridiculous a question? <lb/>
I am surplised, however, to find that he sets so very <lb/>
little value upon the fisheries of the country, and that he <lb/>
sneers at the men who carry them on. He says they are <lb/>
degrading us for their own selfish purpose, Well, if the <lb/>
hon gentleman can afford to fall out with the merchants, <lb/>
his principal supporters, I don't know that I have any <lb/>
right to object to his doing so. Still, I cannot agree <lb/>
with him that the merchants are degrading the country. <lb/>
I don't see how we could very well do without them. I <lb/>
observe however, that in one part of his speech he utters <lb/>
a very glaring contradiction. He admits that it would <lb/>
have been a great injury to transfer our fisheries to the <lb/>
Americans, but then it would be a great blessing to <lb/>
transfer them to the Canadians. I don't see the consis<lb break="no"/>tency of such an observation as that. Both the Americans <lb/>
and Canadians have the privilege of fishing in our waters, <lb/>
and I can't imagine what more either of them can <choice><sic>wan</sic><corr>want</corr></choice>. <lb/>
They can catch just as much fish now as they are able to <lb/>
get. More they will not be able to do under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. The hon gentleman repudiates the idea that we <lb/>
shall give away our liberties. But we certainly shall do <lb/>
it if we agree to those resolutions. Don't we give away <lb/>
our fisheries, our lands, our minerals, our revenues, and <lb/>
    our constitution, with the power to tax us <hi rendition="simple:italic">ad libitum</hi>, <lb/>
superadded. Is this not selling our liberties? If it is <lb/>
not, then I do not know what you can call it. I should <lb/>
be glad to think Confederation as good a thing as the <lb/>
Speaker represents it. If I could be convinced that it <lb/>
would be beneficial to the country, and would have the <lb/>
effect of lifting our people out of their present condition <lb/>
of poverty, I would gladly give in my adhesion to it. <lb/>
The Speaker has called our attention to the material pro<lb break="no"/>gress which Canada has made, and to the prosperity of <lb/>
its people. But it the people of Canada were prosperous, <lb/>
they had worked hard for it. They were industrious, <lb/>
and had given their attention to the arts and sciences, <lb/>
as well as to every thing else that could raise them as a <lb/>
people. And now as to taxation: Hon gentlemen should <lb/>
remember there was such a thing as taxing a people to <lb/>
death. It is the last straw that breaks the camel's back. <lb/>
I cannot and do not say our taxes will be raised to so <lb/>
extreme a pitch as some persons imagine, but I think <lb/>
there can be no question they will be higher than they <lb/>
are now, and if the Canada tariff be retained, they will be <lb/>
very much higher. It is a serious thing to place the <lb/>
power of taxing us in the hands of others. But we go <lb/>
further—we give them the privilege of taxing not only <lb/>
        
        <cb/>

our imports, but our exports, our lands, our houses <lb/>
our money, our cattle, everything in short that we have <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
<persName ref="pers:SPEA1">The SPEAKER</persName>—No! No! No! <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
<persName ref="pers:TALB3">Mr. TALBOT</persName>—But it is so. The 29th resolution reads <lb/>
as follows. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
"The General Parliament shall have power to make <lb/>
laws for the peace, welfare and good Government of the <lb/>
Federated Provinces, (saving the Sovereignty of Eng<lb break="no"/>land) and especially Laws respecting the following <lb/>
<choice><sic>subjec s</sic><corr>subjects</corr></choice>:— <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
The Public Debt and Property. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
The Regulation of Trade and Commerce. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
The imposition or regulation of Duties of Customs on <lb/>
Imports and Exports, except on Exports of Timber <lb/>
Logs, Masts, Spars, Deals and Sawn Lumber, and of <lb/>
Coal and other Minerals. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
The imposition or regulation of Excise Duties. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
The raising of money by all or any other modes or <lb/>
systems of Taxation. <lb/></p>
        
        <p>
            <hi rendition="simple:italic">The raising of money by all or any other modes or <lb/>
systems of taxation</hi>. Does it not give the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment unlimited power to tax us how they may please, <lb/>
on what they please, or to any extent they please? If it <lb/>
does not, then I do not know the meaning of words. The <lb/> 
hon, gentleman also says our fishermen, are already <lb/>
taxed fifty or sixty per cent for the supplies they get. <lb/>
Does he mean to say that under the Confederation they <lb/>
won't have to pay anything at all for their supplies? If <lb/>
he does, then I will agree with him that Confederation is <lb/>
a good thing, and I will vote at once for it. But I do <lb/>
not consider the price which a man pays for his supplies <lb/>
as being in,the nature of a tax at all. Again, he says that <lb/>
our lands are valueless to us, but that Canada will give <lb/>
us, £37,500 for them. Now that's disingenuous, to say <lb/>
the least of it. It is true that in a measure our lands are <lb/>
walteless to us, but it is not true that we are to receive <lb/>
£37,500 for them. That amount is included in the <lb/>
general bargain,and is not given for our lands exclusively. <lb/>
Nevertheless, I do say I am greatly pleased with the <lb/>
idea of Confederation. I think it would be beneficial to us <lb/>
in a great many important respects. When I think how <lb/>
we are shut up here in our isolation, sharing so little in <lb/>
the great enterprise, and the civilizing strides that are <lb/>
being made east audwest of us, apparently centent with <lb/>
our own littleness, and occupied almost entirely with <lb/>
our petty party squabbles and our eontemptible secta<lb break="no"/>rian contentions—1 say when I think of these things, I <lb/>
feel that our alliance with the more powerful neighbour<lb break="no"/>ing Colonies would be greatly beneficial. If these evils <lb/>
could be swept away by Colfederation, I would welcome <lb/>
it at any price. I feel,too,that the Speaker does not over<lb break="no"/>rate the inconvenience to which our young men are sub<lb break="no"/>jected here from want of employment, though I doubt <lb/>
the effectiveness of the remedy he sets up. We educate <lb/>
our young men, and for what? Merely that they may <lb/>
walk about the streets, eating out their hearts and brains, <lb/>
and their energy, for lack of occupation. They lose <lb/>
ambition, they lose moral standing, they become a burden <lb/>
to themselves. Our native young men, Mr. Chairman, <lb/>
are not second in industry, in energy, and in ability to <lb/>
any of those of the neighbouring nations. All that they <lb/>
lack to secure to them honorable positions in life, is <lb/>
opportunity. Some who have gone from us have raised <lb/>
themselves to most respectable conditious in life, and <lb/>
there are others yet with us who would do so if the op<lb break="no"/>portunity were given them. Is not that a strong argu<lb break="no"/>ment, then, why we should endeavor to get out of the <lb/>
crawling and creeping solution which wraps us about as <lb/>
a garment? But, Sir, I am not satisfied that Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion will change this for us. If I could be, I would be <lb/>
proud to have confederation as the great panacea. Let <lb/>
us have no clap trap either in this House or out of it <lb/>
ou this question. We are here to elicit truth. It should <lb/>
be our endeavor to avoid all discussion that would lead <lb/>
us away from the truth. Let us know what Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion will do for us, what are the benefits we shall receive <lb/>
and what the sacrifices we shall make for it. But in the <lb/>
meantime uo not ask us to adopt it before we are <lb/>
thoroughly acquainted, with the details. Confederation <lb/>
in the abstract may be good, but the details may be <lb/>
found soune of them to be bad. Let us therefore examine <lb/>
the details first. Therefore approved of them, <lb/>
the House will be prepared to consent to the general <lb/>
principle of Confederation. But most important of all— <lb/>
as we have not been autuorised by our constituents to <lb/>
settle this question, we must before doing so go back to <lb/>
the hustings. If there the people express themselves <lb/>
pleased with Confederation, well and good. If other<lb break="no"/>wise, this measure must not be forced against their will. <lb/></p> 

        <p><persName ref="pers:MARC3">Mr. MARCH</persName>.—When he considered that his estemed <lb/>
            friend the Speaker was one of the delegates who nego<lb break="no"/>tiated the arrangements regarding Newfoundland, he was <lb/>
not surprised at the hon gentleman's anxiety to see them <lb/>
carried into effect. He (Mr. March) had no doubt the <lb/>
Speaker was sincere in the course he took, and that he <lb/>
believed confederation would benefit his native land. <lb/>
But the hon gentleman must allow others the exercise <lb/>
of their own judgment in the matter. Wnen he (Mr. <lb/>
March) referred yesterday to our resources, he spoke of <lb/>
nothing that could be considered at all impossible, or <lb/>
which we might not anticipate seeing realized. All who <lb/>
had seen the fine land at the head of our bays must <lb/>
regret that so many of our people remained settled on <lb/>
the headiands following a precarious fishery, while they <lb/>
might settle in these fine bays and engage in the culti<lb break="no"/>vation of as fine land as any in America, and at the same <lb/>
time attend to the fisnery aiver getting in their crops, <lb/>
as many of the Nava Scotia fishermen did. When he <lb/>
(Mr. March) spoke of having 400,000 seals and 1,000,<lb break="no"/>000 quintals codfish this season, he said nothing that we <lb/>
had not seen within a few years past; and he (Mr. <lb/>
March) had trust in Divine Providence that we were <lb/>
not to be visited with short fisheries every year. And <lb/>
wnen he said it was better for them to look to the re<lb break="no"/>sources of their own country for the re-establishment of <lb/>
their prosperity, than to rush into an aliance with <lb/>
Canada, he spoke the sectinents of the vast majority of <lb/>
the people of Newfoundland. He (Mr. Marcu) did say <lb/>
that we ought not to come to any decision on that <lb/>
question without conszlting the people, whose interests <lb/>
were entrasted to our care. Look at the prospects held <lb/>
out for the reciprocity treaty by its advocates, when <lb/>
they were desirous of having it carried. All the dilapi<lb break="no"/>dated establishments in the outpurts were to be built <lb/>
up, and occupied by the Americans who had previously <lb/>
carried on the fishery from the ports of their own <lb/>
country; and wealth was to flow in upon us, such as we <lb/>
had never seen before. Had these anticipatious been <lb/>
realized? Not one of them. The Americans carried <lb/>
on the fishery as they had always done, only the treaty <lb/>
gave away to them the right of our fisheries, which we <lb/>
should never have parted with to any foreign power. <lb/>
            Look at the consequence of the privleges, <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> by the <lb/>
British Government to the French. The French alone <lb/>
took away more fish than all Newfoundland. If he could <lb/>
accomplish it, he would cut off the supply of bait to the <lb/>
            French at St. Peter's. The last remniant of our fishery <lb/>
at Labrador was invaded by them; and we were not <lb/>
allowed to exclude them because of the friendly feeling <lb/> 
        
        <cb/>

between England and France. We wanted no Cana<lb break="no"/>dians to stand by us. Let us protect our own interests. <lb/>
Then there was the line of Galway steamers which was <lb/>
to do so much for us. What did they cost us? £8,000 <lb/>
a year of our money was expended in subsidising these <lb/>
steamers, from which so little benefit was derived. All <lb/>
we required was a steamer to take the buyers from the <lb/>
importing houses home and out again twice a year. He <lb/>
(Mr. March) represented a constituency of 10,000, and <lb/>
the people had returned him four times without opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, and was he to be a party to giving away their <lb/>
country to the Canadians without their consent? They <lb/>
were good men and true, and their rights must not thus <lb/>
be given away. He would consider himself a traitor to <lb/>
their best interests were he to consent to the convention <lb/>
without their consent. We had no right do anything <lb/>
further than give our opinion, and then let the matter <lb/> 
go to the country. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SHEA2">Mr. SHEA</persName> complained of the irrelevant matter that <lb/>
had been imported into the discussion. The suggestions as <lb/>
to what might be done by the fishermen of the Colony, <lb/>
in resorting to agriculture as an auxiliary resource, be<lb break="no"/>trayed a very limited and imperfect knowledge of their <lb/>
circumstances. How many of them were absent during <lb/>
a great part of the season? And in the town of St. <lb/>
John's, where so many of them reside, where was the <lb/>
land which they might cultivate? For these people the <lb/>
two pursuits were incompatible, and either one or ths <lb/>
other must be abandoned. The hon member who spoke <lb/>
last referred to the Reciprocity Treaty, which he said <lb/>
had proved a failure. He (Mr. Shea) feared the time <lb/>
was not far distant when they would learn by its loss <lb/>
how valuable this measure had been to the Colony. <lb/>
When it was unter discussion last session, the benefits <lb/>
of the Treaty had been attested by evidence from both <lb/>
sides of the House, and the only difference that arose <lb/>
was as to the best uneans of securing its removal. The <lb/>
value of that Treaty in enhancing the worth of the oils <lb/>
and pickled fish of this country, was established by the <lb/>
clearest and most incontrovertible testimony, and he <lb/>
only regretted that the present aspect of the question <lb/>
foreboded the loss of these advantages. As for the <lb/>
right of the Americans to fish on the coast, guaranteed <lb/>
by the Reciprocity Treaty, it was a privilege that had <lb/>
not been availed of; nor would it be in the nature of <lb/>
things, while they possessed the more valuable right of <lb/>
fishing on the Labrador coast, secured them by the <lb/>
Treaty of 1818. Respecting the important question <lb/>
immediately before the committee, he would refer to <lb/>
the circumstances under which the question of a Union <lb/>
of the Provinces presented itself to their consideration. <lb/>
Sometime in September last a communication was receie<lb break="no"/>ved from the Canadian Government, inviting this Colo<lb break="no"/>ny to join in a Conference of Delegates from all the <lb/>
British North American Provinces, to be held at Quebec <lb/>
on the 10th October, to consider the subject of a Union <lb/>
of the whole. The Government of this Colony very <lb/>
wisely felt that in the consideration of such a question <lb/>
all party views should be ignored, and in deciding to <lb/>
accept the proposal, they did me the honour to invite <lb/>
me to be the associate of the hon Speaker, as the Dela<lb break="no"/>gation from this country, the same principle being adop<lb break="no"/>ted by all the other Provinces in the formation of their <lb/>
Delegations. We had no power to bind the Colony to <lb/>
any proposal that might be made, but simply to inquire <lb/>
and report as to the decisions at which the Conference <lb/>
might arrive. The Government, under all the circum<lb break="no"/>ces, would be wrong in giving any more enlarged autho<lb break="no"/>rty; and for his (Mr. Shea's) part, he would not have <lb/>
accepted the position if it involved any greater power <lb/>
than was conferred upon the Delegates. The idea of a <lb/>
confederation of the Provinces, though new in this Co<lb break="no"/>lony, was familiar enough to the people of the other <lb/>
Provinces. When Lord Durham came out from Eng<lb break="no"/>land to inquire into the so-called rebellion, among the <lb/>
measures suggested by him was a union of the whole of <lb/>
these Colonies, for the purposes of strength, and moral <lb/>
and material advancement. The subject, since that <lb/>
time, has occasionally been under discussion in Canada <lb/>
and Nova Scotia, and the conclusion invariably arrived <lb/>
at was that the measure would tend to advance the gen<lb break="no"/>eral prosperity.—It has never been dealt with as a par<lb break="no"/>ty question, and men of all shades of politics amongst <lb/>
the most enlightened of our Colonial statesmen, recorded <lb/>
their deliberate opinions in its favor. But until now the <lb/>
inquiry has never been gone into with a view to a definite <lb/>
result, and it therefore assumes an aspect of greater im<lb break="no"/>portance, and naturally attracts a larger share of public <lb/>
attention than ever before was found to wait upon it. It <lb/>
will be remembered that when the subject was first <lb/>
named in the last summer, a general desire seemed to <lb/>
pervade the public of this country that we should not be <lb/>
excluded from any measure of Union the other colonies <lb/>
might be disposed to form; and the Government were <lb/>
criticised with severity for their supposed hostility to <lb/>
the question, in which it was contended that great <lb/>
benefit would be found for the people of this colony. <lb/>
He (Mr. Shea) was suprised to find that the hon meta<lb break="no"/>ber for St. John's, on his right, who in September last, <lb/>
through his journal, was prominent amongst these critics, <lb/>
should now come forward as an opponent of a course he <lb/>
then advocated go strongly. (The hon gentleman hero <lb/>
read from the Palriot some strong observations in con<lb break="no"/>demnation of the government for not having adopted <lb/>
measures to have this country represented at the <lb/>
Charlottetown Convention, and deprecating the view <lb/>
that they represented the people in their indifference or <lb/>
hostility to a union of the colonies.) He did not say it <lb/>
was not competent to any man to change his opinions; <lb/>
but when statements so adverse to each other are found <lb/>
coming from the same tips, in the short space of time that <lb/>
has elapsed since September last, the individual has <lb/>
at least no right to the character of a reliable authoro<lb break="no"/>ty. But the non gentleman says he was favorable to <lb/>
a Legislative Union of the Martime Provinces, though <lb/>
opposed to a federal union of the whole. He failed to. <lb/>
draw any such distinction when he wrote in September, <lb/>
but he spoke generally of a union, of the Provinces, and <lb/>
quoted Mr. McGee, who it is well known is a Minister <lb/>
of the Clown in Canada, and never advocated any inea<lb break="no"/>sure of un on that did not comprehend all the Provin<lb break="no"/>ces, as embraced in the resolutious of the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference, But he would take the hon gentleman on his <lb/>
own ground, and see the position in which his argument <lb/>
placed him. He objects to a federal union, as proposad <lb/>
by the Conference, because it abstracts from the authority <lb/>
of our present Legislature, though he avows himself <lb/>
favorable to a Legislative union, which would annihilate <lb/>
our local constitution. Can anything more illogical or <lb/>
    <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> be imagined? He objects strongly to the <lb/>
loss of a part, but is quite willing that our Local In<lb break="no"/>stitutions should be entirely swept away! This <lb/>
is the position, the honoravle gentleman places <lb/>
himself in by his attempt to escape from the <lb/>
conspicuous inconsistency of his conduct. But a <lb/>
Legislative union, which would extinguish the local <lb/>
constitutions, was found to be impracticable, and the <lb/>
Charlottetown Conference was a forregone failure, <lb/>
and must have ended without a result, even though <lb/>

it had not been interrupted by the presence of the <lb/>
Canadian Ministers. The lower Provinces are all too <lb/>
    <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> importance for any to be willing to <lb/>
concede to one of then the priority which would be <lb/>
conferred on the head of such a combination, while <lb/>
the proposition was embarrassed also by the loss of <lb/>
    local <hi rendition="simple:italic">prestige</hi>, and the great practical inconvenience <lb/>
of leaving matters of a purely local character to be <lb/>
decided by a general government, where the circum<lb break="no"/>stane is could not be understood, and where special <lb/>
knowlelge was required for their management. Under <lb/>
such constitution it is manifest that the local affairs <lb/>
of the several outlying Provinces would be neglected, <lb/>
and all these considerations doubtless had their <lb/>
weight in leading the Charlottetown Conference to <lb/>
abandon the design of a Legislative union of the <lb/>
three Lower Provinces. On the arrival of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Delegates the larger plan proposed by them <lb/>
attracted the favorable attention of the Conference, <lb/>
whose proceedings were then adjourned to Halifax, <lb/>
and subsequently to Quebec, where the whole matter <lb/>
was again carefully gone into, and after the most <lb/>
mature consideration of eighteen days, the Report <lb/>
now presented was agreed to. It proposes a consti<lb break="no"/>tution based as nearly as circumstances would per<lb break="no"/>mit, on the principles of the British constitution, and <lb/>
while of the Federal character, avoids the promi<lb break="no"/>nent causes of weakness and failure which the work<lb break="no"/>ing of the American system has disclosed. It con<lb break="no"/>templates a General Government, and a Legislature <lb/>
of two Houses, the Uppernominated for life by the <lb/>
General Government composed of 76 members, <lb/>
and the Lower House composed of 193 members, <lb/>
based on the principle of population, to be elected <lb/> 
by the several Colonies forming parts of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation. To this General Government and <lb/>
Legislature will be confided the larger powers now <lb/>
possessed by the several local Governments, con<lb break="no"/>ferring on it the amount of authority necessary for <lb/>
the due conservation and protection of the interests <lb/>
of the several communities whose guardianship it <lb/>
would assume. There was not in this arrangement, <lb/>
as had been represented for unworthy porposes and <lb/>
to raise a cry amongst the unlettered and unwary, <lb/>
any selling of the interests of one Colony to another, <lb/>
but a proposal is made by which the several Colo<lb break="no"/>nies, on principles of honorable and equitable part<lb break="no"/>nership, agree to concede a certain portion of the <lb/>
powers they severally possess, to a Central Authority <lb/>
in which they are fairly represented, and where the <lb/>
aggregate of these powers may be used with greatly <lb/>
increased efficacy for common purposes of public ad<lb break="no"/>vantage. The Local Government would be retained, <lb/>
with smaller powers, having under its control the <lb/>
expenditure of eighty thousand pounds stg. per annum, <lb/>
and the management of peculiarly local affairs. The <lb/>
roads, public Institutions,and other kindred matters <lb/>
would be in the hands of the Local Legislature; but <lb/>
the operations of the General Government would be <lb/>
entirely independent of the action of the Local Bo<lb break="no"/>dies. The modifications of the present Local Gov<lb break="no"/>ernmental machinery are left to the several Bodies <lb/>
themselves, to determine according to the peculiar cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances of each Colony but the necessity of reduc<lb break="no"/>cing them, in one shape of another, to meet the altered <lb/>
condition of affairs, and lessen the expenses would not <lb/>
be a matter of question. The Report embodying the <lb/>
terms of this constitution was signed by his colleague <lb/>
and himself, in conjunction with the other members of <lb/>
the Conference. It had been said they had no author<lb break="no"/>ity to sign that document; but he disputed the grounds <lb/>
of the assertion. TheColony was not bound by their act, <lb/>
and this was fully explained and understood at the con<lb break="no"/>ference. The Report was waste paper without the sig<lb break="no"/>natures of the Delegates, but beyond that, said Mr. Shea, <lb/>
my hon Colleague and myself subscribed our hand, in <lb/>
testimony of our approval of the terms and principles it <lb/>
embraces; and we are here ready to justify our act, and <lb/>
to explain the reasons which brought our minds to this <lb/>
conclusion. It had been urged by some hon member, <lb/>
in thoughtless ignorance of the nature of the discus<lb break="no"/>sion, that the Conference should not have been held <lb/>
with closed doors. He (Mr. Shea) regretted that <lb/>
secrecy was a necessary condition of the deliberations <lb/>
of that Conference, for it would have been well had it <lb/>
been possible that the whole public of British North <lb/>
America, were present, to be witnesses of the great <lb/>
ability displayed by the prominent statesmen of the <lb/>
sister provinces, their grasp of mind, and the singleness <lb/>
of purpose which animated their course, with the deep <lb/>
sense of responsibility felt by all who took part in these <lb/>
proceedings of high historic interest and grave importance. <lb/>
The spectacle would have done good to the people whose <lb/>
interests were at stake, and have frowned down the <lb/>
narrow minded and ignorant views we now see exhib<lb break="no"/>ited in certain quarters, of that work and the men who <lb/>
were its promoters. It is said by some that Canada <lb/>
seeks the alliance for her own purposes: No doubt <lb/>
some constitutional change had become necessary in <lb/>
Canada; and doubtless it was the exigency of their own <lb/>
circumstances that induced the movement they had now <lb/>
made, but how does this affect the question in our <lb/>
regard? It is neither inapplicable to us or otherwise <lb/>
merely from the fact of is being desired by Canada; <lb/>
and we also, as well as they, will deal with it from . <lb/>
selfish point of view, and carry out the principles which <lb/>
regulate trade and all the ordinary transactions of men. <lb/>
If a confederation of the provinces does not commend it<lb break="no"/>self to the intelligent Judgment of the people of these <lb/>
colonies, as a measure of progress, it will not <choice><sic>avai</sic><corr>avail</corr></choice> <lb/>
Canada much that she stands in need of its accomplish<lb break="no"/>ment. But have other colonies no need? Are we in <lb/>
that pairny state at the present moment, or are our pros<lb break="no"/>pects so bright and our general condition so independent, <lb/>
that we may not find it good to inquire whether the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity of Canada may not be our opportunity of escaping <lb/>
from the deprivations of our isolated and powerless state? <lb/>
It had been stated among the objections to this scheme, <lb/>
that we should be at the mercy of Canada, with our <lb/>
small representation of eight members in the General <lb/>
Assembly. Canada is regarded as a large mamoth state, <lb/>
intent only on devouring all its smailer associates. We <lb/>
de not find in the history of combinations like this, that <lb/>
the smaller states have causes of complaint from the ex<lb break="no"/>ercise of undue influence on the part of the larger. It has <lb/>
never been found that the little state of Rhode Island <lb/>
suffers aggression at the hands of the Americsn union. <lb/>
If Canada had the power, it would not be her interest to <lb/>
pursue any unjust or injarious policy towards the lesser <lb/>
confederates. In our case she would desire to be our <lb/>
supplier of the greater part of what we consume, and this <lb/>
would give her a direct interest in our well-being and <lb/>
advancement. But would the power lie with Canada to <lb/>
tax or otherwise oppress us? Hon gentlemen seem to <lb/>
forget that Canada is two provinces, not much in accord <lb/>
in feeling or sentiment, or interest. These provinces <lb/>
    are seperated by causes of the most abiding nature— <lb/>
    differences of race, religion, language, <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> ana<lb break="no"/>gorisms, which have now brought the Government of <lb/>
the country to a deadlock, and which bar all prospect of <lb/>
their becoming a homogeneous people. In the Upper <lb/>
Province, the population is British and Protestant. In <lb/>
the Lower Province, French and Catholic; and it is <lb/>
remarkable how litle the races have mingled, though <lb/>
living side by side for generations past. In the Lower <lb/>
Province you see the French character as distinctly pre<lb break="no"/>served as in any part of old France, and they adhere to <lb/>
their institutions with even poetic tenancy. Nothing <lb/>
more unreasonable can be imagined than the combina<lb break="no"/>tion of two Provinces so circumstanced, for any purpose <lb/>
of aggresssion on our rights, even if their sense of honor <lb/>
or uprightness could not be relied on, which he (Mr. <lb/>
        
        <cb/>
        
        
Shea) would <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>be</corr></choice> sorry to distrust. Between these <lb/>
    Provinces—Upper Canada with her 82 members, and <lb/>
Lower Canada with 65—the 47 members from the <lb/>
Lower Provinces would necessarily, in any inteligent <lb/>
view of the case, exercise a power almost of command<lb break="no"/>ing influence, and the common interest of the Lower <lb/>
Provinces would always join them together whenever <lb/>
the occasion was of adequate importance. The saftey <lb/>
of our position in this respect will be easily understood <lb/>
by any one commonly observant of the working of <lb/>      
the British Parliament, and the influence of even <lb/>
smaller relative combinations in affecting, and control<lb break="no"/>ling the decisions of that great body. There appear<lb break="no"/>ed to be much anxiety in this country as respects the <lb/>
taxation under the Confederation. He (Mr. Shea) <lb/>
was not then going into a particular discussion of that <lb/>
question, which would more properly come on when <lb/>
the resolutions were formally submitted, but he de<lb break="no"/>nied the statements that had been made as to the <lb/>
amount of the increase of our burthens, and would be <lb/>
prepared to show, at least, that if there was any in<lb break="no"/>crease under the change, the most full and intelligible <lb/>        
equivalents would be given for it. That is not taxa<lb break="no"/>tion in the sense in which this cry is raised, where <lb/>
the Colony receives a value for the outlay. The tax<lb break="no"/>ation of Canada had been referred to as excessive; <lb/>
but when he saw what had been accomplished in that <lb/>
country, its Railways, Canals and other extended means <lb/>
of communication, adding to its wealth and population <lb/>
and increasing the value of the labour of <lb/>
the people, he felt with how much reason, we <lb/>
should rejoice, if by means of increased taxation, <lb/>
we could be made to realise similar results. The <lb/>
mere cry of taxation, can be made to serve the <lb/>
purpose of stirring up thoughtless public felling; but <lb/>
no intelligent man will fail to see that taxation, well <lb/>
applied, is necessary to enhance the value of labour, <lb/>
by opening up the sources of a people's industry. But <lb/>
they had been told that by Confederaion they would <lb/>
give up their liberties, in relinquishing their present <lb/>
rights of independent legislation, and various speeches <lb/>
and newspaper articles had been quoted in support of <lb/>
this view. Most of them had beard of Archbishop <lb/>
Connolly, of Halifax, who had recently written on this <lb/>
subject; and what are his opinion on this point? He <lb/>
says—"Confederation, instead of depriving us of the <lb/>
privilege of self-government, is the only practicable <lb/>
and reliable guarantee for its continuance"—"I yield <lb/>
"to no man in my heartfelt appreciation of the bless<lb break="no"/>"ings we all enjoy in this country, and I ask for no<lb break="no"/>"thing more than to be able to calculate on their <lb/>
    "Continuance—<hi rendition="simple:italic">Sed hoc opus, hic labor est.</hi>—This is <lb/>
"the difficulty, and I will say, with all candour, the <lb/>
"only difficulty for me and all others who have every<lb break="no"/>"thing to lose. No country situated as Nova Scotia <lb/>
"is, with a vast area and a sparse population, can <lb/>
"reasonably hope to maintain its independence for <lb/>
"any considerable period. Unless we are to be a single <lb/>
"exception and an anomaly in the history of nations, <lb/>
"some change must come, and come soon." This <lb/>
was the opinion of a gentleman of profound learning, <lb/>
and independently of what they knew of his great <lb/>
worth, the letter bespeaks the philosophic statesman <lb/>
and a mind stored with the treasures of historic lore, <lb/>
which could not fail to command respectful attention. <lb/>
—He tells us of the tendencies of the age and the <lb/>
great forces that are at work in the near vicinity of <lb/>
these Provinces, which warn us of the necessity of <lb/>
preparation, and we in Newfoundland, isolated though <lb/>
we are, cannot, if we would, separate ourselves from <lb/>
our neighbours and their destiny. It had been object<lb break="no"/>ed that the Federal Government had the power to tax <lb/>
fixed property in this country. But such was not the <lb/>
case. The power of direct taxation is reserved to the <lb/>
several Local Governments, and it cannot be imposed <lb/>
except by them. Exception was also taken to the <lb/>
fact, that our fish and oil were not secured against <lb/>
taxation by the General Government, while timber <lb/>
and coal were reserved. It will be observed that the <lb/>
Local Revenues are reserved for the use of each Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and the provision made in the cases specified is <lb/>
merely made to preserve the duties on these articles <lb/>
for their legitimate purposes. In the Timber Colonies <lb/>
there was a direct import called stumpage, under <lb/>
which duties were collected on the ground, but this <lb/>
was found inconvenient, and a tax on this export was <lb/>
accordingly substituted. If this export duty were not <lb/>
protected fro, the operation of the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and given to the local bodies, the latter would <lb/>
have been compelled to revert to the old plan of stum<lb break="no"/>page; and the same applies to the coal of Nova Scotia, <lb/>
from which the colony finds it more convenient to <lb/>
obtain its revenue by an export tax. But the great <lb/>
grain trade of Canada, its provisions and other exports, <lb/>
and the fish and oil of Nova Scotia, are not protected <lb/>
against taxation, any more than our produce, for the <lb/>
reason that a tax on exports is a solecism in finance, <lb/>
and exploded from all sound doctrines on that subject <lb/>
and he (Mr. Shea,) for his own part, would as soon <lb/>
think of asking the British Parliament to give a guar<lb break="no"/>antee they would not reimpose the Corn Laws, or <lb/>
repeal the Enancipation Act. But if hon gentlemen <lb/>
were sceptical, all doubts on this point might probably <lb/>
be set at rest. It was also said that we gave up the <lb/>
control of our fisheries to Canada, which was a most <lb/>
unfair mode of putting the case. Whatever we gave <lb/>
up, it was to the Government of which Nova Scotia, <lb/>
New Brunswick, P. E. Island and ourselves were to <lb/>
form parts, as well as Canada. These Colonies at <lb/>
present have equal rights with our own in the fisher<lb break="no"/>ies, and have all a large direct interest in their pro<lb break="no"/>tection. Where then might the power be more wisely <lb/>
placed than in the hands of a Government that repre<lb break="no"/>sented the whole people whose property these fisheries <lb/>
are? But it was not entirely so placed, for a concur<lb break="no"/>rent authority is reserved to our own Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to protect the fisheries; and who can suppose <lb/>
this local right can ever be injariously interfered with? <lb/>
The British Government now exercise sovereign con<lb break="no"/>trol, and we saw in 1857 how that might be employed <lb/>
to our great detriment. The fisheries of Maine and <lb/>
Massachusets are under Federal control, being gen<lb break="no"/>eral property, as the fisheries of these colonies are <lb/>
general property also, and would be righty amenable <lb/>
to the supervision of the Central Government. The <lb/>
surrender of our minds and minerals to the General <lb/>
Government was also urged as a cause of complaint by <lb/>
those who sought every pretext to depreciate the <lb/>
measure. The surrender, in this case, was met by a <lb/>
very substanial consideration of one hundred and fifty <lb/>
thousand dollars. The mines, however, were not given <lb/>
away, but the right was conferred on the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of legislation for them. To his (Mr. Shea's) <lb/>
mind, there was a great advantage in this arrangement, <lb/>
apart from the sum they were to receive. It had long <lb/>
been a matter of question what our resources were, in <lb/>
this respect, and the Local Government had not the <lb/>
means to make the necessary requires. Last year a <lb/>
feeble effort was made in that direction, but it is man<lb break="no"/>ifest that it would take many years to unfold those <lb/>
resources, if the investigation proceeded on so small a <lb/>
scale. The General Government have the means to <lb/>
prosecute the necessary researches in an active and <lb/>
enlarged way, and for whom, but for our own people, <lb/>
with these treasures be available, if they really exist? <lb/>
It will be easy as at present to obtaian a grant of <lb/>
land or a mining lease, and the parties on the spot <lb/>
must ever have an advantage over all others. Our <lb/>
mines can only be taken away by employing our peo<lb break="no"/>ple to work them; and he only hoped they might soon <lb/>
be taken away on these conditions. But, he would ask, <lb/>
under what circumstances these objections are made— <lb/>
        
        <cb/>
        
objections, too, which a little examination so easily <lb/>
dissipates. Hon gentlemen seem content with oppos<lb break="no"/>ing this scheme, implying that in the state of things <lb/>  
now staring us in the face, we should stand still. Look <lb/>
abroad over the face of the country, and let us ask <lb/>
ourselves if the present condition of the people can <lb/> 
safely continue? Large numbers of our industrious <lb/>
population are, at the present moment, not half fed. <lb/>
And this, under varying circumstances as to localities, <lb/>
has been their lot for many years past, as the amount <lb/>
given for poor relief abundantly testified. We <lb/>
see the population decaying from this cause, <lb/>
and while numbers of those who can resort <lb/>
to emigration, to seek elsewhere the reward <lb/>
which here they cannot get for their labor. <lb/>
And yet, in presence of these facts, it is said we <lb/>
should wait idly by, and live in hopes of better times. <lb/>
We all hope, of course, for these better times, but <lb/>
experience teaches us the true nature of that reliance. <lb/>
Let us look back over the past twenty years. In that <lb/>
time we have had as large a share of prosperous sea<lb break="no"/>sons as we can reasonably look for in any correspond<lb break="no"/>ing future period. And yet what are its results, as <lb/>
disclosed in the present condition of the country? We <lb/>
believe we have resources that, if brought to light, <lb/>
would provide that further employment for want of <lb/>
which our people now suffer. But what are the ex<lb break="no"/>isting agencies by which these means of employment <lb/>
can be effectively brought out? The Legislature has <lb/>
tried its powers in many ways, but to little purpose. <lb/>
We have had fishery reports and Agricultural Com<lb break="no"/>mittees, and devices of one kind and another, and the <lb/>
result of all has been abortive. What, then, can our <lb/>
Legislature do—this "independent" Legislature, the <lb/>
powers of which hon. gentlemen seem so unwilling to <lb/>
abridge? It was evident that its powers were une<lb break="no"/>qual to the emergency that we have had to deal with <lb/>
for past years. No wonder it should be so, when we <lb/>
look at the constitution and the inevitable proceedings <lb/>
of this Assembly. We are here (continued Mr. Shea) <lb/>
rival parties, one having possession of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment whose chief aim was to keep themselves in office, <lb/>
and who made every public question subordinate to <lb/>
this object. On the other hand is an opposition intent <lb/>
on displacing the Government, and equally with their <lb/>
opponents discarding all measures that came into con<lb break="no"/>flict with the main design. Some will tell you that <lb/>
better things and sounder legislation may be looked <lb/>
for when better men obtain seats in the Assembly. <lb/>
But it is idle to suppose that any possible change of <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">personnel</hi> will lead to any marked difference in result <lb/>
where the other conditions and circumstances remain <lb/>
unaltered. We have here a signal illustration of the <lb/>
value of our "independent" legielation; nor are we <lb/>
very different in this respect from some of our neigh<lb break="no"/>bouring provinces. And it is, therefore, no wonder <lb/>
that the conviction should be forcing itself on the <lb/>
minds of prominent public men in these colonies, that <lb/>
for the higher purposes of legislation the present con<lb break="no"/>stitutions are not equal to the task. I do not (said <lb/>
Mr. Shea) mean that it should be concluded that a <lb/>
union of the provinces is the necessary remedy for <lb/>
existing evils; but a contemplation of our present <lb/>
position should at last incline us to look with impar<lb break="no"/>tial minds on any proposal which gave promise of bene<lb break="no"/>ficial results. He indulged in no Utopian views of the <lb/>
results of confederation, but all history and experience <lb/>
gave evidence of the general beneficial tendency of <lb/>
such combinations. We saw the advantage of Con<lb break="no"/>federation in our own case in 1857, when on appeal to <lb/>
    the other Provinces they all made common disuse with <lb/>
us, and induced the Home Government to withdraw <lb/>
the French Convention. The effects are strikingly <lb/>
shown in the case of the Canadas, which have more <lb/>
than doubled in wealth and population since their <lb/>
union. Does any rational man believe that the <lb/>
United States could have become what they now are, <lb/>
had they remained so many political fragments since <lb/>
the time of their separation from the mother country? <lb/>
He had heard the strange argument, that the present <lb/>
war was the cousequence of the Union, but this he <lb/>
thought could hardly have been seriously put. The <lb/>
war arose, as had long been foreseen, out of the sla<lb break="no"/>very question; but the world stood amazed at the <lb/>
marvelous resources of America, of which the war <lb/>
had given evidence, showing what the union had done <lb/>
for the development of the wealth of the country. If <lb/>
the war is to be quoted as an argument against union, <lb/>
we must go back and condemn the British con<lb break="no"/>stitution because of the Wars of the Roses and of <lb/>
the Commonwealth. Are we not justified then, <lb/>
looking at the progress of the United States, in be<lb break="no"/>lieving that a union of these Provinces would lead <lb/>
to at least somewhat similar results? They are not <lb/>
more dissimilar in any circumstances, and far less so <lb/>
in some others, than many of the United States. <lb/>
What diversity can be more plain than that between <lb/>
Maine and California? The one a fishing and lum<lb break="no"/>bering country, with severe winters, the other rich in <lb/>
mines and all the fruits of the earth, rejoicing in the <lb/>
enjoyment of perpetual summer. This very diversity <lb/>
of circumstances is often an argument in favor of <lb/>
unjon, aad not against it, for it gives a country within <lb/>
itself those elements of interchange on which commerce <lb/>
is built up, and which, in the present war in <choice><sic>Americs</sic><corr>America</corr></choice>, <lb/>
has rendered the country so largely independent of <lb/>
external aid. Instead of seeing, therefore, in the <lb/>
alieged difference between this and the other Provin<lb break="no"/>ces a reason against Confederation, it seemed to him <lb/>
to lead to the opposite conclusion. We have in these <lb/>
North American Provinces, at the present time, a <lb/>
larger population and greater wealth that was possessed <lb/>
by the United States when they formed their utilon. <lb/>
There is the agriculture and mines and timber of <lb/>
Canada, the coal and lumber and agriculture of New <lb/>
Brunswick, the agriculture and fisheries and mines of <lb/>
Nova Scotia, the garden of Prince Edward Island <lb/>
and the fisheries and mines of Newfoundland, <lb/>
forming an amount of combined wealth such as <lb/>
few countries can boast of. And we have <lb/>
the British Government urging us, in all friend<lb break="no"/>liness, to make this a common country, and unite our <lb/>
energies for its advancement, with the assurance that <lb/>
while we need it, we can rely on their support and pro<lb break="no"/>tection. He (Mr. Shea) was strong in the conviction <lb/>
that his Colony would be a great gainer by the pro<lb break="no"/>posed union; but he nevertheless would deprecate any <lb/>
undue haste in bringing the House to a conclu<lb break="no"/>sion upon it. The public required fuller information, <lb/>
and time to digest it; and he felt it would be wrong to <lb/>
hassen a decision, until the opportunity for full inquiry <lb/>
had been afforded, The question of the Militia had <lb/>
been used by the smaller opponents of the measure. <lb/>
and the fears of the ignorant had been imposed on by <lb/>
the cry that they would be sent out of the country by <lb/>
force, to defend the Canadian frontier. He (Mr. <lb/>
Shea) thought a Militia force unsuited to this coun<lb break="no"/>try, where the avocations of the people compel them <lb/>
to be absent from home during a great part of <lb/>
the year, and their presence could not, therefore, be <lb/>
relief on in case of emergency. But few were so <lb/>
ignoraat as not to know that a Militia force could <lb/>
not be sent from the Colony, being entirely for <lb/>
purposes of home defence. Canada has her frontier to <lb/>
defend, and her Miiitia is most efficient. But they <lb/>
err who think the British troops will be withdrawn, <lb/>
or that the cost of our defences is to be wholly cast <lb/>
on ourselves. But supposing they were, what alter<lb break="no"/>native have we but to submit? Soon, however, is not <lb/>
the intention of the Government, as far as he (Mr. Shea) <lb/>
could gather it from well informed sources. Nor <lb/>
would it comport with the relations that will exist be<lb break="no"/>tween Great Britain and the Confederacy. While we      
are liable to be involved in Imperial war, our right to <lb/>
protection is a necessary consequence; and it will not <lb/>
be withheld. But some say—"let us remain as we <lb/>
are." He (Mr. Shea) would show that we cannot <lb/>        
remain as we are if the other provinces confederate. <lb/>
We shall probably have to contend with their commer<lb break="no"/>cial restrictions; and our isolation will be more complete <lb/>
than ever, and more injurious. Besides, how shall we <lb/>
stand in the eyes of the British Government, who <lb/>
this measure for our adoption? Depend on it, the French <lb/>
Convention of 1857 is not dead. Their failures as the <lb/>
French shore make them more then ever anxious to <lb/>
extend their operations to Labrador. If we place <lb/>
ourselves in a false position with the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, the French may adroitly secure the opportunity <lb/>
with advantage. We knew how near we were before <lb/>
to a ruinous compromise of our rights, but we shall <lb/>
now have lost the stay of our neighbours, which then <lb/>
upheld us. The Imperial Government cannot afford <lb/>
that we should be a difficulty with France, and this <lb/>
was stated to him (Mr. Shea) at the Colonial offices <lb/>
But such an avowal was unnecessary when we consid<lb break="no"/>er how the commercial idea dominates the whole <lb/>
course of British policy at the present time. We saw <lb/>
it in the case of Denmark, the other day, where inde<lb break="no"/>ference to this principle, a brave ally, was allowed to be <lb/>
trampled on though promises of support had been <lb/>
held out. We saw it in the case of Poland and that of <lb/>
the Southern States, though in all these instances the <lb/>
sympathy of the Eaglish people was strongly on the <lb/>
side of the weak. We have no commercial value for <lb/>
England. France, under the Commercial Treaty, has <lb/>        
become so important in this respect, that the increased <lb/>
trade with that country, for the past four years, was a<lb/>
principal reason why the American war was so little <lb/>
felt in English commercial affairs. Who does not see <lb/>     
the contingency to which we shall be exposed, if we <lb/> 
remain isolated, in oppositon to a course of policy for <lb/>
these Colonies which England has decided on. We <lb/>
should weigh well all the considerations that arise in <lb/>
relation to this question, and viewing dispassionately <lb/>
the arguments on both sides, endeavour to arrive, after <lb/>
mature reflection, at the conclusion that seemed best <lb/>
calculated to conserve the interests committed to our <lb/>
care. <lb/> </p> 

<p>The Committee then rose, and the Chairman report<lb break="no"/>ed propress. To sit again to-morrow. </p> 

<p>The house then adjourned until to-morrow, at three <lb/>

<p>ST. JOH.W'S: <lb/>
MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1865. <lb/></p> 

<p>THE most notable demonstration of the season, ord <lb/>
any other season, assuredly was that Meeting the <lb/>
came off on Saturday, at the Market House, on Colº <lb/>
nial Confederation. All the preliminaries were such <lb/>
as to ferment public expectation to a high degret, <lb/>
and when the time came nobody could complain th: <lb/>
the audience was thin or of niggardly dimensioni. <lb/>
Soon after the proceedings began there came offs <lb/>
batch of public instructors whose fices were now ſº <lb/>
the first time seen on the popular stage, and whose <lb/>
Presentation visibly and at once gave birth to a feeling <lb/>
of half suspicion, half bewilderment in the minds belºw <lb/>
the platform. The new aspirants to the place of the <lb/>
people's guides then altogether superseded the Conſ: <lb/>
deration itself as subjects of various comment—indel <lb/>
the latter theme was for the time quite lost in ſh <lb/>
maze that set in when it was seen that gentlemen hal <lb/>
dome fresh from the Profit and Loss aspect of the <lb/>
ledgers to hold forth against that blue ruin that Con <lb/>
federation would produce to the people's interests. A <lb/>
very current notion at sight of such apparitions in such <lb/>
a place was that the audience must have made <lb/>
mistake and come to the wrong meeting, and <lb/>
that another rendezvoas was to be sough dome<lb break="no"/>where else. They were assured bowever that they <lb/>
had only to wait and all would turn out right—and <lb/>
nobody need go away hungry if he only wanted cºt. <lb/>
rect and lucid explanation, and would keep his eat <lb/>
well open for the supply that was coming. Several <lb/>
of the by-standers then took counsel of their pipe: <lb/>
and each other, and it was resolved to hang on and <lb/>
* out the sport. By an arrangement admirably suſed <lb/>
to the nature of the subject of Confederation, the <lb/>
time allowed to each speaker "to disgust" it fly <lb/>
and in all its details, was ten minutes 1 and it waſ <lb/>
prºved on trial that this allotment exceeded the ne: <lb/>
*ities of the case—such were the powers of the <lb/>
maiden orators in condensing all the points of the <lb/>
41estion into the smallest space of time. One gen<lb break="no"/>tleman representing the bovine interest of River <lb/>
Head, denounced Confederation because under it the <lb/>
Canadians would rush down here and take away hº <lb/>
daughters and his lands,and on his appeal to the mu <lb/>
titude to know whether this was to be endured, a <lb/>
hºllow voice responded, "great out of you, began <lb/>
you need'at say one word more," when of course th <lb/>
speaker retired upon his well-earned laurels. It wal <lb/>
**ounced by another that Canada wanted to make * <lb/>
raid on Newſoundland to help her to pay her debts. <lb/>
Somebody bereupon, reulembering our plethoric coº <lb/>
