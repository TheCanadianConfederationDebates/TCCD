<head rendition="simple:centre">HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY</head> 

<p rendition="simple:right">Monday, Jan. 30. <lb/></p> 

<p>The House met at three o'clock.  </p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:WYAT1">Mr. WYATT</persName>, from the select Committee to prepare <lb/>
an address in reply to his Excelleney's speech, resented <lb/>
the draft of an address, which was read a first time. <lb/>

Second reading to-morrow. <lb/></p> 

    <p><persName ref="pers:WYAT1">Mr. WYATT</persName> gave notice that, on to-morrow, he would <lb/>
move the suspension of the Rules of the House with re<lb break="no"/>ference to that address.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BEMI1">The hon. RECEIVER GENERAL</persName> gave notice that, on <lb/>
tomorrow, he would move the appointment of a select <lb/>
committee on the Contingencies of the House. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:RENO1">Mr. RENOUF</persName> pursuant to notice, asked the Acting<lb/>
    Colonial Secretary tº lay on the table copies of corres<lb break="no"/>pondence with the Government of Canada, and other <lb/>
documents relative to the Federal Union of the Provin<lb break="no"/>ces.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>-The documents were in <lb/>
the course of being printed, and would be laid on the <lb/>
table as soon as they could be got ready. </p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:RENO1">Mr. RENOUF</persName>, pursuant to notice, asked the hon. <lb/>
Acting Colonial Secretary to lay on the table of  the <lb/>
House a copy of the letter of Dr. Stabb, Superintend<lb break="no"/>ent of the Lunatic Asylum, complaining of the visit of <lb/>
inspection by the members for the division of St. John's <lb/>
West to that Institution.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:CART5">The Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> was sorry that the <lb/>
government could not comply with the request of the <lb/>
hon. member, for a copy of the le ter referred to in his <lb/>
notice, in which he assumed that some reference was <lb/>
made to himself and the other members for St. John's <lb/>
West. It must be obvious that if the confidential com<lb break="no"/>munications of the officers of the Government were to be <lb/>
made public, much detriment to the public service would <lb/>
be the inevitable result.</p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:RENO1">Mr. RENOUF</persName>.—Was the letter marked confidential? </p>
    
   <p> 
    <persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>-It was a , matter of no <lb/>
importance whether it was marked confidential or not. <lb/>
It was from an officer of the government.</p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:RENO1">Mr. RENOUF</persName>.-That officer, it appeared, could do as <lb/>
he pleased. He had the sole control of an institution, <lb/>
four miles from the town, in which there were over 100 <lb/>
pauper inmates, and which cost the colony £4,000 a year; <lb/>
and when the members for the Western ſivision of St. <lb/>
John's, in the discharge of their duty to their constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, made a visit of inspection to that institution, it <lb/>
appeared that this official complained to the Executive <lb/>
of their having done so, and now when they applied for <lb/>
a copy of his letter, they were refused. The reason was <lb/>
obvious. Dr. Stabb had a brother in the Executive <lb/>
Council, who supported him in all his proceedings.</p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:CART5">The hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> was very sorry to see a <lb/>
feeling manifested towards, a gentleman who was not <lb/>
present in that House to defend himself. If the hon <lb/>
member were amenable to the government, and if any <lb/>
charges were made against him by the Physician of the <lb/>
Lunatic Asylum, it would be the duty of the government <lb/>
to communicate a copy of such charges to him, to give <lb/>
him an opportunity of meeting them. But it was ob<lb break="no"/>viously improper to furnish a gentleman entirely uncon<lb break="no"/>nected with the government with a confidential commu<lb break="no"/>nication from an officer of that government, even if he <lb/>
was mentioned in it. He (hon. A. Gen.) did not say <lb/>
whether such was the case in this instance or not. He <lb/>
might inform the hon, member, that it was no part of his <lb/>
public duty as member for St. John's West, to visit the <lb/>
Lunatic Asylum. If he went there, it was in private <lb/>
capacity, as any other citizen might go. He (hon. A. <lb/>
Gen.) did not say that it was not proper for him to do <lb/>
so, and to inform himself respecting the management of <lb/>
that institution and every other public institution in the <lb/>
colony; and if he, or any other member had any <lb/>
charges to make respecting the management of this <lb/>
Asylum, or any other institution under the control of <lb/>
the government, they would be prepared at once to <lb/>
institute an inquiry.</p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:RENO1">Mr. RENOUF</persName>-Was certainly surprised that any docu<lb break="no"/>ment should be thus refused to be laid before this <lb/>
House. He would ask the hon. Attorney General <lb/>
        
    whether that document had been marked confidential or <lb/>
    not He (Mr. R) considered that he had a perfect <lb/>
    right to ask for that document in his official capacity as a <lb/>
   member of this House. He (Mr. R.) would briefly <lb/>
    explain the circumstances of this case. He understood, <lb/>
    with his hon colleague Mr. Talbot, that a letter had been <lb/>
    written to the Executive by the Superintendent of, the <lb/>
    Lunatic Asylum, complaining of the conduct of three <lb/>
    hon members of that house, who, in discharge of their <lb/>
    duty as custodians of the public, had visited that institu<lb break="no"/>tion twelve months previously. On that occassion they <lb/>
    had met the Superintendant who complained of illness, <lb/>
    and was unable to accompany them through the building. <lb/>
    —He (Mr. Renouf) must say that as far as the eye could <lb/>
    discover, every thing was in the most perfect order­ <lb/>
    they had been well satisfied with the result of their visit, <lb/>
    and regarded the state of the institution as a credit to the <lb/>
    Superintendent. What then was this letter written for, <lb/>
    and especially twelve months after this visit was made?<lb/>
    Had we no right to go there? That letter reflected on <lb/>
    his (Mr. Renouf's) character, and, he had a right to get<lb/>
    it. He had applied to the hon Colonial Secretary, to <lb/>
    ascertain whether it was really in existence or not. That <lb/> 
        gentleman did not deny it, and said that the hon. Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General would give him  (Mr. Renouf) a copy of the letter.—Did not hon. gentlemen remember that some<lb/>

years back grave complaints had been made against Dr. <lb/>
        Stabb, and that the Governor had said that if he were <lb/>
        guity of the charges alleged against him, he was not fit <lb/>
        to be any longer the Superintendent of that institution? <lb/>
        The result was that Dctors Carson and Rochford were <lb/>
        appointed to supervise the working of that institution. <lb/>
        And now, because the West End members, took a deep <lb/>
        interest in the unfortunate inmates of the Asylum, were <lb/>
        they to be made the subject of complaint to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and his twelve months after their visit? And <lb/>
        when he, no doubt, was anticipating anothor visit, he <lb/>
        applies to the government for liberty to exclude members <lb/>
        from visiting the Asylum. What was the cause of this? <lb/>
        —Was there any great party going on there at that <lb/>
        time? Any extensive decorations to be put up?–Last <lb/>
        session great fault was found with the extravagance of <lb/>
        that insitution. But Doctor Stabb had a brother in the <lb/>
        Executive, and they were mesmerised by his influence. <lb/>
        That letter did not deter the members for St. Jonn's <lb/>
        West from making their visit, when they were received <lb/>


<cb/>
    
    

by Dr. Stabb in a most cringing manner. He took <lb/>
them through the whole building, and actually asked <lb/>
them into his private apartments. There was no insti<lb break="no"/>tution that required more supervision than that one.-<lb/>
        And had the representatives of the people, who voted <lb/>
the supplies for its support, no right to visit it ? </p>
    
    <p>
After some further discussion, in which Mr. Renouf, <lb/>
the hons. Attorney and Receiver General, and Mr. <lb/>
Talbot took part, the matter was dropped. </p>
    
    <p>
The house then adjourned until Tuesday at three <lb/>
o'clock. </p>
    
    
    <!-- GL, 2018-11-06, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->
<!--TUESDAY, Jan. 31. <lb/>
The house met at three o'clock. y <lb/>
Mr. GLEN presented a petition from Gregory Morris <lb/>
and other inhabitants of Witless Bay, which was received <lb/>
and read, praying that a certain cove in Witless Bay <lb/>
º be reserved as a place of 'refuge for their fishing <lb/>
craft. <lb/>
Mr. Gien, in moving that the petition lie on the table, <lb/>
would observe that Witless Bay was much exposed to <lb/>
easterly gales, which proved very destructive to fishing <lb/>
craft; and the cove in question was the only place where <lb/>
they could take shelter. It was, therefore, of great im­ <lb/>
portance to the people that it should be reserved for their <lb/>
use. An endeavour was now made to claim it as private <lb/>
property, and he thought it was the duty of the govern­ <lb/>
ment to interfere for the public interest. <lb/>
Hon ATToRNEY GENERAL, in seconding the motion <lb/>
for the petition lying on the table, would state that the <lb/>
hom member showed him the petition previous to the pre­ <lb/>
seating it to the House; and had pointed out to him the <lb/>
proper course in the matter. It was not a matter for <lb/>
the Government to interfere. Let the petitioners prefer <lb/></p> 

<p>an indictment at the Quarter Sessions for the district. <lb/></p> 

<p>There was a number of them, and the expense would be <lb/>
trifling. They could then have it tried whether any pri­ <lb/>
vate party had any right of property in that cave. <lb/>
Mr. KENT.-Fishery rights throughout the colony <lb/>
should be preserved inviolate. It was obviously of the <lb/>
utmost importance to the petitioners, for the safety of <lb/>
their fishing craft, the cove in question should not pass <lb/>
into private hands. What were the Attorney General <lb/>
and Surveyor General paid such magnificent salaries for, <lb/>
if they were not to look after the public interests * <lb/>
Ordered that the petition lie on the table. <lb/>
on motion of Mr. WYATT, pursuant to order of the <lb/>
day, the address in reply to the Governor's speech was <lb/>
read a second time. <lb/>
Mr. Wyatt moved, pursuant to notice, that the <lb/>
rules of the house oe suspended in reference to the ads <lb/>
dress. <lb/>
Mr. KENT—The address embraced matters of great <lb/>
importance It would be well to proceed in the reg­ <lb/>
ult course, and not have it committed until to-mor­ <lb/>
IoW. <lb/>
Hon Attorney GENERAL-The address being an <lb/>
echo of the speech, as was usual with such documents, <lb/>
there were several paragra hs on which there would be <lb/>
no difference of opinion. They might proceed with these, <lb/>
and let that on which hon members might wish, for dis­ <lb/>
cussion lie over until to-murrow. <lb break="no"/>The motion was put and carried. <lb/>
On motion of Mr. WYATT, the House resolved itself <lb/>
into Committee of the whole on the address, Mr. KNIGHT <lb/>
in the chair. <lb/>
The first and second sections of the address were read <lb/>
serialim and adopted. Ine third section was read refer­ <lb/>
ring to the subject of poor relief. <lb/>
Mr. WYArr moved that the section be adopted, <lb/>
Mr. E. 1). Shea said that paiagraph was not in ac­ <lb/>
cordance with the speech, which recominended assess­ <lb/>
ment in the several districts for the support of the poor. <lb/>
In the reply the Government swallowed their own words <lb/>
and deprecated his Excellency's suggestion. They said <lb/>
there were difficulties in the way of its adoption. He <lb/>
(Mr. Shea) congratulated the Government on their con­ <lb/>
version to the views of the opposition on that question. <lb/>
The matter was fully discussed last session. The sound­ <lb/>
ness of the principle was admitted on this side, but we <lb/>
said it was not applicable to the circumstances of this <lb/>
colony; and that paragraph of the address virtually said <lb/>
the same thing. Å Bill was brought in last session pro­ <lb/>
viding for assessment in certain districts, Hon members <lb/>
on this side expressed their views fully on the subject, in <lb/>
opposition to that measure, and some members on the <lb/>
Government side of the House coincided with them, and <lb/>
the Bill was consequently withdrawn. And now, while <lb/>
the Governor was advised to recommend having recourse <lb/>
to assessment, the Government tell him that such a course <lb/>
is impracticable in this Colony. He (Mr. Shea) did say <lb/>
that piragraph was a distinct and clear and unmistaka­ <lb/>
able amendment on the Governor's speech, proceeding <lb/>
from the Government, or at all events, from members <lb/></p> 

<p>

<p>

<p>| <lb/></p> 

<p>- g the confid of the Gov <lb break="no"/> </p> 

<p>Mr. KENT.—The centripetal and the centrifugal forces <lb/>
of the Government had in this matter been acting in di­ <lb/>
rect opposition to each other. The hon the leader of the <lb/>
Government had last year endeavoured to force the Poor <lb/>
Law Bill down the throats of his supporters, but they <lb/>
were reluctant to swallow the pill. He was realizing the <lb/>
position of all leaders. His supporters were restive, They <lb/>
were kicking in harness, and the hon gentlemen experi­ <lb/>
enced the diffiulty of driving four in hand-Could any­ <lb/>
thing be more strong or more emphatic than the advice <lb/>
given them from the throne on this subject, advice <lb/>
sanctioned by the leader of the Government and the <lb/>
Executive P What did it mean P. That the present <lb/>
system should be discontinued, as it, led to imposition <lb/>
and eurruption in its worst forms. . At present it was a <lb/>
boon, a premium, instead of a relief. This was no new <lb/>
matter. Last year the Government introduced their <lb/>
Poor Law Bill and held it aloft, as high as Caesar ever <lb/>
held his Commentaries; and were to stand or fall by it. <lb/>
But the supporters of the Ministry, would nº sustain <lb/>
them in passing it, and it was withdrawn. The same <lb/>
proposition was now a second ume laid before the Legs­ <lb/></p> 

<p> actually give that proposition a direct negative. <lb/></p> 

<p>They <lb/>
say that though the principle is a perfectly sound one, <lb/>
we are not in a position at present to apply it. They <lb/>
acknowledge the pauper relief is an ulcer in our social <lb/>
system, and yet they would not vote for any measure that <lb/>
ºuld tend to allegiate it, and improve our condition. <lb/>
was the learned Doctor aware that when he signed that <lb/>
Report he was passing a direct censure upon the Go­ <lb/>
vernment Hè (MF. Kent) would ask hon gentleme; <lb/>
opposite whether they intended to support toº address 2 <lb/>
Were they to have two sets of opinions, if this were <lb/>
an ordinary case, he (Mr. Kent) would not mind it. <lb/>
But it was a matter that plunged the countly deeper in <lb/>
debt, year after year. It was sapping, the vital energies <lb/>
of the country; and never was this House so strongly <lb/>
called upon to renunciate its opinions as at present: But <lb/>
the committee had given the question the go-bye. and <lb/>
the Ministry sat in a state of coma, whilst a directºº. <lb/>
ive was given to the proposition of the Eºcuº. W nat <lb/>
did he Executive members say to it?. Were they <lb/>
satisfied with themenace-" Eat thy pudding slave and <lb/></p> 

<p>hold thy tongue."? If they were desirous of playing the <lb/>
part of spirit rappers, let them sehd for the Davenport <lb/>
brothers, to relieve them from their present state ºf <lb/>
embirrasment. They certainly were in an unenviable <lb/>
position, and he would let them enjoy ther fame. He <lb/></p> 

<p>(Mr. Kent) did not begrudge it to them. <lb/></p> 

<p>a Mr. TALBOT-That paragraph required some attention. <lb/>
He must observe that it was not at all what he would <lb/>
expect to be the language emploved in addressing the <lb/>
Governor. The address was in perfect contrast to the <lb/>
elegant and classical language of his Excellency's speech. <lb/>
With respect to that paragraph, he might observe that it <lb/>
was not respectful towards his Excellency for the Gos <lb/>
yernment to address him in that manner, after advising <lb/>
him to recommend assessment for relieving the able: <lb/>
baſſad poor. But the address altogether was not such <lb/>
as should have emanated from the Select Cºmmittee <lb/>
acting in unison with the Government. He (Mr. Tal­ <lb/>
bot) would take a fisherman from the streets, and he <lb/>
wºuld draw '. a more suitable reply than that address. <lb/>
One of those fishermen whom the members of the govern­ <lb/>
mºnt would trample upon, would produce a document <lb/>
couched in a style superior to that address. And as to <lb/>
the Governmeut already departing from the course <lb/>
announced the other day in his Excellency's speech; it <lb/>
was to him (Mr. Talbot) no matter of surprise; for, it <lb/>
was well known that their chief object was to preserve <lb/>
their places; and if they found their supporters would <lb/>
not sustain them in the matter of assessment, they were <lb/>
ready to abandon it, as they did the poor Bill last session. <lb/>
The Government were becoming more infatuated every <lb/>
year. If they diff-red in opinion from the Governor, it <lb/>
was their duty to resign, and make room for others who <lb/>
would give his Excellency reliable advice respecting the <lb/>
actual wants and circumstances of the Colony, The <lb/>
sound principle was to assess the districts for the sup­ <lb/>
port of the poor, but he (Mr.Talbot) had no hope that <lb/>
the present, government would have the manliness to <lb/>
grapple with the growing evil of pauperism, and bring <lb/>
in a measure in opposition to the wishes of some of their <lb/>
influential supporters. <lb/>
Mr. Prows; was delighted to find that the hon mem­ <lb/>
ber who had just sat down, had became a convert to his <lb/>
Excellency's views on the subject of poor relief. But he <lb/>
(Mr. Prowse) would like to see the hon member set <lb/>
forth these views to his constituents. They were sound <lb/>
and correct views; and he (Mr. Prowse) rejoiced to see <lb/>
them enunciated by his Excellency. He (Mr. Prowse) <lb/>
expressed these views last year, and he held them still, <lb/>
whatever difficulty there might be in giving, effect to <lb/>
them in this Colony. He (Mr. Prowse) would like to <lb/>
hear every hon member of that House who had opinions, <lb/>
express them openly. He recollected that in conversa­ <lb/>
tion with the hon member, a few days ago, he expressed, <lb/>
in glowing language, his admiration of Confederation <lb/>
But because certain parties out of doors were opposed to <lb/>
it, he dared not give it his support in that House. The <lb/>
fiſhermen would find by-and bye who were there friends. <lb/>
They would not be misled by interested parties to be­ <lb/>
Hºwe that their interests would be sacrificed by confed­ <lb/>
eration, and that the object of its supporters was to sell <lb/>
Newfoundland. There was a certain amount of clamour <lb/>
raised amongst a class of the population on the subject <lb/></p> 

<p>some time, which orcasioned great inconvenience to the <lb/>
people in the heighbourhood, and especially to ths <lb/>
children in attending school. <lb/>
(medered that the petition lie on the table. <lb/>
Mr. WYATT gave notice, that on to-morrow, he woult <lb/>
ask the hon Acting Colonial Secretary for a return <lb/>
showing the number of voyages made by the steamer <lb/>
Arel, to the Westward and Northward, during the year <lb/>
1864, dates of departure from St. John's, and dates of <lb/>
return; also particulars of ports called at, and time of <lb/>
arrival and departure from these ports. <lb/>
Mr. LEaxos presented a petition from John Harley <lb/>
and others of Cap in Cove, South Side of Port-de Grave, <lb/>
which was received and read, praying for a grant to <lb/>
make a road to that settlement. <lb/>
Ordered that the petition lie on the table. a <lb/>
Mr. Kent presented a petition from Michael Wade, <lb/>
of Fiat Rock, which was received and read, praying for <lb/>
a grant to open a road from the main road to his farm. <lb/>
Mr. KEST, in moving that the petition lie on the <lb/>
table, would observe that it referred to a matter of very <lb/>
great importance, to the progress of agriculture in the <lb/>
Colony. His Excellency | <lb/>
their attention the importance of the road service, as <lb/>
well as the encouragement of agriculture, Agriculture <lb/>
could not progress without roads, and if they desired tº <lb/>
see a prosperous agricultural population, it was essential <lb/>
that they should be provided with the means of access <lb/>
to their land, and of bringing their produce to market­ <lb/>
It was admited on both sides that the fisheries alone <lb/>
were not sufficient to sustain our increasing population, <lb/>
therefore it became their imperative duty to igive every. <lb/>
facility to those who directed their attention, to other <lb/>
industrial pursuits, The petitioner had peculiar claims <lb/>
which ought not to be overlooked. <lb/>
Mr. Pºsons had much pleasure in supporting the <lb/>
prayer of that petition. He had long been the advocate <lb/>
of agricultural improvement: . This country had great <lb/>
agricultural capabilities, whichhad hitherto been vºy <lb/>
much neglected. No person, who had witnessed the <lb/>
oxhibition of agricultural produce in the front of the <lb/>
building in the month of October could have any doubt <lb/>
on the subject. We had extensive tracts, of most fertile <lb/>
land in the interior, which had not yet been rendered <lb/>
accessible for cultivation. He need only refer to the <lb/>
narrative of Mr. Cormack of his journey across the <lb/>
island. He passed over fine plains with grºss five of <lb/>
six feet high, on which numerous herds, ºf deer found <lb/>
pasturage. In addition to our prºlific fisheries, which <lb/>
for a few seasons had partially failed, and our valuable <lb/>
mineral resources, we had tracts of land which could not <lb/>
be surpassed in fertility, and which required only the <lb/>
fostering hand of a paternal government tº give due en­ <lb/>
couragement and assistance for their cultivation, when <lb/>
they would be occupied by a hardy and industrious pºp": <lb/>
lation. It was not the miserable and degrading dole of <lb/>
the pauper that our people required to sustain them. <lb/>
Give them aid to cultivate the soil, and roads to render <lb/>
their lands accessible, and the able bodied would main­ <lb/>
tain themselves in comfort. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. MARCH concurred in the views of the hon mem­ <lb/>
ber who had just sat down respecting the importance of <lb/></p> 

<p>af pauper relief; and, in *1 the <lb/>
Jared not express his views ºn that question. He (Mr. <lb/>
Prows) must say that he had great respect fºr the hon <lb/>
members's ability, but he had very little respect for his <lb/>
courage. <lb/>
tion. Arronxex GENERAL did not think that hon <lb/>
gentleman distinctly understood the meaning of the <lb/>
passage in either the speech or the reply. They had <lb/>
certainly not expressed themselves as if they understood <lb/>
..m."when the Poor Law Bill was introduced last <lb/>
session, these two hon gentlemen opposed, it with all <lb/>
their might. The Bill was withdrawn for further const­ <lb/>
deration, and up to the present time the opinions of the <lb/>
hon gen lemen were thought to be the same as they <lb/>
expressed last session. He was glad that such a happy <lb/>
charge had come over the spirit of their dream. It <lb/>
would appear, from the observations of these hon <lb/>
gentlemen, that however distaseful a measure might be <lb/>
ãuring the administratiºn of one Governor, it was a <lb/>
highly desirable and beneficial one under another. Here <lb/>
ºñía actually a formal recantation of the heterodox <lb/>
principles expressed by hon members last session; <lb/>
#."ºnorabé meuber, Mr. Kent, openly avowed <lb/>
that he had been mistaken. He believed now <lb/>
that the only way to remedy the existing evils of the <lb/>
system of pauper relief was by assessment. He, (hon <lb/>
Åitorier General) was pleased to see the hon gentleman <lb/>
in such a frank and manly way, acknowledged his <lb/>
is... " The hon members object to the address <lb/>
because they say it does not gº sº far as the speech. <lb/>
He (Attorney General) did nºt think it was open to any <lb/>
such aspersion. Undoubtedly there were obstacles to <lb/>
every useful measure, even tº Confederation.—There <lb/>
was not one act, unless it might be some measure of a <lb/>
common place character, that conduced to the remedying <lb/>
of any evils, or aimed at any important improvement, <lb/>
jiàº a first present difficulties to its being cºrried <lb/>
... ." But when difficulties were in the way of any <lb/>
measure, the benefits of which were in the future, no <lb/>
i.biºmas impossible for small mind, to comprehend <lb/>
how they were to be overcome. The address said <lb/>
simply that we entirely assented to the principle, but <lb/>
ºthere were certain difficulties in, the way of its <lb/>
successful application, which we would endeavour by <lb/>
... ºnsideration to overcome, and conter upon the <lb/>
country so desirable a, bººk ºf the address had said <lb/>
jº 'were insuperable difficulties in the wº, then . <lb/>
would have been open to the construction put, Pºº º <lb/>
by hon members opposite. it was all very well for hon <lb/>
gentlemen to endeavour tº mistify and confuse. The <lb/>
thing was perfectly understood. Difficultles did exist, <lb/>
..ºh. H. cºuld not shut their eyes to their exis­ <lb/>
tence. He was glad, nowever, to **** many hon. <lb/>
gentlemen now in favour of the measure, and he felt <lb/>
isfied that the paragraph in question would be adopted <lb/>
as it stood in the address. <lb/>
The motion for the adoption of the section, was then <lb/>
put and carried. -<lb break="maybe"/>ºr. Committee then rose and the Chairman reported <lb/>
gress. To sit again to-morrow. <lb/>
The House ºnen adjourned unul Wednesday at 3 <lb/>
o'clock. <lb/>
WEDNESDAY, Feb. 1. <lb/>
The House met at 3 o'clock. <lb break="no"/>xi. Kºyasaga presented a petition from F. Fitzáerald <lb/>
and others, of lorbay, which was received and read, <lb/>
praying for a grant to make a road from thence to <lb/>
Beaullen, <lb/>
ordered that the petition lie on the table. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Wyatt presented a petitiºn, frºm Thomas Fish <lb/>
Parker and others, of M. dile Bill Cove, which was <lb/>
received and read, praying for a grant to build a bridge <lb/>
over the river at Anthony's Gut. <lb break="no"/> </p> 

<p>Mr. wrarr, in moving that, the petition lie on tha <lb/>
abi, would obſerve taa: the bridge as ocea down fur <lb/></p> 

<p>agriculture. He never was so convinced on the subject <lb/>
hon ber 1 as last He touched in at one settlement on the <lb/></p> 

<p>French shore, where one man had 50 sheep, and another <lb/></p> 

<p>had 11 miſch cows, and these persons had nº complaint <lb/></p> 

<p>of poverty. And it was well known that the land on the <lb/>
French shore was comparatively barren compared with <lb/></p> 

<p>the other parts of Newfoundland. On his return from: <lb/></p> 

<p>the Labrador he met with that eminent statesman Mr. <lb/></p> 

<p>Howe, who had done so much to promote the progress of <lb/></p> 

<p>Nova Scotia. That gentleman spoke in º: highest <lb/>
terms of the fine land which he had seen up the Bays, <lb/></p> 

<p>and along the streams flowing into them. Nearly th: <lb/>
whole of that land was unoccupied. The people had <lb/></p> 

<p>settled on the head-lands, for the convenience of <lb/></p> 

<p>prosecuting the fishery in punts, and were located in <lb/></p> 

<p>the vicinity of the poorest land for cultivation. Yet, <lb/>
we saw that excellent vegetables were raised here­ <lb/>
Mr. Howe saw at once the mistake which had been <lb/>
committed. He said if the people went up into these <lb/>
Bays, where there was fine H. and fine timber they <lb/>
might have large craft, and come down to follow the fish­ <lb/>
erywherever the fieh were to be found, and have their <lb/>
fims at home, to fall back upon, where they could raise <lb/>
much of the produce necessary for our consumption; In <lb/>
place of importing cattle from Prince Edward Island and <lb/>
Nova Scotia, they might have thousands of cattle in these <lb/>
Bºys, which would find a ready market in St. John's, <lb/>
with millions of sheep, which would furnish them with <lb/>
both food and clothing. He (Mr. March) had hope for <lb/>
this country yet, He did not despair of seeing it raise <lb/>
again to prosperity. If we have a good seal fishery thin <lb/>
spring, and he did, hope providence would again smile <lb/>
upon us, we would ston, see industry revive, and the <lb/>
jiants would give out supplies with their accustomed <lb/></p> 

<p>liberality, as no other merchants in the world would do. <lb/>
There were one spring, no fewer than 680,000 seals <lb/></p> 

<p>brought in, an i with favourable winds, there was reason <lb/></p> 

<p>to an icipate a good fiat ery, this spring, for but few seals <lb/>
had been takenjast year. He would not put it at the <lb/>
highest rate; but assuming that thºrs would be 400,000 <lb/></p> 

<p>j, taken; at 10s each, they would be worth £200,000 <lb/></p> 

<p>Tº had fair cod-fishery we might calculate on a mil­ <lb/>
lion quintals. There had been considerably more in <lb/>
je easons. Fuh would be worth a pound a quintal. <lb/>
It was now worth 26s, and there would be none in the <lb/></p> 

<p>..aº, when the new fish came in. This exclusive...of <lb/>
joi, the salmon and the herrings, gave us £1," <lb/></p> 

<p>200,000 fºr a population of 130,000, besides the produce <lb/></p> 

<p>of Ágriculture; and if our people were assisted by tha <lb/>
government and by the merchants tº gº "P into these <lb/>
fine Bays, we would soon havº.º. prºper nº agricultural <lb/>
population. There was Mr. Tilly, who was so comfort­ <lb/>
... with his family in Hants' Harbor. That venerable <lb/>
and respected gentleman, was, far seeing: He saw that <lb/>
in fishery would be liable to failures, and as populatiºn <lb/>
was increasing, that some other means of support would <lb/>
become neceſſary; and he went up into Random Sound <lb/>
... the head of Trinity Bºy, where here was as fine a <lb/>
jii as in the land of Goshen. He and his sons had gul: <lb/>
ºated a fine tract of land there, where they raised <lb/>
abundance of produce, while they attended to the fishery <lb/>
in the height of the season. Que year lately they raised <lb/>
sufficient ºbeat to make 35 barrels of flour, and this <lb/>
year Mir, lilly aad such fine turnips that one of them <lb/>
ãould not be put into a flour barrel. Sººral other fa­ <lb/>
milies had been induced to follow Mr. Tilly's example, <lb/>
and with the same industry would soon be comfortable­ <lb/>
Now with all this we had our minerals, There was no cºunt <lb/>
try that possessed more valuable resource: than this island, <lb/>
and thogh we had for some years severe distres; amº <lb/>
our people, yet when it, passed ºy it would be, the <lb/>
means of doing us good; and after all, if Providence <lb/>
afteted us wºn a fºilure of the fisheries, we were ****P* <lb/>
from the scourge of war, which was desolating the Uuited <lb/>
Šates, our government had met the crisis with much <lb/>
energy and judgment, and Ho Persºn." allowed to <lb/>
