been pursued un Ier all Gºvernments. It <lb/>
nanced in 1859, and was one of the passport <lb/>
-gilative popularity, and had been continued <lb/>
since. When the lion, member, Mr. Ifogsstt, <lb/>
Attorney-General, he had: called the Assembly <lb/>
her in the month of December in order. to <lb/>
n relief for the distressel. With regarl to the <lb/>
int received by each district, those represente I <lb/>
embers of the Government compared. m st <lb/>
irably-with those represented by the opposition. <lb/>
e,was a very: large amount spent ºil S. John's <lb/>
he district of Ferrylan l exige led all other, <lb/>
ºvely. The hon...member, AMr. Glen, was the <lb/>
uage.asing in his efforts, to extract. relief from <lb/>
public chest, and it was only: when he was defin<lb break="no"/>told that.ao more would-be given out, that his <lb/>
rtunity ended. He (uon. A. G.), declared that <lb/>
wn, ºnzmber; Mr. , Hogwett, was most pressing: <lb/>
uad actually received more than he wastentitled <lb/>
1. *coutit ſ of road money. There was, no <lb/>
º, º great deal of fraud practised that was in<lb break="no"/>ible to be prevented. It was with the view of <lb/>
king that thiſ.the Proclamation had been issued. <lb/>
ºuld not have been done betore. The circum, <lb/>
res of the people prevented it. But as soon as <lb/>
Government had been able to do so, they grap<lb break="no"/>with the difficulty. It would have been worse <lb/>
idle to have issued a Proclamation without <lb/>
4 jn a position to carry it out. I as 1865 ani <lb/>
there was no alternative but to give relief. In <lb/>
spring of last year it was determined that no <lb/>
* relief should be given. It has been state i that <lb/>
Proclamation was caused by the Union, Bank. <lb/>
t was perfectly untrue. It was quite true that <lb/>
agements bad been made by the Government <lb/>
, the Union Bank, which it was the duty of the <lb/>
ernment to garry-out, and it... would, have been <lb/>
ossible for them, to have doſe solf, they had con<lb break="no"/>*d the issue of relief;to the able, bylied poor. <lb/>
hon, member, Mr. Hogsett, says £hat wºn the <lb/>
isition res:# the credit of it. The Hon. minºer, <lb/>
Rºufº attributes"if"toºthºińſſieboe:of the <lb/>
in Bank, lioth these genileinen, then, were at <lb/>
* among themselves, and contradicted each <lb/>
r. He (hon. A. G.).). £ongra'ulated the oppo<lb break="no"/>in on the support which they haſ thus.given th: <lb/>
vernment, and upon theºlogy which they had <lb/>
•ed upon his Excellº's speech. He (hia. <lb/>
..) bay, asked the oppositiºn Hast year to propose <lb/>
solution.tº do away with pauper relief, jºu: they <lb/>
ºś" Prºclamatiºn, neither <lb/>
red by the Union Bank nor by the opposition, <lb/>
been issued. Again, he (hou. A.G.) was <lb/>
sed of promisigg seed potatous. He dénied that <lb/>
wer male such a promise, and the official report <lb/>
hat, he said was before the country. But he <lb/>
told that if he had given this seed the condition <lb/>
he peºple would have been ameliorated. He <lb/>
red that sučh would have been the result. He <lb/>
never done an act which could be better justi<lb break="no"/>an he would'hive deeply regretted bad it been <lb/>
rwise. In 1866 and 1867 seed potatoes were <lb/>
n, and all knew the result. Every district got <lb/>
Hare, and yet no benefi. was derived and no in<lb break="no"/>He in the crop took place. They wore given <lb/>
in small quantities, and instead of being planted, <lb/>
: consumed, and in autumn there was no de<lb break="no"/>sion appárğāt in the gaupur relief expenditure. <lb/>
(hom A.G.) had asked the hon, memuur, Mr. <lb/>
sett, not to bring, the matter forward openly in <lb/>
louse, as he was aware tuera. were partie: <lb/>
uſif they knew, the Government intended <lb/>
ºrchase, would have communicated with their <lb/>
ids in P. E. Island and Halifax, and thus have <lb/>
"d the pricº. If it had been påssible, the Gov. <lb/>

hased up the luited supply that was in it, wº <lb/>
dilave, deprived.every industrious man whº <lb/>

would thus have reduced the indistrious naº <lb/>

    <p>
The House met at 3 o'clock. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. GODDEN</persName>, from the Select Committee to draft <lb/>
an address of thanks in reply to his Excellency's <lb/>
Speech at the opening ef the session, Presented the <lb/>
address, which was received and read a first time. <lb/>
Second reading to-morrow. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
The hon. <persName ref="pers:CART5">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>, pursuant to no<lb break="no"/>tice, moved the appointment of a Sergeant-at-Arms. <lb/>
There were only, so far as he knew, two applicants <lb/>
for the office. and the majority of the House con<lb break="no"/>curred in opinion that the office should be given to <lb/>
Mr. John B. Barnes. He had, therefore, much <lb/>
pleasure in moving that Mr. Hornea be appointed. <lb/>
That gentleman was well known to them all. He <lb/>
(hon. A.G.) had the pleasure of long knowing him, <lb/>
        and of knowing that he was <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> by the whole <lb/>
community. He had long been successfully engaged <lb/>
in mercantile pursuits, but latterly unfortunate. He <lb/>
was also the brother of the late Mr. Richard Barnes, <lb/>
who did very goed service to the Colony as a lead<lb break="no"/>ing member of the Assembly. Mr. Barnes was a <lb/>
man of liberal tendencies, all his life long. There <lb/>
was also the application of another person, Mr. <lb/>
William Woodley, whom he (hon. A.G.) had also <lb/>
long known, and who was well known to hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers. His application was considered, but the <lb/>
majority coccurred in supporting, Mr. Barnes for <lb/>
the office, and he (hon. A.G.) had much pleasure, <lb/>
therefore, in moving that Mr. Barnes be appointed <lb/>
to the vacant office of Sergeant-at-Arms. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:PROW1">Mr. PROWSE</persName> was happy to secoud the motion for <lb/>
the appointment at Mr. Barnes. His only regret <lb/>
was that Mr. Barnes should be reduced to such <lb/>
circumstances as to be an applicant for the office. <lb/>
They all remembered, the highly respectable mer<lb break="no"/>cantile firm of John B. Barnes, &amp; Co., and he (Mr. <lb/>
P.) was aware that many of our native shipmasters <lb/>
had been brought forward by that house; among <lb/>
        others the master of the steamer <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ariel</hi>. Hon. <lb/>
members had all a good opinion of Mr. John B. <lb/>
Barnes, and he (Mr. P.) had mach pleasure in se<lb break="no"/>conding the notion, for his appointment to the office <lb/>
of Sergeant-at-Arms. <lb/></p>
    
    <p><persName ref="pers:HOGS1">Mr. HOGSETT</persName> —Before the motion was put, he <lb/>
wished to make some remarks. He was not aware <lb/>
that on this side of the House there was any dispo<lb break="no"/>sition to oppose the appointment. He believed Mr. <lb/>
Barnes was a very worthy man, but before the <lb/>
motion was agreed to, he (Mr. H) had something <lb/>
to say about the salary, and would have liked that <lb/>
the Attorney General had stated what salary would <lb/>
be proposed, as on this side they were powerless <lb/>
except to suggest. He considered that a salary of <lb/>
£50 was ample, considering the duties involved and <lb/>
the unfortunate state of the country; and seeing the <lb/>
office was a necessary one, so that it could not be <lb/>
abolished. The officer had merely to occupy a chair <lb/>
inside the bar, and to call out order when directed <lb/>
by the Speaker, and occasionally, to serve a writ <lb/>
when some hon. member was obsereperous; and <lb/>
£50 was ample cenpensation for such services for <lb/>
three months of the year. It was as much as a <lb/>
member of the House got, who had to discharge <lb/>
sucn more onerous duties. He moved that the <lb/>
salary be £50. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>—The salary was an <lb/>
after consideration, and could not come up as an <lb/>
amendment. The question now was as to the <lb/>
appointment. <lb/></p>
    
    <p><persName ref="pers:HOGS1">Mr. HOGSETT</persName>.—It was act an Executive appoint<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/></p>
    
    <!--IC STOPPED HERE-->
    
    <p><persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—It was not, but <lb/>
one to be filled up by the House; but the ques<lb break="no"/>tion now was not what salary that officer should <lb/>
receive. It may afterwards become a question <lb/>
for the House whether the salary ought to be <lb/>
reduced, and his (hon. A. G.'s.) own opinion <lb/>
was that there ought to be a considerable re<lb break="no"/>duction, but net to £50, there was a number of <lb/>
ether salaries in which reductions ought to be <lb/>
made. They gave the principal Door-keeper <lb/>
$230, and certainly the Sergeant-at-Arms, <lb/>
under whose orders he was placed, ought to <lb/>
have more than $200. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:HOGS1">Mr. HOGSETT</persName>.—The Door-keeper's was not <lb/>
a new appointment. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—We only voted <lb/>
the salary from session to session. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:HOGS1">Mr. HOGSETT</persName>.—The House had not hitlerto <lb/>
interfered with those salaries; but this was a new <lb/>
appointment, and now was the time to say what <lb/>
the salary should be; otherwise the Sergeant-<lb break="yes"/>at-Arms, at the end of the session, might set up <lb/>
a claim to the same salary as his predecessor. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—He was not dis<lb break="no"/>posed to quarrel with economy in any depart<lb break="no"/>ment of the public service; but he did not agree <lb/>
that officers should be underpaid. Besides, the <lb/>
hon. member could not but that as an amend<lb break="no"/>ment. There appeared to be no difference of <lb/>
opinion as to the appointinent, while there was <lb/>
a difference as to the salary. They had to make <lb/>
the appointment whether the salary should be <lb/>
£50 or £75, or even £100. The salary of the <lb/>
late officer was two high, and all agreed there <lb/>
should be a reduction. Those who voted for <lb/>
the appointinent would not be in any way bound <lb/>
to the salary, which would be afterwards con<lb break="no"/>sidered hitherto the question of salaries had <lb/>
been left to the Colummittee of Contingencies, <lb/>
and considered by the House when their report <lb/>
was presented. It could not be decided in the <lb/>
manner proposed, and unless, there was some <lb/>
other name to be submitted, no other amendement <lb/>
should be proposed. <lb/></p> 
    
    <cb/>


<p><persName ref="pers:GLEN1">Mr. GLEN</persName>.—thought it was necesssry to fix <lb/>
the salary before the appointment was made; <lb/>
and if the Government had decided what the <lb/>
    salary was to be, it might as well be stated. <lb/>
They all greed that the appointment was ne<lb break="no"/>cessary, and as the officer must have a salary, <lb/>
this was the best time to decide what it should <lb/>
be. There was auther matter to which he <lb/>
wished to refer, but wished there was a full at<lb break="no"/>tendance of members on this side when he did <lb/>
so. They were aware that for the past two or <lb/>
three there was no recognised leader of <lb/>
the opposition; and hon. members of this side <lb/>
had considered the matter, and had asked him <lb/>
(Mr. G.) to accept the appointment of leader, <lb/>
which he was unwillingly to do, as he did not <lb/>
consider himself fit for it, but, at all events, if he <lb/>
did so, it must be on the understanding, that <lb/>
members on this side abstain from using violent <lb/>
language, or such as they would not dare to use <lb/>
to a private house. There was an important <lb/>
question couing up, that of Confederation, one <lb/>
of the most important which could engage the <lb/>
attention of any Legislature, involving the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of whether they would give up the <lb/>
management of their own affairs, which the <lb/>
    House had held <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> the introduction of Respon<lb break="no"/>sible Goverainent, and the subject should be <lb/>
entered upon with the greatest deliberation, and <lb/>
decided with a due regard to the best interests <lb/>
of the country. He trusted, therefore, that on <lb/>
that and all other questions comiug up, the dis<lb break="no"/>cussions should be conducted so as to command <lb/>
public respect. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—The hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber would find every courtesy extended to him <lb/>
so far as this side of the House was concerned; <lb/>
and from his long experience and desire to re<lb break="no"/>press improper proceediugs on the other side, <lb/>
he (hon. A.G.) was satisfied that nothing on <lb/>
this side would interrupt that decorum which <lb/>
should characterise the proceedings of the <lb/>
House. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. PINSENT</persName> thought that so far as the salary <lb/>
of the Sergeant-at-Arms was concerned, there <lb/>
would be no difficulty in fixing its amount, of <lb/>
course there would be a considerable reduction; but <lb/>
let the appointment be first made, and then let <lb/>
them determine what that salary should be. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:RENO2">Mr. RENOUF</persName> regretted that it had become <lb/>
necessary to appoint a Sargeant-at-Arms but as <lb/>
the office had become vacant, he believed they <lb/>
were all agreed as to who should be appointed. <lb/>
But there was an important matter to be <lb/>
decided as to what they should pay that office, <lb/>
which must be regarded a view of the present <lb/>
circumstances of the country. The late officer <lb/>
had a salary of £144 cy., which was far more <lb/>
than they should give his successor. The <lb/>
Attorney General told the House that the salary <lb/>
would not be no much. But this side of the <lb/>
House wanted to have the salary definately fixed <lb/>
now; and considering the circumstances of the <lb/>
Colony, and the duties of the office, they thought <lb/>
that £50 was sufficieut compensation for that <lb/>
office. If he received a pound a day, for three <lb/>
months during the winter, they thought he <lb/>
would be sufficieutly paid. It was necessary to <lb/>
practise the strictest econouy. The people were <lb/>
ground down by the taxes inposed upon them. <lb/>
Without any disrespect for Mr. Barnes, for <lb/>
whom he (Mr. R.) had a high respect, he would <lb/>
say that there were many equally respectable <lb/>
men in the community who would be glad to <lb/>
take the appointment at £50 a session. If the <lb/>
principal Doorkeeper leceived £50, it was no <lb/>
reason that they should give a higher salary to <lb/>
a superior officer who was now to be appointed. <lb/>
They must consider the circumstances of the <lb/>
people. In Nova Scotia, with three times our <lb/>
population, the Sergeant-at-Arms had only £75 <lb/>
a session. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—What did the <lb/>
principal Doorkeeper receive? <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:RENO2">Mr. RENOUF</persName>.—$80. Considering the revenue <lb/>
of Nova Scotia, and the circumstances <lb/>
of its people; and also the duties of <lb/>
the office, he held that £50 was ample <lb/>
compensation. He did not consider the pro<lb break="no"/>fessions on the other side as sufficient <lb/>
guarantee that the salary would be sufficiently <lb/>
reduced; an he was not disposed to leave it <lb/>
unsettled until the report of the Contingency Com<lb break="no"/>mitee was presented at the close of the session. <lb/>
Let the House decide it now, with a due regard to <lb/>
the circumstances of the sountry. How much <lb/>
was the revenue of the past year short of the <lb/>
Estimate? He said there should be a large and <lb/>
general reduction of salaries, which were far in <lb/>
excess of what was paid in Nova Scotia and Prince <lb/>
Edward Islaud. The hon. memer, Mr. Glen, had <lb/>
announced his appointineut as leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition. The hon. member enjoyed the confidence <lb/>
of this side of the House, and he Mr. Renouf, <lb/> 
would be glad to support him in repressing every<lb break="no"/>thing unbecoming the dignity of the House; but <lb/>
he regretted that the hon. member went so far as <lb/> 
to assuume that it was on this side ot the House <lb/>
such proceedings took places. The other side was <lb/>
as guilty in that respect as this side. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:GLEN1">Mr GLEN</persName>.—It was mistake on his part, which <lb/>
he had intended to correct. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—It was not correct <lb/>
to assert that unbecoming language was used on <lb/>
this side. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:RENO2">Mr. RENOUF</persName> trusted the debates on both sides <lb/>
would be so conducted as to secure the respect of <lb/>
the whole community. With respect to the matter <lb/>
under consideration, the salary of the Sergeant-at-<lb break="yes"/>Arms should now be definitely settled. He did <lb/>
not agree with the Attorney General that it should <lb/>
be left till the end of the session. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Hon. RRECIEVER GENERAL</persName>.—That salary should <lb/>
bear some proportion to the salaries of the lower <lb/>
officers. It would be perfectly absurd that the <lb/>
salary of the first officer of that department should <lb/>
be less than that of an officer under him. Sup<lb break="no"/>posing it was made $300, it would be only a little <lb/>
over halt what the late Sergeant-at-Arms recieved.</p> 
    
    <cb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:HOGS1">Mr. HOGSETT</persName>.—They wanted, on this side, to <lb/>
know what the salary was to be. They had fully <lb/>
considered it, and saw no relson, because the <lb/>
principal Doorkeeper received £50 stg., that they <lb/>
should give over £50 cy. for this office, in making <lb/>
a new appointment. The salary of the Door<lb break="no"/>keeper was not now before the House, because, <lb/>
when appointed, it was considered that the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment was for four years, and it was not now <lb/>
a question of what he should receive. But this <lb/>
was a new anpointinent, and they ought now in <lb/>
making it, to determine what the salary should <lb/>
be. He would press his amendment, that the <lb/>
salary should not exceed $200. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL.—Such an amend<lb break="no"/>ment was irregular and could not be put from the <lb/>
chair. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:HOGS1">Mr. HOGSETT</persName> contended he had a right to move <lb/>
that resolution. If not now fixed the matter could <lb/>
remain for the Contingency Committee, and after <lb/>
a long session and many keen debates, there <lb/>
generally was a feeling of giving way at the end <lb/>
of the sessien, and if the Contingency Committee <lb/>
        came up with a report of £75 or £100 for this <lb/>
office, it would be carried without much opposition. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:TALB3">Mr. TALBOT</persName> regretted not being present at <lb/>
the commencement of that debate. He had <lb/>
given notice that he would move that the salary <lb/>
should not exceed $200. As to the objection <lb/>
of the Attorney General, that such a motion <lb/>
could not be put, nothing appeared to him more <lb/>
germane to the motion of which the Attorney <lb/>
General had given notice, than when the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment was moved it should be added that the <lb/>
salary be $200. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—But he had <lb/>
moved the appointment of a Sergeant-at-<lb break="yes"/>Arms, and the question being the appointment <lb/>
of that officer, the motion as to salary came up <lb/>
as an amendment, which was not admissible. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:TALB3">Mr.TALBOT</persName>.—Did he think £50 too low? <lb/>
He (Mr. T.) thought it a sufficient salary for <lb/>
the office. It required no labour, either <lb/>
mental or physical, and that officer was <lb/>
not put to one farthing of expense; and would <lb/>
the Attorney General say that they could not <lb/>
get a  gentleman in every respect suitable, for <lb/>
that salary? It was to by assumed that all <lb/>
Government officers were gentlemen, and it <lb/>
was not their salaries that made them such. <lb/>
There was an absolute necesssity for curtailing <lb/>
the public expenditure in every department, and <lb/>
hon. members on this side of the House were <lb/>
determined to use every possible exertion to <lb/>
accomplish it. Now when it was proposed that <lb/>
the people should give up their liberties, earned <lb/>
by such protracted and earnest struggles, it was in<lb break="no"/>cumbant upon those who opposed such a course <lb/>
to do all within their power to resuscitate the <lb/>
country by the means it possessed within itself. <lb/>
The salaries of the public officers were enour<lb break="no"/>mous. Was a country like this, with ouly 120,<lb break="no"/>000 of a population, not more than that of a <lb/>
third or fourth rate city, with abundant re<lb break="no"/>sources, lying dormant, to have its revenues <lb/>
absorbed by the payment of £100,000 to the <lb/>
officers of the Government? <lb/></p> 

    <p><persName ref="pers:PROW1">Mr. PROWSE</persName>.—How much of that sum was <lb/>
absorbed by the paupar expenditure? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TALB3">Mr. TALBOT</persName> doubted if the paupers even <lb/>
got the money. They had been charged with <lb/>
the money which had been squandered for other <lb/>
purposes. But on this side they were determin<lb break="no"/>ed to effect sweeping reductions. It they could <lb/>
get off from £20,000 to £30,000 from the civil <lb/>
expenditure, without impairing the efficiency of <lb/>
the public service, it would go far towards <lb/>
resuscitating the country. They would not at<lb break="no"/>tempt to do anything which a reasonable man <lb/>
would say would not be fair. With such a <lb/>
saving they would be able to lift up the country, <lb/>
and make it one of the most prosperous on <lb/>
either side of the Atlantic. It was a country of <lb/>
boundless resources, which could be made to sup<lb break="no"/>port three times its present population in afflu<lb break="no"/>ence. But it was sunk in misery and destitu<lb break="no"/>tion though misgovernment. He did not say <lb/>
the present Government had produced all the <lb/>
evil. Much had resulted from the narrow and <lb/>
selfish policy of former Goverments. But the <lb/>
present Government had intensified the evils <lb/>
resulting from former misgovernmeut, until <lb/>
they brought the country in its present deplorable <lb/>
circumstances. And now that the vessel was go<lb break="no"/>ing upon the rocks, it became necessary to reverse <lb/>
the helm, so as to get the vessel out of the <lb/>
breakers. The Government could suggest no <lb/>
remedy for our depressed condition, no means <lb/>
of elavating the people but Confederation, <lb/>
which might benefit those who were its earnest <lb/>
advocates, but would be productive of anything <lb/>
but adventage to the people. But, while oppos<lb break="no"/>ed to parting with our liberties, he said that the <lb/>
country could be elevated by a reduction of its <lb/>
enorumous expenditure. If they had £25,000 or <lb/>
£30,000 saved off the enormous salaries, and that <lb/>
sum applied to stimulate the industry and deve<lb break="no"/>lope the resources of the country, it would soon <lb/>
effect a very great change for the better. Ten <lb/>
years before the present Government came into <lb/>
power the people had their food duty free; <lb/>
there was nho duty upon flour or pork or butter, <lb/>
or upon several other necessaries of life; but <lb/>
no sooner did the present Government assume <lb/>
the reins than they imposed duties upon all these <lb/>
articles, while latterly they had also increased <lb/>
the duty upon manufactured goods. But this <lb/>
side were prepared to show that with a proger <lb/>
reduction of the civil expenditure, these duties <lb/>
might be dispensed with, and a surplus left to <lb/>
stimulate the energies of the country. It would <lb/>
be for the Government, if they desired to retain <lb/>
to their places, to give effect to these sayings <lb/>
which this side would show could be easily <lb/>
carried out. Hon members on this side did not <lb/>
covet their offices. Let the present holders <lb/>

 <cb/>
 
retain them. On this side they were willing <lb/>
to act the part of Mr. Gladestone with the <lb/>
Reform Bill, who carried the measure while in <lb/>
opposition. So this sile were ready to carry <lb/>
out a financial reform for the benefit of the <lb/>
    country, without caring for the <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> of <lb/>
office, which the present holders were welcome to <lb/>
remain at such recuded salaries as were com<lb break="no"/>mensurate with the extent of their duties and <lb/>
the circumstances of the country. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:SHEA2">Hon. A. SHEA</persName>.—The hon. member, in his <lb/>
        anxiety to give out the results of his delibera<lb break="no"/>tions for the past nine months, had <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
altogether from the question before the House, <lb/>
which was simply the appointment of a Serjeant-<lb break="yes"/>at-Arms. The hon. member had gone into at <lb/>
manner of questions, several of which would <lb/>
come up in due course, when they could be <lb/>
better discussed than in the irregular way in <lb/>
which the hon. member had referred to them. <lb/>
But such was the earnestness of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for St. John's West to set his views before the <lb/>
country, that he must lay hold of that opportunity <lb/>
to do so. The question now for their decision <lb/>
was the appointinent of a Serjeant-at-Arms, <lb/>
and it seemed to be the unanimous opinion of <lb/>
the House that Mr. Barnes should be appointed, <lb/>
although there was some difference of opinion as <lb/>
to the salary. He hon. (Mr. S.) was glad <lb/>
there was so much unanimity about Mr. Barnes, <lb/>
who was an old friend of his and a worthy man. <lb/>
He (hon. Mr. S.) would not have troubled the <lb/>
House with any observations beyond the ques<lb break="no"/>tion before the chair, were it not for the irregu<lb break="no"/>lar observations in which the hon. member for <lb/>
St. John's West had indulged, with the evident <lb/>
intention of producing mistaken impressions, <lb/>
which he (hon. Mr. S.) would not allow to <lb/>
go forth, uncontradicted. The hon. member <lb/>
must inform the House and the country that he <lb/>
was opposed to Confederation. That question <lb/>
was not now before the House, and it had been <lb/>
stated by the hon. Attorney General that resolu<lb break="no"/>tions were to be submitted on the question, <lb/>
when there would be an opportuuity for its <lb/>
regular discussion. When it came up he (hon. <lb/>
Mr. S.) would be prepared to deal with it. <lb/>
But the hon, member proposed to obviate the <lb/>
necessity of going into Confederation, by raising <lb/>
the people to a state of prosperity by means of <lb/>
a sweeping reluction of the public expenditure. <lb/>
Now it appeared to him (hon. Mr. S.) that <lb/>
there was an evidant want of sincerity in such <lb/>
professions of a desire to reduce official salaries, <lb/>
when hon. members opposite anticipated that <lb/>
the approaching general election would transfer <lb/>
to them the offices of the Government with <lb/>
their emoluments. The hon. member, how<lb break="no"/>ever, affirmed the practicability of reducing the <lb/>
civil expenditure by £30,000. Now the total <lb/>
amount of the official salaries, from the highest <lb/>
to the lowest, including those of the officers of <lb/>
Customs, was only £32,053 8s. currency.; and <lb/>
how was the hon. member to effect a saving of <lb/>
£25,000 or £30,000 out of that, and still main<lb break="no"/>tain the public departments efficiantly?— <lb/>
The hon. member must have known per<lb break="no"/>fectly well that it was impossible to make <lb/>
such a saving, and said it merely for <lb/>
the sake of effect. The Government had made <lb/>
considerable reductions in the civil expenditure, <lb/>
as offices <choice><sic>bocame</sic><corr>became</corr></choice> vacant by the death of their <lb/>
incumbents, by making no new appointments <lb/>
where they could be dispensed with. The civil <lb/>
expenditure now was cousiderably less than it <lb/>
was a few years ago, and the reductions were <lb/>
effected with a due regard to the claims of ex<lb break="no"/>isting incumbents, and to the circumstances <lb/>
of a large portion of our populations all knew <lb/>
that distress existed, and for years past large <lb/>
sums had to be disbursed from the public trea<lb break="no"/>sury for the relief of the poor; but the decision <lb/>
had been come to, with the concurrence of both <lb/>
sides of the House, that relief should no longer <lb/>
be afforded to the able-bodied poor. But the <lb/>
hon. member would elevate the condition of the <lb/>
people by the saving which he was to effect is <lb/>
the civil oxpenditure. Granting that it was <lb/>
practicable to effect such a saving, how, with <lb/>
the population prostrate from one end of the <lb/>
country to the the other, was he to elevate them <lb/>
to a state of comparative confort with sum of <lb/>
£30,000? What would that saving effect? Why, <lb/>
it would amount to just 61 a quintal on all the <lb/>
fish exported from the Island; so that if a fish<lb break="no"/>erman caught 50 quintals of fish, it would be <lb/>
equivalent to his getting 18s 61. a quintal for it, <lb/>
in place of 18s. And would, 25s a year to a <lb/>
fisherman's family make up the difference be<lb break="no"/>tween poverty and comfort? The people were <lb/>
not so ignorait as to be imposed upon by <lb/>
any such absurdity. It was not by say limited <lb/>
saving in the civil expenditure that the condition <lb/>
of the people was to be elevated, but by opening <lb/>
up to them new sources of employment, and this <lb/>
Confederation would effect. The hon. member <lb/>
indulged in the specious clap trap that in join<lb break="no"/>ing the Confederacy the people would part with <lb/>
their liberties, as it in the Dominion of Canada <lb/>
they had not as well balanced freedom as we <lb/>
enjoy in this Colony. In the great Confed<lb break="no"/>eracy of the United States, which has advanced <lb/>
in the course of two or three generations to be <lb/>
one of the foremost nations of the worlds would <lb/>
it be said that the people of the several States <lb/>
had parted with their liberty in forming a Con<lb break="no"/>federacy which commands the respect of all <lb/>
civilised nations? The hon. member charged <lb/>
the Government with increasing the burden of <lb/>
taxation upon the people. They had imposed <lb/>
no highers duties than were absolutely necessary. <lb/></p>
