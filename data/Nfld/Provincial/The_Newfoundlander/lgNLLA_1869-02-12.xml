lion. mambers say, with an asunption of grave sin<lb break="no"/>cerity, let us educate and inform the people on this <lb/>
question. This was the very course the Govern<lb break="no"/>inent side proposed to take, and was engaged in <lb/>
urging; and this was the tenor of its resolution, <lb/>

and, as he believed, designed to prevent the very <lb/>

and uttery fails to prove it. But, he adds, does <lb/>
Canada sºy she will help us, that she will come <lb/>

doubted if we had the means to continue local <lb/>

obtain Railway work in Canuda the coming suin<lb break="no"/>mer, steamcrs taking theim and bringi g then <lb/>
back, it they chose to return. That was a sun.ill <lb/>
example of what univn would do. The union ut <lb/>
the two Capadas was cited as an unfortunate oilu. <lb/>
True, there had been some political disaffection, <lb/>
but the material progress of those file countries <lb/>
had not been interrupted, in population, public <lb/>
wºrks, railways, &amp;c. It showed how little our <lb/>
people need care about the political changes, iſ the <lb/>
substautial blessings of lile were to ſlow <lb/>
from the proposed union. The hon. and learned <lb/>
luetmber ticu proceeued to 8how that so fur irutu <lb/>
its being the fact, as Mr. Tilbot had said, that Sir <lb/>
liugh Hoyles had uo been favourable to Confe<lb break="no"/>deration, he, Sir Hugh, hud been the very strºng<lb break="no"/>est advocate of it, and would have adopted tie <lb/>
Quebec sclieme without hesitatiou, but for the less <lb/>
buld policy of his ussociates and tile ineumbers of <lb/>
the House in general. Here Mr. Pinseut cited <lb/>
at considerable length from the speech of Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General Hoyles in 1865, a speech whicu he <lb/>
designated us out of the most powertul ever ut<lb break="no"/>tured here upon the subject. Tilat speech was in <lb/>
connection with the oily Resolution ever passed <lb/>
by this House in tie unatter of Gouiederation, and <lb/>
the closing language oi that Resulution, prop sel <lb/>
by Mr. Høyles, secuuded by the present Receiver <lb/>
General, Mr. Kent, then in oppositivu, and curried <lb/>
unanimously, was " that a linul determination <lb/>
upon this importunt subject be deterra 1 until <lb/>
the next session of the Legislature." The <lb/>
session there reterred to was the first <lb/>
session of this very preseut Parlialuent, so that <lb/>
if that resulution had been acted upon, as it unight, <lb/>
in all consistency have been, the question now <lb/>
before us, for consideration oily, migut have been <lb/>
finally determined turce years ago, without any <lb/>
further appeal. But on account of the desire <lb/>
generally expressed, that it should not be so <lb/>
ficted upou, but that butter terms should it possi<lb break="no"/>ble, be secured, and the conditious ascertained <lb/>
for the inſurinution of the Jeople, and a promise <lb/>
of the premier that there should be uo final deter<lb break="no"/>mination until the inuproved terms had been first <lb/>
submitted to the people, ſor these reasons a <lb/>
course, the one now being pursued, was taken. <lb/>
Here Mr. Pinsent read a long extruct ſroul, as h <lb/>
said, the finest speech, and that was say great <lb/>
deal, ever delivered by Mr. Reuout in the Assem<lb break="no"/>bly, in which, in 1965, he supported Mr. Hoyles's <lb/>
resolution, and poiuted out in turcible terms the <lb/>
propriety of taking the course now proposed by <lb/>
the governunent, belore sending the question to <lb/>
the people, also extracts troºm jr. Glen's speeches <lb/>
of that time to the same effect, and part of ºn <lb/>
editorial from the Patriot printed by the hon. mem. <lb/>
bºr, Mr. Parsons, in Roman letters, which could <lb/>
alumust be read from the gallery, to the effect that <lb/>
no sane than could for 3 inoment think of rejecting <lb/>
the consºlºition of equitable terms. He (Air. P.) <lb/>
never could bring himself to believe in the sincerſ <lb/>
ity of Mr. Parsons's subsequent opposition. It <lb/>
must have been irom fearola loss of that 1. opularity <lb/>
of which he was so fond, and which he so de<lb break="no"/>servºlly enjoyed; but that hon, member would <lb/>
do wisely now in turning with the tide, which had <lb/>
evidently set the other way. The hou. member <lb/>
(Mr. Pinsent) then showsd that there was to fail <lb/>
comparison to be mºde with the Irish uniou, some <lb/>
of the terms of which every liberlly tuiuded man <lb/>
now condemned and eudeavoured to remove. <lb/>
There were no objections of that kind to Confeder. <lb/>
ich conteumplated perfect equality, and <lb/></p> 

<p>il atºl religious liberty in its highest uevelop<lb break="no"/>meut. Would jute Iligent men be deluded by the <lb/>
prºposal to take...off all duties ou the staple <lb/>
accessaries of life this session, as a partial <lb/>
alleviatiosi of the burtheus of the people, when <lb/>
the finaucial eoudition of the gov and the <lb/>
state of the people were sush its they now ure, aul <lb/>
with a debt cousiderably exceeding half a million <lb/>
ºf dollars tº be redeemed in tour or five years? <lb/>
Iſºn: members whº suggested such neºs <lb/>
must be aware of their iupossibility, and the <lb/>
ºpiº, and rºiu which must bºonju. <lb/>
on their adoption as we now are, while by an alli<lb break="no"/>ance with the Dominion those objects they so <lb/></p> 



<p>ded to argue that if the policy of the Statesmen of <lb/>
Great Britain to annex this Island and the sister <lb/>
Provinces, was Confederation, this was a strong addi<lb break="no"/>tional reason for submitting to it, and he pointed out <lb/>
several modes in which an indirect pressure might <lb/>
be bronght to bear upon us, even if the parent state <lb/></p> 

<p>would be fairly potent. It was not to be sup <lb/>
that all the rest were to be banded against us. <lb/></p>

Harbor Main of considerable weight and in<lb break="no"/>portance in this H usef And it bore the same <lb/>
relation to its numbers as our number of Repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives would to the Central Parliament. <lb/>
The Lon. member proceeded to take up other <lb/>
objections and positions put from the other side, <lb/>
argued that the amen ment was unfounded in fact, <lb/>
inconsistent in itself, and opposed to the principles <lb/>
hon. gentlemen opposite contended tor. He uſged <lb/>
that the course propose i by the address, far from <lb/>
being any interference with the rights of the people, <lb/>
was what the country was anxiously looking for, <lb/></p> 

<p>that it might know en what to decide. Meinhers <lb/>
on this side of the House proposed to take the <lb/>
proper preparatory measures before submitting the <lb/>
question o the people. They were prepared to <lb/>
stani or fall by their policy. He felt that they <lb/></p> 

<p>were candidly and honestly discharging their <lb/>
duty to their constituents. If they were rejected, <lb/></p> 

<p>when the basis of terms was submitted, then the <lb/>
consequences lay with the people; and their present <lb/>
Representatives would have acquitted themselves of <lb/>
the grave responsibility of rejecting or dangerously <lb/>
delaying this measnre. He gathered from the <lb/>
course proposed by the other side, from the very <lb/>
language of their aimendment, that their policy was <lb/></p> 

<p>by again sunn ng up the adva.tages to be derived <lb/>
fron union, and describing the nobler character of <lb/>
that new political and cominercial life into which we <lb/>
shall have entered under Confederation. ... . <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Rexocri-Notwi.listin ling the bitter <lb/>
scolding which the Opposition had just received, <lb/>
he would not be deterrid from suppoiling the <lb/>
amendment of the hon. member, Mr. Talbºt. <lb/>
The hon. member who had just spoken. and <lb/>
taxed this side of the House with inconsisten<lb break="no"/>cies, should have recollected the old adage rela: <lb/>
tive to the peculiar liability of those who lived <lb/>
in giass houses. In 1865 the hon, ºnember was <lb/>
in the Legislative Council, and had there given <lb/>
notice that he would move the following <lb/>
lesulutions:- a <lb/></p> 

<p>First,-\-That for Newfoundland to enter into a 'Con. <lb/>
federation of the British North American Coloniasupon thc <lb/>
terms, proposed in the Report of the Quebec Couference, <lb/>

But us uv further record was to be found of this <lb/>

to be the case, th it the ho - member thought <lb/>
better to abandon it. Iu 1866, he give another <lb/>
notice, which he also dropped like a hot potatoe. <lb/>

The House met pursuant to adjournment. <lb/></p>
    
    <p rendition="simple:centre">ORDER OF THE DAY.</p>
    
    <p>
Committee of the Whole on Address. Mr. Knight <lb/>
in the Chair. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
The paragraph relating to Confederation having <lb/>
been read. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:OREI2">Mr. O'RIELLY</persName> said,—So much had been said on <lb/>
this matter, and so many diverse opinions offered, <lb/>
that the subject might be well said to be worn <lb/>
threadbare. While hon. members accused each <lb/>
other of inconsistency he at least could lay claim to <lb/>
consistency upon this question, and if he could <lb/>
not point to, any record of lengthy arguments <lb/>
which he had employed, he could at least flatter <lb/>
himself that he had no shifts or backslidings to ac<lb break="no"/>count for. His position was still precisely the same <lb/>
as that which he and his hon. colleagues had assumed <lb/>
at the hustings in '65, with this difference, however, <lb/>
that whatever difficulties he had then seen in the <lb/>
way had now entirely disappeared. The confederate <lb/>
cause had been gaining ground over all the Island, <lb/>
and though the Confederate party were continuing <lb/>
faithful to their pledge, that the question should be <lb/>
submitted to the constituencies, public opinion from <lb/>
Cape John to Cape Ray, was calling aloud for a <lb/>
change. The principle of Confederation was now <lb/>
under discussion. Who denied the principle? <lb/>
To use the joint language of the hon. and gallant <lb/>
Major, and the hon. member, Mr. Talbot, "the <lb/>
highest and most gifted minds acknowledge the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple." There was not the beginning of a differ<lb break="no"/>ence with regard to the principle between hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers on this and on the other side. Hon. members <lb/>
opposite were all confederates, and the only differ<lb break="no"/>ence, between them was upon matters of detail. <lb/>
Surely then upon the question of details hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers could well give over their party differences. <lb/>
As to terms there were few hon. members who would <lb/>
be more difficult to please than himself, and <lb/>
when the debate upon the subject came on <lb/>
he should be prepared to contend that express <lb/>
provision should be made for the encouragement of <lb/>
        the fisheries. Exception had been taken to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">bona <lb/>
fide</hi> character of the telegram recieved by his hon. <lb/>
coleague offering employment to 800 or 1,000 people. <lb/>
He might safely say that all that scepticism was to be <lb/>
found within the doors of this House. Those persons <lb/>
who were most to be affected by it had full faith in <lb/>
        its reality and they regarded it as a <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
        <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
        
        <cb/>
        
tion means employment. While the abstruse argu<lb break="no"/>ment of hon. members opposits might be thrown <lb/>
away, the people would be able understand when they <lb/>
were spoken to in this manner. The only thing hon. <lb/>
members opposite had done was to endeavour to <lb/>
mystify the people. If their real opinions were worth <lb/>
anything the people must go without them. On the <lb/>
question of terms he (Mt. O'R) should be prepared to <lb/>
press what he considered to be essential conditions, <lb/>
no one would attempt to deny that he was an out<lb break="no"/>spoken Confederate, but he should always be jealous <lb/>
of this country's interests in connection with the <lb/>
    question of terms. <lb/></p>

<p>After some remarks from <persName ref="pers:HOGS1">Mr. HOGSETT</persName>, <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:PARS1">Mr. PARSONS</persName> said that he had been waiting for <lb/>
some hon member opposite to enlighten the <lb/>
House uppon the question before the chair. <lb/>
He had expected to hear some vigorous oration <lb/>
upon this all important question of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. It would appear that there was not much <lb/>
unanimity as to the meaning of the word. <lb/>
The hon member, Mr O'Rielly, says that it means <lb/>
employment for the people. Well, that certainly <lb/>
was a new meaning to hin (Mr P.) and was one <lb/>
which would hardly be found in any dictionery. If <lb/>
that were really the meaning of it—it it would <lb/>
procure that, the Opposition would hail Confederation <lb/>
with one voice. But he feared no such meaning <lb/>
would be placed upon it. We do not want to go <lb/>
abroad from this colony to seek employment because <lb/>
we had it within our own borders. We did not want <lb/>
to transport 800 of our stalwart fishermen into the <lb/>
wilds of Canada. We would keep them here and <lb/>
give them better employment than Canada could <lb/>
afford them. What I expatriate the hardy natives <lb/>
of this colony and make them seek employment <lb/>
amongst strangers? Why it was a policy that no <lb/>
parental Government would entertain. The hon <lb/>
member then proceeded to show that we had within <lb/>
ourselves resources which if fostered and developed <lb/>
by the Government were more than sufficient for our <lb/>
population. He considered the bringing of this <lb/>
question of Confederation before the House now was <lb/>
a breach of faith on the part of the Government, <lb/>
that there was no evidence before this House that <lb/>
the public desired any change. He referred to the <lb/>
Petitions which had been presented former sessions <lb/>
against Confederation, and contended that the <lb/> 
opinion of the people was the same now, and that no <lb/>
step should be taken by this House before an appeal <lb/>
was made to the country at the next general election. <lb/></p>

<p>
    Upon motion the Committee then rose, reported <lb/>
    progress, and asked leave to sit Monday.
</p>
    <p>
        The House then adjourned until Monday at 3 <lb/>
        o'clock. <lb/>

Upon motion of the Hou. ArroRNEY GENERAL, <lb/></p> 

<p>the House resolved itself into a Committee of the <lb/>

The hon. the SPEAKER said that he considered it." <lb/>
to be his duty, occupying the position of Speaker of <lb/>
this House, to refer to certain remarks contained in <lb/>
the Chronicle of this morning, in which he had been <lb/>
charged with uttering language derogatory to Mr. G <lb/>
F Bennett. <lb break="no"/>call upon the House to endorse what he now said, <lb/>
that he neither directly nor inferentially referred to <lb/>
Mr. Bennett. <lb/>
guilty of a violation of the rules of this House, and <lb/></p> 

<p>He must contradict that statement, and <lb/></p> 

<p>Had he done so he would have been <lb/></p> 

<p>he thought all would do him the justice to say that <lb/>
since he had the honor of pre # <lb/>
ways endeavoured to sustain the dignity of the <lb/>
House and adhere to the rules governing our de<lb break="no"/>bates. Had the remarks in this paper mºrely refer<lb break="no"/>- red to himself personally, he would have deemed <lb/>
them unworthy of notice, but when they referred to <lb/>
his position as the Speaker of this House, he con<lb break="no"/>sidered that in recognition of that duty which he <lb/>
owed to that office and to this House, he was bound <lb/>
to take notice of this matter and contradict it. <lb/>
would again declare that he had neither directly nor <lb/>

<p>The hon. Receiver General, Mr. Prowse, and the <lb/></p> 

<p>Colonial Secretary also sustained the assertion of the <lb/>
hon. and learned Speaker, and bore testimony to the <lb/>
dignity with which he had always upheld his posi­ <lb/></p> 

<p>tion. <lb/>
The Receiver GENERAL remarked that the offi<lb break="no"/>cial Reports were confirmatory of what the Speaker <lb/>
had declare <lb/>
Mr. TALBor could not say whether the words had <lb/>
been used or not, but he denied that the official <lb/>
Reports were any authority upon the matter. <lb/>
GLRN was glad to see that every oné read the <lb/>
Chronicle, it shewed that it was the true exponent of <lb/>
public opinion. He thought that it was carrying this <lb/>
unatter too far when he heard that the Editor of the <lb/>
Chronicle had been ejected from the Clerk's room by <lb/>
the order of the Speaker. The Opposition were <lb/>
attacked in the most outrageous manner every day, <lb/>
but they paid no attention to it. <lb/>
Tue hon. A. SBEA was sorry that the hon. and <lb/>
learned Speaker had taken the trouble to occupy <lb/>
a moment of time with a matter so paltry. Suppose <lb/>
he had said Mr. Bennett was the Head 3.nº ºthe <lb/>
Anti-Confederates? What then Was that gentle<lb break="no"/>man ashamed of being so called? What then was <lb/>
there in it that any man should feel thin skinned <lb/>
about? But the hon, the Speaker had never men<lb break="no"/>tioned Mr. Bennett's name. How then could he <lb/>
have spoken disrespectfully of him?. He (Mrs) <lb/>
had referred to Mr. Bennett in this House and <lb/>
would do so again when he deemed it uecessary, but <lb/>
he had never spoken *... of him. He <lb/>
was sorry any importance had been attached to this <lb/>
matter. He would now refer to the paragraph be<lb break="no"/>fore the Chair, This section then affirmed that the <lb/>
time had arrived for considering this question of <lb/>
Confederation, so that it might be referred to the <lb/>
various constituencies. Now the hon. member Mr, <lb/>
Talbot the other evening in a speech of considerable <lb/>
length, denied this. He (Mr. S.) admitted that the <lb/>
hon. member had discussed the matter with a great <lb/>
deal of ability and in language that was certainly <lb/>
entitled to respect, and he made this admission <lb/>
freely and readily, altho' both in the premises and <lb/>
conclusions of the hon. member he entirely dis<lb break="no"/>agreed. The hon, member had asserted that the <lb/>
time had not arrived for dealing with this question, <lb/>
and that this House had no authority to deal with it, <lb/></p> 

<p>He thought that the time had fully arrived for this <lb/>
question to be considered, and further, that was <lb/>
in accordance with the existing state of <lb/>
opinion, Why, what was the reprºach that had been <lb/></p> 

<p>public <lb/></p> 

<p>uttered against us time after time 2 That we did <lb/></p> 

<p>not bring down the terms, so that the people might <lb/>
be fully instructed upon them, and now, with a <lb/>
strange and marvellous inconsistency. they tell us <lb/>
that we have no right to go into the discussion and <lb/>
provision should be made for the encouragement of investigation of those very terms, for which they had <lb/></p> 

<p>what were satisfactory terms or not. It could not be <lb/>
too well known, he thought, that no proceeding wº <lb/>
contemplated by this Liouse by which this question <lb/>
would be finally determined. We simply desired tº <lb/>
show the country what the terms were—so that they <lb/>
might give them earnest consideration, and be in 4 <lb/>
position at the general election to say whether they <lb/></p> 

<p>lature or by the country, because it had never bºss <lb/>
submitted to either. This House would certainly be <lb/>
open to censure it it permitted such a statement to go <lb/>
unchallenged. Hon alembers opposite a few years <lb/>
ago, . when there was a paragraph in the address <lb/>
relative to Confederation, said, if you pass it, you <lb/>
affirm the principle of Confederation. The Goveral <lb/>
ment declared at the time that that was not a right <lb/>
interpretation to place upon it, as the section was oils <lb/>
which pronounced no opinion, and went ºuerely for <lb/>
delay. But so assured were they that it affirmed the <lb/>
principle of Confederation, that they proposed an <lb/>
amendment to it. (Here the hon member read the <lb/>
same.) Now if that amendment had been carried, <lb/>
the hoa member would have been borne out in his <lb/>
statement that the question had been rejected. But <lb/>
the fact was, that that amendinent had been igno, <lb/>
iminiously rejected by a majority of eighteen to six, <lb/>
How then could it be said that the Quebec scheus <lb/>
had ever been rejected by this House. Now he ſ \ir <lb/>
S) did not claim that thut majority aſfirined the <lb/>
principle of Contederation, he merely claimed that it <lb/>
rejected the amendment against the principle. His <lb/>
was indeed somewuat surprised that the lion member <lb/>
Mr Talbot should deal with so important a question <lb/>
in the nanner he had. The clap trap about our <lb/>
lives and liberties was not worthy that gentleman', <lb/>
position or ability. Then he appeals to the natives <lb/>
not to sell their country. Tuat question of sals <lb/></p> 

<p>gainer by that sale He merely referred to this <lb/>
in reference to the question which had been raisel, <lb/>
and to shew that selling a country was not atter <lb/>
so terrible a thinx, but was a proceed.ng by which <lb/>
many countries had been benefitted. " The hon <lb/>
meuber then referred to Irish encumbered estates <lb/>
Act, and shewed the alivantages it had conferred, <lb/>
regarding it in the light of a forced sale. The hº <lb/>
meuber Mr Talbot tells us that the Irish Union was <lb/>
caused by bribery, and that sons three millions wers <lb/>
spent lor.that purpose. Well, that was true. But <lb/>
who was it that received that money? Why the <lb/>
ºpposition, who then occupied that position in the <lb/>
Irish Parliament which hon gentlemen oppone'd, <lb/>
huts. It was to purchase their woes that this ujuuy <lb/>
had been spent. <lb/></p> 

<p>Ma. Lºrree.—Are you going to give as sºmé. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. Mr. Shka–Don't let the hon. member, <lb/>
mouth water too soon, Île would not have hon, gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen oppositº indulge in extravagant expectations <lb/>
of what might happen here. The Un or of Irelani <lb/>
was an exception and was not one that should b, <lb/>
quoted, ...That was a Union between people not, on <lb/>
an equality. It was a Union of a dominant race <lb/>
with a slavish and enthralled one. It was the union <lb/>
of men who enjoyed civil an I religious rights with <lb/>
men who had nuthur the one nor the other, was it <lb/>
then anything surprising that the dominant cle, <lb/>
should regard the otbers as slaves and treat thea of <lb/>
But were the same conflicting eleucots to be ſouni <lb/>
here 2 Had we not all civil and regious liberty? <lb/>
Were we not all upon the same looting 7 were as <lb/>
not equal in the eye of one Govern ment and it un<lb break="no"/>Mersal laws? Would the hon gentleman say that the <lb/>
Union of the States was a falºre? Janadian Union <lb/>
he says was a ſailure Where does the hon. member <lb/>
get his facts for making such a statement? <lb/>
The result to the country was great prosperiy. <lb/>
He had not then a hand the sta istics of popu, <lb/>
lition, produce, &amp;c., but he knew that they <lb/>
showed sufficient to justify the assertion that the <lb/>
Union of the two Provinces had proved a succes, <lb/>
Was the fact that the people of England last <lb/>
year demanded a new Bºforin Bill any proof <lb/>
th it the bill of 1832 was a failure? No iſ otly <lb/>
showed that the time for further changes had <lb/>
some, and just so with the question of Union. <lb/>
The time for change cam', and when the ques. <lb/>
tion which had agitated the Lower Province', <lb/>
was ripe for settlement, Canada could searcely <lb/>
believe that Nova Scotia, the cladle of Union, <lb/>
would tura its back on its own offspring. It was <lb/>
stated that the Delegates had condemned the <lb/>
Quebec Resolu ions. Such was not tua case, <lb/>
neither the hon. and learned Attorney Gaueral <lb/>
nor he (hon. Mr. S.) had ever said so. They <lb/>
never eutertained such opinions as would justily <lb/>
them in saying so. Having regard to the time <lb/>
ºf its origiu, he denied that it was a plan which <lb/>
deserv'd coudemuation. It was most lavorably <lb/>
received, and coun vided the admiration of the <lb/>
ablest and most intelligent men in England. <lb/>
It had since then been slightly nod fied, but <lb/>
how? Was it not by making concessions all <lb/>
round, on the oue silio as well as the other? <lb/>
The result of monetary consessions would by <lb/>
that whºle we might get more money for our <lb/>
own immediate purposes, we would act be <lb/>
benefited to tug fu.j extent supposed, because <lb/>
to the extent of the increase received we lessen <lb/>
the money which would remain in the hauds of <lb/>
he General Government for general purposes. <lb/>
The ouly changes made as yet were nonetary <lb/>
ones. The framework and eharacter of the * <lb/>
constitution, the powers of the general and local <lb/>
governunauts, are sull the same as adopted in <lb/>
Quebec, so that in these principal points thusa <lb/>
resulutions remain intact. In one other poia <lb/>
ºly was any change made, and that was by the <lb/>
British Government in the number of Seators, <lb/>
