you allow me to remark on one statement which <lb/>
forms no legal part of the judgment, since it was <lb/></p> 

<p>made in support only, of a pont which was ruled P, <lb/>
The judgment runs:– In the rubric, as to the re­ <lb/></p> 

<p>ception of the Sacramental bread and wine, the <lb/>
words, "...all meekly kneeling," apply, as their lord<lb break="no"/>ships, think, to the celebrant as well as to other <lb/>
clerks and people.' Now, the rubric, is;; Then <lb/>
shall; the minister first receive the communion in <lb/>
both kinds himself, and then proceed to deliver the <lb/>
same to the bishops, priests, and deacons in like <lb/>
manner (if any be present), and after that to the <lb/></p> 

<p>•ople also, in order, into their hands all meekly <lb/>
É. Now, if, this clause, "all meekly kneel­ <lb/></p> 

<p>ing, applied at all to the celebrant,it would gramma­ <lb/></p> 

<p>tically involve the direction that he should kneel <lb/>
while aduinistering to others. A direction which <lb/>
occurs atter the mention of two acts of a person can<lb break="no"/>not (if it applies to him as all) be limited to the first <lb/>
of those two acts, to the exclusion of that the mention <lb/>
of which, immediately precedes that direction, Il <lb/>
this (as it would), involves an absurdity, then tha. <lb/>
whole construction, is faulty, and it tollows that the <lb/>
direction can apply to neither, Yet, altbough this is <lb/>
only an argument, and so not binding in law, the <lb/>
charge against Mr. Mackonochia could not have been <lb/></p> 

<p>substantiated without it. For apart from this com. <lb/></p> 

<p>struction, it could not have been alleged that Auy <lb/>
offence had been committed by his kneeling at the <lb/>
eyd of the prayer of consecration. Now, even <lb/>
:::::: that the construction were doubtful, we <lb/>
all qi is remember how carefully Dr. Lushing:on, in <lb/>
the "Essays and Reviews' case, laid down again and <lb/>
again that, it being a criminal cause, the donbt <lb/>
was in each case to be given in favour of the res, <lb/>
ppndant: I need not say what effect it will produce <lb/>
in the minds of English Churchmen if the Supreme <lb/>
Court of Appeal is at one time stringent in its con. <lb/>
struction of words, at another lax, and both alike in <lb/>
criminal giutes: • For, however the aecuser's, costs. <lb/>
which are thus laid upon-Mackonchie, may be paid <lb/>
by others, the law knows nothing of this. It has not <lb/>
only condemned him of doing an unlawful act in the <lb/>
most solemn part of public worship (which is the <lb/>
most sensible wound it could inflict on any clergy. <lb/>
man), but has laid a considerable fine upon him. <lb/>
The world would call this playing fast and loose'. <lb/>
"loose,' whenever it is the question of allowing any <lb/>
matter of taith to be disbelieved; "last," when it is <lb/>
the question of not allowing anything to be be<lb break="no"/>lieved which, popular. prejudice disbelieves. It <lb/>

<p>ON yesterday at two o'clock the Legislative Ses<lb break="no"/>sion was opened by His Excellency the Governor <lb/>
with the accustomed formalities and with the Speech <lb/>
which appears below. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
Addresses in reply were moved, in the Council, <lb/>
        by the Hon. <persName ref="pers:WINT2">Dr. Winter</persName>, seconded by the hon. <persName ref="pes:CLIF1">Mr. <lb/>
    Cliff</persName>; and in the Assembly moved by <persName ref="pers:GODD1">Mr. Godden</persName>, <lb/>
seconded by <persName ref="pers:BARR3">Mr. Barron</persName>. <lb/> </p>

    <p><persName ref="pers:GODD1">Mr. Godden</persName>, the new member for Harbor Grace <lb/>
spoke eartinently upon the leading points of the <lb/>
Speech, endorsing specially its Confederation policy. <lb/>
He was assailed by Messrs. Renouf and Hogsett, both <lb/>
of whom decried Confederation, abused the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for not having supplied seed Potatoes for the <lb/>
poor, and while appearing to approve of the Pro<lb break="no"/>clamation discontinuing able-bodied poor Relief, <lb/>
claimed for themselves the credit of having forced <lb/>
this step upon the Government. The Attorney-<lb break="yes"/>General replied, defending the course adopted by the <lb/>
Government on the potato supply matter, and showing <lb/>
that such aid would have been a mischievous waste <lb/>
of the public funds. He further showed that some <lb/>
members opposite, instead of having any claim to <lb/>
credit for the stopping of assistance to the able-bodied <lb/>
Poor, had done their utmost to force its continuance <lb/>
upon the Government. With regard to Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, he reiterated the favourable opinion he had <lb/>
always entertained upon the question, which however <lb/>
he would reserve for discussion at a more suitable <lb/>
time when Resolutions upon it would be submitted to <lb/>
the House. Mr. Prowse and Mr. Parsons also spoke, <lb/>
the former in favour, and the latter against the pro<lb break="no"/>posal of Confederation. <lb/></p> 

<p>The House having chosen a Committee to draft a <lb/>
Reply, adjourned to Monday. <lb/></p> 

    <p>The following was His Excellency's Speech:— <lb/></p> 

    <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. President and Honourable Gentlemen of the <lb/>
Legislative Council.</hi> <lb/></p>
    
    <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Honourable <lb/>
House of Assembly.</hi> <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
For the fifth time in my administration, of the <lb/>
Government I have the pleasure of meeting you to <lb/>
resume our Legislative duties; and I am happy to <lb/>
remember that nothing during this period has in<lb break="no"/>terrupted the harmony of our intercourse. <lb/></p> 

    <p>The past year has not been marked by any spe<lb break="no"/>cial occurence. A beneficent Providence has <lb/>
protected us from epidemic disease, nor have we <lb/>
had occasion to lament disaster such as that of the <lb/>
devastating gale on the coast of Labrador in 1867. <lb/> 
But beyond exemption from misfortune, our grati<lb break="no"/>tude is due for the good average result of <lb/>
the chief occupation of the people in the cod<lb break="no"/>fishery, both at Labrador and on the coast of <lb/>
Newfoundland. We have been favoured in the <lb/> 
abundant yield of the Potato Crop, which is so im<lb break="no"/>portant to the mass of our population, with less of <lb/>
blight than has been known for may previous years. <lb/>
And the price of provisions, which was unusually <lb/>
high in the early months of last year, has greatly <lb/>
declined, to the advautage of our community who <lb/>
must import the chief necessaries of his. All these <lb/>
circumstances have produced a consequent inproved <lb/>
condition for those who have practical industry and <lb/>
frugality. <lb/> </p> 
    
<p>The depression of Trade and the comparative <lb/> 
failure of the Crops and Fisheries for several past <lb/>
years, had, notwithstanding all the guards at the Com<lb break="no"/>mand of the Government, caused large and increas<lb break="no"/>ing expenditure, in sustaining the able-bodied poor <lb/>
thereby adding an annual aacumulaiton to the <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
Debt, for which no adequate return could be exacted. <lb/></p> 

<p>The impossibility of year by year providing from <lb/>
    our source of revenue for the <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> drafts was

<cb/>

becoming more manifestly plain. They must ne<lb break="no"/>cessarily lead to indrease of taxation to sustain the <lb/>
credit of the Colony, and bear very heavily on the <lb/>
truly industrious and frugal. There was left no <lb/>
alternative to the Government but to issue a notifica<lb break="no"/>tion that reliance must not in future be placed upon <lb/>
obtaining support from the Government. By the <lb/>
advice of my Council I published a Proclamation on <lb/>
the 9th June that relief would thereafter be con<lb break="no"/>fined to the sick and infirm, and to destitue widows <lb/>
and orphans; so that others who had been in the <lb/>
habit of trusting <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> Government for support <lb/> 
might in time provide themselves with subsistence dur<lb break="no"/>ing the next winter. Timely warning was thus given <lb/> 
with due publicity. Many have profited by it and <lb/>
made provision for their necessities, and all might <lb/> 
more or less have done so. It has been pro<lb break="no"/>vidential that the resources at the command of the <lb/>
industrious operative during the past favorable sea<lb break="no"/>son have enabled and justified the Executive in <lb/>
abiding by the Proclamation, and the provision for <lb/>
employment which in many cases resulted from <lb/>
the determination of the Government will doubtless <lb/>
be productive of vast benefit to all interested; and <lb/>
all are interested in the suppression of the gi<lb break="no"/>gantic evils which, in the words of the Proclamation, <lb/>
are shewn to have been produced by a periodical and <lb/>
gratuitous distribution of food, in the destruction of <lb/>
every feeling of self-reliance and of all motive for <lb/>
industrious effort. <lb/> </p> 

<p>Many have been added to the numbers of <lb/>
those availing themselves of the Act which was <lb/>
continued, during the last Session, for the reduc<lb break="no"/>tion of pauperism by promoting the cultivation <lb/>
of the soil, but yet fewer than might have so <lb/>
aided their other means of livelihood. The addition<lb break="no"/>al means of subsistence thus afforded by land obtain<lb break="no"/>able free of charge by those who are willing to <lb/>
labor, in every district of the Colony, of which the <lb/>
occupation is facilitated by the bounty offered and <lb/>
ready to be paid by the Government on the cultiva<lb break="no"/>tion of the soil, whilst affording present compensa<lb break="no"/>tion, would surely be most conducive to permanent <lb/>
independence. <lb/></p>
    
    <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Honorable House <lb/>
of Assembly:</hi> <lb/></p>
    
<p>The usual annual Estimates and Accounts shall <lb/>
be laid before you without delay. The collections <lb/>
under the Revenue Act of 1868 have not been equal <lb/>
to the escimited amount, though larger than those <lb/>
afforded by that of 1867. I rely upon your making <lb/>
due provision for the public service. <lb/></p>

    <p>
During a regent visit to England, I had opportuni<lb break="no"/>ty for personal communication with Her Majesty's <lb/>
Secretary of State upon the questions connected with <lb/>
the 'French Shore.' to which your memorials of last <lb/>
Session referred. You will be glad to be assured <lb/>
that the subject is receiving the careful attention of <lb/>
Her Majesty's Government and that His Grace the <lb/>
Secretary of State had adopted measures to resume <lb/>
negotiations with the French Government for <lb/>
the purpose of arriving at such an amicable <lb/>
understanding as would give effect to the views <lb/>
embodied in the Report of the Joint Communit<lb break="no"/>tes of your Honourable Houses made during the <lb/>
Session of 1867 and adopted by you. I trust <lb/>
that it will not be long belore these negotiations are <lb/>
completed in an arrangetinent which will be advan<lb break="no"/>tageous to both parties, aud while ensuring the due <lb/>
observance of Fishery rights under treaties will re<lb break="no"/>move all obstacles, to the application of capital to <lb/>
mining enterprises in any places on the coast where <lb/>
it may promise to be remunerative. In anticipation <lb/>
of the formal agreement which has been proposed to <lb/>
the French Government, I bave been acquained by <lb/>
His Grace, the late Secretary of State, that he ap<lb break="no"/>proves of the policy indicated in Lord Carnarvon's <lb/>
despatch of the 7th Deceuber 1866, that no action <lb/>
should be taken which can in any way be construed <lb/>
into an interference with the French in the exercise <lb/>
of their Fishery rights, and is of opinion that this <lb/>
policy should be adhered to; but it appears to His <lb/>
Grace that the restriction placed has perhaps been <lb/>
construed more widely than is necessary. I am in<lb break="no"/>formed that His Grace sees no reason why grants <lb/>
should not be sanctioned in the interior of the Island. <lb/>
although near the Coast included in the French <lb/>
limits, provided that no right is granted which will <lb/>
enable buildings to be erected upon the Strand, or <lb/>
which would cause the French to apprehend any <lb/>
interruption to the full enjoyment by them of <lb/>
any of the privileges belonging to their Fishery <lb/>
rights. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>There is an increasing number of applications for <lb/>
mining licenses of search, as well as for Timber <lb/>
Cutting, many of which I shall now consider myself <lb/>
authorised to entertain; and any works which may <lb/>
consequently be put into operation must neces<lb break="no"/>sarily involve the investment of capital and em<lb break="no"/>ployment of labor. With reference to this subject I <lb/>
suggest to you that it will be expedient to make some <lb/>
new Statutory provisions in respect of Licenses or <lb/>
Grants for Timber cutting, with regard to which the <lb/>
existing law is insufficient. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
In accordance with the provisions made during the <lb/>
last Session for the conveyance of the Mails be<lb break="no"/>tween St. John's and Halifax. I have entered into a <lb/>
contract with the Liverpool, New York and Phila<lb break="no"/>delphia Steam Ship Company for this service, for <lb/>
the period of three years, from the 15th of July <lb/>
last, at the rate of £9,000 per annum, of which one <lb/>
half will be defrayed by the Imperial Government. <lb/>
The arrangement has received the approval of Her <lb/>
Majesty's Government. The performance of the <lb/>
service up to this time has been found to be gene<lb break="no"/>rally satisfactory, and the vessels employed unex<lb break="no"/>ceptionable for the purpose. I shall cause copies of <lb/>
the Agreement with Messrs. Inman and Company <lb/>
to be laid before you. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
The great question of the expediency of Union <lb/>
with the Dominion of Canada still remains for your <lb/>
judgment. Your decision upon the principle in<lb break="no"/>volved, and consideration of the terms under which <lb/>
such an arrangement will be desirable, can scarcely <lb/>
be longer deferred with advantage to the communi<lb break="no"/>ty with whose interests we are charged. I believe <lb/>
that public opinion has reached a stage which is ripe <lb/>
for dealing with this subject in a spirit of calm and <lb/>
deliberate investigation. Whatever may be the <lb/>
diversity of views entertained and promulgated by <lb/>
different parties, it cannot be disputed that the <lb/>
issue of this controversy must be one of signal im<lb break="no"/>portance to the future destinies of this community. <lb/>
I do not underrate the magnitude of the interests in<lb break="no"/>volved, but I have never concealed from you that my <lb/>
dispassionate consideration of the proposal induces me <lb/>
strongly to believe that those interests will be promot<lb break="no"/>ed by Union with the progressive communities which <lb/>
now form the Dominion. I have no reason to doubt <lb/>
what I have stated to you on former occasions that <lb/>
the Government of Canada is disposed to meet in a <lb/>
spirit of liberality, any suggestions which may ema<lb/><unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> from you. The essence of any agreement which <lb/>
should be mutually advantageous must be its equity, <lb/>
and own self respect will prevent any demands <lb/>
being made by us which would place us in the position <lb/>
    
    <cb/>
    
of an artificially protected dependency when desiring <lb/>
to form an integral part of a trans-atlantic portion of <lb/>
the British Empire daily increasing in wealth and <lb/>
importange.I recommended anew the whole subject <lb/>
to your careful thought, in confidence that it will <lb/>
receive your attention. The renewal of the Treaty <lb/>
of Reciprocal Trade with the United States is a <lb/>
matter sure to obtain the best efforts of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the Dominion for its settlement on satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory terms at no distant date, but it is useless to <lb/>
disregard the fact that the present financial position <lb/>
of the Colony precludes any hope of our being able <lb/>
to avail ourselves of any such arrangement unless as <lb/>
forming part of the Dominion, and this circumstances <lb/>
alone shows the weighty character of the question <lb/>
you are called upon to decide. We cannot remain <lb/>
aloof from the Union without being compelled to im<lb break="no"/>pose much higher taxation upon the labouring classes <lb/>
for some years to come than any likely to be <lb/>
raised by the Parliament of the Dominion. Be<lb break="no"/>fore any final arrangement can be completed <lb/>
opportunity will be afforded, for, its acceptance <lb/>
and ratification by the Constituencies. But it rests <lb/>
with you if you agree that Union is desirable, to <lb/>
devise the best means of arriving at satisfactory <lb/>
terms with the Government of the Dominion. When <lb/>
these are concerned, the Imperial Act provides the <lb/>
mode of admission to the Dominion by order of Her <lb/>
Majesty in council upon such terms as shall be ex<lb break="no"/>pressed in Addresses from the Parliament of Canada <lb/>
and the Legislature of this Colony, and shall be <lb/>
approved by Her Majesty. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
I will not detain you longer from the discharge <lb/>
of your duties. Conscious of their high importance, <lb/>
I pray that the Almighty Ruler of events may guide <lb/>
you in your deliberation. <lb/></p>

<p>His Excellency's speech is one of much more than <lb/>
ordinary importance, embracing, as it does, a distinct <lb/>
proposition to deal with the great question of the day, <lb/>
as well as for the satisfactory information con<lb break="no"/>tained in it regarding our laud rights on the French <lb/>
Shore. On the former matter, we have no doubt what<lb break="no"/>ever that the proposition of Union on reasonable terms <lb/>
will be sustained in the Legislature by a sweeping <lb/>
majority. It has come to be admitted by all who <lb/>
reason on the subject that the exigencies of this <lb/>
country now demand some remedial measure from <lb/>
    without—something too radical and comprehensive <lb/>
to lie within compass of any merely local expedient <lb/>
that can be devised. In Confederation alone are <lb/>
we offered this means of meeting the requirements <lb/>
of our condition; and we are therefore confident <lb/>
that the wise and practical suggestions of his Ex<lb break="no"/>celleney's speech will meet that response which <lb/>
sense and intelligence must dictate to a people <lb/>
whose vital interests are involved in the speedy set<lb break="no"/>tlement of this question. <lb/></p>
