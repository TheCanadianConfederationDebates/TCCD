ORDER OF THE DAY. <lb/>
Address of conqolence to the fam iy of the late hon <lb/>
Jr. Rothford, <lb/>
Hon. E. MoRRis sº id he regretted to be obliged to <lb/>
observe that since hon members assen, bled here last <lb/>
session their number hau been reduced by the removal <lb/>
from amongst them of their late hon brother member, <lb/>
Joctor Rºchford—a man truly honorable and respecta<lb break="no"/>ble, and esteemed by every member of this house. His <lb/>
connection with the Legislative Council was a long one, <lb/>
and during the whole course of an honorable career, both <lb/>
as a legislator and in his high professional character, his <lb/>
gentlemanly deportment and conciliatory manner had <lb/>
earned for him the esteem of his brother members as <lb/>
well as of the general community. <lb/></p> 

<p>In accordance with the notice he had given on the first <lb/>
day of the session, he begged to request the concurrence <lb/>
of the Council to the following Resolutions:— <lb/>
Resolved,—That the Legislative Council her by records <lb/>
its deep regret for the recent demise of the late Hon. <lb/>
Doctor Rotchford, an event which has deprived the <lb/>
Council of an esteemed and truly amiabe member, and <lb/>
the ity of professional gentleman who duriug <lb/>
a:ong course of practice, had acquired the confidence of <lb/>
tho public, and whose character throughout, both in pub<lb break="no"/>| '" and private lite, was unimpeachable. <lb/>
Resolved.—That the Council deeply sympathises with <lb/>
the family of the late hon. Dr. Rochford in their affliction <lb/>
for his loss; and that a copy of these Resolutions be <lb/>
sent to them in token of their sympathy. <lb/>
lion. P. G. Tessier cordially agreed with the senti. <lb/>
ments of the honorable mover of the resolutions, and <lb/>
begged to second the motion for their adoption. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. N. STABB-We can only regret that we are <lb/>
so frequently called upon to take part in similar melan<lb break="no"/>choly proceedings. Nearly every session the Council has <lb/>
to deplore the death of a brother member, six or seven <lb/>
having been removed by the hand of death within a very <lb/>
few years. It would no doubt be gratifying to the sur<lb break="no"/>viving members of the late hon 1)octor Rochford's family <lb/>
to receive this deserved recognition of the high esteem <lb/>
and appreciation in which he was held his brother <lb/>
members of the Legislative Council. He heartily supported <lb/>
the proposition <lb/>
The resolutions were then put from the chair and <lb/>
and carried unanimously. <lb/>
On motion of hor. R. J. PINskNT, the following gen<lb break="no"/>tleman were appointed a select committee on the prints <lb/></p> 

<p>Finsent, E. Morris, and P. G. Tessier. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon R. J. PINSENT gave notice that on Monday next, <lb/>
he would move the adoption of the following resolu<lb break="no"/>tions:­ <lb/></p> 

<p>First—That for Newfoundland to enter into a Confed<lb break="no"/>eration of the British North American Colonies, upon <lb/>
the terms proposed in the Report of the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, would be detrimental to the best interests of this <lb/>
Colony, and ought to be resisted. <lb/></p> 

<p>Second—That a humble address be presented to Her <lb/>
Majesty, embodying the views of the Legislative Council <lb/>
upon tuls subject, with their reasons for the adoption of <lb/>
these views. <lb/>
Third—That a Select Committee of this House be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed to draft the said Address. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. P. G. Tessier gave notice that he would, on <lb/>
fºunorrow, ask the non the organ of the Government to <lb/>
on ºne table of the house a return snowing the value <lb/>
of the Imports for 1863, and the amount of duties collec<lb break="no"/>led thereon, particularizing , the principal articles of <lb/>
mercuundize with a comparative statement showing the <lb/>
amount of uuties said imporus wou.d have been liable to <lb/>
it levied unger the Uanadian tariff of 1864, with the in<lb break="no"/>crease anu decrease thereon. <lb/></p> 

<p>... house then adjourned until 4 o'clock on Monday <lb/>

    <p rendition="simple:right">FRIDAY, Feb. 3.</p>

<p>The House met at 3 o'clock. <lb/></p> 

<p>On motion of <persName ref="pers:WYAT1">Mr. WYATT</persName>, pursuant to order of the <lb/>
day, the House resolved itself into committee of the <lb/>
whole, on the further consideration of the address to his <lb/>
Excellency the Governor. <lb/></p> 

    <p><persName ref="pers:PARS1">Mr. PARSONS</persName>.—The question embraced in the section <lb/>
now under consideration, that if confederation. A day <lb/>
is, however, set a part for its consideration, and I would <lb/>
not now anticipate what I shall then bave to say on the <lb/>
subject. I rise now merely to reply to an attack made <lb/>
upon me last evening by one of the Delegates to the <lb/>
Quebec convention, the hon member for Placentia and <lb/>
St. Mary's, Mr. Shea. The hon gentleman charged me <lb/>
in the face of the country, with inconsistency,because a late <lb/>
        issue of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Patriot</hi> newspaper contained some remarks, <lb/>
in favour of the union of the maritime provinces. And <lb/>
because I  reduplcate this confederation scheme concocted <lb/>
in secret at Quebec, the hon gentleman assumes that my <lb/>
course is inconsistent. I maintain that I am acting with <lb/>
perfect consistency. There is a marked difference between <lb/>
a Legislative union of the maritime provinces and this <lb/>
project of Confederation. He (Mr. Parsons) would like <lb/>
to be informed by the Premier and the Colonial Secreta<lb break="no"/>ry by what authority they designated the hon member <lb/>
for Placentia and St. Mary's, Mr. Shea, the leader of the <lb/>
opposition, which they did in their communications with <lb/>
the other provinces respecting the appointment of dele<lb break="no"/>gates. The liberal party did not recognise that hon <lb/>
member as their leader, especially in such a delegation. <lb/>
In all those embassies in which he had taken part, the <lb/>
hon member had regarded his own interests more than <lb/>
those of the parties who sent him. How could we forget <lb/>
his self-denial in the matter of the Telegraph Company, <lb/>
of which he became the agent How could we forget <lb/>
his embassy in the matter of Free Trade, which had so <lb/>
much disappointed the expectations of the people? Who <lb/>
could forget his exertions in the matter of the Galway <lb/>
Company, so beneficial to so little advantage to the pub<lb break="no"/>lic, considering how many thousands of pounds it cost? <lb/>
The liberal party would be cautious in entrusting their <lb/>
interests in so vital to the welfare of the people to the <lb/>
hon member. And the result of the conference showed <lb/>
that the selection was not as it ought to be; for it was <lb/>
evident we were sold to the Canadians. A Union on <lb/>
fair terms might be advantageous; but such a one sided <lb/>
measure as that could never have the sanction of the <lb/>
people of Newfoundland; and he (Mr. Parsons) was <lb/>
satisfied it would be rejected by the house. The hon <lb/>
        member had quoted from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Patriot</hi> his (Mr Parsons') <lb/>
options respecting the conduct of the government in not <lb/>
taking action on tue dispatch of the Duke of Newcastle <lb/>
transmitting the resolutions of the Nova Scotia House <lb/>
of Assembly on the subject of a legislative union of the <lb/>
maritime Provinces. Such a union might have something <lb/>
in it calculated to prove beneficial to tuis colony. At all <lb/>
events, it was worth considering. But we had now <lb/>
before us the results arrived at by the Quebec conference, <lb/>
after sitting so many days with closed doors, and he (Mr. <lb/>
Parsons) said it ought to be rejected by the house, if they <lb/>
were Due to the interests of their constituents. I do not <lb/>
believe the people would be adverse to a Confederation <lb/>
based upon principles which would benefit them equally <lb/>
with Canada. But I am sure they will be opposed to <lb/>
the confederation now sought to be effected. What have <lb/>
we to uppe from Canada? Has she anything to bestow <lb/>
upon us> Conteueration may be all well enough for the <lb/>
neighbouring Provinces, but for us who are isolate from <lb/>
them having interests entirely different from theirs, what <lb/>
have we to expect. You talk of beneffitng our sons. Has <lb/>
not Canada sons too, and will not they be the first to <lb/>
occupy vacant places? Tak of our mines. Canada has <lb/>
mines too, and will she not invest money in them in pre<lb break="no"/>ference to ours, The fact is, Canada is a troublesome <lb/>
country. She is always in instine commotion. A great <lb/>
many years have not transpired since she was in rebellion <lb/>
against tue British Government. Only the other day her <lb/>
Parliament House was burnt down, and now, day by day <lb/>
between Orangemen and Femans, she is continually in <lb/>
trouble. She is besides very considerably in debt, with <lb/>
no hope of decreasing it. Her debentures cannot find <lb/>
buyers, save at a discount, and finding it necessary to get <lb/>
out of her financial alticulties she is endeavouring to ally <lb/>
herself to the other colonies, besides she knows this is <lb/>
the only way to prop up her falling credit. Already we <lb/>
find her people unratted aud sent forward to protect her <lb/>
frontier. Already we find them in trouble with the <lb/>
United States, and likely to get into war with them. <lb/>
Should such a war come, will we not have to share it, if <lb/>
we are joined witn her? We do not want the protection <lb/>
of Canada. She has more than she can do to protect herself. <lb/>
We are safe from all aggression if we remain as we are. <lb/>
We have the shields of two nations over us—England and <lb/>
France. As for what the Speaker says about Canada <lb/>
having influenced Britain to withdraw from the French <lb/>
Convention. Canada was as much concerned in that as <lb/>
        we were; and as to the <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> of another Convention to <lb/>
give away our fisheries, we nave received the promise of <lb/>
great Britain that nothing of the sort should be done. I <lb/>
hope we have no paltry sunemers among us willing to sell <lb/>
this country, having the fishermen's interests on their lips, <lb/>
but their own interests in their hearts. The Speaker asks <lb/>
would he, a native, be likely to sell Newfoundland? <lb/>
Does he forget that a Sir John Smith sold Scotland, and <lb/>
a Casneragn sold Ireland. So a native migut sell us. <lb/>
But the man wuo would attempt such a thing would be <lb/>
scouted and coutemned by the people of the whole country. <lb/>
I would like to know what Mr. March would do with <lb/>
such a man. <lb/></p> 

    <p><persName ref="pers:MARC3">Mr. MARCH</persName>.—Hang him. <lb/></p> 

    <p>Mr. PABSONS.—We must not forget the convention <lb/>
was held with closed doors, and we do not know what <lb/>
secret arrangement were made in refereuce to taxa<lb break="no"/>tion and other important matters. As to Union being <lb/>
strength, our Union with Canaua would be no Union, <lb/>
and therefore it would have no strength of the <lb/>
bundle of sticks, because we should be but one single <lb/>
stick at the end of the bundle. The Speaker dwelt <lb/>
largely upon the glorious future which he says is <lb/>
before us under Confederation. I don't believe in <lb/>
that. At all events, we can afford to wait before <lb/>
joining it, that we see what the other Colonies will do, <lb/>
and it would be far better if we first allow them to <lb/>
enter, the Confederation and afterwards act upon their <lb/>
experience. The door will be open for us to enter <lb/>
it just as well by and bye as now. It is but now <lb/>
we are beginning to appreciate the value of Respon<lb break="no"/>sible Government, and are we going to give it up <lb/>
just as we understand its value? Look at the lesson <lb/>
set before us by the United States, and let us hesitate <lb/>
belore binding ourselves to a similar Confederation of <lb/>
States. The advantages set forth by the supporters of <lb/>
Confederation are more than counterbalanced by one <lb/>
year of war, such as that now going on in the United <lb/>
States. We are asked to give up our revenues, a por<lb break="no"/>tion of whcih only we shall recieve in return. To make <lb/>
up the difference we must resort to direct taxation, and

<cb/>

I appeal to those who have experienced the blessings of <lb/>
having the water tax gatherer at the doors, how they will <lb/>
like the idea of other tax gatherers calling upon them <lb/>
to pay a direct tax upon every necessary they use. <lb/>
Under the Confederation the people will have to pay <lb/>
double the amount of taxation they pay now. Canada <lb/>
is thousands upon thousands of pounds in debt, and this, <lb/>
is owing to the corruptness of her politicians. Her <lb/>
representatives are elected by the municipalities, and <lb/>
the members of the latter elect those who can pay the <lb/>
highest bribes. Far better for us will it be to remain <lb/>
as we are. All we need is good fisheries. It is all <lb/>
fudge to say that Canada will supply us more cheaply <lb/>
with manufactures. She can only partially supply her<lb break="no"/>self by an immense protective duty. Her object is plain <lb/>
enough. She is endeavouring to build up her manufac<lb break="no"/>tures, and looks to her sister Colonies for her markets, <lb/>
but until she is in a position to compete successfully with <lb/>
Britain, she cannot supply us more advantageously than <lb/>
we are now supplied. Will Canada take our fish and <lb/>
oil from us? No, because she can get enough else<lb break="no"/>where. I doubt very much whether Nova Scotia and <lb/>
New Brunswick will be disposed to join Canada. They <lb/>
will hesitate before allying themselves with so restless <lb/>
and discontented a people. The letter of Archbishop <lb/>
Connolly has no application whatever to Newfoundiand. <lb/>
It is intended only for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, <lb/>
and does not affect us in any way. Give us good fisher<lb break="no"/>ies, and we shall be perfectly content as we are. We <lb/>
have no Orange or Feman Societies to disturb us; or if <lb/>
we have them, they do not dare to show themselves; nor <lb/>
have we any other occasion for unhappiness. I trust <lb/>
this will continue to be the case, and that by the kind <lb/>
providence of God our country will yet rise from the <lb/>
ruin we are now in. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:RENO1">Mr. RENOUF</persName>—If I consulted my own feelings I would <lb/>
say nothing upon Confederation till the day upon which <lb/>
the subject is to be discussed, but as the delegates have <lb/>
made long speeches, and put forth their arguments. I <lb/>
feel bound to reply to some of their points, I am grateful <lb/>
to find these gentlemen have at length found their <lb/>
tongues. We expected to have heard from them when <lb/>
they first returned, but not one word have they favored <lb/>
us with until yesterday. I would like to know from <lb/>
them why it was we received an invitation to attend the <lb/>
Conference only at the last hour. So late were Cana<lb break="no"/>dians in inviting us that they were at last obliged to do <lb/>
so by telegram. The Delegates met at Quebec, thirty<lb break="no"/>two of them, and there with closed doors and in secret <lb/>
session, they attempted to revolutionize the Constitution <lb/>
of the British North American Provinces. Our delegates <lb/>
were not <choice><sic>authorize</sic><corr>authorized</corr></choice> to sign those resolutions, But they <lb/>
had done so, and the results that Mr. Cardwell accepts <lb/>
their signatures as expressing the voice of this Colony, <lb/>
and forward his despatch to the Governor, Mr. Cardwell <lb/>
tells us we can affirm the resolutions now, and work out <lb/>
the details afterwards, and Mr. Brown of Toronto is now <lb/>
in England waiting the arrival of the other delegates <lb/>
to aid in passing a bill through Parliament, so that if <lb/>
we affirm those resolutious, our two delegates will go <lb/>
home immediately upon the rising af the House, and <lb/>
help to bind us permanently to Confederation. That <lb/>
being the case, we must take care that we do not affirm <lb/>
the resolutions until we have gone back to the people <lb/>
and had a general election. Canada is troubled by two <lb/>
great difficulties, one being military, the other constitu<lb break="no"/>tional, Her military difficulty is that Eugland threa<lb break="no"/>tens to withdraw her troops, and leave Canada to protect <lb/>
herself. This Canada is unable to do, and she wants the <lb/>
other Colonies to help her, either with men or money. <lb/>
Her constitutional difficulty is that Upper and Lower <lb/>
Canada have an equal number of representatives, the <lb/>
consequence of which is that they often come to a dead <lb/>
lock and are really unable to conduct a government <lb/>
through a single term. They want us to help them out <lb/>
of that difficulty also. The Speaker said that the taxation <lb/>
argument was mere claptrap. On the contrary, it is the <lb/>
very pith and marrow of the whole matter. There can <lb/>
be no doubt in the mind of any intelligent man that our <lb/>
taxes will be increased, and if so such a fact could not be <lb/>
regarded as claptrap. He talks about the long prices <lb/>
paid by the fishermen for their supplies, but if Canadian <lb/>
merchants came here to-morrow, would they supply our <lb/>
fishermen at lower rates? Our supplying system is <lb/>
precisely similar to the lumbering system of Canada, but <lb/>
I speak knowingly when I say that the lumberers of <lb/>
Canada are charged much longer prices for their goods <lb/>
than our fishermen are. It is said again that Canada <lb/>
manufactures sufficient to supply our wants, If so why <lb/>
does she not do it? Are not our markets as open to <lb/>
her now as they can be under Confederation? If our <lb/>
trade could be carried on as well with Canada as with the <lb/>
United States, no doubt it would be so. But now, I <lb/>
would ask are we going to get a barrel of flour from <lb/>
Canada to-day. Is not Canada shut up all the winter, <lb/>
and how then can we be supplied by her? And during <lb/>
the summer season, will our merchants allow their ves<lb break="no"/>sels returing from Brazil to pass by New York, Boston <lb/>
and Portland, to go to Canada? Surely they will not, <lb/>
Confederation or no Confederation. Then is is said we <lb/>
shall have a line of steamers to Canada. But what <lb/>
guarantee have we for that, for I see nothing about it in <lb/>
the resolutions? A Company would no inducement to <lb/>
send their steamers here unless they were subsidized, <lb/>
and who is to pay that subsidy? It is Canada? No <lb/>
certainy not. We have had quite euough of steamship <lb/>
subsides already. Now upon the question of tariff. We <lb/>
are told that a uniform race of fifteen per cent will be <lb/>
adopted. Yet even here Canada will be the gainer <lb/>
while we shall lose. When Dr. Tupper, one of the <lb/>
Nova Scotia delegates, returned to his cuistituents, what <lb/>
did he tell them? He told them not to deceive them<lb break="no"/>selves, for taxation would be increased. Railroads were <lb/>
to be built, which could never be of any benefit to New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Other omprovements were also to be <lb/>
carried out, but these would not add to our com<lb break="no"/>fort or prosperity. Taxation a claptrap, indeed? <lb/> 
Just apply the Canadian tarrif to our imports, <lb/>
and what will be the result? Why, that our taxes <lb/>
will be increased £40,000. I have the figures <lb/>
here, and I find that by the application of the Canadian <lb/>
tariff to our imports for the year 1863, it would give a <lb/>
total increase of taxation of £92,208. There would be <lb/>
a decrease on some articles of £11,700, so that the <lb/>
balance of increased taxation would be £40,508. This <lb/>
satement is taken directly from the Customs Returns, <lb/>
and must therefore be regarded as correct. What will <lb/>
our fishermen say when they hear that under the Con<lb break="no"/>federation they will have pay £3,600 more for their <lb/>
        molassess? On tea they will have to pay £2,000 more <lb/>
and over £200 on the single item of blacking alone. <lb/>
over £7,000 upon boots aud shoes. Over 1,000 on <lb/>
        their bread.—£1,200 on soap. On leather £2,400. <lb/>
On sealing guns, power and shot they will have to pay <lb/>
        £500 more, and on manufactured goods £24,000. When <lb/>
the question comes up on the 15th I will be in a position <lb/>
to show that the General Government will have a den<lb break="no"/>ciency of $2000,000, and this sum they will be com<lb break="no"/>pelled to make up by direcdt taxation. But it is said <lb/>
that Canada will open up a field for our young men, and <lb/>

<cb/>

perhaps for our hungry lawyers. But Canada is <lb/>
flooded with lawyers, briefless ones, who are glad <lb/>
to labor on the railroads for a living. It would be <lb/>
no great harm if some of our lawyers were employed <lb/>
in the same respectable way. Canada is as open <lb/>
to our young men now as it possibly can be under Con<lb break="no"/>federation. But even supposing there were offices to <lb/>
be had in Canada, is it likely that our young men would <lb/>
get them in preference to Canadians? What a power<lb break="no"/>ful voice our eight representatives would have among the <lb/>
196 members in Parliament. Oh, Sir, it cannot be <lb/>
doubted that our young men will have a great chance, <lb/>
backed by the influence of 8 members out of 196. My <lb/>
opinion is we should not burry this matter. Mr. Shea <lb/>
stated st the Conference that the Confederation could <lb/>
not do without Newfoundland. So I say here. And <lb/>
yet we are to be glad that Canada will make us a gift of <lb/>
£37,500 for our minerals and waste lands. What an <lb/>
idea? Canada, steeped in debt, make us a <hi rendition="simple:italic">gift</hi>. Do <lb/>
we not give over to her our revenues, and lands, our <lb/>
Constitution, our all, Canada gives us no gift. I will <lb/>
prove to this House and to the country that we give <lb/>
Canada £140,000 a year, and in return we get from her <lb/>
£112,000. We are sold,—our revenues, our lands, our <lb/>
fisheries our constitution, our all—for £112,000 a year <lb/>
She gives us eighty cents per head on our population, <lb/>
but, she will give us no more when our population, is <lb/>
doubled, or when our wants are largely increased. The <lb/>
seat of Government is to be at Ottawa, a town further <lb/>
away from us than London, so that the inconvenience <lb/>
we shall have to submit to on this account will not be <lb/>
small. By the 20th section it will be seen that Lower <lb/>
Canada can never have more than 65 members so that <lb/>
in thirty years Upper Canada, by emigration and in<lb break="no"/>crease of population, will have a larger representation <lb/>
than Lower Canada and all the maratime provinces <lb/>
combined. But we are told any change will be for the <lb/>
better. When you convince us that it is for the better, <lb/>
we'll go for Confederation. Canada is now heavily in debt. <lb/>
At the Union they owed but £1,000, 00, now they owe <lb/>
£16,000,000. Last year they could not sell their de<lb break="no"/>bentures at twenty-five per cent discount, while our <lb/>
debentures are at a premium. We have the authority <lb/>
of Mr. Palmer, one of the delegates for saying that <lb/>
there was great difference of opinion at the Conference. <lb/>
The delegates could not get along with their work at <lb/>
all, until a message was sent down to them that the <lb/>
Lieut. Governors should be Colonial appointments. <lb/>
After that every thing went on smoothly. Then it is <lb/>
said there will be no occasion for an army and navy. <lb/>
But president Lincoln has told the British Government <lb/>
that he intends putting six steamships on the Lakes <lb/>
to check the Canada raiders. If he does then Canada <lb/>
must do the same. Canada is a most indefensible <choice><sic>conn<lb break="no"/>try</sic><corr>country</corr></choice>, She has 1400 miles of frontier, and needs troops <lb/>
to protect her from the United States. She looks to <lb/>
the other Colonies to find a portion of these troops for <lb/>
her. Our delegates tell us that a million of dollars is <lb/>
only set down for purposes of Canadian, defence. The <lb/>
New Brunswick delegates tell their people that two and <lb/>
a half millions will be required. Who are to be belie<lb break="no"/>ved! It is said that we could not have a militia in this <lb/>
country, because our fishermen were generally absent<lb break="no"/>But we have a large resident population, who would be <lb/>
liable for militia duty. No one ever dreamt that a draft <lb/>
would have been made in the United States, yet it had <lb/>
        been done, and may be done with us.—Let us keep out <lb/>
of the Confederation, and we shall be clear of any such <lb/>
contingency. The 67th section says that all engage<lb break="no"/>ments that may, before the Union be entered into with <lb/>
the Imperial Government for the defence of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, shall be assumed by the General Government." So <lb/>
that if Canada assumes a debt of five, ten or twenty mil<lb break="no"/>lions for defensive purposes, Newfoundland will have to <lb/>
pay her share. I do say, that, before these resolutions <lb/>
can be affirmed, it is our bounded duty to go back to our <lb/>
constituents, and receive their consent to this measure. <lb/></p>
    
    <p><persName ref="pers:KENT2">Mr. KENT</persName>.—Did not intend now to enter upon the <lb/>
consideration of this subject. But he felt coerced to <lb/>
make a few observations on some of the remarks of which <lb/>
had fallen from the hon member for St. John's west, <lb/>
Mr. Renouf. That hon, gentleman had imputed to him <lb/>
(Mr. Kent) an improper and selfish motive for his expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion on this subject. He (Mr. Kent) thought <lb/>
that he would have been the last public man on whom <lb/>
such an importation would have been cast. If any man <lb/>
had made sacrifices in the sustainment of his political <lb/>
opinions he was the man. When he entered the Assem<lb break="no"/>bly he was a supporter of the liberal party, although all <lb/>
his interest was the other way, and when he was made <lb/>
Treasurer he recorded on the Journals of one Assembly his <lb/>
intention of not receiving a pension from the government; <lb/>
and when he was Colonial Secretary and premier of the <lb/>
late government he sacrificed his position on account of <lb/>
a disagreement which he had with the then Governor, the <lb/>
late Sir Alexander Bannerman. He (Mr. Kent) hoped <lb/>
that the hon member for St. John's West, Mr. Renouf, <lb/>
would as fearlessly and honesty asserts the rights of the <lb/>
people as ne (Mr. Kent) had doue. With reference to <lb/>
this proposed Confederation wers only called, upon at <lb/>
present to affirm the principle. But we had actually <lb/>
oeen told that we were transferring the government into <lb/>
the hands of the Canadians. That was not the case. It <lb/>
would not be in the hands of the Canadian, but in those <lb/>
of the government. And was it to be supposed that we <lb/>
were going to ally ourselves with an enemy. Was it not a <lb/>
league with a parental government which would watch over <lb/>
our chief interests. He also states that any great public <lb/>
mark that may be undertaken would be entirely for the <lb/>
benefit of Canada, and could not confer any advantage <lb/>
upon us. If extensive Railroads were commenced in <lb/>
Eagland were not the Irish navvies employed upon them; <lb/>
suppose a rail were made into Canada, Nova Scotia, and <lb/>
New Brunswick, what fear had we, s long as we were <lb/>
at unity with Great Britain. The balance of power on <lb/>
the continent of America, would be preserved by this <lb/>
Confederation. What does the leader of the Government <lb/>
say in this matter. He says there is to wish to press the <lb/>
question. He merely puts forward the resolutions, and <lb/>
then says after the question have been discussed we will go <lb/>
to the Country on one matter. The hon member, Mr. <lb/>
Parsons, had certainly used an extraordinary argument, <lb/>
and that was that we might rely for protection on the <lb/>
French. Were we to seek the protection of, and were <lb/>
we likely to receive it from a country against our whole <lb/>
encroachments on our shores and fisheries we were ever <lb/>
complaining, and to resist which we had to seek the aid <lb/>
of Britism men-of-war. He (Mr. Kent) had not intended <lb/>
to offer any observations on this question, and he would <lb/>
refrain from doing so now until the 15th, when the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was to be freely and amply discussed. He could not <lb/>
however, permit to pass unnoticed the improper and un<lb break="no"/>called for importatons or a political tyro whose seat in that <lb/>
Assembly was yet hardly warm. He (Mr. Kent) was <lb/>
influenced in this matter by a profound sense of duty, <lb/>
and by nothing else. <lb/></p>
    
    <p><persName ref="pers:SHEA2">Mr. A. SHEA</persName>.—It appears that we were having the <lb/>
field day in anticipation. Now nothing was more unfair <lb/>
and irregular than the way in which this debate had been <lb/>
conducted. The delegates had deemed it their duty <lb/>

before the matter came to be fully discussed, to place it. <lb/>
before the public in a proper light so that no one might, <lb/>
be taken at a disadvantage. Was it right that hon gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen should endeavor to prejudice the public mind in <lb/>
tne way in which they had tried to do. They come in <lb/>
here with garbled statements—statements entirely incor<lb break="no"/>rect and in that not a shadow of foundation, for assertion, <lb/>
and omit to mention the all fishery materials, such as <lb/>
lines, twines, nets, &amp;c., were admitted, duty free. They <lb/>
tell as that we should have called a public meeting. But <lb/>
there was no objection by them on their return, to go <lb/>
before the public. He (Mr. Shea) was responsible to no <lb/>
one but his constituency for his conduct; he was not ap<lb break="no"/>pointed by the public, and he did not see how any injury <lb/>
could have resulted by reason of their not calling a pub<lb break="no"/>lic meeting. We had no desire to force, the matter <lb/>
thus; we wanted the fullest investigation and we rightly <lb/>
deemed that the proper place for that investigation was <lb/>
this House, where face to face, and before the public the <lb/>
matter could be carafully and boldly enquired into. <lb/>
The public had nothing to do with what the delegates <lb/>
said at the Conference. They had to do with their <lb/>
Acts and nothing more. He insisted that some hon <lb/>
members had been there to witness the proceedings of <lb/>
that Conference; it would have done them good, they <lb/>
would have witnessed an exhibition of high tones, feel<lb break="no"/>ing and patriotism, for which they would have been <lb/>
uttered unprepared. What other cause could have been <lb/>
adopted than the one pursued. These Resolutions would <lb/>
have been only waste paper without the signatures of the <lb/>
Delegates to authenticate them. Then we were to receive <lb/>
no manufactures from Canada because Canada imported <lb/>
largely from England herself. The arguanent was a <lb/>
false and unfounded one, As well might you say that <lb/>
we cant import from England because England imports <lb/>
largely from France. He (Mr. Shea) knew of a manu<lb break="no"/>factory at Toronto which actually imported chairs to <lb/>
England. Canada was great and rich in all the elements <lb/>
of meterial prosperity. It was a bad thing, to see mo<lb break="no"/>ney so easily obtained here. It was an evidence of the <lb/>
unfortunate state of the country. We had great accumu<lb break="no"/>lations of idle money and a deal of pauperism. When <lb/>
he (Mr. Shea) was in Canada he had been ashamed to be <lb/>
compelled to state that we spent £20,000 in poor relief. <lb/>
We know pauperism to be incident to all places, but it <lb/>
was not paid out of the public money as it was done <lb/>
here. Had we not the extreme wealth at one end pau<lb break="no"/>perism at the other, and was a state things, which hon. <lb/>
genlemen would desire to perpetuate. The hon gentle<lb break="no"/>man continued at great length, replying to each argument <lb/>
put forward by the hon member Mr. Renouf. <lb/></p>
    
<p>On motion of <persName ref="pers:WYAT1">Mr. Wyatt</persName>, the Committee rose, and <lb/>
the Chairman reported progress. To sit again on Mon<lb break="no"/>day.</p>
    <p>The House then adjourned until Monday at three <lb/>
o'clock. <lb/></p>
    
    
    <!-- IC, 2018-11-13, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->
    
    <!--<p>
Monday, Feb. 6. <lb/>
The House met at three o'clock. <lb/>
Mr. WYATT presented a petition from George <lb/>
Bridle, Gaoler at Greenspond, which was received <lb/>
and read, praying for an increase of salary. <lb/>
Mr. Wyatt, in moving that the petition lie on the <lb/>
table, would express a hope that its prayer would be <lb/>
favourably considered by the house. The petition<lb break="no"/>er's salary was altogether inadequate. <lb/>
The Sûrveyor GENERAL supported the prayer of <lb/>
the petition. It was gay a few years ago that he <lb/>
(Sur. Gun.) succeeded in securing the petitioner any <lb/>
salary as gaoler, although he had long discharged the <lb/>
duties. It was the smallest salary of any gaoler in <lb/>
the Island. He trusted he would be put on the <lb/>
same footing as the other outport gaolors. <lb/>
Order that the petition lie on the table. <lb/>
Mr. PARsoss presented a petition from Jacob <lb/>
Bradbury, of Torbay, which was received and read, <lb/>
raying for compensation for dauage done to his <lb/>
ouse by lightning in August last. <lb break="no"/>Mr. PARSoss, in moving that the petition lie on <lb/>
the table, said the destruction of property by light<lb break="no"/>ing was of rare occurrence in this country. In this <lb/>
instance the property, which the petitioner had ac<lb break="no"/>cumulated by years of industry was suddenly destroy<lb break="no"/>ed by a visitation of providence. He (Mr. Parsons) <lb/>
trusted the house would make him some allowance, <lb/>
to enable him to retrieve his loss. <lb/>
Ordered that the petition lie on the table. <lb/>
Mr. PARsoss also presented petitions from James <lb/>
Brown and others, of Torbay, and from Jacob <lb/>
Bradbury and others, of the same place, which were <lb/>
severally received and read, praying for grants to <lb/>
open and complete roads in these localities. <lb/>
Ordered that these petitions lie on the table. <lb/>
On motion of Mr. WYATT, pursuant to order o <lb/>
the day, the house resolved itslf into Committee of <lb/>
the whole, on the further consideration of the address <lb/>
in reply to his Excellency's speech, Mr. KINGHT in <lb/>
the chair. <lb/>
Mr. E. D. SHEA said he had listened with a good <lb/>
deal of attention to the observations of the gentlemen <lb/>
who differed from him on the subject of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, as he was desirous of discovering what their <lb/>
objections were, and whether they had any weight, <lb/>
that he might modify the opinions he had already <lb/>
formed, if he found himself in any degree mistaken. <lb/>
But he had heard nothing to induce him to modify <lb/>
his views. In saying that, he did not attribute to <lb/>
these hon. members any lack of zeal and energy in <lb/>
the discussion of that question. They had laboured <lb/>
hard to find arguments in support of their views, <lb/>
only it appeared to him that they expended so much <lb/>
labour in the endeavour to make the worse appear <lb/>
the better reason. Iſe (Mr. Shea) believed the <lb/>
more that question was discussed, the more would <lb/>
public opinion be influenced in its favour. He had <lb/>
observed a good deal of inconsistency in the observa<lb break="no"/>tions of hon members in opposition to that measure. <lb/>
They asserted at one time that Canada desired to <lb/>
get held of us that she might victimise us for her <lb/>
own ends, and then that Canada thought of us at the <lb/>
eleventh hour. If the latter assertion was the correct <lb/>
one, it showed how really indifferent Canada was <lb/>
whether we joined in the confederation or not. Then <lb/>
it had been urged that the securities of Canada are <lb/>
depressed, while ours are at a premium, from which <lb/>
it was inferred Canada is not in a sound financial <lb/>
condition. But it did not follow, because money <lb/>
was in demand in a country, and the rate of interest <lb/>
high, that it was not in a prosperous condition. The <lb/>
very reverse was frequently the case. It by no <lb/>
means indicated a sound state of the money market, <lb/>
that the rate of interest was low. What was the <lb/>
W. state of the labour market in this colony? <lb/>
Why 400 able bodied men were at present employed <lb/>
by the Board of Works at 6s a week, paid in provi<lb break="no"/>sions. Why was that? Because there was no de<lb break="no"/>mand for labour; and the saine rule which applied <lb/>
to labour applied with equal force to the state of the <lb/>
mouey market. Then the hon. member for St. <lb/>
John's East, Mr. Parsons, told us not to be anxious <lb/>
about our defence from foreign aggression, for <lb/>
England and France had such a deep interest in the <lb/>
protection of this, country, that they would see to <lb/>
our defence. He (Mr. Shea) did not see hoy we <lb/>
could have much confidence in the protection of <lb/>
France. It seemed to him to be somewhat like the lamb <lb/>
relying on the wolf for protection. We paid a large <lb/>
sum annually for the protection ofcur fisheries against <lb/>
French encroachments, and why should we do this, <lb/>
if the French felt such a deep interest in us? And <lb/>
a few years ago we were in great excitement on ac<lb break="no"/>count of a convention between England and France <lb/>
on the subject of our Fisheries, by which our inter­ <lb/></p> 

<p>\ <lb/></p> 

<p>ests were sacrificed to France; and now the hon. <lb/>
member told us to rely upon the protection of <lb/>
France. Again,it was said that while the supporters <lb/>
of confederation spoke of the openings in Canada <lb/>
for their children,they had no regard to the interestsof <lb/>
the fishermen's children. If we regarded the present <lb/>
state of our operative population, they would ap<lb break="no"/>pear to have the deepest interest in that ques: <lb/>
tion. What had our legislation been for several <lb/>
years past, but unsuccessful efforts to raise the la<lb break="no"/>bouring classes from their depressed condition? <lb/>
And what had we accomplished but to join with the <lb/>
Receiver General in Jeremiads over the distressed <lb/>
state of the country, without being able to strike out <lb/>
anything to relieve the general distress? We have <lb/>
now come to such a state of depression that we can <lb/>
proceed no further, and it was our solemn duty to <lb/>
consider whether this proposed confederation offer<lb break="no"/>ed any means of relieving the people. No mat: <lb/>
ter that the f-elings of those whose interests were <lb/>
involved in this discussion were excited against the <lb/>
measure, still it was our duty to enter earnestly into <lb/>
its consideration. It looked to him as a providential <lb/>
interposition that these calamities had come upon us, <lb/>
as if to force us to look beyond precarious fisheries <lb/>
with the view of finding some means of relieving the <lb/>
general distress; and that federation seemed to meet <lb/></p> 

<p>the case. Whāt was the state of the country at <lb/>
present? Why a third of our population are not <lb/>
Ilalf fed. What did we see in our streets? Those <lb/></p> 

<p>who once were in comfortable circumstances reduc<lb break="no"/>ed to the deepest, penury, suffering from that want <lb/>
which blanches the cheek, palsies the limbs, and <lb/>
makes the young suddenly old. And we <lb/>
were told to rely upon our fisheries to 1emedy <lb/>
this. We had relied upon them from year to year, and <lb/>
our circumstances were becoming worse. Some years <lb/>
we had good fisheries, but the good was not so much <lb/>
to the fishermen as to the capitalists who realized <lb/>
fortunes out of the fisheries and then left the coun<lb break="no"/>try. He (Mr. Shea) did not blame them for leav<lb break="no"/>ing a country in which there was such frequent and <lb/>
deep destitution. He merely referred to the fact and <lb/>
system, if system it might be called. Our fisheries <lb/>
at their best were only sufficient to keep the heads <lb/>
of the labouring people over water for the season in <lb/>
which they were productive, experience had shown <lb/>
they left to the sons of toil ao permanent fruit. <lb/>
Agair, they had not kept pace with the progress of po<lb break="no"/>pulation,and that was the difficulty we had to meet. <lb/>
We want other employment for our people besides the <lb/>
fisa lies. Would confederatiºn give such employment? <lb/>
lie (Air. Shea) believed it would. One of its first <lb/>
results would be a line of weekly steamers between <lb/>
this port and one in Canada. These steamers must <lb/>
cause an increase of trade, which would give in<lb break="no"/>creased employment; and anything that gave in<lb break="no"/>creased employment must benefit the people gener<lb break="no"/>ally. It would also put an end to our isolation, <lb/>
and with increased interconrse would come the <lb/>
opening up of new resources and an increase of our <lb/>
trade. It was said that we wished to drive the peo<lb break="no"/>ple from the country. No such thing. We wish to <lb/>
make the country worth their living in; to provide <lb/>
employment for the labouring classes, and <lb/>
so to promote their comfort as to make <lb/>
the country worth calling their home. What <lb/>
do we find now? That. many of our best fish<lb break="no"/>ermen and mechanics are fleeing the country. The <lb/>
only part of the country from which we did not at <lb/>
present hear the wall of distress, was that where a <lb/>
in arket was created by reciprocity with the United <lb/>
States; and in the prospect of the free trade treaty <lb/>
being abrogated, it behoved us to endea<lb break="no"/>vour to secure a new vent for our exports <lb/>
in lieu of that trade. The only means by which <lb/>
we could see our pauperism put an end to <lb/>
was by providing increased employment for our peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and extended markets for our produce. Could <lb/>
we retain our people permanently if they could bet<lb break="no"/>ter their circumstances by leaving the country? Large <lb/>
numbers were leaving, and many of those who re<lb break="no"/>named did so because they had not the means of go<lb break="no"/>ing away. If the Government were to charter two <lb/>
or three vessels to carry emigrants to Canada or <lb/>
Nova Scotia, they would have applications from <lb/>
more than they could accommodate. Again, with <lb/>
regard to the cducated classes. There was no field <lb/>
for many of then here; and under confederation <lb/>
they would find a fine field in such a growing commu<lb break="no"/>nity as that of Canada... But it was said why not go <lb/>
there now? They would be regarded only as aliens. <lb/>
But with confederation of the Provinces we would <lb/>
become one people, and with our representatives in <lb/>
both houses of the Federal Legislature, they would <lb/>
have influential friends whose aid they would be en<lb break="no"/>titled to rely upon to forward their views. A fur<lb break="no"/>ther effect of confederation would be to allay those <lb/>
ascerbities of religious and political differences, which <lb/>
were the bane, of small communities. Our public <lb/>
men would have larger questions to grapple with, <lb/>
and in the choice of representatives to the federal <lb/>
parliament, talent and integrity would be regarded <lb/>
more than creed or faction. But it was said by hon. <lb/>
gentlemen beside him that confederation might suit <lb/>
tue other colonies, but that it was unsuitable for us. <lb/>
They say that Archbishop Connolly's letter had no <lb/>
reference to our circurystances, and was unsuitable <lb/>
for Newfoundland, although it might be very well. <lb/>
for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. If these gen: <lb/>
tlemen were at liberty to quote Nova Scotia newspa<lb break="no"/>pers of little or no influence, got up metely to set <lb/>
forth the views of interested parlies opposed to.con<lb break="no"/>federation, why might not we quote the opinions of <lb/>
so distinguished and taleuted a Prelate as Arch<lb break="no"/>bishop Counolly? And if confederation would bene<lb break="no"/>fit Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, why would it <lb/>
not also benefit us? But he (Mr. Shea) maintained <lb/>
it would benefit us still more. These countries were <lb/>
prosperous now, while we were the reverse. We <lb/>
Lad the same need of protection that they had, and <lb/>
we had the sad necessities of our people besides. And <lb/>
if the opinious of Archbishop Connolly were not to be <lb/>
quoted here, what would hon, gentlemen say to the <lb/>
opinions of Dr. Mullock?, They could not say <lb/>
tuat they were not applicable to our circumstances, <lb/>
and ue was most favourable to confederation.— <lb/>
Mr. CASEx—You have no right to introduce the <lb/>
name of the Rt. Rev. Dr. Muiluck here. <lb/>
Mr. SHEA.—His opinion is already published, <lb/>
and he has no objection to his name being <lb/></p> 

<p>the continuance of the troops, for there was no de<lb break="no"/>sire on the part of the Imperial Government to with: <lb/>
draw them, if we only evinced a wish to adopt such <lb/>
measures as would aid in the defence of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. Did we not know that the people of England, <lb/>
of all parties, looked favourably on confederation, as <lb/>
that which would raise us into national importance? <lb/>
It was a foregone conclusion with the Imperial Goy<lb break="no"/>ernment, as was evident from Mr. Cardwell's dis<lb break="no"/>patch. What was the reception of Mr. Brown the <lb/>
other day, when he went home from Canada? He <lb/>
was visited and feted by the highest in the land, <lb/>
by many to whom he was previously unknown, and <lb/>
who would have been unacquainted with him for a <lb/>
long time to come, had he not represented the idea <lb/>
of Confederation. Now he (Mr. Shea) would ask, <lb/>
what condition we should be in if we remain <lb/>
in our isolation, and a French convention were again <lb/>
to be entered into? Would we be in a condition to <lb/>
claim the assistance of the confederated provinces? <lb/>
Or could we unaided successfully oppose the in<lb break="no"/>fluence of France with the Imperial Government? <lb/>
These were serious considerations. They were con<lb break="no"/>siderations which we could not afford lightly to dis<lb break="no"/>miss. His (Mr. Shea's) belief was that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation would sooner or later be forced <lb/>
upon us. We might stave it off for a time. But the <lb/>
tendency of the age was for the union of small states <lb/>
into larger ones. It was said we proposed to give <lb/>
up our self government. We gave up nothing worth <lb/>
retaining. Self-government was the best system we <lb/>
could have, but it would not make up for short fish<lb break="no"/>eries and a starving population. We would still <lb/>
have self-government on a larger scale, for we were <lb/>
to have a voice in the General Government and <lb/>
Legislature of the union in proportion to our <lb/>
population, while, our local government for <lb/>
merely local affairs was to be as much our <lb/>
own as now. We were told that we gave up <lb/>
our fisheries to be legislated for by Canada. . But <lb/>
the fisheries were still to be under local control, by <lb/>
a special stipulation, while their protection would be <lb/>
effectually carried out under the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It was said we gave up our Crown lands and <lb/>
mines. We merely gave up the right of legislating <lb/>
for them, in return for a valuable consideration. We <lb/>
received £37,500 a year for them. Much had been <lb/>
said about out mineral wealth; but of what value <lb/>
were our mines, while they were not worked? And <lb/>
was it not well known that we had neither capital nor <lb/>
enterprise to work them? And when we were of. <lb/>
fered such a valuable consideration for them by par<lb break="no"/>ties who had both capital and enterprise, would it not <lb/>
be folly to decline such an advantageous offer?— <lb/>
Could it be doubted that the Federal Government, <lb/>
which proposed to pay such a price for our Crown <lb/>
lands and mines, would be induced to improve them, <lb/>
in order to have a return for their outlay? <lb/>
Mr. Renouf.-We would not receive as much from <lb/>
the Federal government as we would be called upon <lb/>
to pay. Our Customs duties would amount to £140,<lb break="no"/>000 a year, while we would ouly receive altogether <lb/>
£112,000. <lb/>
Mr. E. D. Shea.—The hon member assumed that <lb/>
the present Canadian tariff would be retained by the <lb/>
Federal Governument. Now we had the assurance <lb/>
of Lord Monck, as well as of Mr. Galt that the Can<lb break="no"/>adian tariff would not be that of the Confederation, <lb/>
but a reduced tariff. , Our present revenue, for years <lb/>
past, had been only from £90,000 ta £100,000, and <lb/>
we were to receive £112,000. But supposing we <lb/>
should have the Canadian tariff, it did not follow <lb/>
that the revenue should increase in accordance with <lb/>
the increased duties levied. Assuming that we are <lb/>
º: 13 per cent now, and that the duties should <lb/>
e raised to 15 per cent, what was that compared <lb/>
with what our people are suffering now? We were <lb/>
suffering taxation in its worst shape, the taxation of <lb/>
pauperism. As to an increase from 13 to 15 per <lb/>
cent... what was that, if the country were rendered suf<lb break="no"/>ficiently prosperous to bear it? Let us have another <lb/></p> 

<p>year or two of such fisheries as we have had for || <lb/></p> 

<p>several years past, and no other resource opened up <lb/>
for the employment of our people, or for the enter<lb break="no"/>prise of our merchants, and what taxation should we <lb/>
be able to pay? Taxation was a relative con<lb break="no"/>sideration—it will be heavy or otherwise, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the ability of our people to endure it. <lb/>
We were now taxed over 13 percent upon the whole of <lb/>
our duty-paying imports, and what did we get outof it? <lb/>
Only the defraying of our civil expenditure and the <lb/>
support of our poor; and the poor were not half fed, <lb/>
and it could not be otherwise, while we had such ina<lb break="no"/>dequate means of relief. And we had also to consider <lb/>
the deterioration, moral and physical, that must <lb/>
result from this perpetuated pauperism—trans<lb break="no"/>mitting not alone its inherent debasement and <lb/>
demoralization, but the worst bodily diseases that <lb/>
could afflict a people. We had not had a road grant <lb/>
worth naming for years past; but he must remind <lb/>
the house that under confederation we would have <lb/>
an annual road grant of from £12,000 to £15,000, <lb/>
which would be under the control of the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and Legislature, and would not be liable as <lb/>
now to be given, withheld or reduced according as we <lb/>
had successful fisheries or the reverse. This itself <lb/>
would be a permanent source of employment for a <lb/>
number of our people, which would not be subject to <lb/>
curtailment at the time they would most require it. <lb/>
He (Mr. Shea) did not know that there would be <lb/>
any increase of taxation. He saw nothing to induce <lb/>
him to believe that there would be any necessity to <lb/>
have any material increase. Hon gentlemen antici<lb break="no"/>pated that we would be under the necessity of having <lb/>
recourse to direct taxation on property in the island. <lb/>
But were not proprietors worse taxed now,in the de<lb break="no"/>privation of those rents which the depressed circum<lb break="no"/>stances of many of our people rendered them unable <lb/>
to pay? If we should have the Canadian tariff, under <lb/>
confederation, the area of taxation would be nar<lb break="no"/>rowed, because we would have a considerable impor<lb break="no"/>tation of the manufactures of Canada, of wedlens, lea<lb break="no"/>ther and other articles which would come in duty <lb/>
free. Hon members might sneer at that, but we know <lb/>
that in Nova Scotia and New Bruuswick, where they <lb/>
knew the manufacturing capabilities of Canada better <lb/>
than we do, it was made an argument against Con. <lb/>
federation that they would be flooded with Canadian <lb/>
manufactures, to the injury of their own. To listen <lb/>
to the objections to confederation urged by some hon <lb/>
members, one would suppose that Newfoundland was <lb/></p> 

<p>mentioned as eminently favourable to confeder-! urged to come into the confederation because we <lb/>
ation; but hon: gentlemen might not be desiruns to were so important that they could not get on without <lb/></p> 

<p>hear it. Besides, did not all history prove the <lb/>
beneficial results of union in promoting social order <lb/>
and general prosperity? Did not the prosperity of <lb/>
England, date from its union into one monarchy? <lb/>
And had not Scotland prospered since her union <lb/>
with England. Was not the prosperity of France, <lb/>
Switzerland, Germany and the Uuted States alsº <lb/>
largely promoted by their respective unions? What <lb/>
would be the result to us of the union now under <lb/>
consideration? Why, we should be brought into <lb/>
close intercourse with four millions of people who <lb/>
had made much greater progress than we had done, <lb/>
and who were in a highly prosperous cordition.— <lb/>
And would it be asserted that we should not benefit <lb/>
largely by such intercourse? Reference had been <lb/>
made to the probable withdrawal of the troops by <lb/>
England, it we should enter into this confederation <lb/></p> 

<p>What authority had ſhon, gentlemen for that? He <lb/>
(Mr. Shea) maintained that it was all the other way. <lb/>
By entering into the confederation we would ensure <lb/></p> 

<p>| <lb/></p> 

<p>| <lb/></p> 

<p>i <lb/></p> 

<p>| <lb/>
| <lb/></p> 

<p>us. He (Mr Shea).did not depreciate our resources. <lb/>
Our fisheries were the most important, the position of <lb/>
the Island also, as the key to the Gulf and to the <lb/>
river St. Lawrence was of great value as a strategic <lb/>
position in the event of war. But toe world. could, <lb/>
lowever, get on without us —and so could the con<lb break="no"/>federation. He haſ lately read some observations <lb/>
in a Canada newspaper, in which it was stated that <lb/>
Newfoundland had made an excellent bargain, but if <lb/>
we were dissatisfied with it, we might remain out of <lb/>
the Confederation. Bon gentlemen said they were <lb/>
dissatisfied with confederation; but if they rejected <lb/>
that, wist would they suggest to better the condition <lb/>
of our people? <lb/>
Mr. Casey-Better legislation than we had of late <lb/>
years. <lb/>
Mr. E. D. SHEA-Would any legislation of ours <lb/>
give food to the people or find then employment P <lb/>
He did not desire ta' press the final decision of the <lb/>
4**tion this sesson. Let the constituents, by all <lb/></p> 

<p>means, be sonsulted; but before we call on them for <lb/>
their opinions, lat hon members express their Own: <lb/>
and let the country give the final verdict upon thº. <lb/>
He thought that was the right course, and that an; <lb/>
tning short of it would be a shirking of the question <lb/>
We were here to deliberate, and not as mºre deſ. <lb/>
gates. As to what was the duty of members to their <lb/>
constituents, he would quote the opinion of Burks <lb/>
whose opinions on constitutional questions were ad. <lb/>
mitted by, all parties to be entitled to the greates: <lb/>
weight, Here the bon member quoted from a speech <lb/>
by Burke to his constituents at Bristol, as follows:<lb break="no"/>"It ought to be the happiness and glory of a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative, to live in the strictest union, the closest <lb/>
correspondence, and the most unreserved communica. <lb/>
tion with his constituents. Their wishes ought to <lb/>
have great weight with him, their opinions high re. <lb/>
spect, their business unremitting attention. It is his <lb/>
duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasuras, his satis. <lb/>
factions, to theirs; and above all, to prefer their inter<lb break="no"/>ests to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature <lb/>
judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to <lb/>
sacrifice to any man, or to any set of men living. <lb/>
These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nº <lb/>
from the law and the constitution. They are a trust <lb/>
from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply <lb/>
answerable. Your representative owes you, net his <lb/>
industry only, but his judgment, and he betrays, in<lb break="no"/>stead of serving you.if he sacrifices it to your opinion." <lb/>
lt was our duty as representatives to give our Constitu<lb break="no"/>ents the benefit of our judgment; and they wonid af<lb break="no"/>terwards exercise their judgment upon their represen<lb break="no"/>tatives, and rejeot us, if they were not satisfied with <lb/>
our conduct. The question was prejudged by some <lb/>
hon. members, and it was oar duty to express our de<lb break="no"/>liberate opinion upon it, after that cool and caim con<lb break="no"/>sideration which its importance to the country, to its <lb/>
people, and to those who would come after us impera<lb break="no"/>tively demanded. Let no hon. member shrink from <lb/>
the responsibility of his position. Let all speak out <lb/>
in the face of the country. and let the constituencies. <lb/>
afterwards say whether they will accept or reject the <lb/>
terms of the proposed Confederation. <lb/>

<p>LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, <lb/></p> 

<p>Monday, February 13. <lb/>
The House met at 4 o'clock. <lb/>
Hon N. STABB laid on the table of the house the: <lb/>
following documents— <lb/>
Estimate for defraying part of the public expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of the colony for 1865. <lb/>
Statement showing the aggregate amount of the <lb/></p> 

<p>public debt of the colony on the 31st December, 1834, <lb/></p> 

<p>and the years in which the several portions of it are <lb/>
repayable. <lb/>
Financial statement of the affairs of the colony for <lb/>
the year 1865. <lb/>
Consoliuated account current of the receipts and <lb/>
payments for the year ended 31st December, 1864. .. <lb/>
Detailed statement of salaries of Stipendiary Mugis<lb break="no"/>trates, Clerks of the Peace, Constables and Jailors in. <lb/>
the outports. <lb/>
Hon. P. G. TESSIER presented a petition from the <lb/>
Cºmmercial Society of St. John's, an important and <lb/>
influential body, he said, representing the greater <lb/>
portion of the trad ng interests of the colony, and en<lb break="no"/>titled to the fullest cºnsideration at the hands of the: <lb/>
legislature. The object of this petition was to pray <lb/>
this honorable house that when the subject of the <lb/>
Confederation of the Colonies comes before it for de<lb break="no"/>liberation, it will not take definite action upon the: <lb/>
matter until such information shall have been obtain<lb break="no"/>ed as will clearly demonstrate that it would be to the <lb/>
advantage of Newfoundland to euter into the proposed. <lb/>
Colonial Union. He should merely present the Peti<lb break="no"/>tion, that it be ſaid upon the table of the house. <lb/>
ORDER OF THE DAY. <lb/>
Hon. R. J. PINsent notice to move, <lb/>
First—That for Newfoundland to enter into a Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the British North American Colonies <lb/>
upon the terms proposed in the Report of the Q lebec. <lb/>
Conference, would be detrimentil to the best interests <lb/>
of the colony, and ought to be resisted. <lb/>
Second,-That a humble Address be presented to her <lb/>
Majesty, embodying the views of the Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil upon this subject, with their reasons for the adop<lb break="no"/>tion of those views. <lb/>
Third-That a select committee of this house bs. <lb/>
appointed to prepare the said Address, <lb/>
Hon. R. J. PINSENT said, that as the hon gentleman <lb/>
§. Tessier) has just presented a petition from the <lb/>
Sommercial Society, a most important and influential <lb/>
body, upon the same subject and of a similar character <lb/>
to that emoraced in his (Mr. P's) notice of motion,and <lb/>
as a rule of the house prevents the reading of that <lb/>
petition, or any action being taken on it to-day, he <lb/>
(Mr. P.) would not proceed with his motion, but pass, <lb/>
it over for the present. He did not desire that a <lb/>
question of so much momen:ous concern should be: <lb/>
entered into until it had received the fullest consider<lb break="no"/>ation before hand; and when we shall have heard this <lb/>
petition read, and more deliberately examined the <lb/>
documents relating to the matter, we may be in a <lb/>
better position to discuss it. There can be no doubt. <lb/>
that the feeling of a large majority of the people was <lb/>
opposed to the terms of the proposed confederation, as <lb/>
regards this colony, and he must express his own opin<lb break="no"/>ion that they were highly objectionable in many material <lb/>
respects. The motive, then, which prompted him <lb/>
(Mr. P.) to move in the muter was that this view <lb/>
might be expressed by the Council, and the reasons <lb/>
for it made known by address to the Jimperial Gov<lb break="no"/>frnment. The decision of this house upon such reso<lb break="no"/>lutions as he(Mr. P.) had given notice of would not. <lb/>
affect the main question of confederation or non-con<lb break="no"/>federation, but would go to point out the salient fea<lb break="no"/>tures of objection to it, in the form in which it has <lb/>
been offered to us. He presumed it would not be <lb/>
denied that this house has an independent right to de<lb break="no"/>clare its opinions upon public questions, irrespective <lb/>
of outside influences of any kind, and it was not <lb/>
bound to await the result of action in any quarter. <lb/>
We have no constituencies to consult, no country to: <lb/>
appeal to, to regulate the course of action we should <lb/>
pursue, and are consequently in a position to give an <lb/>
untrammelled opinion on questions of a public char<lb break="no"/>acter. Hon. members of this bouse possess con<lb break="no"/>siderable stake in the country, and are deeply inter<lb break="no"/>ested in its present and future welfare; and being <lb/>
unswayed by personal or party motives in their legis<lb break="no"/>lative action, it was only just to expect from them a <lb/>
dispassionate consideration of such important sub<lb break="no"/>jects as this. However, as the petitiou just presented <lb/>
confirms what appears to be the general view, that <lb/>
anything like decisive action upºn it should be delay: <lb/>
ed, he would not press his motion, but await until the: <lb/>
matter has received more ample consideration. <lb/>
Hon E. MoRBIs—Do you mean to let it staad upon <lb/>
the minutes? <lb/>
Hon. R. PINSENT—Yes, for the present. <lb break="no"/>Hon. E. Morals—It does seem a most extraordin <lb/>
ary proceeding. And notwithstanding the hon and-\-<lb break="yes"/>learned gentlemau's statement, the resolutions on that <lb/>
notice aſ motion do not in the smalles, degree corres<lb break="no"/>pond witn the petition just presented to a the Cordº <lb/>
