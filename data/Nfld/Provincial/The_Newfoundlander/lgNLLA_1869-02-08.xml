<p>w that destitution prevailed in the locality " <lb/>
ed to by the hon, member....A large amount <lb/>
ief was last year conveyed thither and no re- #: <lb/>
adever been made. There was a supplying <lb/>
ant resident there and surely he, when he <lb/>
res the benefit of these poor men's services, <lb/>
i in some substantial manner display his sympa<lb break="no"/>ith their distress. There is really no part of <lb/>
land so capable of sustaining a population as <lb/>
strict of Placentia and St. Mary's. There <lb/>
the most fertile land in the country...There <lb/>
dustrious man can fi:id fish almost at his door. <lb/>
at that fertile land has been lying untilled and <lb/>
t calling aloud for cultivation. It stands in <lb/>
•ontrast to the sterile land of the Northern <lb/>
sts, where the people are now sustaining them. <lb/>
. But the people of Placentia would risk <lb/>
lives upon the chance of what little sustain<lb break="no"/>they could get from the Government rather <lb/>
exert themselves to their own permanent, <lb/>
endence. Only last session there were turee <lb/>
and barrels of flour distributed among the <lb/>
le of that district through the wreck of the <lb/>
ner, and hardly a man of the locality but got a <lb/>
1. There could aot have been a single man <lb/>
ust have been in a position to commence the " <lb/>
y infinitely superior to the men of other districts. <lb/>
same pressure was last year attempted to be <lb/>
:ht to bear upon the Government, although in <lb/>
on to the flour so obtained, some £3000 worth <lb/>
super Relief was distributed in the district. <lb/>
non. A.G.) had as much sympathy for the suf<lb break="no"/>; poor as any man. He would go to any legi<lb break="no"/>é exteat to assist ther. He hoped that the <lb/>
| money of the people might be preserved for <lb/>
for a purpose which he had in view. . He <lb/>
ished to provide against the necessity which <lb/>
elled the poor to sell their greenfish at an <lb/>
nous sacrifice, leaving then nothing for the. <lb/>
imme it of their families, and it was with a view <lb/>
le prevention of this state of things that he <lb/>
1 to get the sustainment of hon. Ine abers in <lb/>
burse which he had marked out. From Twil<lb break="no"/>te every possible pressure was brought to bear <lb/>
the Executive. Petition after petition was <lb/>
in, and a grave responsibility devolved up a <lb/>
Ministry. In a very short time all communica<lb break="no"/>with this district would be cut off by ice. <lb/>
ºrtheless the Government felt it to be their <lb/>
to resist these appeals, and the consequence <lb/>
that not only in this district, but in Bouavista <lb/>
even in Trinity Bay, where it was found that <lb/>
Government were resolute in their intentions, <lb/>
wns were found to come forwerd to the relief <lb/>
le destitute. In his own district two Vigilauce <lb/>
mittees had been appointed, and the people bad <lb/>
a upon themselves the task of assisting be dis<lb break="no"/>ed. Hon members would find that if there <lb/>
a proper resistance to all appeals, for a suffi'. <lb/>
length of time, the people of the country: <lb/>
d be for the first time in a long series of years <lb/>
position of comparative independence. He <lb/>
. A.G.) was wel, aware that individuals, for <lb/>
ested motives, attempted to get up an outcry as <lb/>
e prevailing destitution, in order to force the <lb/>
rument into the issue of relief, that these agi<lb break="no"/>s might profit by the large sales on laeal and <lb/>
sses which would necessasily follow. The peo<lb break="no"/>hemselves were well disposed and well con<lb break="no"/>'d, and it any emente should take place, it <lb/>
d be found, upon euquiry, that these interested <lb/>
es were at the bottom of it. It would be very <lb/>
able that the really destitute should be relieved; <lb/>
here can be no check against imposture, and the <lb/>
lent you begin the infernal system it becomes <lb/>
ral, and you cannot distinguish between the <lb/>
stor and this deserving poor. But there wa-, <lb/>
les these difficulties, another apd a paramount <lb/>
acle. The Colony has not the funds at its dis<lb break="no"/>l sufficient to meet this demand. There had <lb/>
* , the gre test care manifested to keep the ex<lb break="no"/>ſiture within the Legislative grants; but still <lb/>
drain upon the Revenue had been so euorinous <lb/>
put it beyond the power of the Government, <lb/>
1 if they had the desire, to renew the issue of <lb/>
f. He (lion. A.G.) gave the hon, member, Mr. <lb/>
telly, credit for sincerity; but he could not <lb/>
thinking that sufficient care had not been taken <lb/>
upress upon the people the nature of this <lb/>
ºlamation. If that bad been effectually done, <lb/>
ld not believe that this pressure would have <lb/>
brought to bear upon the hon inember. <lb/>
Mr. O'REully explained that ths.ugh it was: <lb/>
that the people of the district obtained <lb/>
e 3000 barrels of flour from the wreck to <lb/>
ch the hon. Attorney General alluded, yet <lb/>
flour was scattered over some 5,000 peow <lb/>
A very small portion could be the share <lb/>
ny individual. It was wrong too to suppose <lb/>
Placentla had received the wuole of it. A <lb/>
e number of the people were at the time <lb/>
:ut at St. Peter's, and thus received no: <lb/>
efit whatsoever from this distribution. <lb/></p> 

<p>Ir, RoRKE.—Although he had listened with <lb/>
t attention to the speeches of hon. gem<lb break="no"/>men opposite, he had been unable to com? <lb/>
tly other couclusion than that taey were <lb/>
here rehash of the same speechs which, <lb/>
three or four sessions, we had been in <lb/>
habit of hearing. The paragraph before <lb/>
chair says that the proclamation has been <lb/>
timed. It might be well timed, but he <lb/>
igh: it would h ve oeen better timed had <lb/>
een adopted 25 years ago. Had that <lb/>
1 so, he believed that the distress now so <lb/>
ersal would not have besa the hundredth <lb/>
: of what is. He remembered the intro". <lb/>
ion of this system. He was persoually <lb/>
re of the imposture which was then at<lb break="no"/>ºpted, imposture which had continued ever <lb/>
e, and he was firmly conviuc.d that were <lb/>
ot for that proclamation tue thing would <lb/>
er have come to an end. It might be <lb/>
ed how the poor were to be r lieved.-\-<lb break="maybe"/>far as he could, he had assisted the desti <lb/>

ve, without extending to then a helpiné <lb/>

Cotton Famine in Englaud had taught<lb break="no"/>althy people came forward and organised a <lb/>

    <p>"We are pleased to learn that Your Excellency's <lb/>
personal exertions in endeavoring to settle the <lb/>
vexed question of the Franch Shore, have been so <lb/>
far successful that there is now a prospect of its <lb/>
being arranged in a manner advantageous to both <lb/>
parties interested in it; and that the Policy indicat<lb break="no"/>ed in Lord Carnarvon's despatch, of the 7th Deesin<lb break="no"/>ber, 1865, has been so far modified that Your Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency will now be enabled to issue Grants under <lb/>

    <p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Hon. RECIEVER GENERAL</persName>.—This is a great crisis <lb/>
in one world's history, and not confined so any par<lb break="no"/>ticular country. Sweep your eye over the orb which <lb/>
we inhabit, you there observe a succession of events <lb/>
that must alarm and surprise the dwellers thereon. <lb/>
The very crust that envelope the habitable gobe, <lb/>
seems to be worn out by the combustion of the <lb/>
central fires. Earthquakes tear asunder the solid <lb/>
trust and suddenly engulph not only the works of <lb/>
man but man himself. Volcanoes, the chimneys of <lb/>
these cultral fires, are loud with frenaial fury. <lb/>
Storms sweep the ocean and engulph the floating <lb/>
argocies that career upon its bosom, swallowing up <lb/>
the treasures and the men which they contain. Let <lb/>
us circumscribe our view and regard our own Island, <lb/>
what do we see? The stalwart inhabitants of the <lb/>
country fleeing from its shores, and those remaining <lb/>
are stricken with poverty and deprived of their very <lb/>
self-reliance. Widows weeping for their husbands <lb/>
who have been torn from their arms; mothers for <lb/>
their sons who have been untimely reft from them; <lb/>
children looking in vain for the parents who will <lb/>
never again return to caress them. He (hon.R.G.) <lb/>
did not speak of these things for the purpose of <lb/>
fostering despair. He still saw in this Island all <lb/>
the elements of wealth which it had ever possessed. <lb/>
Her fisheries were liable to be as productive as ever. <lb/>
New elements of wealth present themselves which <lb/>
capitalists are anxious to explore. In a crisis such <lb/>
as this we surely ought not to exhaust our strength <lb/>
and temper in improlibable and acrimonious debates. <lb/>
That was why he spoke of these things. He calm<lb break="no"/>ly stated these circumstances which were patent to <lb/>
every one acquainted with the history of the world. <lb/>
To those who feel with the greatest intensity the <lb/>
sufferings of the people, it must be apparent that we, <lb/>
as Representatives of the people, to whom is en<lb break="no"/>trusted the serious care of searching out the causes <lb/>
of the mifortunes of the people, should come dis<lb break="no"/>passionately to the considerations which would <lb/>
enable us to embody in Legislation the curative <lb/>
processes which will in some degree remove those <lb/>
overwhelming afflictions. Afer this exordium, <lb/>
which he hoped hon. gentlemen would not consider <lb/>
exaggerated, he would enter on a short review of <lb/>
the substantial matters contained in His Excellency's <lb/>
speech. The first important matter presenting <lb/>
itself is the circumstance that the Executive have <lb/>
<choice><sic>aken</sic><corr>taken</corr></choice> upon themselves the responsibility of inducing <lb/>
His Excellsncy to issue a Proclamation restricting <lb/>
the issue of Poor Relief to the disabled and the <lb/>
infirm. He (hon. R.G.) had always dreaded the <lb/>
conseuuences of indiscriminate Relief to the able<lb break="no"/>bodied poor. He had foreseen that it would deprive <lb/>
the Population of self-reliance, chill the industry of <lb/>
the people, and drag down to one common level <lb/>
the industrious men of the Island. His views on <lb/>
this object had been repeatedly before the public, <lb/>
and their publication had subjected him to ridicule, <lb/>
and ultimately to the loss of official position; but <lb/>
he had the satisfaction of seeing that at the present <lb/>
time every one recognised the necessity of acting <lb/>
upon those principles which he had from time to <lb/>
time laid down. In 1868 this system of indiscrimi<lb break="no"/>nate relief reached its culminating point, and when <lb/>
nearly a quarter of a million of dollars had been <lb/>
expended, it was high time for Government to stay <lb/>
its hand. It required great honesty on the part of <lb/>
supporters of the Government to sustain the Exe<lb break="no"/>cutive policy, and it was highly creditable to them <lb/>
        <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> they had done so, and hon members opposite, with <lb/>
one or two exceptions, had very fairly responded <lb/>
to the necessity of the act. The next question to <lb/>
which attention is called is the subject of territorial <lb/>
rights on the French Shore. Last year he (hon. <lb/>
R. G.) had crossed the Atlantic, and had had two <lb/>
interviews with the Duke of Buckingham, who had <lb/>
    made promises which he had faithfully fulfilled. At <lb/></p> 

<p>his own expense he had remained for a considerable <lb/>
time in London, and while there, unauthorized by <lb/>
the Executive. he had presented to his Grace the <lb/>
following memorial. <lb/></p>
    
    
    
    <p rendition="simple:centre">"TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM <lb/>
AND CHANDOS.</p>
    
    <p>
        "<hi rendition="simple:italic">May it please your Grace</hi>.—The memorial of <lb/>
John Kent, member of the Executive Council <lb/>
of Newfoundland, and member of the House of <lb/>
Assembly for St. John's. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
"Humbly showeth, <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
That memorialist was appointed in 1859 <lb/>
joint British Comissioner in connection with <lb/>
Commodore Dunlop, on the part of Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain, and the Marquis De Montaignac and the <lb/>
Count De Gobincau on the part of France, to <lb/>
take evidance on the causes of dispute arising <lb/>
between the fishermen of both nations on that <lb/>
part of the coast commonly called the French <lb/>
Shore. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
"That since that period all causes of complaint <lb/>
have ceased, owing to the British fishermen <lb/>
having discontinued to resort to that part of the <lb/>
coast for the purposes of the fishery. That <lb/>
now a new question was arisen, growing out of <lb/>
a knowledge that British Residents possess, that <lb/>
valuable deposits of minerals exist on that <lb/>
part of the Island. That the Governor of New<lb break="no"/>foundland has been prohibited, as your Grace <lb/>
is aware, to issue licences of search for said <lb/>
minerals. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
"That your memorialist humbly submits that <lb/>
ho' a question of this nature was never con<lb break="no"/>templated by the framers of the treaty of <lb/>
Utrecht, still the terms of that treaty are suffici<lb break="no"/>ently comprehensive to embrace every necessary <lb/>
condition to enable Her Majesty's Government <lb/>
to issue licenses of search for minerals, or for any <lb/>
other purpose unconnection with the fisheries. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        "A <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> of article 13 of the above men<lb break="no"/>tioned treaty will clearly show the limited <lb/>
        rights of the French; and that the <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
of the soil for agricultural or mineral or any <lb/>
other purpose outside at those limited rights, <lb/>
and not interfering with their fishing previlege, <lb/>
belongs to the prerogative of the Queen. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
The terms of the treaty carefully exclude <lb/>
the French from the excrcise of any Dominion <lb/>
over the soul.—The treaty does not acknowledge <lb/>
the right on the part of the Freach to remove <lb/>
fixed settlements belonging to British subjects. <lb/>
That right, by the declaration of His Britannite <lb/>
Majesty attached to the treaty of Versailles in <lb/>
1783, is reserved to the Sovereign of Great <lb/>
Britain. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>"The French are prohibited from remaining <lb/>
on the Island after the termination of the fishing <lb/>
season. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
" Memoralist humbly submits that at <lb/>
the present time there are many reasons to <lb/>
induce Her Majesty's Ministers to view this <lb/>
question in a favorable point of view. As the <lb/>
population of the Islald encrease, the fisheries <lb/>
are not sufficient to support the inhabitants. <lb/>
Poverty in consequence is wide spread. The <lb/>
large bounties given by the Government of <lb/>
France for the encouragemeat of their fisheries, <lb/>
and the exclusion of British fish from the <lb/>
markets of France, by imposing on its importa<lb break="no"/>tion a prohibtory duty, tend to increase the <lb/>
difficulties of our fishermen. The Newfound<lb break="no"/>land Government are most anxious to open up <lb/>
new resources for the employment of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. The mineral wealth of the Colony is <lb/>
beginning to attract the attention of capi<lb break="no"/>tilists. Under these circumstances the <lb/>
denial of the right of search for minerals on the <lb/>
part of H. M. Government, is considered by <lb/>
the Colonists as a very strained interpretation <lb/>
of the treaties; and that denial is felt the more, <lb/>
as it emanated altogether from H. M. Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, the French authorities never having ob<lb break="no"/>jected to any occupation of the soil on the part <lb/>
of British settlers who did not interrupt by <lb/>
their competition the fishermen of France; and <lb/>
further, when the Government of Newfoundland <lb/>
appointed a Stipendiary Magistrate in George's <lb/>
Bay, within the limits of the Franch rights of <lb/>
fishery, the French authorities made no remon<lb break="no"/>strance, as it was considered no violation of the <lb/>
treaty rights of the nation. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
"Memorialist further begs to inform your <lb/>
Grace that in Paris, a few days ago, he had a <lb/>
conversation with Admiral the Marquis de <lb/>
Montaignac, the former Commissioner, who ex<lb break="no"/>pressed an opinion that he considered it a great <lb/>
hardship that British subjects were denied the <lb/>
right of exploration on the French Suore, and <lb/>
he also stated that he was satisfied that if a <lb/>
negociation was entered into with the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of France, an arrangement satisfactory to <lb/>
all parties would be concluded. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
"In submitting the foregoing statement for <lb/>
your Grace's consideration, memoralist declares <lb/>
that the parties who take a leading interest in <lb/>
this question are those most attached to the pa<lb break="no"/>rent state. They see Nova Scotia, perhaps <lb/>
without cause, distracted and divided, and they <lb/>
do not wish that the just discontent of New<lb break="no"/>foundland should swell the chorus of disunion. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
"They wish to see the Dominion of Canada <lb/>
composed of a series of coutented Colonies, <lb/>
indebted to the mother Country for the charter <lb/>
of their rights, and in the hour of danger her <lb/>
support, and not her weakness. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>"All which your memorialist humbly submits <lb/>
for your Grace's consideration. <lb/></p> 

<p>After presenting this memorial he received a <lb/>
communication to the effect that the Governor <lb/>
had been requested to come home to take the <lb/>
whole matter into consideration. With regard to <lb/>
the mad service, he believed that general satis<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

faction had been given. At present a moiety <lb/>
of the subsidy was paid by the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and the remainder by the Colony; but at <lb/>
the expiration of three years we will have to <lb/>
bear the whole amount of that subsidy, £9,000 <lb/>
Sterling. The next question referred to is the <lb/>
great question of Confederation, which embraces <lb/>
every phase of our present state, social, politi<lb break="no"/>cal and financial. It concerns our relations in <lb/>
regard to our own internal Government, our <lb/>
brother colonists, the mother country, and <lb/>
foreign countries. We have to ask ourselves the <lb/>
simple question—Is the present state of things <lb/>
satisfactory? If every hon. member ask him<lb break="no"/>self that question, in the silent solitude of the <lb/>
night, when the outer world and all its con<lb break="no"/>siderations are excluded, when the conscience <lb/>
works most powerfully, he must declare that the <lb/>
present condition of affairs is not as we would <lb/>
have it? The next question, then, is whether <lb/>
the preseat constitution of the country is <lb/>
capable of redressing and removing the evils <lb/>
that afflict us. If the majority of this Assem<lb break="no"/>bly should determine that the present constitu<lb break="no"/>tion is powerless for good, we have to determine <lb/>
what remedial measure is necessary to restore <lb/>
confidence to the people, and produce that state <lb/>
of things which was the object of Henry the <lb/>
Fourth's desire, that every peasant in his <lb/>
dominions should have a fowl in his pot. The <lb/>
next question is whether or not our fellow <lb/>
colonists are anxious to associate with us. If <lb/>
that be so, ought we to shut out the bare con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the question, or ought we not to <lb/>
see whether it would be advisable to secure a <lb/>
form of Government which would rescue us <lb/>
from our Slough of Despond? Are the terms <lb/>
fair and equitable which the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment offer us? They offer to relieve us of a great <lb/>
    portion of our official expenditure, which, pre<lb break="no"/>suming Mr. Pinsent's figures to be correct,— <lb/></p>

This tariff, then, is proposed to be substituted <lb/>

official expenditure proposed to be defrayed by <lb/>
the Dominion, with the further sums required <lb/>
to liquidate our local expenditure. Supposing, <lb/>
then, that we should accept this offer, what <lb/>
would be the result? Should we reduce our <lb/>
present constitution, so as to square with its <lb/>
lessened responsibility? Such reduction might <lb/>
        readily be effected, without any <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> of <lb/>
efficiency, and the total expenditure might be as <lb/>
follows:— <lb/></p>

<p>This provides on a scale equal to the present for <lb/>
every species of official expenditure, with the ex<lb break="no"/>ception of Legislative contingencies, which, under a <lb/>
new constitution, might easily be reduced. This <lb/>
expenditure amounts in all to $315,000. The grant <lb/>
from the Dominion amounts to $446,000, so that <lb/>
every year a sum of $100,000 would be left us for <lb/>
    roads—an amount which no local government can <lb/>
hope to have at its disposal for years to come. Ves<lb break="no"/>sels too will be admitted without the imposition of <lb/>
light dues, which would at present be to us a saving <lb/>
of $22,000 per annum. Another item we shall have <lb/>
to bear if we continue as we are, is the subsidy to <lb/>
the mail Steamers, amounting in all to $43,200, one <lb/>
half of which is now paid by the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The Dominion Government undertakes the <lb/>
responsibility of bearing our debt amounting to <lb/>
$1,500,000. Our debentures having the stamp of <lb/>
the Dominion, would be equal in value to their own, <lb/>
so that in the London markets our 5 per cents. now <lb/>
unsaleable, would be worth 95, and our 6 per cents <lb/>
from 106 to 108. But how are we to pay the public <lb/>
debt if we remain as we are? Tuere is a grave re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility of maintaining the credit of the colony <lb/>

<p>
How shall we pay the public debt if we remain as we <lb/>
are? Here is a responcibility which we must face if <lb/>
we refuse the offer of the Dominion. To whom does <lb/>
this money, represented by the public debt belong? <lb/>
To the bone and sinew of the country, who, with a <lb/>
longing desire for the future independence of their <lb/>
children have denied themselves comforts and worked <lb/>
late and early in the accumulation of this money. <lb/>
Did not this present to hon. members a serious sub<lb break="no"/>ject of consideration? Prudent men regarding these <lb/>
things will be constrained to say, "let us associate <lb/>
ourselves with the neighbouring Colonies who are <lb/>
possessed of inexhaustible resources, who will tax us <lb/>
lightly and who, when they regard our geographical <lb/>
position as the bulwark of the St. Lawrence, will not <lb/>
haggle at slight pecuniary considerations." How will <lb/>
the matter affect us in regard to our foreign rela<lb break="no"/>tions? We see the manner in which our own territory <lb/>
is dealt with, and can we for a moment fancy that <lb/>
our small country with its sparse population could <lb/>
produce the same inpression in determining the <lb/>
correct construction of these treaties as if we <lb/>
were united to four millions of men and formed <lb/>
an aggregate Dominion of all the Colonies. <lb/>
Then with regard to the question of Reciprocal free <lb/>
trade with America, suppose that the Americans <lb/>
would agree to change us no duty, it would be im<lb break="no"/>possible for us to remit the duties which we impose so <lb/>
as to give full effect to the arrangement. If such a <lb/>
thing were attempted at present, it would result in <lb/>
colonial insolvency. Then, how were we in position <lb/>
to open up new sources of Commerce upon the basis <lb/>
of free trade with the vast countries of Brazil, Mexico, <lb/>
&amp;c., and when we find from the report lately publish<lb break="no"/>ed in Canada, that there are twelve milions of men <lb/>
daily consuming the same produce which we export. <lb/>
If then we had any means of opening up proper ne<lb break="no"/>gotiations with these markets, so as to establish some <lb/>
fiscal arrangement, it would be of large advantage to <lb/>
the people of this country. Now he (Hon Rec. Gen.) <lb/>
had stated his opinion. He had been charged with <lb/>
self-interested motives. He did not see how Confed<lb break="no"/>eration could possibly benefit him. He was satisfied <lb/>
that the hon members opposite, who indulged in these <lb/>
charges did not really believe them themselves, <lb/>
and only wished to show that they were skilled in the <lb/>
art of ingeniously tormentory. But what was <lb/>
the position which the Executive took on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion? Did it force the subject upon an unwilling <lb/>

country? Does it take advantage of its large mas<lb break="no"/>jority to pass the resolution? Does it take the <lb/>
country by surprise? All we ask is that the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions be fairly and quietly considered, arrive at what <lb/>
the terms should be, and then contrast them with the <lb/>
existing state of things; and say if the country would <lb/>
be ameliorated by the change. Then they would be <lb/>
submitted to the Dominion Parliament if accept<lb break="no"/>ed the House would be dissolved, and the whole coun<lb break="no"/>try would be called upon to ratify or reject them. We <lb/>
are hardly so intolerant as to say that the people do <lb/>
not understand the question or know what they <lb/>
would be called upon to determine. If we quietly <lb/>
entered into a discussion and examination of its de<lb break="no"/>tails, what need we be afraid of? Were we afraid of <lb/>
our own positical positions being extinguished.—our <lb/>
Parliamentary consequence being abated? Surely <lb/>
the interest of the colony should be paramount to all <lb/>
other considerations. He had now expressed his <lb/>
opinions, and they were the opinions of all upon this <lb/>
side of the House—gentlemen who represented every <lb/>
phase in the commerce of the country. In conclusion <lb/>
he would say in the ancient warning of the Church <lb/>
    —<hi rendition="simple:italic">sursum corda</hi>—and so consider this great question <lb/>
fraught with such vital consequences to the future <lb/>
welfare of this country, free from all party tactics, <lb/>
and with a single and sincere desire to promote the <lb/>
best interests of our native or adopted land. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:GLEN1">Mr. GLEN</persName> only intended to say a very few words. <lb/>
All the hon. members who had spoken upon the <lb/>
Government side of the House seemed to anticipate <lb/>
the question of Confederation, and the hon. Receiver <lb/>
General now asks the House to calmly deliberate <lb/>
upon a question which is not yet formally before it. <lb/>
Now, he would ask could this House enter into <lb/>
consideration of the question of Confederation, when <lb/>
at present the details were not before them, and <lb/>
when they knew nothing about them. He (Mr. G.) <lb/>
was indeed glad to hear that this question was to be <lb/>
left entirely for the country to decide upon. He, <lb/>
however, did not believe such would be the case, <lb/>
from the first, and further, he did not believe it now. <lb/>
The hon. the Receiver General says we are to agree <lb/>
to certain terms which will be sent to the Canadian <lb/>
Parliament for its approval. and then referred to <lb/>
the constituencies for theft ratification or rejection. <lb/>
Now that course was certainly not shadowed forth <lb/>
in the speech of his Excelleney the Governor. That <lb/>
speech calls upon us to affirm the principle of union, <lb/>
and yet the hon. Receiver General never said a word <lb/>
about that. If this House now were going to affirm <lb/>
the principle of Confederation, it would be a be<lb break="no"/>trayal of the agreement which the hon. Attorney <lb/>
General made, and which was that the matter should <lb/>
first be submitted to the constituencies. Do you <lb/>
intend this House to affirm the principle of union? <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTOREY GENERAL</persName>—We are not bound <lb/>
by it until it receives the sanction of the people, to <lb/>
whom it mast be submitted. <lb/></p>
    
    <p><persName ref="pers:GLEN1">Mr. GLEN</persName>.—Are you going to affirm the princi<lb break="no"/>ple of union in this General Assembly? That is <lb/>
the question, and that is the question you are shirk<lb break="no"/>ing. <lb/></p>
    
    <p><persName ref="pers:CART5">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—I am not shirk<lb break="no"/>ing any question. What I do will be done <lb/>
openly. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>Mr. GLEN.—Why, then, does the hon. <lb/>
Receiver General tell us that the Government <lb/>
programme is, it it is not to be carried out? <lb/>
What that hon. gentleman said was fair and <lb/>
right, and he (Mr. G.) would endorse every <lb/>
word of it. But he would warn the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that this side of the House were not to be <lb/>
entrapped without a fight. All they wanted <lb/>
was fair play for the country. This House had <lb/>
nothing to do with the principle of union. Let <lb/>
the Government bring down their resolutions, <lb/>
and let us see what the details are, and then we <lb/>
can go to the country upon them. We are told <lb/>
every day to keep calm, and yet we don't know <lb/>
what we are to keep calm about. Would the <lb/>
hon. Receiver Geueral tell us whether we would <lb/>
be called upon to affirm the plinciple of union? <lb/>
No; his speech on the point resembled the play of <lb/>
Hamlet with the part of Hamlet left out. With re<lb break="no"/>gard to be question of Reciprocity, and the way in <lb/>
which the hon. member had viewed it, he (Mr. <lb/>
G.) would say that it was absurd. If we want <lb/>
anything for Revenue purposes, we can tell the <lb/>
United States so, and say to them we will put <lb/>
on 5 per cent. and do you do the same, <lb/>
and then we would have reciprocity. Did <lb/>
not the British Government exact duties? <lb/>
Reciprocity did not exclusively mean a total <lb/>
abrogation of duties, but an assimilation of <lb/>
tariffs also. This claptrap, then, about reci<lb break="no"/>procity, was merely to show the people that we <lb/>
could not got anything except we were confede<lb break="no"/>rated. Now could wo not have a commercial <lb/>
treaty with Canada, instead of this union? He <lb/>
would tell the Government that they would not <lb/>
carry the principle of Confederation without a <lb/>
hard struggle. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:SPEA1">THE HON. THE SPEAKER</persName>.—It appears that <lb/>
many hon. gentlemen in this House have been <lb/>
rather premature in their discussion of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation. A few cursory remarks <lb/>
might not certainly have been out of place, but <lb/>
that full and ample discussion which it had <lb/>
received from some hon. members was uncalled <lb/>
for, especially when, in a short time, the question <lb/>
will come formally before the House for dipas<lb break="no"/>sionate deliberation. The hon. and venerable <lb/>
Receiver General has this day told us that the <lb/>
present period is a crisis in the world's history; <lb/>
and in tile history of Newfoundland. He (hon. <lb/>
the Speaker) leared that the crisis had not yet <lb/>
arrived. We were still suffering from the <lb/>
fever, but the disease had not yet reached its <lb/>
crisis. Now this House had already spent nine <lb/>
or ten days in discussing the Address of thanks <lb/>
in reply to his Excellency's speech at the open<lb break="no"/>ing of this session. Of course it was to be ex<lb break="no"/>pected that that speech would be attacked by <lb/>
the opposition, and that it would be defended by <lb/>
the Government side. As usual, it had been <lb/>
designated a barren, ball and and naked speech. <lb/>
He, however, must say that he never heard a <lb/>
speech delivered from the throne containing so <lb/>
many matters of vital importance, and fraught <lb/>
with so deep an interest to every individual in <lb/>
this Island. In it reference is made to the <lb/>
absence of any calamity during the past year, to <lb/>
a successful fishery, to the abundant yield of <lb/>
the potato crop. He (Hon. the Speaker) could <lb/>
not recollect when labour was so amply <lb/>
rewarded as it had been during the past year. <lb/>
But was there any improved condition of the <lb/>
people corresponding to that success? On the <lb/>
contrary, is there not more depression, starvation <lb/>
and misery than heretofore? His believed <lb/>
    
    <cb/>

nothing had occurred in the past history of this <lb/>
country that could compare with the present ex<lb break="no"/>isting state of things. When we saw, then, <lb/>
all this, when we saw those engaged in adminis<lb break="no"/>tering the Government of the country with so <lb/>
great a burden upon them, with such an im<lb break="no"/>pending crisis over us all, it behoved every <lb/>
man to lend his aid and assistance and influence <lb/>
in meeting the difficulties of our position. This <lb/>
was no time for the exercise of a factious oppo<lb break="no"/>sition, the indulgence of an obstructive policy. <lb/>
But those hon. members on the opposition <lb/>
benches should land their assistance to the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, to help them through the difficulties by <lb/>
which they were surrounded. Accusations had <lb/>
been made from time to time, that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were the cause of all these misfortunes.<lb/>
But they were mere empty allegations, which <lb/>
were without the slightest foundation, and to <lb/>
support which not a <choice><sic>tittle</sic><corr>title</corr></choice> of proof could be given. <lb/>
What were the causes of these difficulties? The <lb/>
causes were many, and had not occurred yester<lb break="no"/>day. They had been growing for years. We <lb/>
all know that the population of this country has <lb/>
been rapidly increasing, but with no commensu<lb break="no"/>rate increase in the industrial occupations of <lb/>
the people. Our forefathers had but one re<lb break="no"/>source, the fisheries, and unfortunately we were <lb/>
in the same position. That resource <lb/>
was now failing. Look for one <lb/>
moment at our Salmon fishery, which heretofore <lb/>
had yielded such a rich produce, a fishery <lb/>
which if it were fostered and protected, would <lb/>
be sufficient alone to yield a competency to the <lb/>
whole labouring population. That fishery is now <lb/>
comparatively nothing, compared to what it was <lb/>
in former years. We find, therefore, that our <lb/>
fishery had not merely failed to keep pace with <lb/>
our growing population, but that it had actually <lb/>
decreased. Even in Agriculture, very little <lb/>
progress had been made. The few patches of <lb/>
land that had been cleared, had faded to yield <lb/>
even a fair return for the labour which had been <lb/>
bestowed upon them. Then we had the potato <lb/>
disease, and yet with all the scientific means <lb/>
that had been used, we had not yet succeeded <lb/>
in eradicting it, or in discovering any means <lb/>
that would arrest its progress. He must say <lb/>
that he was astonished when he heard hon. <lb/>
gentlemen of the opposition attack the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for not having expended some £3,000 <lb/>
for seed potatoes, when they well knew that the <lb/>
failure of the potato crops had been one of the <lb/>
causes of reducing the country to the state in <lb/>
which it is at present. What, expend £8,000 <lb/>
in distributing seed potatoes, which after all <lb/>
the labour that would be bestowed upon them, <lb/>
might result in nothing. Although the past <lb/>
year, under the mercy of providence, we had <lb/>
been favoured with abundant crops, yet go now <lb/>
and ask the people who had saved these crops <lb/>
what had become of them. They would tell <lb/>
you that they wers becoming rapidly diseased <lb/>
in their cellars, and were wasting away. The <lb/>
unfortunate course which had been adopted in <lb/>
this country for a great number of years, had <lb/>
trained the people into the habit of looking to <lb/>
the public revenue for support, and as that to <lb/>
which they had a right. Very shortly after <lb/>
representative institutions were introduced into <lb/>
this country, pauper relief was initiated, and <lb/>
up to the present it had been fostered and sus<lb break="no"/>tained by representatives the people in this <lb/>
House. Who can deny it, that he was consid<lb break="no"/>ered the best man who could obtain the great<lb break="no"/>est amount of poor relief? That was the case, <lb/>
and no one coull deny it. It commenced in <lb/>
St. John's, and had extended to all the other <lb/>
districts. What, then, was the result? We <lb/>
found now a generation of men bred up in <lb/>
pauper relief, and trained to look to the revenues <lb/>
of the country as to that to which they had a <lb/>
right, and not to depend apon their own <choice><sic>indus<lb break="no"/>dustry</sic><corr>industry</corr></choice> or labour for their support. He would <lb/>
say that at such a time as this, with the greater <lb/>
portion of the people in a starving condition, <lb/>
he was indeed sorry to hear any men appeal to <lb/>
the passions of a hungry starving and ignor<lb break="no"/>ant, people. He regretted such a <lb/>
course exceedingly, and hon. members <lb/>
might yet find that they were not the <lb/> 
first who sowed the wind and reaped the whire<lb break="no"/>wind. We had then only one resource (ex<lb break="no"/>cept one mine) which engaged the labour of <lb/>
the people, and only sufficient capital was re<lb break="no"/>tained in the country to carry on the one branch <lb/>
of industry. What power had the Government <lb/>
over capital, which had been drawn out of the <lb/>
country? Could they arrest the progress of <lb/>
the potato disease, or make the fisheries more <lb/>
productive? Were they to blame for the pau<lb break="no"/>per relief system, a system which had grown <lb/>
up before we had Responsible Government at <lb/>
all? But it we cannot coerce capital to re<lb break="no"/>main, we may place the country in such a <lb/>
position as to attract it. We may woo it to <lb/>
our shores, and it there be a means of doing <lb/>
so, should we not adopt it? Our isolation plac<lb break="no"/>ed us in that position, that alone we could do <lb/>
nothing. When we made appeals to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government, how had they been respond<lb break="no"/>ed to? Had we not been knocking and kick<lb break="no"/>ing at Downing street, and what did we get by <lb/>
it? When, then, there was an opportunity <lb/>
offered to us of uniting ourselves to the adjacent <lb/>
colonies, and thus obtaining a power which as <lb/>
we are we could not possess, was it not a matter <lb/>
which should be discussed seriously and calmly, <lb/>
not in that factions or party feeling? We are <lb/>
told that no Canadian capital would flow into <lb/>
this country. Now what capital was working <lb/>
the mines of Nova Scotia, and sustaining the <lb/>
manufactories of New Brunswick? Compare <lb/>
the labouring classes in Canada with our own <lb/>
operative population. There every man had <lb/>
employment and fair pay, and could lift up his <lb/>
head in independence. We knew very well <lb/>
that, from the precarious nature of the avoca<lb break="no"/>tions of the people, there would be times of <lb/>
depression and times of prosperity. Would it <lb/>
not then be well if we were united to so pros<lb break="no"/>perous a country as the new Dominion. At <lb/> 
all events Nova Scotia, a short time ago, thought <lb/>
    
    <cb/>
    
that it was well to be confederated. If she <lb/>
had not been, where could she bave got those <lb/>
thousands which were sent to her relief? (Here <lb/>
the hon. and learned gentlemen referred to the <lb/>
misrepresentation which were being made by <lb/>
those opposed to union, and alluded to an in<lb break="no"/>stance which had lately come under his own <lb/>
notice , that men could not cut wood without a <lb/>
licensé or go to the fishery without a license, <lb/>
which they would have to pay for when this <lb/>
colony was united with the New Dominion.) <lb/>
This, then, is the style of things which has been <lb/>
said by the great head centre of the Anti Con<lb break="no"/>federate cause in this country. Many ask <lb/>
what are the great benefits to be derived from <lb/>
Confederation? But he would say, what are we <lb/>
to do without it? The only panacea that was <lb/>
offered was the reduction of the public expen<lb break="no"/>diture. He (hon. the Speaker) could only judge <lb/>
of the future from the past. Since 1832 we had <lb/>
had many Government, and and all without exception <lb/>
had increased the public debt and the <lb/>
        public expenditure.—That speech, bar<lb break="no"/>ren, ball and uninteresting. There was one <lb/> 
subject to which it alluded, which was of the <lb/>
deepest importance, and on which they might <lb/>
well congratulate themselves, and that was the <lb/>
settlement of the French Shore question. He <lb/>
believed that that would result in the employ<lb break="no"/>ment of a large amount of capital in mining <lb/>
operations on that shore. The time would come <lb/>
when every matter mentioned in this speech. <lb/>
would come before the House. They would <lb/>
then have an opportunity of expressing them<lb break="no"/>selves in detail on each subject. At the present <lb/>
time he would, as he always did, confine himself <lb/>
to making a few remarks on the general pur<lb break="no"/>port of the speech. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:RENO1">Mr. RENOUF</persName> could find no fault with the speech <lb/>
of the hon Receiver General, who had set forth his <lb/>
views fairly reasonably and temperately but the <lb/>
speech of the hon. and learned Speaker reminded <lb/>
him of the lamentations of Jeremiah. No matter <lb/>
how he might differ from the views of both these <lb/>
hon. gentlemen, he could assure them that on his <lb/>
(Mr. R's) side of the House they required no <lb/>
admonitions from the Government side on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation. When it comes before the <lb/>
House it shall receive that cool dispassionate consi<lb break="no"/>deration which a question of its great importance <lb/>
demands. The hon. Receiver General says that Con<lb break="no"/>federation will give the people employment. A greater <lb/>
fallacy was never uttered, and the country would <lb/>
not believe it. Let, however, the advdcates of Con<lb break="no"/>federation show the truth of this assertion and then <lb/>
    all would accept their <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>. Free Trade. <lb/>
The hon. member for Ferryland had shown how they <lb/>
could have reciprocity. What was there to prevent <lb/>
us from having Commercial Reciprocity with Canada <lb/>
now, which would accomplish as much for us as any <lb/>
Confederation? They had heard a good deal of <lb/>
having flour and pork and other such articles free of <lb/>
duty, ald also of their present state of isolation. <lb/>
What made that isolation so complete? Would <lb/>
Confederation remove the barrier of ice which <lb/>
surrounds those shores? It was the duty of the <lb/>
House to economise, and before the session closed <lb/>
hon. gentlemen at his (Mr. R's) side of the House <lb/>
would show the country that such reductions can be <lb/>
made as would, it carried ont, enable the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to reduce the taxation. Suppose we had Con<lb break="no"/>federation, and that to-morrow we required a supply <lb/>
of Canadian flour, by what means could it bee <lb/>
brought here? At this time our vessels, on <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>their</corr></choice> <lb/>
return from the Brazils and West Indies, call nt <lb/>
New York, &amp;c., and thus supply our wants; and <lb/>
was it to be supposed that they would be diverted <lb/>
to diverge so far from their course as to go up <choice><sic>ahe</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> <lb/>
St. Lawrence, and incur all the additional risk <choice><sic>bd</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> <lb/>
expense of such a course? No doubt we would be <lb/>
told that the necessity for such a course would be <lb/>
obviated by the Railway. Halifax would be the <lb/>
Atlantic terminus of that Railway, and what would <lb/>
be the cost of transit to Halifax? If these things <lb/>
could be got cheaper from Canada, how is it that <lb/>
our people do not trade there? Our trade with the <lb/>
United Staics is to the extent of about £459,000 <lb/>
a year, while with Canada it is only £40,000 or <lb/>
£50,000. The hon. Receiver General says he can <lb/>
show by carefully prepared returns what Canada <lb/>
will give us and what she will take from us, and <lb/>
that we would have $100,000 a year for Road Ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. How hon. gentlemen differ. When the <lb/>
hon. and learned Attorney General and the hon. <lb/>
Mr. Shea returned from Quebec, in 1861, they <lb/>
stated this country would have a perpetual road <lb/>
grant of £12,000. He (Mr. R.) recollected that <lb/>
when he first heard their statements he made some <lb/>
calculatiens and found that there could be no such <lb/>
result, and that to get £12,000 for roads they <lb/>
should starve grants for other purposes. This idea <lb/>
was another fallacy. The hon. Receiver General <lb/>
asks how we could have a road grant if we remain <lb/>
as we are? It could be had by severe economy <lb/>
applied to expenditure, and public Institutions. <lb/>
He (Mr. R.) agreed with the hon. and learned <lb/>
Speaker that a crisis is at hand, but that crisis was <lb/>
different from that alluded to by the hon and learn<lb break="no"/>ed gentleman. The crisis was one which would <lb/>
pare down expenditure both inside and outside of <lb/>
this House. The expenditure was far beyond the <lb/>
requirements of the country, and while, session <lb/>
after session, taxes were laid on taxes, no attempt <lb/>
was made to reduce official salaries. The hon. and <lb/>
learned Speaker had said that all classes of laborers <lb/>
were fairly recompensed during the past year. How <lb/>
many thousands of fishermen had been without the <lb/>
means of prosecuting the fishery, and were com<lb break="no"/>pelled to sell their fish green to meet their daily <lb/>
wants? Then was if not nonsense to tell such <lb/>
people that their labor had been fairly rewarded? <lb/>
The hon. and learned gentleman also called on the <lb/>
Opposition to help the Government out of their diffi<lb break="no"/>cuities. They were not of our creation. We had <lb/>
pointed out many remedies to the Government, but <lb/>
had always got the deaf ear, and now the prophe<lb break="no"/>sied result had come, and the only remedy proposed <lb/>
was Confederation. It was not true that Poor <lb/>
Relief had its origin in St. John's. It had its <lb/>
rise when under the old irresponsible Government <lb/>
1000 barrels of flour were sent to Trinity. It was <lb/>
easy to make these charges against the capital, when <lb/>
it was the refuge for the poor of all the Outports, <lb/>
whom it had to support, in addition to its own. <lb/>
Reference had been made to the capitalists of <lb/>
Canada building up the manufactures of New <lb/>
Brunswick and Nova Scotia; why the fact was <lb/>
that these two Colonies had manufactures when <lb/>
they stood alone, but Coutederation had crushed <lb/>
them out. The hon. and learned Speaker spoke <lb/>
of the various forums of Government which had <lb/>
been it, this Colony, and said that each had piled <lb/>
on taxes, and referred to the present Government <lb/>
as beset with more difficulties than any other. <lb/>
He (Mr. R.) would ask what Government had <lb/>
been so lavish in their expenditure, or so increas<lb break="no"/>ed the burdens of the people? It, instead of <lb/>

<cb/>
    
    taxation they had practised economy, and applied <lb/>
    the pruning klnife to the official salaries and the <lb/>
expenditure of the Public Institutions, they could <lb/>
have effected a reduction sufficient to meet all <lb/>
their wants. But no, their policy was tax, tax, <lb/>
tax, and they had taxed, taxed, taxed, and still the <lb/>
people were starving. Why not appropriate these
taxes for the benefit of the public? What good <lb/>
hed they ever done for the operative population? <lb/>
Was it a fair or legitimate argument that because <lb/>
former Governments had made no improvements, <lb/>
the present one should not do so either. It was <lb/>
a remarkable fact that all those who supported <lb/>
the Government policy decried all attempts on the <lb/>
part of his (Mr. R's) side of the House to reduce <lb/>
the public expenditure. They profess to have no <lb/>
faith in it, but it would be found that the country <lb/>
would have faith in it. The hon. Mr. Shea made <lb/>
reference the other evening to his (Mr. R.) re<lb break="no"/>ceiving £50 a year. He (Mr. R.) did not ask <lb/>
for it, it was sent to him. And when he found he <lb/>
could accept it without at all interfering with his <lb/>
public duties, he did so, and he did not think the <lb/>
service lost by his connection with that office. It <lb/>
would appear that the hon. gentlemen did not <lb/>
like his (Mr. R's.) method of speaking in that <lb/>
House, and considered all his speeches to be <lb/>
merely rehashes of the former ones. Of this he <lb/>
(Mr. R.) was satisfied to let the public be the <lb/>
judges. Where was there anything new in the <lb/>
<choice><sic>peesches</sic><corr>speeches</corr></choice> of hon. gentlemen opposite? Then <lb/>
why should the Opposition be taunted with not <lb/>
advancing anything novel in the way of argument. <lb/>
They were there to enunciate their views fully, <lb/>
clearly and fairly, and let the public be the arbiters <lb/>
as to who was right and who was wrong. WHen <lb/>
the hon. member was speaking of his (Mr. R's.) <lb/>
handsome pay of £50 a year, why did he not say <lb/>
something of the amount received by his own <lb/>
family. He (Mr. R.) could tell the public that <lb/>
the hon. member of Placentia and St. Mary's <lb/>
and his family received £2000 a year out of the <lb/>
public chest. <lb/></p>
    
    <p><persName ref="pers:SHEA2">Hon. A. SHEA</persName>.–Give us the particulars. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:RENO1">Mr. RENOUF</persName> had them in his hand, and would <lb/>
take his own time for making then public. The <lb/>
hon. member spoke of the Opposition as being <lb/>
factious, contemptible and weak, and yet he <lb/>
spent 3 1/2 hours the other evening in abuse of <lb/>
them. If they were so factious, contemptible and <lb/>
weak, why should the hon. gentlemen take so <lb/>
much trouble about them? As for the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment boasting of their triumph in Harbor Grace, <lb/>
the less they said of that affair the better, and he <lb/>
(Mr. R ) thought it woull be better to let the hon. <lb/>
member speak for himself. The Harbor Grace <lb/>
election was no test at all. The Candidates did <lb/>
not go to the people on the question of Confede<lb break="no"/>ration at all. There were in the district about <lb/>
1880 voters, of those only 840 voted, and though <lb/>
the Government used every effort even to threat<lb break="no"/>ening those who were employed on the public <lb/>
works. Mr. Godden was returned only by a bare <lb/>
majority of 40. This was the great triumph of <lb/>
which so much was made. If the question of <lb/>
Confederation had been fairly submitted, was it <lb/>
to be supposed the people would be so inert? He <lb/>
(Mr.R.) took to himself much credit as a prophet. <lb/>
He had the other evening prophesied that the hon. <lb/>
Mr. Shea would be in want of a dodge for this <lb/>
session, and that that dodge would be a telegram <lb/>
for laborers. Well, was not it true; was <lb/>
not the proposal made to export our people <lb/>
to work in the wild woods of Canada on a <lb/>
Railway, the contracts for which are not yet signed? <lb/>
The hon member now manifests great sympathy <lb/>
with the laboring population, but in 1837, when the <lb/>
Telegraph Company applied for power to extend <lb/>
their capital to enable them to add to their land <lb/>
lines, and thus give employment to the people, the <lb/>
only member of the Committee who opposed the <lb/>
permission asked for was the hon. Mr. Shea. He <lb/>
yielded at least, but only when he found <lb/>
that the rest of the Commitee were unanimous <lb/>
in their desire to give the desired permission. <lb/>
The hon. member, Mr. Shea, has no <lb/>
faith in seed potatoes, because he deals in <lb/>
meal and molasses, and not in potatoes. <lb/>
If the hon. gentlemen dealt in potatoes, he <lb/>
would doubless profess a very different creed. <lb/>
It was rather a singular fact that though several <lb/>
hon. members have spoken on the Government <lb/>
side since the hon. member, Mr. Shea, had pro<lb break="no"/>pounded his transportation scheme, not one of <lb/>
these hon. gentlemen had uttered a word about <lb/>
it; but, on the contrary, they had appeared to <lb/>
avoid it very carefully. Other countries endea<lb break="no"/>voured to woo emigration to their shores, but <lb/>
we seem to be anxious to reverse this policy, <lb/>
and to denude the country of its <lb/>
strength and its pride. You might send away <lb/>
10,000 men, but how would that better the con<lb break="no"/>dition of those remaining? The idea of ship<lb break="no"/>ping 800 men to Canada, before a single con<lb break="no"/>tractor has entered into a contract, was simply <lb/>
preposterous. He (Mr. R.) could not see how <lb/>
hon. members could place any confidence in it, <lb/>
resting, as it did, on the bare unsupported testi<lb break="no"/>mony of the hon. member for Placenia and St. <lb/>
Mary's. How beneficient had the Canadian <lb/>
Government become. Not a word, last year, <lb/>
about relieving the poverty of the people, but, <lb/>
at this peculiar moment, when these hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men are trying to force us into Cofederation, <lb/>
the people are to be bribed to sell the country. <lb/>
Hon. gentlemen opposite were afraid to bear <lb/>
the responsibility of selling the country, but <lb/>
they endeavour to in make a catspaw of the unfo<lb break="no"/>tunate fishermen to accomplish that which <lb/>
they dread to do thenselves. He (Mr. R.) <lb/>
would like to ask what had become of the Caps <lb/>
Ray Railroad? Many person believed in the <lb/>
probability of that project being accomplished, <lb/>
and what authority was brought up to support <lb/>
it? Mr. Sandford Fleming. The project, <lb/>
however, feel to the ground, and a new dodge <lb/>
was enterprised. And whose authority does the <lb/>
new scheme rely upon? Strange coincidence, <lb/>
upon Mr. Sandford Fleming. Let the hon. <lb/>
member, if he were honest, come out with some <lb/>
    broad, comprehensive <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>, and he would, at <lb/>
least, be appreciated. But it was not by such <lb/>
    dodges and suits and empty <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> that the <lb/>
people were to be inposed upon. The hon. <lb/>
meanber says that there can be no great econo<lb break="no"/>my practised in our expauditure. Why, one <lb/>
institution supporting a hundred paupers had <lb/>
    in 1887, 940 hogsheads of coals at 8s. per <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
and 735 loads of wood, at 4s. a load. Surely <lb/>
there must be something rotten in <lb/>
such a state of things. Year after year, <lb/>
amendment was promised, but year after <lb/>
year the same complaiats had to be made. Bad <lb/>
as the opposition might be, could they do much <lb/>
worse than this? Are Hon. members to be dic<lb break="no"/>tated to by such hon. gentlemen as the learued <lb/>
member for Brigus, who comes down here with <lb/>

a grand scheme showing what Canada is going <lb/>
to do for us? But owing to the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
imperfect knowledge of figures he make a trifling <lb/>
blunder of $37,000 against the Colony. How <lb/>
can the hon. member tell us what terms the <lb/>
Dominion would give? If these really were the <lb/>
terms offered to us, it was rather strange that <lb/>
we should not hear of them through some mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Executive, and not through a mere <lb/>
    supporter of the party. Something had been <lb/>
    said about Tilt Cove, and occasion, had been <lb/>
    taken to revile Mr. C. F. Bennett, who was one <lb/>
    of the greatest benefactors the country ever had. <lb/>
[Here the hon. member read and commented <lb/>
in a letter of Mr. Smith McKay in the "Chroni<lb break="no"/>cle," defending Mr. Bennett from certain charges <lb/>
made against him.] It had been said that Mr. <lb/>
Bennett had left some money behind him to <lb/>
work up the anti-confederate cause. If he had <lb/>
done so, he had not put his hand into any other <lb/>
man's pocket. He did not, like soune Executive <lb/>
gentlemen, who, after giving a dollar to a poor <lb/>
man, go down to Dr.Shea and get reimbursed. <lb/>
And hon gentlemen say "the only remely for <lb/>
our present condition is Confederation, which <lb/>
will give us honours and offices and titles. <lb/>
We have mismanaged everything, taxed the <lb/>
people and after this let us escape to the <lb/>
union." The traitors of Nova Scotia, who rivited <lb/>
the shackles upon the people, are raised to <lb/>
positions of eminence and honour, and of <lb/>
course it is only reasonable to expect that <lb/>
those hon. gentlemen who here assist in carry<lb break="no"/>ing the measure will be similarly honoured. <lb/>
Ww were advised to go into Confederation, and for <lb/>
for what object? Because we want a change. He <lb/>
(Mr. R.) said in all sincerity, let hon. members <lb/>
shew us the benefits that will flow from Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, positive benefits, not chimerical and specula<lb break="no"/>tive ones, and no man would be more favourable <lb/>
than himself. But he would be recreant to his duty <lb/>
were he to close his eyes to the schemes and dodges <lb/>
that had been going on for the past few years to <lb/>
thrust us into Confederation, for the benefit of a few <lb/>
family compacts. Oh, they say that it is claptrap <lb/>
if we speak of the Irish union. There were men <lb/>
then who sold the liberties of Ireland for gold. <lb/>
Every man who voted for it received gold for <lb/>
riveting the chains upon his country. And had <lb/>
Ireland since been benefited or contented with the <lb/>
change? It was indeed a sad thing to refer to the <lb/>
union of Ireland, with all its disastrous conse<lb break="no"/>quences. We must keep that strongly before the <lb/>
public. The opposition desired the welfare of the <lb/>
people as well as tho Government. It was not such a <lb/>
dodge as the Cape Ray Railway from which we were to <lb/>
believe that any good would be the results—He was <lb/>
a native of the country, and it was equally as dear <lb/>
to him as it was to those members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment who were revelling in the luxury and emolu<lb break="no"/>ments of office. Every man who went before the <lb/>
various constituences next election would see how <lb/>
public opinion ran. We knew that there were <lb/>
many who would not dare to face the electors, and <lb/>
thus it was that they desired to transfer the rights <lb/>
and liberties of this country to another province. <lb/>
Thery were indeed playing a deep game, and <lb/>
then they woull meet fitting reward. Where can <lb/>
we gather from his Excellency's speech that this <lb/>
question was to be submitted to the people? There <lb/>
was no allusion to such a course in it. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment then simply say, we all carry it whether you <lb/>
approve of it or not. The constituencies would be <lb/>
    bribed as they had been in Nova Scotia and New <lb/>
Brunswick. In the former Province nineteen mem<lb break="no"/>bers had been bribed, as in the days of the Irish <lb/>
union. Look at Nova Scotia to-day. There was <lb/>
not a village that had not its repeal club, like those <lb/>
which O'Connell established in Ireland, to use all <lb/>
their influence to abrogate a union to which the peo<lb break="no"/>ple had never assented. (Here the hon. member <lb/>
referred to the proceedings connected with the <lb/>
delegation to Quebec, and pointed out that only one <lb/>
man Mr. Palmer, of Prince Edward Island, had <lb/>
repudiated the articles that had been agreed to <lb/>
there. He then read a letter which he said came <lb/>
from a leading lawyer in Montreal, and in which <lb/>
Newfoundland was advised to keep out of the <lb/>
union. The hon. member concluded by saying <lb/>
that he expected by the next mail to blow to the <lb/>
winds the dodge of sending men from this island <lb/>
for the public works in the New Dominion. <lb/></p>
