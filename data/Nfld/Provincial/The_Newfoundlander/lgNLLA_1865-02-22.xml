HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY. <lb/></p> 

<p>TUESDAY, Feb. 21. <lb/>
The house met at three o'clock. <lb/>
The hon Receiver GesekAL, by command of his <lb/>
Excellercy the Governor, presented to the house a return <lb/>
of the duties collected at tiarbor Grace in the years <lb/>
1862 '3 and '4. <lb/>
Ordered that this document lie on the table. <lb/>
Mr. RoRKE presented a pretition from Wm. Burke <lb/>
and others, of Victoria Willage, near Carbonear, which <lb/>
was received and read, praying for a grant to complete <lb/>
the road through that settlement. <lb/>
Ordered that the petion lie on the table. <lb/>
M. KAVANAGH pres, n'ed a petition from Gregory <lb/>
Dug-an and others, of Broad Cove, which was received <lb/>
and read, praying for a grant to complete the road join­ <lb/>
ing the Portugal Cove road. <lb/>
Ordered that the petition lie on the table. <lb/>
On motion of the hon Attors EY GENERAL, pursuant <lb/>
to order of the day, the house resolved itself into com­ <lb/>
mittee of the whoſe on the further consideration of the <lb/>
confederation of the British North American Provinces. <lb/>
Mr. Knight in the chair. <lb/>
Mr. Rokke said he rose to say a few words on this <lb/>
important subject of confederation. He regarded the <lb/>
surject in two aspects, political and commercial, Some <lb/>
of the supporters of the latter seemed to forget the for­ <lb/>
mer. All who had paid attention to the proceedings in <lb/>
the Imperial Parliament, and the progress of public <lb/>
opinion in England, of late years, must be aware that the <lb/>
question of the military expenditure in the colonies had <lb/>
received a good deal of attention, and was the cause of <lb/>
much complaint, and that Her Majesty's Government <lb/>
were pressed to have recourse to every means of its <lb/>
reduction. That question of confederation, which was <lb/>
taken up in the neighbouring Proviuces, and to which <lb/>
they were invited to become parties, voffered an oppor­ <lb/>
tunity of effecting such reduction; and we saw, by the <lb/>
despatch of Mr. Cardwell, that it was surongly recom. <lb/>
mended to us by Her Majesty's Government. We had <lb/>
therefore to consider it as a measure which the home go­ <lb/>
vernment desired to see carried out. By the confedera­ <lb/>
tion of the colonies, they would form a powerful commu­ <lb/>
nity, and the Imperial Government would be gradually <lb/>
relieved from a considerable, portion of the existing <lb/>
military evpenditure. It had been said that Great <lb/>
Britain would still continue our plesent protection to us, <lb/>
and that we m gºt, therefore, remain out of the con­ <lb/>
He (Mr. Rork") did not consider the matter <lb/>
in that light. If we declined to accept the terms offered <lb/>
to us, he apprehended the British Government would <lb/>
not act towards us as they had hitherto done. It had <lb/>
been stated that the statesmen of Canada desired to have <lb/>
this Colony, and the ºther maritime Provinces, for the <lb/>
purpose of aiding in the defence of Canada. He did not <lb/>
concur in that. Canada was a populous and poweriul <lb/>
and prosperous country. and better able to defend her­ <lb/>
selt than we were. Then as to the commercial aspect <lb/>
of the question; many apprehended that we would be <lb/>
subjected to a much larger annunt of taxatiou than we <lb/>
now paid; but when we come to consider the position <lb/>
we would be in, he did not see much to apprehend rom <lb/>
increased tax ition. People were apprehensive that the <lb/>
tariff of Canada would be adopted by the confederate <lb/>
Government and Legislature. But supposing the tariff <lb/>
of Canada were applied to our imports, he did not consi­ <lb/>
der that it would produce so much revenue as was sup­ <lb/>
posed. By that tariff, books, lines, seines, nets, salt and <lb/>
canvas were admitted duty free, which were articles of <lb/>
large consumption in the fisheries. There were other <lb/>
alticles which came in at a duty not exceeding our pre­ <lb/>
sent tariff. A large quantity of goods were imported now <lb/>
which we had no business to use; and which had been <lb/>
the cause of three fourths of the poverty under which <lb/>
Newfoundland now suffered; and if increased duties <lb/>
would be the means of reducing the consus.ption of such <lb/>
goods, he (Mr. Rorke) would say that it would be a <lb/>
great benefit to the country. But respecting the in­ <lb/>
treased duty on manufactured goods; so far as regarded <lb/>
our operative population, he did not apprehend the <lb/>
levenue would be increased by them. Look at Canada. <lb/>
He found there inanufactures of the articles we required, <lb/>
which, under confederation, would come in duty free. <lb/>
These manufactures hau much increased of late years, <lb/>
and now hanufactures from the United States were com­ <lb/>
ing in, on accoult of the distracted state of the country, <lb/>
i by the war, at d its enormous taxation. They <lb/>
had extensive woollen manufactures, manufactures of <lb/>
boots and shoes, and the manufactures of leatner were <lb/>
very extensive. Canada had long bº noted for its <lb/>
superior saddlery, which was not, however, of extensive <lb/>
demand here." But Canada leather was a good <lb/>
article, and our consumption of leatherware was large. <lb/>
He (Mir, Rorke) had samples of boots and shoes, from <lb/>
Quebec, last taſi, and he had compared them with our <lb/>
imports from England and other countries. and found <lb/>
them very much superior to rhat we were in the haoit <lb/>
ºf receiving from America, and fully equal to the Eng: <lb/>
lish, while the prices were moderate. Their leather and <lb/>
their castings were of as good a description as what came <lb/>
from England, and fully as cheap. He had no doub: <lb/>
that many other articles were produced in Canada that <lb/>
would suit us, and which would all come in duty tree. <lb/>
We all knew that when people were put to it, they <lb/>
readily actommodated themselves to circumstacces. We <lb/>
need not, therefore, be apprehensive that there would be <lb/>
any great difficulty in substituting the Canadian amanufacs <lb/>
ture for the British. He did not, therefore, apprehend <lb/>
that our taxation would, on the whole, be higher than <lb/>
now, and he believed that our fishermen would in many <lb/>
instances get better articles than they used now, aud <lb/>
equally cresp. Fiour and provisions were also abun­ <lb/>
'lant and cleap in Canada, and, when the Grand. Trunk <lb/>
lauway was completed to Halifax, could be received by <lb/>
is all the year round. This was an age of change, and <lb/>
the coufederation of small states into larger was occuring <lb/>
yearly, in Europe. He thought, taking the whole matter <lb/>
into consideration, that. Confederation would ultimately <lb/>
prove beneficial. He did not antiulpate any immediate <lb/>
enefit, nor did he suppose we would suffer any detrix <lb/>
ment, fºr he believed we woulu find that the revenue on <lb/>
the arucies we would receive duty free would balance <lb/>
the increase duty on the others; and then Canada <lb/>
ºffered an unlimited market for our pickled fish, while <lb/></p> 

<p>St. John's, Monday, March <lb/></p> 

<p>munication both with England and with Canada, and <lb/>
when that was accomplished, he believed it would work <lb/>
a greater benefit to this country than could, at present, <lb/>
be estimated. But some hon members were apprehensive <lb/>
that the federal parliament would tax our fish and oil.­ <lb/>
That could easily be guarded against, and he believed if <lb/>
delega'es were sent tº England on the snbject, we would <lb/>
get other. concessions. We were not similar to the <lb/>
other provinces, and that would be taken into considera­ <lb/>
tion. It was his firm belief that Confederation would <lb/>
alimately be of great benefit. He did not desire to <lb/>
influence others, but it was his belief that it would work <lb/>
beneficially for this country, and, therefore, he had much <lb/>
pleasure in supporting the resolutions moved by the hon <lb/>
leader of the government. <lb/>

already published in this Journal) <lb/>-->
    
    
    
<p rendition="simple:right">WEDNESDAY, Feb. 22.</p>
    
    
<p>The house met at three o'clock.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:SHEA1">Mr. E. D. SHEA</persName> presented a petition from the Revd. <lb/>
Kyran Walsh, Chairman of the Roman Catholic Board <lb/>
of Education at Harbor Main, which was received and <lb/>
read praying, that the R. C. school at Colliers should be <lb/>
placed under the direction of the Harbor Main Board. <lb/>
Also a petition from Samuel Case, Ferryman at Aquate<lb break="no"/>forte, which was received and read, praying for an increase <lb/>
of salary.</p>
    
    <p>
Ordered that the petition lie on the table.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:BARR3">Mr. BARRON</persName> presented a petition from John Ryan and <lb/>
others, of St. Mary's, Holyrood and Trepassey, which was <lb/>
received and read, praying for the establishment of a <lb/>
ferry at the North east arm of Trepassey. </p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:BARR3">Mr. BARRON</persName>, in moving that the petition lie on the ta<lb break="no"/>ble, said he knew the necessity for a ferry at that place, <lb/>
and hoped, when in committee of supply, that the peti<lb break="no"/>tion would be favourably considered.</p>
    
<p>
Ordered that the petition lie on the table.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">The SOLICITOR GENERAL</persName> presented a petition from <lb/>
James Dove and others, of Harbor Grace, which was <lb/>
received and read, praying for a grant of land for the <lb/>
purpose of a buying ground for the Wesleyans of that <lb/>
town.</p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">The SOLICITOR GENERAL</persName>, in moving that the petition <lb/>
lie on the table, would observe that the house had alroa<lb break="no"/>dy granted money for the purchase of burying ground for <lb/>
the members of the Church of England and for the Ca<lb break="no"/>tholics of Harbor Grace. The Wesleyans, who equally <lb/>
required a burying ground outside the town, now came <lb/>
forward and petitioned that similar provision should be <lb/>
made for them, . He was satisfied that the prayer of the <lb/>
petition would be readily acceded to by the house.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:MOOR3">Mr. MOORE</persName> was happy to support the player of that <lb/>
petition. Similar provision had been made for by all de<lb break="no"/>nominations in St. John's, and more recently the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Church of England and the Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lics of Harbor Grace were provided for. The Wesley­ <lb/>
ans were a numerous and repectable body, and they <lb/>
now petitioned for similar consideration, which he had <lb/>
no doubt the house would comply with. <lb/>
Ordered that the petition lie on the table.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:RORK1">Mr. RORKE</persName> presented a petition from Jonn Winterbo­ <lb/>
tham and others of Carbonear, wrich was received and <lb/>
eau, praying for a grant of land for a burying ground <lb/>
for the Wesleyans of that town. </p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:RORK1">Mr. RORKE</persName>, in moving that the petition lie on the ta<lb break="no"/>ble, would observe that, last session, when grants were <lb/>
made for the Church of Englanu and Roman Catholic <lb/>
burying grounds outside tee town of Harbor Grace, he <lb/>
stated that he supported these grants on the understan<lb break="no"/>ding hat the claim of Carbonear for similar consideration in <lb/>
should be recognized. The Wesleyans of that town were <lb/>
an old and respectable congregation, and this burying <lb/>
ground had for some years been so crowded as to endan<lb break="no"/>ger the health of those residing in its vicinity, and there <lb/>
was a necessity for its being closed, and a suitable bury<lb break="no"/>ing ground provided outside the town. After the grants <lb/>
alieady made to other places, he was satisfied that the <lb/>
petition would be favourably considered.</p>
    
    <p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">The hon RECEIVER GENERAL</persName> had much pleasure in <lb/>
supporting the prayer of that petition. He knew many <lb/>
of the petitioners intimately, and was aware that the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Wesleyan burying ground at Carbonear was alto<lb break="no"/>gether insufficient for the requirements of such a large <lb/>
body. Similar grants were made to St. John's and Har<lb break="no"/>bor Grace, and the claim of the petitioners to the same <lb/>
consideration would be admitted by hon members on <lb/>
both sides of the house.</p>
    
    <p>
Ordered that the petition lie on the table. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:RORK1">Mr. RORKE</persName>, also presented a petition from Nicholas <lb/>
Nichol, Postmaster of Carbonear, which was received <lb/>
and read, praving for an increase of salary.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:RORK1">Mr. RORKE</persName> in moving that the petition lie on the table <lb/>
would observe that the duties of the Postmaster of Car<lb break="no"/>bonear had been very much increased since the salary was <lb/>
fixed at its present amount, way offices had been establish<lb break="no"/>ed on the North Shore of Conception Bay and on the South <lb/>
Shore of Trinity Bay, to which he had to dispatch mails, <lb/>
and from which mails are received, and the local busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the office was also increased, so that the salary, <lb/>
which was sufficient a few years ago, was now inade<lb break="no"/>uate.</p>
    
    <p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">The SOLICITOR GENERAL</persName> thought that Post Master a <lb/>
very worthy person, and considered his remuneration <lb/>
very inadequate for the duties he had to perform. But <lb/>
he (S. Gen.) would observe that he had two years ago, <lb/>
presented a similar petition, from the Post Master of <lb/>
Harbor Grace, whose duties had much increased since <lb/>
the salaries were fixed for Harbor Grace, Carbonear and <lb/>
Brigus. Special mails were now received and dispach<lb break="no"/>ed on the arrival of the mail Packets from Halifax, and <lb/>
the system of money orders was also introduced, which <lb/>
had caused a great deal of additional duty which the <lb/>
Post Master had to perform, and for which he did not <lb/>
receive one penny. When he was appointed to the othce, <lb/>
he was merely to receive the mails from St. John's, and <lb/>
dispatch the return mails. The system had since been <lb/>
much extended. He (S. Gen) regretted the Post Mas<lb break="no"/>ter General was not in the house. He could testify <lb/>
to the efficiency of the Post Master at Harbor Grace, <lb/>
and the inadequacy of his salary. Harbor Grace was the <lb/>
only Post Office out of St. John's that paid its expenses, <lb/>
which was evidence of the extent of duty there compa<lb break="no"/>red with other offices.</p>
    
<p><persName ref="pers:RORK1">Mr. RORKE</persName> quite agreed with the Solicitor General, <lb/>
that the Post Mſ.ster at Harbor un ace was not sufficiently <lb/>
remunerated; but at present he would urge the prayer <lb/>
of that petit on on the favorable consideration of the house. <lb/>
Public servants, who performed their duty faithfully, <lb/>
should be properly remunerated.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:MOOR3">Mr. MOORE</persName> supported the claim of the Post Master <lb/>
of Harbor Grace for an increase of salary. His present <lb/>
salary was in no way adequate to the duties he nad to <lb/>
perform. These duties were increasing every year; and <lb/>
all he (Mr. Moore) wondered at, was now it was that he <lb/>
should have been kept so long doing such onerous duties <lb/>
at so inadequate a salary.</p>
    
    
<p><persName ref="pers:WINT1">Dr. WINTER</persName>—While he admitted the claims of the <lb/>
Post Masters of Harbor Grace and Carbonear to the <lb/>

would call attention to that of the Post Mistress at Trin<lb break="no"/>ity also to an increase of salary. Without desiring to <lb/>
prejudice the claims of others, he hoped that the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of Trinity would be taken into consideration, and <lb/>
adequate remuneration provided for its Post Mistress. <lb/>

The hon Acting Colonial Secretary, by command of his <lb/>

    <p>
On motion of the <persName ref="pers:CART5">hon ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>, pursuant <lb/>
to order of the day, the house resolved itself into Com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the whole on the further consideration of the <lb/>
Confederation of the British North American Colonies, <lb/>
Mr. Knight in the Chair. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:GLEN1">Mr. GLEN</persName> rose to say a few words on this important <lb/>
question, though, he felt much diffidence in saying so, <lb/>
after the very able speeches of the hon members, Mr. <lb/>
A Shea and the hon Attorney General. He would say <lb/>
those speeches would have been listened to with satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion, even if they had beer, delivered within the walls <lb/>
of the Imperial Parliament. He differed with them, <lb/>
however, on many points, and as he could not attempt <lb/>
to follow them in their aerial flights, so visionary and so <lb/>
speculative, he would address the house in a more prac<lb break="no"/>tical, and he believed, more trustworthy manner. With <lb/>
regard to the Report of our Delegates, as to the amount <lb/>
of money we are to receive, he would say that it was not <lb/>
correct. He told them so at an early stage of the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings; but they paid no attention to it. When, <lb/>
therefore an important document of that kind was pla<lb break="no"/>ced before the house and found incorrect, parties would, <lb/>
he thought, be cautious in putting much faith in any of <lb/>
their future statemen's, There were errors in <lb/>
the documents. He would only point out two of them, <lb/>
one of £500 for the Receiver General, which sum was <lb/>
already provided for in the appropriation for the Customs <lb/>
Department. So with the Post Office Department, they <lb/>
put down the whole expenditure, say £3.281, but gave <lb/>
no credit for £1000 revenue received by that department. <lb/>
After examining the financial details submitted by the <lb/>
Delegates I confess I am far from being satisfied with <lb/>
them. The tariff that will be introduced into Newfound<lb break="no"/>land will be the Canadian one, in my opinion a <lb/>
most oppressive tariff, 25 per cent on all wearing <lb/>
appareal, boots, shoes, &amp;c., and 20 per cent on all wool<lb break="no"/>lens, cottons, linen, leather, cordage, &amp;c., in short, a <lb/>
high protective tariff, to shut out, if possible, the cheap <lb/>
manufactures of Great Britain, in order to encourage <lb/>
their own manufactures. We want no protective tariff; <lb/>
what we require is to purchase our fishery supplies where<lb break="no"/>ever we can procure them at the cheapest rate, but <lb/>
Canada will not permit us to do so, if she can prevent it. <lb/>
Her high protective tariff, she expects, will keep out the <lb/>
cheap manufactures of Great Britain. Such an attempt <lb/>
I protest against as injurious to the interests of our fish<lb break="no"/>ing population, and of our fisheries. It is said the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian tariff will be reduced. Will any one believe it will <lb/>
be reduced after the confederation of the Provinces? <lb/>
In my opinion the tariff of duties must be raised higher, <lb/>
to provide for their vast expenditure, they must Support <lb/>
a large militia force, build fortifications, in fact the coun<lb break="no"/>try must be put in a plete state of defence, costing <lb/>
millions. Then their inter-colonial railroad, reconstruc<lb break="no"/>ting their canals, costing more millions, besides pro<lb break="no"/>viding for their future army, and navy. Taxation <lb/>
must, therefore, be iucreased as they must have a much <lb/>
larger revenue to meet their enormous expenditure. In <lb/>
fact the Canadian tariff of duties, was increased only last <lb/>
year, which does not look much like reducing their tariff. <lb/>
We will have to pay our proportion of all that vast outlay, <lb/>
but we'll receive no benefit whatever from it, and as the <lb/>
Canadian Government will, after the confederation, have <lb/>
the power of taxing Newfoundland by all the other modes <lb/>
and systems of taxation, I much fear, looking at their <lb/>
future vast expenditure, that Newfoundland wil be made <lb/>
to feel the power the General Government will have after <lb/>
the union of taxing us for ever. The power of taxing <lb/>
Newfoundland for ever, by all methods and systems, is <lb/>
in my opinion too great a power to give the Canadian <lb/>
Government. It has been said that manufactured <lb/>
goods will be imported into Newfoundland from Canada, <lb/>
and be sold cheaper than British goods as Canadian man<lb break="no"/>ufactures will be imported here free of duty. I do not <lb/>
believe it, for this reason, that British manufactures are <lb/>
imported largely ($16,000,000 last year) into Canada, <lb/>
notwithstanding their high productive tariff of 25 and 20 <lb/>
per cent, and can undersell them in their own market. <lb/>
Now if they cannot compete with British manufactures, <lb/>
how can British goods be kept out of Newfoundland, <lb/>
when Canadian manufactures will be subject to the addi<lb break="no"/>tional expense of freight, insurance, commission, &amp;c. It is <lb/>
evident that British goods will be better able to compete <lb/>
with Canadian goods in Newfoundland; and as British <lb/>
manufactures are sold cheaper than those of Canada in <lb/>
their own inaiket, it follows they will also be sold cheaper <lb/>
in Newfoundland, notwithstanding the high protective <lb/>
duty of 25 and 20 per cent. It is also clear that we will <lb/>
have to pay those oppressive taxes; and the misfor<lb break="no"/>tune is, the increased revenue will go for Canadian im<lb break="no"/>provements. I do not like the idea of being a party <lb/>
to a protective and hostile tarif agilist Great Britain, <lb/>
our best friends, and certainly our only protectors. It <lb/>
does not look well. It may be all very well for Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans and Canadians to do so, but for Newfoundlanders to <lb/>
act in that manner would be most ungrateful. Besides <lb/>
there is the ridicule of the thing, that of submitting to a <lb/>
tariff at the command of Canada, not only hostile to <lb/>
    Great Britain, but a protective taritſ, "<hi rendition="simple:italic">with nothing to <lb/>
protect</hi>." I would rather have a hostile tariff against Canada <lb/>
than against Great Britain. As I said oefore, we know <lb/>
them as our best friends, and our only protectors, in the <lb/>
hour of danger. What does Mr. Gladstone say about <lb/>
these protective tariffs? He says, "We have given to <lb/> our colonies practical freedom. I am not prepared to <lb/>
say that we have not something to rectify on the other<lb/>
side of the account. We observe a disposition on the <lb/>
part of some colonies calling themselves our own, to set <lb/>
up against the industry and productions of England, the <lb/>
mischiefs and obstructions of an exploded productive <lb/>
system." Now, I say again, I object to being a party <lb/>
to the mischleis, and o structions of an exploded pro<lb break="no"/>tective system, Newfoundland having nothing to protect, <lb/>
our annual expenditure, taking the average of the last <lb/>
eight years, is £113000 stg. The General Government <lb/>
of Canada give us £112,000 stg., so that we nave less <lb/>
by £1,000 than the amount required to pay our average <lb/>
expenditure. What a miserable bargain for Newfound<lb break="no"/>land; and for any improvements we may require in <lb/>
future, we must get them by direct taxation, as the <lb/>
General Government have told us that they will give us <lb/>
no further assistance, beyond the £112,000. Now is <lb/>
it fair that we should only receive £112,990 stg. whilst <lb/>
they would collect from us, under the Canadian tarif, <lb/>
at a very moderate calculation, £145,000 stg.> (The <lb/> 

<cb/>

actual amount by the Customs Returns is £160,000 stg.) <lb/>
—We would send them annually £33,000, and <lb/>
in ten years they would receive from us the large <lb/>
amount of £330,000 stg. What improvements we could <lb/>
make in Newfoundland wih such a revenue. The road <lb/>
and education grants we could then give would benefit <lb/>
our country to a great extent; and every one that <lb/>
wished would get constant employment. But, unfortu<lb break="no"/>nately, all that large revenue abstracted from us, will be <lb/>
sent off to Canada, and Newfoundland would be left <lb/>
lamenting over such a bargain. The principal question <lb/>
after all is what effect the Confederation will have on <lb/>
our fisheries and fishermen, for the very existence of <lb/>
every one in Newfoundland, from the highest to the <lb/>
lowest, depends, on our fisheries. It is true, our <lb/>
fisheries have been unsuccessful of late years, and <lb/>
great distress prevails amongst our fishermen and <lb/>
others throughout the Colony. But it has not <lb/>
yet been shown by any one how joining the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion will benefit our fisheries, or how it will relieve our <lb/>
fishermen from their distressed condition. In my opin<lb break="no"/>ion, joining the Confederation on the terms proposed, <lb/>
will add to thei distress, by the great increase of taxa<lb break="no"/>tion, particularly as they will derive no benefit whatever <lb/>
from the additional taxes imposed upon them, as the <lb/>
revenue received from these taxes will all be sent off to <lb/>
Canada. I have no objections to taxation if the revenue <lb/>
was spent in Newfoundirnd, for the benefit of our own <lb/>
people, but I have every objection when the revenue <lb/>
will be carried away, for the benefit of the Canadians. <lb/>
I notice by the Canadian tariff, that French fish will be <lb/>
admitted free into Newfoundland. Our fishermen <lb/>
cannot compete with the bounty-protected fishermen of <lb/>
France. For every quintal of fish they will sand into <lb/>
our market they will receive a large bounty of eight or <lb/>
nine shillings per quintal. Our fishermen receive no <lb/>
bounty. They will therefore be undersold in their own <lb/>
market; and I believe this will complete the ruin of our <lb/>
fishing population. This was guarded against, as the <lb/>
Hon Attorney General is aware of, by placing a duty of <lb/>
five shillings per quintal on foreign salted fish. The <lb/>
reason for doing so was that we could not compete <lb/>
with French fish, unless the French Government gave <lb/>
up their system of bounties. They will not give up the <lb/>
bounty on fish, therefore we put on a duty of five shillings <lb/>
per quintal to protect our fishermen. The Canadian <lb/>
tariff will leave our fishermen unprotected. Such will <lb/>
be the effect to Newfoundland, if she joins the union. <lb/>
And will any one favorable to the Confederation say we <lb/>
ought not to have better terms than are now offered us, <lb/>
and perfect security for all our reasonable demands<lb/>
before we think at all of joining the Confederation?<lb/>
What a mess we would have been placed in had the <lb/>
Legislature affirmed the Resolutions of the Quebec <lb/>
Delegates, as was contemplated by some of our Repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives. We must have better terms; and every <lb/>
reasonable security we ought to have. No promise of <lb/>
what the General Government intend to do should <lb/>
satisfy us.- Every thing should be put in the New Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. No pledge, no promise, should be taken on <lb/>
such a subject as this. Scotland made terms before <lb/>
entering into the Union with England, and was benefitted <lb/>
by it. Ireland made terms, but took the word of the <lb/>
Government, that, if she joined the Union, Catholic <lb/>
emancipation would at the same time be granted. Ireland <lb/>
was deceived; she joined the Union, but Catholic <lb/>
emancipation was refused although the English Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had pledged themselves to grant it. So much for <lb/>
trusting to promises, and it was only through the exer<lb break="no"/>tions, many years afterwards, of Daniel O'Connell, that <lb/>
Catholic emancipation was granted to Ireland, from fear <lb/>
of a rebellion- what was refused to the justice of the <lb/>
case. If Newfoundlaud trusts to promises and fine <lb/>
speeches, we will be looking, in a few years, for another <lb/>
Daniel O'Connell. What do we actually receive from <lb/>
the General Government by the resolutions agreed to at <lb/>
the Conference of Delegates at Quebec, forming the <lb/>
bases of the proposed Confederation? All Newfound<lb break="no"/>land is to receive is £112,000 stg. Nothing more. <lb/>
And what does Newfoundland actually give up to the <lb/>
General Government? 1st. She gives up her revenue <lb/>
under the Canadian tariff of £145,000 to £160,000 stg. <lb/>
2-yd. She gives up all her ungranted Lands, Mines and <lb/>
Minerals.-3rd. She gives up to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, the power of making laws for us.-4th. <lb/>
She gives the General Government of Canada the power <lb/>
to regulate our fisheries.—5th. She gives the General <lb/>
Government the power of taxing our fish and oil.–6th. <lb/>
She gives them the power of raising money in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land by all modes and system of taxation,-7th. French <lb/>
fish, with eight shillings bounty, will be admitted free <lb/>
into Newfoundland, to the injury of our fishermen. Will <lb/>
any one in Newfoundland say, we ought to join the Con<lb break="no"/>federation on such terms as these? I should think not. <lb/>
We must, in my opinion, have better terms, not only as <lb/>
to money matters, as we receive nothing in comparison to <lb/>
the amount they will get from us; we should also <lb/>
have the sole control of our fisheries, without any refer<lb break="no"/>ence the Canadian Government. We should allow no <lb/>
taxes to be imposed on us whatever in Newfoundland. <lb/>
The tax on imports we cannot avoid, if we join the <lb/>
union, as there must, of course, be a general tariff of <lb/>
import duties for the whole Confederation. But we pay <lb/>
    "<hi rendition="simple:italic">double per head in Newfoundlanand</hi>" to want they do in <lb/>
Canada of import duties. Why should Newfoundland, a <lb/>
poor country, pay double import duties, as compared with <lb/>
Canada, which is said to be a rich country, and receive no <lb/>
fair equivalent? This is not just or fair. To enter the <lb/>
Confederation on the resolutions agreed to at the Quebec <lb/>
conference, would, in my opinion, be ruinous to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and I hope it will not be agreed to. Let us <lb/>
at least have fair terms, without perfect security I think we <lb/>
should not enter the union. No one in Newfoundland <lb/>
would, I think for a monent agree to join the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, on the ruinous terms proposed by the Delegates at <lb/>
the conference at Quebec, on the 10th October, 1864. <lb/>
    The hon member, Mr. Shea, based his calculations on <lb/>
the tariff of 1863, because it, answered his purpose, as <lb/>
the revenue that year was only £94,000, instead of tak<lb break="no"/>ing the year 1864, which was a fair average of our re<lb break="no"/>venue for the last 9 years, being a little over £100,030. <lb/>
His friend Mr. Galt, of Canada, acted differently. He <lb/>
does not like to take 1863 for the basis of his calculations, <lb/>
as there was a deliciency in the account of amount a mil<lb break="no"/>lion of dollars. So 1893 would dot do for him; he likes <lb/>
    1864 better, as he had a surpius that year <hi rendition="simple:italic">for the first <lb/>
time.</hi> So you see how cunningly the two great finan<lb break="no"/>cers, manage with the years 1863 and 1864. Mr. Galt <lb/>
says let us take 1864 for the basis of our calculations, <lb/>
as I have a Surplus revenue that year for the first time, <lb/>
and it will look vetter than taking 1863, when there was <lb/>
a deficiency. It may answer you to take 1864 for your <lb/>
basis of calculations, but it will not answer me, says <lb/>
the hon member, Mr. A. Shea; for if I take 1864 for <lb/>
my basis I will snow an increase of duties of £60,000 <lb/>
stg. No I must take 1863, to show a less amount of <lb/>
taxation. The hon member puts down £10,000, as an <lb/>
asset for steam communication from Canada to Great <lb/>
Britain, (calling at Newfoundland.) There is no <lb/>

<fw type="running">THE NEWFOUNDLANDER.</fw>

guarantee in the Quebec resolutions for anything of the <lb/>
kind, he has assumed £10,000 as an asset, on a mere <lb/>
promise, which is really absurd; and shows he is unable <lb/>
to make a statement that would oe satisfactory to this <lb/>
house. He therefore, is obliged to have recourse to the <lb/>
delusion of making the £10,000 appear as an asset, and <lb/>
on the simple promise of so me one (of course of hign <lb/>
standing,) in Canada. I say nothing is to whether the <lb/>
steam communication, when we get it, would be really <lb/>
worth £10,000 to this country. So we might think <lb/>
    £10,000 could be better appropriated. I merely wish to <lb/>
    state that putting down in his statement £10,000 <hi rendition="simple:italic">as an <lb/>
asset</hi>, on a promise that steam communication may be <lb/>
granted us by Canada, is a delusion of a kind that I real<lb break="no"/>ly think will not take in any one. The hon member <lb/>
says, the amount of duty (£7004) that would be co<lb break="no"/>lected on Bread under the Canadian tariff, is a mis<lb break="no"/>take, as he has Mr. Galt's word that bread will be put <lb/>
down in the next tariff in the free list. I can only say <lb/>
that by the present Canadian tariff, bread is subject to a <lb/>
duty of 20 per cent. Mr. Galt also informs the house <lb/>
member by telegraph that the Canadian tariff will be <lb/>
revised to the satisfaction of the Lower Provinces. <lb/>
These fine promises do not suit us. I have no doubt <lb/>
they were thought sufficient by Mr. Galt to make us <lb/>
jump into the union at once. When all the fine promises <lb/>
and persuasive speeches failed to make us see the beauties <lb/>
of the confederation, on the terms agreed to at the <lb/>
Quebec conference, the hon member threatened us with <lb/>
the high displeasure of the British Government, that we <lb/>
would be left without any protection, and of course, be <lb/>
a prey to any power that might wish to take possession <lb/>
of our country. I do not believe that Great Britain will <lb/>
refuse to continue her protection to Newfound and. She <lb/>
will not feel insulted at our desire to obtain better terms <lb/>
before entering the confederation. " In all probability <lb/>
Newfoundland will be the last place of America, where the <lb/>
British flag will wave." Such is my opinion, I will now <lb/>

the scheme. The Goverument appointed two dele<lb break="no"/>gates to the Conference held at Quebec on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion; and be must say that they did their work well <lb/>
there, and represented the country efficiently , and <lb/>
both the hon members, Mr. Shea and the hon Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General, made excellent speeches in support of <lb/>
the measure. He regretted the course which was <lb/>
rendered necessary for him to adopt, as he differed <lb/>
entirely from these hon gentlemen. It was for the <lb/>
supporters of confederation to show what were its <lb/>
advantages, and it was for us, who differ in opinion <lb/>
from them to show the fallacy of their reasoning. The <lb/>
hon member, Mr. Shea, had endeavoured to prove <lb/>
that we would derive great benefit f on the proposed <lb/>
connexion with the confederate provinces; and the <lb/>
supporters of the proposition, who appear to be in <lb/>
extacies with what they call a grand idea, would in<lb break="no"/>duce us to believe that, by its adoption, this country <lb/>
would be largely benefitted. One would suppose, <lb/>
from the picture painted by them,that a howling wilder<lb break="no"/>ness would be turned into a garden of Eden—a Para<lb break="no"/>dise, but he thought it would be a Paradise lost— <lb/>
that we would have a little Heaven here below; and <lb/>
be, in all times to come in a perfect state of beatifi<lb break="no"/>cation. But he (S. Gen.) could not see all these <lb/>
good things in the same light as some hon gentlemen <lb/>
did, but regarded the scheme as one calculated to do <lb/>
much injury to the country, and now proposed to <lb/>
argue his side of the case with hon gentlemen. No <lb/>
doubt the connexion would be beneficial to New <lb/>
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, which were contiguous <lb/>
to Canada; but our condition is very different, and <lb/>
the rule , which may apply to them may be most <lb/>
prejudical to us. If we were connected with Canada <lb/>
by land, we could avail ourselves of the advantages <lb/>
which would result to us from her railways, ber man<lb break="no"/>ufactures, and her public institutions, but being <lb/>
isolated as we are, and in effect, farther from Canada <lb/>
    

<cb/>

than from England; the case is very different. It is a <lb/>
fact that we can go to England almost every day, <lb/>
whilst, for at least, four months of the year Canada is <lb/>
inaccessible to us except through the United States; <lb/>
and in summer we have very little intercourse or bu<lb break="no"/>siness with that country, compared with what we have <lb/>
with England. We are at present connected with <lb/>
Britain by the most tender ties—we are her sons— <lb/>
she is the home of our forefathers—we are one of her <lb/>
oldest and most Inyal colonies; and he (S.Gen.) would <lb/>
not be one of thase who would adopt a course cal<lb break="no"/>culated evidently to make us independent of that <lb/>
great nation, and estrange her maternal affections <lb/>
from us. A great deal had been said about the ex<lb break="no"/>isting distress of this colony—that we have re<lb break="no"/>sources not availed of, which might be developed, <lb/>
and which would afford employment to our peo<lb break="no"/>ple; and this has been urged as a reason for our en<lb break="no"/>tering into the union. But whilst he admitted that <lb/>
there was much distress at present, and that the coun<lb break="no"/>try was not in that prosperous and wholesome con<lb break="no"/>dition, that might be desired, yet the supporters of <lb/>
Confederation had failed to show how the proposed <lb/>
scheme world remedy these evils, how annexation to <lb/>
Canada would make the country more prosperous, <lb/>
while notoriously great evils would result from the <lb/>
connection. There must ne a great increase of taxa<lb break="no"/>tion,to defray the necessary expenditure of the con<lb break="no"/>federation; but how we should receive commen<lb break="no"/>surate benefit from our connection with Canada, had <lb/>
not been shown to his satisfaction. Hon. gentlemen <lb/>
say—" Our people are poor and in distress. Allow <lb/>
us to tax them some £50 or £60,000 per annum more <lb/>
than at present—to abolish our Legislature—to hand <lb/>
over the right of universal taxation to Canada—in <lb/>
fact, to yield up ourselves and our country, and that <lb/>
    will be a <hi rendition="simple:italic">panacea</hi> for all our ills. He (S. Gen.) did <lb/>
not see how the poverty of our people would be les<lb break="no"/>sened by further taxation, or now we were to improve <lb/>
by yielding up our birthrignt. We are told that facto<lb break="no"/>ries would rise and that sources of employment for <lb/>
our people would be opened up; but it was only as<lb break="no"/>sumption, that by going into Confederatiou we would <lb/>
possess these institutions, whilst it is a fact, that if we <lb/>
dared, in our Legislature, to tax the people to the ex<lb break="no"/>tent proposed by the Confederation, we would our. <lb/>
selves have the means of fostering and encouraging <lb/>
all those institutions which would give employment <lb/>
to the labouring classes, at that season of the year <lb/>
when such is required. The hon, member, Mr. Shea, <lb/>
said that entering into the Confederation we would <lb/>
have a line of steamers to Montreal, or some other <lb/>
Canadian port; and that the Canadian steamers, to <lb/>
and from England, would call here; but he (s. Gen.) <lb/>
did not see that in the Resolutions of the Conference. <lb/>
This too was assumption.—Another great benefit to <lb/>
flow from Confederation was, that we were to have <lb/>
eight members in the Federal House of Commons, <lb/>
and all our young men who could not find employ<lb break="no"/>ment here to their satisfaction, could go to them, <lb/>
and they would procure situations for them in <lb/>
Canada, and that our people would find employ<lb break="no"/>ment on the railroad which was to connect Ca<lb break="no"/>nada and New Brunswick with the port of Halifax. <lb/>
If it could be stown that manufacturing capitalists <lb/>
would come amongst us and establish factories—that <lb/>
    new resources would be opened to us <hi rendition="simple:italic">in our own <lb/>
country</hi> which would give employment to our increas<lb break="no"/>ing population, it would be something; but to say <lb/>
that we would by benefited by our people leaving us, <lb/>
and the country being depopulated, was to him inex<lb break="no"/>plicable, and an argument which he did not under<lb break="no"/>stand. We were told by the advocates of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of these advantages, but he could not see them <lb/>
whilst its disadvantages were certain. This House is <lb/>
the guardian of our public rights. Let us go into <lb/>
confederation, and what would we have to look to?<lb/>
The privilege of governing ourselves would be trans<lb break="no"/>ferred into other hands, and gone from us. He (Sol. <lb/>
Gen) believed this discussion about Confederation had <lb/>
inspired the people with more confidence in the House <lb/>
of Assembly, as the guardian of their rights, his <lb/>
House was looked to to maintain the rights of the <lb/>
people of Newfoundland. If we entered into, the pro<lb break="no"/>posed Confederation, they would be gone. We would <lb/>
have no independent Legislature; and what could <lb/>
eight men sent to Canada do to protect our interests? <lb/>
We had thirty members in this Assembly, of whom <lb/>
seven were residents in the outposts; and what influ<lb break="no"/>ence had they? They had been urging morning meet<lb break="no"/>ings of the house, so as to get though with the pub<lb break="no"/>lic business to a reasonable time, that they might go <lb/>
home to attend o their own private affairs; but they <lb/>
could not carry it. The St. John's men were too pow<lb break="no"/>erful for them. They attended to their business during <lb/>
tne day, and came to the house after dinner; and it <lb/>
any member had anything of interest to attract him <lb/>
in the evening, there was an early adjournment, and <lb/>
the outport members had to submit. if the voice of <lb/>
7 members in 30 has such slight effect, what influence <lb/>
would 8 members have in a House of 194, to protect <lb/>
our interest in Canada? If confederation, was carried <lb/>
out, this House would become a nudity, and we would <lb/>
have the representatives of Canada, New Brunswick <lb/>
and Nova Scotia legislating for us and making us at <lb/>
their will, for our 8 members could only offer a feeble <lb/>
resistance to what they might disapprove of. At pre<lb break="no"/>sent we are legislating in the face of our constituents, <lb/>
having an election every four years; and if we oppress <lb/>
them or overtax them they can supply our places wish <lb/>
those men worthy of their confidence. But it we <lb/>
united with Canada we would have no redress, for <lb/>
Canada would make our laws and do with us as she <lb/>
pleased. What influence would 8 men have to pre<lb break="no"/>vent our taxation being doubled? At present our im<lb break="no"/>port duties are about 13 per cent in the aggregate. <lb/>
The duties in Canada are 20 per cent; and when Con<lb break="no"/>federation is carried out there will be an assimilation <lb/>
of tariffs, as is admitted, and that would add 50 per <lb/>
cent, to our present taxation, as had been snown by <lb/>
the hon member Mr Glen. What was the object of <lb/>
England in recommending Confederation for Canada? <lb/>
Was it not that she might be relieved from <lb/>
the expense of detending that province, which involved <lb/>
a heavy expenditure? And  would not the military <lb/>
protection of Newfoundland be discontinued by Eng<lb break="no"/>land, if we entered into the union? And would they <lb/>
not have an army and a navy to provide ior the pro<lb break="no"/>tection of the confederated Colonies? And still, we <lb/>
are told of a reduction to be effected in the existing <lb/>
tariff of Canada. In place of reduction, that taxation <lb/>
must be raised 100 per cent. And how will it be <lb/>
raised? The Quebec Resolutions answer that ques<lb break="no"/>tion. They give unlimited powers of taxation to the <lb/>
federal government and legislature. They could tax <lb/>
our fish, our oil, our houses, lands, horses and carts, <lb/>
and all other property, and we could not resist. <lb/>
Besides, they are to have full control over our fisher<lb break="no"/>ies. How would our fishermen and planters like that? <lb/>
But then we were to give up to the federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment all our ungranted Crown lands, with our mines <lb/>
and minerals,and we had a gentleman from Canada last <lb/>
summer examining our mineral resources. We did <lb/>
not well know what they were; but Canada seemed <lb/>
to know well, for part of the bargain was that we were <lb/>
to give up our mines and minerals to then. He (S. <lb/>
Gen) spoke of these matters as he believed them. This <lb/>
was his native country; and if he thought it would <lb/>
be benefited by confederation he would go into it. He <lb/>
had a large family, and it he thought it would promote <lb/>
their welfare he would gladly embrace it. But he <lb/>
could not see that the proposed union would benefit <lb/>
    
    <cb/>

this country, but the reverse. There was another <lb/>
matter. It was said that England would continue to <lb/>
extend to this country a helping hand. There may <lb/>
be no doubt of that. Still there would be a disruption <lb/>
of those maternal ties that bind Great Britain to this <lb/>
her most ancient Colony. At present we have Eng<lb break="no"/>land and her army to protect us. who are her chil<lb break="no"/>dren, and if a foreign foe touched a rock of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, England would immediately demand reparation <lb/>
for it. It might be said that we will still have her <lb/>
protection; yet if so, she would be removed from us <lb/>
in feeling, and in course of time, she may be altoge<lb break="no"/>ther estranged from us. It was said that the people <lb/>
of England complained of the cost of protecting the <lb/>
colonies, and that they must get rid of the burden; <lb/>
that Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and all the other <lb/>
colonies must provide for their own defence, or pay <lb/>
for the troops employed in their protection. Well, <lb/>
he did not say that it was unreasonable that we should <lb/>
pay our proportion of the military defence of the <lb/>
empire, if required, including, of course, the colonies. <lb/>
He did not suppose our share of it, according to <lb/>
population, would exceed £5,000 a year; but if it <lb/>
were twice that amount, he would rather pay it than <lb/>
incur the burthen that would be entailed on us by <lb/>
Confederation. And besides, Canada and the United <lb/>
States are contiguous; and we do no know the mo<lb break="no"/>ment when there may be war with the United States <lb/>
or some other power when we would have to bear <lb/>
our proportion of the cost of the war, whatever <lb/>
it might come too; and if troops were called for, for <lb/>
the protection of the Canadian frontier, we would <lb/>
have to proceed to its defence, as was the case now in <lb/>
the United States, where the citizens throughout the <lb/>
union were drafted, and had to join the army. If we <lb/>
united with Canada, and there should be war with the <lb/>
United States or any other power, we would be sub<lb break="no"/>jected to the draft tor the defence of Canada, and go <lb/>
we must. Hon. gentlemen had stated that we must <lb/>
enter into the Confederation, whether we would or <lb/>
not. He did not see anything in the correspondence <lb/>
to shew that there would be any compulsion. England <lb/>
did not desire that we should join, if we did not wish <lb/>
it. The other Provinces took up the question, and <lb/>
were about to hold a conference, which we were in<lb break="no"/>vited to join; and the Attorney General said we should <lb/>
send Delegates to see what was going on, and in<lb break="no"/>structed them to da nothing binding on this colony. <lb/>
We have now their report; and it is quite another <lb/>
matter to become parties to its terms. We were <lb/>
never requested by the British Government to take <lb/>
part in these proceedings, nor by the colonies, until <lb/>
we invited ourselves. And because Canada and New <lb/>
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, which are contiguous to <lb/>
each other, are about to confederate, ought we, who <lb/>
are 600 miles distant from the nearest point, to <lb/>
join the union, if we do not consider it for our inter<lb break="no"/>est to do so? If he (S. Gen.) were a representative <lb/>
of Nova Scotia he would go for the union. But <lb/>
although Nova Scotia would be benefited, still he <lb/>
found by the newspapers of that Province that there <lb/>
was much difference of opinion on the question, and <lb/>
that New Brunswick was also against it.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:SHEA1">Mr. SHEA</persName>—The hon gentleman should be careful <lb/>
as to the accuracy of his statements. Mr. Tilly, the <lb/>
premier of New Brunswick, was confident there would <lb/>
be a large majority in the Assembly of that Province <lb/>
for confederation.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">The SOLICITOR GENERAL</persName> –One thing was certain, <lb/>
if New Brunswick was not against it, at all events she <lb/>
was not for it; and Prince Edward Island was decid<lb break="no"/>edly against it, while that island was much nearer the <lb/>
other provinces than Newfoundland; and as to this <lb/>
colony it was evident that with the exception of a few <lb/>
who expected to benefit by it, confederation was un<lb break="no"/>favourably regarded. So far as his vote went he was <lb/>
inclined to remain as we are at present, for he did not <lb/>
think confederation with Canada would improve our <lb/>
circumstances, but on the contrary would be the cause <lb/>
of oppossing our people with heavy burthens. He <lb/>
would rather be the tail of England than the tail of <lb/>
Canada; and living been born under the flag which <lb/>
had braved for a thousand years the battle and the <lb/>
breeze, he hoped to live and die under it.</p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:MARC3">Mr. MARCH</persName> must congratulate this House and the <lb/> country on the Resolution proposed by the hon Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General, complying as it did witn the unanimous<lb/>
voice of the people. The people had been called wood<lb break="no"/>en heads and chowder heads by an hon member of <lb/>
this house, as if they were not capable of giving an <lb/>
opinion on a great question like this. If they felt no <lb/>
interest in it, who did? They were bound to this <lb/>
country by the strongest of ties. Their fathers had <lb/>
died to establish its liberty, and he (Mr March) would <lb/>
never consent, while a drop of British blood ran in his <lb/>
veins, to yield up this country. which was one day <lb/>
bound to be the most flourishing on the ocean, to a <lb/>
parcel of Johnny Crapeaus or Dutch Canadians. We <lb/>
were now part of the glorious British Empire; we <lb/>
lived under the sway of our beloved sovereign Queen <lb/>
Victoria, upon whose dominions the sun never sets. <lb/>
Were we to leave the flag that had braved a thousand <lb/>
years the battle and the breeze; be separated from the <lb/>
glorious Empire of Britain, and place on a sandy, <lb/>
muddy, tickety foundation? He (Mr March) indig<lb break="no"/>nantly protested against any such spoliation of our <lb/>
liberties. Hon gentlemen call this clap-trap. It was <lb/>
no clap-trap—it was as true as Holy Writ. He had <lb/>
a duty to discharge to his country, and he would <lb/>
fearlessly and honesty discharge it. He would defy <lb/>
any man to say he was wrong. He endorsed every <lb/>
word that had fallen from the hon members, Mr Glen <lb/>
and Mr Hayward.—Although they had not spoken <lb/>
three hours, they had thrown a deal of light on the <lb/>
subject, and had taken the part of honest man who <lb/>
had the welfare of their country at heart. He <lb/>
knew very well that if the delegates had not <lb/>
been , feasted and gormandized in Canada, they <lb/>
would have never signed that Report. Why, <lb/>
if any of us got muddled, we would not know <lb/>
what we were about. Who will deny that? None of <lb/>
us was infallible. Human nature was frail. One <lb/>
great man might be deceived. Aye, even two of <lb/>
them. What would become of the country if the <lb/>
wooden heads did not brave the dangers of the deep­ <lb/>
if they did not run out,like so many squirrels, over the <lb/>
rotten ice, and bring in their big loads of fat?– He <lb/>
regretted that any disparagement had been thrown on <lb/>
them. This is a question we would all differ on. <lb/>
Honour to the Attorney General, the star of this coun<lb break="no"/>try;—The bench shall be honoured by him. If we <lb/>
went into this Confederation and a war took place <lb/>
with America, our best men would have to fight their <lb/>
battles. He well knew that Canada had been a night<lb break="no"/>mare to the British Government, and a drain on her <lb/>
treasury. They say that the time had come when she <lb/>
should bear part of the cost of her military defence. <lb/>
Look at the immense sum of money it would take to <lb/>
fortify Canada; and how could she defend herself <lb/>
without means? She was now almost insolvent, and <lb/>
wanted to pounce on Newfoundland like a hungry cat, <lb/>
and seize her teeming wealth—her milions of money, <lb/>
which were annually drawn from her waters, and re<lb break="no"/>plenish her own exhausted treasury with it. Was this <lb/>
country to be bartered away for a mess of pottage? <lb/>
When the old Government had their seven years of <lb/>
plenty, what did they do with it? Did they, like <lb/>
Joseph in Egypt, lay it up? Look at our great <lb/>
Northern Route; why, there is land there equal to any <lb/>
in the world; and if the dogs were destroyed, and the <lb/>
people encouraged to rear sheep, we would have our <lb/>
woolen manufactories scattered throughout the land, <lb/>
        

<cb/>

giving employment to the people, and providing them<lb/>
with cheap raiment. Our country could rise like a Phoe<lb break="no"/>nix from its ashes, and amid wealth, happiness and<lb/>
prosperity, blossom like the rose. He had this from<lb/>
Mr. Howe's lips himself, the greatest statesman on <lb/>
this side of the Atlantic. Look at the Scotch farmers <lb/>
who had left Nova Scotia, and settled at the Bay of<lb/>
Islands, were there was fine land, with immense timber, <lb/>
no dogs to worry the cattle or destroy the sheep. And <lb/>
was this country to be sacrificed for a paltry £112,000<lb/>
a year? Never, the people would go to the cannon's <lb/>
mouth before they submitted to such a think. What <lb/>
good were we to derive from railroads, their canals, &amp;c? <lb/>
The country was not asleep to these things. There <lb/>
was no use thus to throw dust into the eyes of the<lb/>
public. We wanted no hungry lawyers to guide us <lb/>
in this matter. Common sense and honesty was all<lb/>
that was required to carry on the Government. We <lb/>
had our old mother England to protect us, with the <lb/>
milk of human kindness in her heart. Did she ever <lb/>
make serfs of us? No, her glory was to watch over<lb/>
and protect us. He (Mr. March) would settle this<lb/>
matter, supposing he had to go to London at once.- <lb/>
Two or three years ago it was stated by men who <lb/>
now make speeches of two or three hours in length, <lb/>
that if we had only steam communication with Brit<lb break="no"/>ain, this country would be turned into a land of Go<lb break="no"/>shen at once. Well, we had the Galway line, and <lb/>
what good resulted from it? What had we to pay<lb/>
for it? No less than £8,000 a year. They brought <lb/>
the scum of society into this country, who, with their<lb/>
bag pipes, danced their horn-pipes on the water pipes, <lb/>
and we had to pay the piper. Facts are stubborn <lb/>
things, and under this Confederation, if we had steam <lb/>
communication, we would have to pay for it. Do you <lb/>
think that if we have this confederation, capitalists <lb/>
will come here and spread their money broad cast over <lb/>
the country? It was a delusion, a mockery and a <lb/>
humbug. If rich men wanted to come here, they <lb/>
could come now; and Confederation was not going to <lb/>
bring them. What object under heaven had he (Mr. <lb/>
March) but what would tend to benefit his native <lb/>
country? He remembered when 800 men were sent<lb/>
from this to Canada; to fight , and how many re<lb break="no"/>turned; Why poor old Billy Boggs and Johnny Mar<lb break="no"/>tin. It was well for us to ponder what was in store <lb/>
for us. He would tell the house what would raise the <lb/>
country out of its present depressed condition. Let <lb/>
us pass an Act to prevent the sale of bait to the <lb/>
French. That was what ruined our fisheries. If they <lb/>
could get no bait from us, they would be unable to <lb/>
prevent the fish from coming in upon our shores. <lb/>
He (Mr. March) heartily concurred in the Resolution <lb/>
before the house. <lb/></p>

<p>ST. JOHI.Y'S: <lb/>
MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1865. <lb/></p> 

<p>ON Thursday last in the Assembly there was a flood <lb/>
of Petitions presented, numbering not fewer than seven <lb/>
thousand signatures, praying that legislation be ap­ <lb/>
plied to the checking of the vice of intemperance in <lb/>
this country and after a good deal had been said in <lb/>
the way of eulogium of the efforts of the temperance <lb/>
Sºcieties, the Receiver General notified his intention <lb/>
to introduce a measure to meet the view of the peti­ <lb/>
tioners. <lb/>
Mr. MARCH moved the second reading of a Bill to <lb/>
amend the present Herring Fishery Act. The object <lb/>
of Mr. MAitch's amendment was identical with that <lb/>
proposed by Mr. WHITE in the Council last session <lb/>
—the repeal of that clause of the Act which forbids the <lb/>
barring of Herring. The House generally were of <lb/>
opinion that there has not yet been sufficient opportu­ <lb/></p> 

<p>nity of testing the law as it s'ands, and there being no <lb/>
evidence fnrnished by petitions or otherwise of its <lb/>
injurious operation, Mr. MARCH's motion was mega­ <lb/>
tived by a large majority. <lb/>
Bills were then introduced—by Mr. Parsox's, for <lb/>
the erection of a Light House on Cape St. Francis, <lb break="no"/>by Mr. PRowse, for the erection of a Light House <lb/>
on the Western coast of the island,-hy Mr. Resoup, <lb/>
for the amendment of the Act regulating the sale of <lb/>
Provisions, &amp;c, by Mr. Saga to provide for construc­ <lb/>
tion of two Bridges on Placentia main Road, -by Mr. <lb/>
PBowse, to regulate the Homestead law, and by the <lb/>
ArtoRNEY GENERAL, for retiring allowance to Chief <lb/>
Justice Beady. <lb/></p> 

<p>After which, there was an adjournment to this day. <lb/>
We remarked last week that the winds and weather <lb/>
here were such as inspired much hope for the success <lb/>
of the Seal fishery. We are very glad to be enabled <lb/>
to say that we have succe too been favoured <lb/>
with a continuance of similar mild, spring­ <lb/>
like weather, and with those variable winds which <lb/>
best meet the requirements of the real-hunter. It is <lb/>
generally felt among the judges on this subject, that <lb/>
if we had the regulation of the weather ourselves, we <lb/>
could not have made selection more suitable for our <lb/>
spring fishery than that which Providence has vouch­ <lb/>
safed to send us. Of course expectation is propo" <lb/></p> 

<p>tionately sanguine as to the result of the voyage. <lb/></p>

<p>Friday last, being the A. <lb/>
Saint of Ireland, the Son*** <lb/>
ind hailed the returningºla <lb/>
siastic feeling characteristic <lb/>

never failed to platt, on th <lb/>
new abode, the symbol of st <lb/>
of human redemption, and, <lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:PROW1">Mr. PROWSE</persName>.-No man in this house enjoyed an <lb/>
exhibition of this kind more than he (Mr Prowse); <lb/>
ever, when the laugh was against himself, as it was <lb/>
this evening, he had no objection to the serio-comic <lb/>
performance; but he thought it would be very much <lb/>
better suited for other scenes. If the hon member, <lb/>
Mr March, would only act it elsewhere, for the ben<lb break="no"/>efit of the poor, he would do a great service, these <lb/>
bad times. Here it was out of place, and in the <lb/>
discussion of a great subject like the one now before <lb/>
us, most unseemly and improper. The hon member <lb/>
says all we want in the discussion of this question is <lb/>
common, sense and honesty; "we want no hungry <lb/>
lawyers." Now he (Mr. P.) quite agreed with the <lb/>
hon gentleman, that all he (Mr March) wanted was <lb/>
common sense and honesty. He might have those <lb/>
qualities separately, but after this last speech, he cer<lb break="no"/>tainly could not have them in combination. If he had <lb/>
no common sense, he might honestly believe what he <lb/>
and the Solicitor General said about our being sepa<lb break="no"/>rated from England and joined to Canada alone; but <lb/>
if he has any common understanding, he must see that <lb/>
one of the primary objects of the Conference was to <lb/>
connect us more closely with Great Britain; and that, <lb/>
under confederation, we will be as much an integral <lb/>
portion of the British Empire, or even more so, than <lb/>
we are now. Confederation is a great thing; it has made <lb/>
the Solicitor General speak, and the great argument <lb/>
    that he relies upon is the little influence our eight men: <lb/>
would have in the general Parliament. See, says the <lb/>
Solicitor General, how little influence the seven out <lb/>
harbor members have in this house. Why they can<lb break="no"/>not get the St John's members to attend to business, <lb/>
and they cannot prevent them adjourning to go to <lb/>
dinners. He (Mr Prowse) would like to know if <lb/>
there had ever been any complaint made by the So<lb break="no"/>licitor General on this score, and whether he was not <lb/>
always the first to go to a dinner party himself? What <lb/>
can eight members do? The hon and learned gentle<lb break="no"/>men forgets all the influence Sir William Molesworth <lb/>
and the philosophical radicals exercised in the British <lb/>
House of Commons, though only numbering about a <lb/>
score of gentlemen? But is it more of the results of <lb/>
confederation that small states, like Rhode Island, for <lb/>
instance, are crushed and tyrannized over by large <lb/>
states like New York? Has the smallest Swiss can<lb break="no"/>ton the smallest complaint against the larger cantons? <lb/>
And why should we be afraid that Canada, Nova <lb/>
Scotia, New Brunswick, and P. E. Island, should all <lb/>
combine to treat us unfairly? It was very amusing <lb/>
to listen to some of the arguments of hon gentlemen <lb/>
on this question, The hon member, (Mr. March) and <lb/>
the learned Solicitor General describe the wealth and <lb/>
prosperity of this country in the most glowing terms. <lb/>
She is like some fair and beauteous damsel, rich with <lb/>
the spoils of the ocean, with no unseemly rents of <lb/>
pauperism in her bridal attire, her wealth and her <lb/>
beauty have attracted the covetous eyes of that old <lb/>
brokendown, ruined, <choice><sic>spenthrift</sic><corr>spendthrift</corr></choice> Canada, who wants to <lb/>
inveigle her into Confederation, and then ravish her <lb/>
of all her wealth. Do hon gentlemen know anything <lb/>
about that ruined country, Canada? Why, Sir, these <lb/>
beggarly Canadians have only 18 million dollars worth <lb/>
of agricultural implements, 79 millions dollars of live <lb/>
stock, and over 60 millions invested in railways and <lb/>
canals. Any one hearing these hon gentlemen argue <lb/>
this question, would think that the whole aim and <lb/>
desire of Canada was to squeeze the last drop of blood <lb/>
out of us, and that she was to recruit her ruined finan<lb break="no"/>ces by grinding us down by oppressive taxation. Now, <lb/>
sir, this is a most unſair way of discussing this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Canada is not going to tax us. Whatever is <lb/>
done in that way will be done by the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of the United British North American Provinces. <lb/>
But whatever hon gentlemen say about the Delegates <lb/>
and Canadian politicians, the Delegates had at least <lb/>
the satisfaction of knowing that their report and the <lb/>
Proceedings of the conference had the high approval <lb/>
    of enlightened British statesmen, of the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, <lb/>
which is quite as high an authority on political ques<lb break="no"/>tions as any of our intelligent newspapers. That con<lb break="no"/>ference at Quebec, consisting of some of the ablest <lb/>
men from each of the colonies, acted all through this <lb/>
matter in the most able manner, and thoroughly in <lb/>
the spirit of our constitution. The Delegates first pre<lb break="no"/>pared a draſt of the new constitution. This draft, con<lb break="no"/>tained in their report, was then submitted to the differ<lb break="no"/>ent local Legislatures, where, under the system of party <lb/>
government, it would receive the fullest ventilation; <lb/>
and each colony would discover how its particular <lb/>
interest lay with regard to it. And finally there was <lb/>
the last reference to the Imperial Parliament, where <lb/>
    the claims of each colony would be <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>, and <lb/>
the reasonableness and justice of such claims decided <lb/>
upon by the enlishtened statesmen of England. He <lb/>
(Mr Prowse) considered that it was a matter of the <lb/>
greatest importance to us that our reasonable and <lb/>
moderate demands were to be decided upon by en<lb break="no"/>lightened statesmen such as England now possesses, <lb/>
by such men as Lord Palmerston, Earl Russell, and <lb/>
Mr. Gladstone, men whose impartialty was above sus<lb break="no"/>picion, and whose political sagacity and forethought <lb/>
was above all praise. One of the great difficulties in <lb/>
answering the objections of the opponents of this <lb/>
great, measure was the great diversity and the conflict<lb break="no"/>ing character of the argumements they used. One en<lb break="no"/>lightened merchant, an opponent of confederation,says <lb/>
we will be flooded with Canadian manufactures. So <lb/>
also say the opponents of the confederation in Nova <lb/>
Scotia; but the great Nestor of the anticonfederates <lb/>
in this house, Mr Glen, says go. Canada is a large <lb/>
importer of British goods, and this shows she cannot <lb/>
manufacture enough for herself; and how, then, will <lb/>
she be able to export manufactured goods to us? Now <lb/>
if the hon gentleman's argument were of any weight, <lb/>
any, ountry that imported largely of manufactures <lb/>
could not export them. But unfortunately for his <lb/>
position, England, which exports the largest amount <lb/>
of manufactured articles in the world, also imports <lb/>
manufactures to an enormous extent. France, the <lb/>
largest exporter of light wines, actually imports large <lb/>
qunatities of light wines from Hungary and Germany. <lb/>
Don't we ourselves import dried cootish? But the <lb/>
facts as well as the arguments are against hon mem<lb break="no"/>bers. The hon member for Carbonear, Mr. Rorke, <lb/>
has samples of Canadian leather as low in price as <lb/>
American, and superior in quality. The produce of <lb/>
the tanneries of Canada now amounts to more than <lb/>
two millions and one half of dollars worth a year. <lb/>

<cb/>

Canada also manufactures over a million yards of <lb/>
woolen cloths, valued at less than one dollar a yard. <lb/>
She has large iron founderies whose produce is two <lb/>
and a half million dollars worth. Then she exports <lb/>
furniture and boots and shoes to England. She has <lb/>
large manufactures of carriages. Canada has thus <lb/>
been shown to be in a position to export many kinds <lb/>
of manufactures to us to a considerable extent; and <lb/>
whilst labour is so dear there, it will pay them better <lb/>
to end down the leather and woolens not made up, <lb/>
and thus afford a good deal of employment to our un: <lb/>
fortunate tailors and shoemakers, so many of whom <lb/>
are now suffering great distress. But it makes no <lb/>
difference how fallacious the arguments of those op­ <lb/>
posed to confederation may be shown to be, the ready <lb/>
answer to all reasoning is—"Oh, all you shew us in <lb/>
four of confederation is purely speculative, wholly <lb/>
theoretical." These gentlemen are not satisfied unless <lb/>
they can clutch futurity in their fists and put it into <lb/>
their breeches pockets... No political philosophy has <lb/>
any reference to us... We have nothing to do with the <lb/>
arguments and political economy of John Stuart Mill. <lb/>
The experience we derived from the study of history <lb/>
does not teach us, and he (Mr. Prowse) would ask <lb/>
them,-where are we to go then for a parallel? Are <lb/>
we to be guided by the political experience of the <lb/>
King of Dahomey, or to follow the model of the King <lb/>
question is theoretical; and must be to a great extent <lb/>
speculative in its character. What other arguments <lb/>
were used to prove the benefit that would result from <lb/>
the Reciprocity Treaty, or from the introduction of <lb/>
Responsible Government? It is singular, but true, <lb/>
that precisely the same position which is now taken <lb/>
up by the <choice><sic>opponen's</sic><corr>opponent's</corr></choice> of confederation was the one <lb/>
assumed by those who opposed the union of England <lb/>
and Scotland. But, says the hon member, Mr. Glen, <lb/>
there is no similarity between that union and the com: <lb/>
federation. To his (Mr Prowse's) mind, there was a <lb/>
remarkable similarity. The pauperism of Scotland <lb/>
was something frightful in 1707. Are not we in the <lb/>
same condition? And what is her present position? <lb/>
She has fewer paupers than any other portion of the <lb/>
three kingdoms. She has whole counties with hardly <lb/>
a single parish pauper. The union has accomplished <lb/>
tenfold greater results, material, social and political, <lb/>
than the wildest anticipations of those who labored to <lb/>
promote it. But then we are told there is increased <lb/>
taxation. This weighs down every advantage in hon. <lb/>
gentlemens' minds; but he (Mr Prowse) would like <lb/>
to know whether civilization, the moral and intellec<lb break="no"/>tual elevation of the people, are not of far more in<lb break="no"/>portance than an extra penny or twopence on tea, or <lb/>
any question of tariffs? What is the present situation <lb/>
of this country as regards education and enlighten<lb break="no"/>ment? We are like a lot of little boys in the lowest <lb/>
class of a country school. We have been using our <lb/>
well-thumbed horn books so long that we have got to <lb/>
think of nothing beyond them. But let us come in <lb/>
contact with people who have a splendid system of <lb/>
education, who are enjoying the advantages of rail<lb break="no"/>ways and steamers, and who are in a higher state of <lb/>
civilization than we are; does any one suppose that it <lb/>
we formed part of the confederation, we would have <lb/>
been so long trembling on the brink of a great public <lb/>
work like, Toad's Cove Breakwater or Flower Hill <lb/>
Firebreak? Do you think we should have remained <lb/> 
    go long satisfied with that wretched tub the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ellen Gis<lb/>
borne</hi>, or with the imperfect manner in which local <lb/>
steam is at present carried out, or our present miser<lb break="no"/>able postal system? No. we cannot remain as we are. <lb/>
Increased intercourse with or fellow, colonists, espe<lb break="no"/>cially Canada, will have the same effect on to that it <lb/>
has everywhere else. We must improve. We never <lb/>
can go back in the path of progress. No government <lb/>
how dare do away with local steam. The whole coun<lb break="no"/>try would cry out against the infliction of such an in<lb break="no"/>justice on the outports. But, say hon gentlemen, this <lb/>
theory may be all correct; however, there is no com<lb break="no"/>munity of interest between this country and Canada. <lb/>
She wants protection and we want free trade, she <lb/>
must have a protective tariff. Now he (Mr. Prowse) <lb/>
denied that the present Canadian tariff is protective. <lb/>
It was put on entirely for the purpose of revenue. <lb/>
It would not suit her agricultural population to <lb/>
have a protective tariff on manufactures; nor <lb/>
would it suit her best interests to place a duty <lb/>
on foreign grain, a duty of a shilling a barrel<lb/>
on flour, or sixpence a bushel on wheat from the <lb/>
States, would make grass grow in the streets of <lb/>
Montreal. It would render Canada's great canals <lb/>
and railways, useless for the great design which they <lb/>
were intended, namely, as the best and cheapest out<lb break="no"/>let of the produce of the Western States to the At<lb break="no"/>lantic. Besides, it does not at all follow that the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the majority of any country should guide <lb/>
its fiscal policy. In England the majority, both in <lb/>
wealth and population, are agricultural; yet Eng<lb break="no"/>land's policy and England's interests have been found <lb/>
to lie in free trade in grain; and it has been found, <lb/>
too, that her agricultural interests are best served by <lb/>
this polity. We will have besides in our favour the <lb/>
fact that the interests of Nova Scotia and New Brun<lb break="no"/>swick are identical with our own. Neither of them <lb/>
produce their own food entirely. They are both <lb/>
lurge importers of foreign flour and foreign ma<lb break="no"/>nufactures; and over and above all this, we have the <lb/>
wood of Mr. Galt, that the present Canadian tariff <lb/>
will be reduced, in order to accommodate it to the <lb/>
interests of the whole Confederacy. Mr. Galt has <lb/>
given us this pledge, in the most solemn manner, <lb/>
through Lord Monk and our own Governor. It may <lb/>
be all very well for hon gentiemen to sneer at Mr. <lb/>
Galt and his promises, but it only betrays the lament<lb break="no"/>able ignorange of the history of colonial politics. Mr. <lb/>
Galt has shown himself an enlightened patriotic <lb/>
statesman; and his reputation as a financier stands as <lb/>
high in England as it does in Canada; and he (Mr. <lb/>
P.) would as soon expect men like George Brown, <lb/>
L. A. McDonald, and Mr. Galt, to return to the ex<lb break="no"/>ploded theory of protection as he would expect them <lb/>
to defend the Canadian frontier with bows and ar<lb break="no"/>rows. Hon. gentlemen may say, of course, it they <lb/>
choose, that Mr. Galt's statement, made through <lb/>
Lord Monk, is a lie; but he (Mr. Prowse) thought <lb/>
they would find very few to be.ieve them. Any one <lb/>
who has read Mr. Galt's pamphlet or this question of <lb/>
Confederation must have been struck with the clear. <lb/>
honest and candid statement of facts it contained. He <lb/>
made no attempt to conceal the Canadian difficulties, <lb/>
out of which this idea of union originated. And what <lb/>
stronger arguinent can there be in favour of Confede<lb break="no"/>ration than the desire of these enlightened statesmen <lb/>
to retain this union of Upper and Lower Canada, at <lb/>
any cost? These loading statesmen of two powerful <lb/>
Colonies, like the Canadas, actually forced themselves <lb/>
upon the Charlottetown Conference of the smaller <lb/>
colonies, in order to sustain a union which was an <lb/>
on air one in its commencement, which was forced <lb/>
upon Lower Canada by the British Government, and <lb/>
which is most unfair at present to Upper Canada, a <lb/>
large majority, of whose population is unrepresented. <lb/>
But unfair and unequal as that union now is, still it <lb/>
has been productive of such benefecial results to both <lb/>
colonies, that they would submit to almost, any incon<lb break="no"/>venience sooner then again be separated. Another <lb/>
argument, which hon gentlemen who oppose Confede<lb break="no"/>ration have relied upon is, that as the general Par<lb break="no"/>liament has the power to tax our exports, they will lay <lb/>
a duty on the exports of our fish and oil. He (Mr. <lb/>
Prowse) admitted that if such a thing were attempted <lb/>
it would be a serious loss to this colony. But the <lb/>
<cb/>
    
   very idea of such a thing was absurd. The fisheries <lb/>
of colonies are equal to three-fourths of <lb/>
ours; and their fishing interest; are more nourished <lb/>
and protected than our own. The leading statesmen <lb/>
of Nova Scotia declared they would protect every <lb/>
hook and line, bob and sinker, which Nova Scotia <lb/>
threw into the water. Canada too expends a large <lb/>
amount every year in protecting and encouraging her <lb/>
fisheries; and an export tax would be almost the ruin<lb break="no"/>ation of the fishing interests of those colonies, which <lb/>
had to be so cherished, and nurtured in order to <lb/>
raise up a maritime population, which Nova Scotia, <lb/>
and especially Canada, considered so recessary for <lb/>
their Colonial prosperity. If the provinces comprised <lb/>
in the proposed Confederation were the only export<lb break="no"/>ers of codfish, if they had no rivals to compete with <lb/>
in foreign markets, he (Mr. Prowse) would consider <lb/>
an export duty on fish and oil might possibly be im <lb/>
posed, aod it would not be so wholly unfair. But <lb/>
when our fish was being driven out of Spain by the <lb/>
fish from Norway, Sweden and Iceland, when, at the <lb/>
present time, our export to Spain alone had dwindled <lb/>
down to less than one-third of the whole consumption <lb/>
of the Peninsula, where, less than thirty years ago, <lb/>
Spain and Portugal, did not receive ten thousand <lb/>
quintals from any other country but Newfoundland; <lb/>
when we had such rivals as the French and others <lb/>
driving us out of the Foreign fish markets, it would <lb/>
be a suicidal policy thus to destroy, at, one fell blow, <lb/>
these great maritime interests which Colonial states<lb break="no"/>men had laboured so long and energetically to pro<lb break="no"/>mote. In the present day an export is an exploded <lb/>
fallacy in political economy; but he (Mr. Prowse) <lb/>
felt sure that, as the interests of the Canadas <lb/>
and the maritime Provinces were identical with <lb/>
our own in that respect, it would be very easy to <lb/>
obtain the same guarantees with respect to our <lb/>
fish and oil, which was given for the coal of Nova <lb/>
Scotia and the lumber of New Brunswick. As regards <lb/>
the financial view of the qmestion, he (Mr Prowse) <lb/>
considered that the fixures by which his hon friend the <lb/>
member for Placentia, Mr. Shea, had shown what <lb/>
would be the result of the Canadian tariff of 1863 as <lb/>
applied to this countly, were unanswerable. He would <lb/>
not dwell up on this point, which was so ably discussed <lb/>
by that hon gentleman. He (Mr. Prowse) had heard <lb/>
many intelligent influential gentlemen who were op<lb break="no"/>posed to confederation say that Mr. Shea's statement <lb/>
was under the mark, rather than over it. One argu<lb break="no"/>ment, however, was used until it became stale, nause­ <lb/>
eating, that is, that in the event of the other colonies <lb/>
joining the confederation without us, Great Britain <lb/>
would make us her pet colony, that she would hug us <lb/>
to her heart as their most cherished offspring. He <lb/>
(Mr. Prowse) would like to know if this was the <lb/>
usual course in human affairs. Do we generally re<lb break="no"/>ward those most who give us most slaps in the face; <lb/>
and after you have given the Right Hon. Edward <lb/>
Cardwell a moral kick, spurned the advice of Her <lb/>
Majesty's government, which is tantamount to a com<lb break="no"/>mand, the Imperial authorities will be so delegated <lb/>
with your conduct in this respect, that they will pass <lb/>
over all the other colonies who have followed their <lb/>
advice, and single you out for all their favors. <lb/>
Does any hon member of this house believe <lb/>
that this will be made a Naval port by Great <lb/>
Britain, if we refuse to go into confederation, or <lb/>
that England will do anything at all for us? If any <lb/>
hon gentlemen does believe such a thing, all he <lb/>
    (Mr. Prowse) could say was <hi rendition="simple:italic">that he envied their <lb/>
faith</hi>. Hon gentlemen who argue thus against Con<lb break="no"/>federation, would try and make us believe that we <lb/>
are being separated from Great Britain, and in the <lb/>
event of war, our men would be drafted to defend the <lb/>
Canadian frontier. Now they must know that in the <lb/>
event of war, the moment Canada was attacked, we <lb/>
would be attacked too, no matter whether we were in <lb/>
confederation or out of it. Talk about the defence<lb break="no"/>less position of Canada, there was no country so open <lb/>
to attack as this colony; not a man could be spared <lb/>
from here to defend any other part of the union. <lb/>
    Picture to yourselves what one federal <hi rendition="simple:italic">Monitor</hi> would <lb/>
do, if she opened her guns on the capital. Look at the <lb/>
position your Banks and all your institutions would <lb/>
be in. He (Mr. Prowse), would remind hon gentle<lb break="no"/>men that they had a little account to settle with the <lb/>
British Government with reference to payment of their <lb/>
share of the thirty thousand pounds stg., which the <lb/>
troops cost here. This would doubtless be presented <lb/>
<choice><sic>immeediately</sic><corr>immediately</corr></choice> they refused to enter confederation; and <lb/>
he would remind them they had made a promise on <lb/>
this matter, which they would have to keep. He (Mr. <lb/>
Prowse) considered we were bound by every tie of <lb/>
gratitude for the countless favors which we have re<lb break="no"/>ceived from the mother country, to consider her wish<lb break="no"/>es in this matter, and to give them the most serious <lb/>
consideration. As regards England's position with <lb/>
the confederation, he (Mr. Prowse) considered that <lb/>
every province in that confederation was bound to <lb/>
afford assistance to the mother country, whenever <lb/>
their services were required, and Englind was also <lb/>
bound in honor to support the Confederacy when <lb/>
attacked. He (Mr. Prowse) felt the importance of <lb/>
this great, subject. He felt there was a tremendous <lb/>
responsibility cast upon every representative who had <lb/>
to decide upon a measure involving such tremendous <lb/>
consequences to the present and future welfare of <lb/>
this colony. It was quite possible that many of the <lb/>
theories and anticipations put forth on this subject <lb/>
would not be realised; and he (Mr. Prowse) believ<lb break="no"/>ed for himself, that the beneficial results would far <lb/>
exceed their most sanguine anticipations; perhaps <lb/>
they would not do so in the way hon gentlemen had <lb/>
predicted. He felt very strongly on this subject of <lb/>
confederation,and he regretted that in the heat of de<lb break="no"/>bate he had perhaps been too personal; but however <lb/>
strong in his opinions, he would not accept confed<lb break="no"/>eration on its present basis, without a guarantee for <lb/>
local, direct, and intercolonial steam. If our other <lb/>
demands were moderate and reasonable, he (Mr. <lb/>
Prowse) considered that we would obtain them; and <lb/>
he thought that, on those terms, our union with the <lb/>
British North American Provinces would be the great<lb break="no"/>est boon, that could be conferred on this colony. <lb/>
It would be the proudest event in the life of every <lb/>
man who had helped to secure that union on a fair <lb/>
and impartial basis. He (Mr. Prowse) for one would <lb/>
never regret the curtailment of the power of this <lb/>
house, however much hon gentlemen might talk about <lb/>
the value which the country set upon it. If they did <lb/>
so it must have lately come to them. But a few years <lb/>
before, the Solicitor General said he was out, it an <lb/>
unseasonable hour, at a fire, and when the burning <lb/>
house tumbled in, an independent voter in the crowd <lb/>
said he wished " them blackguards of the Assembly <lb/>
were under it." Has there been such a complete <lb/>
revulsion of public feeling since that the public are <lb/>
now delighted with the Assembly and the council, <lb/>
together speciding nearly as much as the whole educa<lb break="no"/>tion grant The public indeed. They wouldn't <lb/>
care a straw, if your whole paraphernalia of Speaker <lb/>
and Sergeant-at-Arms, Clerks and Messengers, Mace <lb/>
and Members, were swept away to-morrow. There <lb/>
would neither be lamentation nor weeping nor great <lb/>
mourning, except, perhaps, on the part of the few <lb/>
small politicians who suffered by the change. He <lb/>
(Mr.Prowse) trusted there would be no silent votes on <lb/>
this question; but that every member would state <lb/>
the reasons which influenced his views, so that our <lb/>
constituencies will know now to deal with each one of <lb/>
us at the next general election.<lb/></p> 

<p>The house then adjourned until 8 o'clock to-morrow. <lb/></p>

<p>ST. JOH.W.?.S.: <lb/>
THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1865. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Mail Steamer Merlin arrived from Halifax at <lb/>
an early hour on Monday morning last, bringing Eng. <lb/>
lish dates to the 4th inst. The papers announce the <lb/>
death at London, on the 15th ult, of His Eminence <lb/>
Cardinal WIsesian, after a protracted illness, in his <lb/>
63rd year. He was a native of Spain. We give below <lb/>
an abstract notice of the death of this most illustrious <lb/>
Prince of the Church. An account of his funeral we <lb/>
must reserve for our next number. <lb/>
The deaths of the Duke of Northumberland and <lb/>
Wiscount Combermere are also announced. <lb/>
Lord Lyons has from ill-health resigned his place <lb/>
as Ambassador at Washington. lie is to be succeed. <lb/>
ed by Sir Frederick Bruce, brother of the late Lord <lb/>
Elgin. <lb/>
The QUEEN had almost miraculously escaped being <lb/>
crushed by the fall of a tree at Windsor on the 18th ul. <lb/>
Her Majesty was riding in the Home Park at the time <lb/>
and was approaching close to the tree without observing <lb/>
that it was toppling, when a groom seeing the danger <lb/>
gave the alarm, ard thus averted a fatal result. <lb/>
It is again rumoured that Lord Palmersron in­ <lb/>
tends to quit public life at the close of the present <lb/>
session, and that Lord John Russell will take his <lb/>
post as Prime Minister, with Mr. GLADstone leader <lb/>
of the Government in the Commons. <lb/>
<lb break="no"/>We notice that in New Brunswick Mr. Tiller and <lb/>
his Confederation friends have been defeated at the <lb/>
election by a large majority. No decisive action had <lb/>
been taken.on the question in Nova Scoti,but the be-, <lb/>
lief seems to be that the defeat in New Brunswick will <lb/>
so act in Nova Scotia as to prevent any decision for <lb/>
the present. <lb/>
We do not regard this pronouncement in New <lb/>
Brunswick as a matter likely to thwart the ulti­ <lb/>
mate aim of the Confederates. Iyoubtless, it post­ <lb/>
poses the issue they desire to accomplish; but when <lb/>
it is remembers that the election in that colony was <lb/>
a proceeding of hot haste—that the question was <lb/>
forced precipitately upon a people who were moat pro­ <lb/>
bably unacquainted with i's menits, and therefore uſ <lb break="no"/>prepared to determine their course on just grounds, it <lb/>
seems as if mere prejºdice a d fana'icism bad been <lb/>
the arbiters of the pre-ent result. This, coupl d with <lb/>
the fact that the l'a ling m in of the Province have <lb/>
been rej cted at the hºstings, portend, a very brief <lb/>
duration of the new Gºvern n at which his bee, in"t <lb/>
together by such means and which must be compºsed <lb/>
of comparatively weak materials. <lb/>
We notice that in Canada Confederation has been <lb/>
carried by a sweeping majority in the Legislature, and <lb/></p> 

<p>that it has brºn decided that "Notwithstanding the <lb break="no"/> </p> 

<p>defeat of the Confederation candidates of N w Brun. <lb/>
swick,and the cºnseq tent chrc.; of the gener il sch.me <lb/>
for a Confederation, the C-nadian Government would <lb/>
pass their resolutions in favour of the Confederation <lb/>
as soon as possible, ask for a vote of supplies, and <lb/>
adjourn Parliame, itnuediately, when the members <lb/>
of the Government would proceed to England to confer <lb/>
with the Inperial G vernment with regard to the <lb/>
question of detence, and other pressing matters. The <lb/>
result of their mission is to be submitted to the Uana. <lb/>

(FROM THE WEEKLY Register.) <lb/></p> 

<p>An expectant congregation, at the solemn reopening <lb/>
of the Chapel of Our Lidy of the Rosary on the 11th <lb/>
of December, were disappointed of his presence He <lb/>
presided we believe at the meeting of the Bishops on <lb/>
the 13th, and, ever since that day the gravity of his. <lb/>
malady steadily increased. <lb/></p> 

<p>It was endured with the sublime fortitude that had <lb/>
distinguished his life throughout. In the j. <lb/>
a',public writer which we quoted last week and <lb/>
which we are now able to verify from personal infor. <lb/>
mation:­ <lb/></p> 

<p>"His medical advisers had, in accordance with the <lb/>
request of their illustrious patient, informed him ºn. <lb/>
reservedly of the critical state of his health, and he <lb/>
was quite prepared for the issue, be it life or death. <lb/>
Though rarely free from pain, and labouring under a <lb/>
mºst depressing malady, His Eminence has ºne. <lb/>
hibited the slightest impatience or irritation. He <lb/>
converses in a calm, collected manner, not only with <lb/>
*gºrd tº his own dissolution but in reference tº those <lb/>
eºlesiastical matters in connection with his sºj <lb/>
office which have never ceased to occupy his attention." <lb/></p> 

<p>Last Saturday week the Cardinal Archbishop knew <lb/>
that he was dying, and the knowledge prompted him <lb/>
to exert his last act of ecclesiasticala. thority. It was <lb/>
by his own express command that his viºr Gºnº, <lb/>
issued to the Clergy of the Archdiocese the circular <lb/>
which we published in our last impression -bidding <lb/>
them to desist from supplicating for his recovery and, <lb/>
instead, to pray during the Holy Sacrifice that he <lb/>
might have a happy death, and to do so in the ºri. <lb/>
Prescribed by the Church herself in the sacred Liturgy: <lb/>
Pro Infirmo, qui proximus est morti, <lb/></p> 

<p>In the aſternoon of the same Sunday, (Feb. 5) on <lb/>
which the desire of that circular ºrj". <lb/>

said, "I wish to express before ºne Chapter that I <lb/>

sightest doubt or hesitation as to any one of the <lb/>
Articles of this faith; I have always endeavoured to <lb/>

            Colonies, Mr. KNIGHT in the chair.</p>
        
        <p><persName ref="pers:RENO1">Mr. RENOUF</persName> said he had much pleasure in giving<lb/>
            the Resolution his warmest support, because it was<lb/>
            of that character which met the views of the people<lb/>
            generally on this most important question of Confe<lb break="no"/>deration. There can be no doubt, however much<lb/>
            some hon members may now say to the contrary,<lb/>
            but for the firm and independent stand taken by the<lb/>
            few hon gentlemen on both sides of the house, sus<lb break="no"/>stained by public opinion out of doors, as expressed<lb/>
            at the public meeting held a few days ago, we should<lb/>
            not now have before us the present modified Resolu<lb break="no"/>tion to speak to and vote on; but the Resoolutions<lb/>
            adopted at the conference of Delegates held at Que<lb break="no"/>bec in October last. An affirmative vote taken on<lb/>
            those Resolutions, would doubtless have the effect of<lb/>
            binding us to this proposed Confederation, without<lb/>
            giving a majority of the people, whose best inter<lb break="no"/>ests are so deeply involved in the mighty changes<lb/>
            contemplated, an opportunity of understanding the<lb/>
            merits or bearings of the case, or expressing their<lb/>
            opionons thereon. This matter was new to this house<lb/>
            and the country, and he (Mr. Renouf) felt that we had<lb/>
            no power delegated to us by the people to entertain<lb/>
            this vital question either affirmatively or negatively,<lb/>
            until such times as the constituencies should decide at<lb/>
            polls in the general election to take place in a few<lb/>
            months, this being the last session of this term of<lb/>
            the Legislature. The Resolution, therefore, accom<lb break="no"/>plishes all that can be fairly desired for the present;<lb/>
            and it would be for the members of the next Assembly<lb/>
            to carry out the well understood wishes of the people,<lb/>
            who would have to bear all the responsibility which<lb/>
            this complete revolution in our affairs would bring<lb/>
            about, in the event of Confederation being desired by<lb/>
            them. This question of Newfoundland entering into<lb/>
            a Confederation with the British North American<lb/>
            Provinces, is, without doubt, the most important that<lb/>
            has ever agitated the public mind in this country,<lb/>
            since the advent of representative institutions. If we<lb/>
            look to the sister Provinces, contemplated to form a<lb/>
            part of this union, we find there the same strong<lb/>
            manifestations of public opinion in favour of this<lb/>
            momentous change in our constitution being decided<lb/>
            by the people at the polls. This great question is also,<lb/>
            with them, as it is with us, the subject of all engross<lb break="no"/>ing importance, deep interest and thoughtful consi<lb break="no"/>deration, which, in the event of a union being carried,<lb/>
            is to decide, not for a year, but for all time, the weal<lb/>
            or the woe, the happiness or misery of those Provin<lb break="no"/>ces, which are at present governed by their own in<lb break="no"/>dependent legislation. The abstract principles of<lb/>
            confederation have, under peculiar circumstances,<lb/>
            much to recommend them; and more especially when<lb/>
            the terms are based on justice and equality, where<lb/>
            small states become closely allied to a strong central<lb/>
            power, possessing all the materials of strength neces<lb break="no"/>sary to imparta tone and vigour to the whole body,<lb/>
            for purposes of trade, commerce, and protection,<lb/>
            without at the same time unduly restricting their<lb/>
            liberties and privileges, or imposing upon them a too<lb/>
            heavy burthen of taxation. It, therefore, becomes our<lb/>
            solemn duty, as the custodians of the rights, liberties<lb/>
            and priveleges of a free people, to clearly understand<lb/>
            how far those elements of success and future prosperity<lb/>
            for this country are contained in the terms proposed<lb/>
            by the Quebec Report, and which can only be fairly<lb/>
            arrived at by the calmest enquiry, the most mature<lb/>
            consideration, and the deepest investigation. It was<lb/>
            to him (Mr Renouf) and his hon colleagues, and to a<lb/>
            majority of the house, as it wasto the people generally,<lb/>
            a source of congratulation that the Resolution was of<lb/> 
            that temperate tone, which neither affirms nor nega<lb break="no"/>tives this Confederation; but goes to the country for<lb/>
            its opinion, thereby giving authority to the next<lb/>
            Legislature to give effect to whatever decision the peo<lb break="no"/>ple may arrive at. The advantages of such a course<lb/>
            of action would be manifest. The people of the remote<lb/>
            outports may of whom have yet scarcely heard a word<lb/>
            about this Confederation, will, in the interim, have<lb/>
            frequent opportunites of coming into close communi<lb break="no"/>cation with those who have heard its merits discussed;<lb/>
            and who have carefully studied it in all its details. The<lb/>
            debates on it in this Assembly will go on the wings<lb/>
            of the press to all parts of the island; and hon mem<lb break="no"/>bers who may go to theur constituents for re-election,<lb/>
            would have to make this question the principal plank<lb/>
            of their political platform, would have ample time and<lb/>
            would feel the imperative necessity of educating the<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
            public mind, honestly, fairly and impartially, so as to<lb/>
            enable it to arrive at a right decision on this, the great<lb break="no"/>est political, social and constitutional question that has<lb/> 
            ever affected our general interests. He (Mr Renouf)<lb/>
            had listened with the deepest attention to the speeches<lb/>
            delivered by the hon Attorney General and the hon<lb/>
            member for Placentia and St. Mary's, Mr Shea, one<lb/>
            of the Delegates, who opened the debate on this<lb/>
            Resolution, and he (Mr Renouf) could not deny the<lb/>
            great ability and ingenuity displated by each of those<lb/>
            hon gentlemen, in placing this Confederation of the<lb/>
            Provinces in the most captivating manner, in the most<lb/>
            favorable light before this Assembly; and in the ac<lb break="no"/>complishment of which they certainly never laboured<lb/>
            harder on any question, since they had the honor of<lb/>
            seats in the house, to bring conviction to the minds of<lb/>
            their bearers of the inestimable benefits that might<lb/> 
            possibly flow from this union. All that ingenuity;<lb/>
            tact, imagination, speculation and sophism could pos<lb break="no"/>sibly accomplish with a bad case, was resorted to "to<lb/>
            make the worse appear the better reason," in pointing<lb/>
            out those purely imaginary benefits of Newfoundland<lb/>
            under Confederation. The hon gentlemen failed to<lb/>
            point to one single <hi rendition="simple:italic">positive</hi> benefit that would accrue<lb/>
            from this union. They dealt chiefly in hyperbole and<lb/>
            speculation; and on those unsound theories and Uto<lb break="no"/>pian schemes, built their splendid superstructures of<lb/>
            greatness and prosperity for our country and people,<lb/>
            for all time to come. It is not very difficult to con<lb break="no"/>struct the most splendid superstructures on supposition<lb/>
            by the rule of False Position; but such foundations<lb/>
            are less reliable than those of sand are the most<lb/> 
            aerial conception, which the gentlest breath at once<lb/>
            dissipates; and with them all those fancied vis<lb break="no"/>ions of happiness and unrealized benefist for the<lb/>
            people; and</p>
        
        <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"Like the baseless fabric of a dream,<lb/>
            Leave not a wreck behind."</p></quote>
        
        <p>If Newfoundland enters this Confederation, he (Mr<lb/>
            Renouf) trusted it would be on certain fixed and well<lb/>
            defined principles, with material guarantees: and not<lb/>
            on the vague speculations and unauthorised promises<lb/>
            held out by our Delegates, to induce, if possible, a<lb/>
            compliance with <hi rendition="simple:italic">their</hi> wishes, which they doubtless<lb/>
            led the Canadian Delegates, and those of the other<lb/>
            Provinces to believe they would have sufficient inter<lb break="no"/>est and influence to realize. The Quebec Resolutions<lb/>
            clearly define the terms, on which we may enter this<lb/>
            union; and the hon member, Mr. Shea's, clumsy at<lb break="no"/>tempt to cajole this Assembly and the country, by<lb/>
            patching those Resolutions, agreed to, and signed by<lb/>
            the thirty-two Delegates at the Conference, and which<lb/>
            our Delegates have not the slightest power or autho<lb break="no"/>rity to alter, is <choice><sic>two</sic><corr>too</corr></choice> transparent to deceive the people.<lb/>
            By intelligence received yesterday by mail, we have<lb/>
            learned that Nova Scotia does not view this change<lb/>
            as at all favourable to her interests, on the plea that<lb/>
            they are very well off as they are. New Brunswick<lb/>
            was also divided upon this question, and her Legis<lb break="no"/>lature was dissolved, to go to the country on its<lb/>
            results. If those Provinces, whose connection and<lb/>
            interests would be so closely interwoven with Cana<lb break="no"/>da, and more particularly after the completion of the<lb/>
            Intercolonial railway, running from Canada, through<lb/>
            New Brunswick and terminating at Truro, in Nova<lb/>
            Scotia, feel cautious in adopting this scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, how much more so ought we to be, who<lb/>
            are so remote and isolate, and who must necessarily<lb/>
            remain so, who cannot participate in those improve<lb break="no"/>ments, and who can have no reciprocal interchange of<lb/>
            commodities? Even in Canada matters did not run<lb/>
            so smoothly as was expected; the opposition to the<lb/>
            scheme was much greater than was at first anticipat<lb break="no"/>ed: dissentions existed amongst the supporters of<lb/>
            that government; dissolution of their parliament was<lb/>
            looked for, to make an appeal to the people. Prince<lb/>
            Edward Island, like ourselves, being isolated from<lb/>
            sharing in the continental improvements of Railroads<lb/>
            and Canals, was also showing decided opposition to<lb/>
            the scheme, with but a faint hope of her adopting it.<lb/>
            There can be little doubt that our Delegates represented<lb/>
            themselves to the Canadian government as the chosen<lb/>
            agents of our people, the duly authorized exponents<lb/>
            of their wishes, desirous for this union, and with<lb/>
            high position and commanding influence to carry it,<lb/>
            whereas they proceded on their mission of enquiry<lb/>
            only, not clothed with official capacity by resolution of<lb/>
            this house and not authorized to sign any convention<lb/>
            which certainly led the Secretary for the Colonies,<lb/>
            Mr. Cardwell, to believe that the acts of our Delegates<lb/>
            would be ratified by this Assembly and the people.<lb/>
            Our Delegates went and came, and the majority of<lb/>
            the public were ignorant of their mission; and now<lb/>
            that their views are fully before this house and the<lb/>
            people, on this question of union, are repudiated on<lb/>
            all sides. The history of Canada, since the union of<lb/>
            the two provinces, and more especially of late years,<lb/>
            would show how necessary Confederation was, in or<lb break="no"/>der to remove the political difficulties which are em<lb break="no"/>barrassing her, and which have, in several occassions,<lb/>
            led to a dead lock in her government. This is difficul<lb break="no"/>ty arises from the number of representatives to each<lb/>
            province being equal - 65 members; which was<lb/>
            agreed to at the time of the Legislative union; when<lb/>
            Lower Canada had the larger population of the two;
            but now as Upper Canada has an increase of about<lb/>
            500,000 over Lower Canada, she claims an increas of<lb/>
            members on the basis of population; and which being<lb/>
            resisted by the Lower Canadians, the government<lb/>
            was unable to hold power longer than a few months,<lb/>
            and upon one occasion lately, only a few days. The<lb/>
            hon George Brown, the leader of the dominant party<lb/>
            in Upper Canada, has admitted that the great object<lb/>
            to be gained by Confederation with the maritime pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, would be an increas of Representatives; to<lb/>
            enable them to shake off the thraldom in which they<lb/>
            have been kept by Lower Canada, and from which<lb/>
            there was no possible chance of escape but by the<lb/>
            proposed Union. The representation of Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da on the basis of population, however, had not been<lb/>
            lost sight of by Mr. Brown at the conference; and<lb/>
            by calculations correctly correctly made, it was clearly shown,<lb/>
            that at each decennial arrangement, owing to her<lb/>
            large increase of population over the lower Provin<lb break="no"/>ces. she would be steadily gaining, and that in 36<lb/>
            years hence, she would have an increase of 66 mem<lb break="no"/>bers over the number she had on entering the union,
            thereby giving her a total of 148 members against 116,<lb/>
            or a majority of 36 members over Lower Canada,<lb/>
            New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P E Island, and New<lb break="no"/>foundland. The agricultural interests of Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da would then certainly rule the commercial and ship<lb break="no"/>ping interests of the lower provinces and any influence<lb/>
            our eight members could have in that Legislature was<lb/>
            an absurdity, even to think of. However beneficial<lb/>
            Confederation might be to New Brunswick and Nova<lb/>
            Scotia, whose general interests are more identified<lb/>
            with Canada than ours can ever possibly be, who form<lb/>
            part of the same continent and may be closely connec<lb break="no"/>ted by railways, there are no possible means of making<lb/>
            those improvements subservient to our interests, of<lb/>
            reducing the distance of over 600 miles we are from<lb/>
            the nearest point, Halifax, or removing that barrier<lb/>
            of ice, which, for five months of the year, completely<lb/>
            shuts us out from Canada for any purpose of trade.<lb/>
            Our poverty has been used as an argument by our<lb/>
            Delegates, why we should be anxious for Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion with the rich, prosperous and powerful country of<lb/>
            Canada. Did our delegates use this argument at the<lb/>
            Conference, as a reason why we ought to be admit<lb break="no"/>ted into the union? Did they speak of the poverty<lb/>
            of Newfoundland at the Conference, and at the public<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
            entertainments given them by the Canadians, on the<lb/>
            termination of their labourers? Certainly not. They spoke<lb/>
            of our great resources, healthy state of trade, sound<lb/>
            public credit, flourishing revenue, most valuable fish<lb break="no"/>eries, furnishing inexhaustible mines of wealth, from<lb/>
            which, from time to time, immensely large fortunes<lb/>
            have been drawn, and that Newfoundland would not<lb/>
            enter the Confederation empty handed; but could do<lb/>
            so in the character of independence. Those were the<lb/>
            arguments used by our delegates in Canada; but the<lb/>
            moment they return, and came before this Assembly<lb/>
            with their views on this question, what "a wonderful<lb/>
            change comes over the spirit of their dream." Our<lb/>
            country is altogether different in every aspect to<lb/>
            what they represented it in Canada; and they have<lb/>
            now the effrontery to characterise it as beggarly, half<lb/>
            starved and pauperised and which ought to be glad of<lb/>
            the chance of getting so good a stepmother as wealthy<lb/>
            Canada. Such fraudulent inconsistency, on the part of<lb/>
            our Delegates, for purposes, no doubt, best known to<lb/>
            themselves. needs no comment; and carries with it<lb/>
            the condemnation it deserves. Our fisheries certainly,<lb/>
            for the last three or four years, have not been prosper<lb break="no"/>ous; yet our merchants have been able to hold their<lb/>
            own, and still issue supplies on an extensive scale. Our<lb/>
            people are, no doubt, suffering much from those bad<lb/>
            voyages; but it is not the first time in the history of<lb/>
            the country that we have had, several years in suc<lb break="no"/>cession, bad fisheries, and yet managed to retrieve<lb/>
            our position without Confederation; and he (Mr. Re<lb break="no"/>nouf) would ask, what position would Canada be in,<lb/>
            had her crops failed her for the same number of years?</p>

<p>THE INFALLIBLE REWIEDY. <lb/>
IIolloway's Ointment. <lb/></p> 

<p>Contracted or Stiff Joints. <lb/></p> 

<p>All the Medicines in the London dispensaries would <lb/>
barely benefit, much less cure, any chronic cases of <lb/>
contracted or stiff joints; whereas if this invaluable <lb/>
Ointment be effectually rubbed into such parts twice a <lb/>
day, the effects will be immense: , Paralytic patients <lb/>
evencan derive advantages from this fine remedy when <lb/>
other means fail. <lb/></p> 

<p>Scorbutic Humours—Scald Heads &amp; Skin <lb/>
Diseases. <lb/></p> 

<p>| Scorbutic humours arise from an impure state of the <lb/></p> 

<p>blood, and in most cases the liver and stomach are the <lb/>
organs at fault.—The Pills will speedily, restore these <lb/>
* to a healthy action; while the Ointment, if well rubbed <lb/>
in at least twice a day, will soon cure any case of skin <lb/>
disease. Soldiers, sailors, and miners, use this famous <lb/>
Ointment in all parts of the world. <lb/>
Disorders of the Kidneys, Stone and Gravel. <lb/>
In any of the above complaints more benefit may be <lb/>
derived in twenty-four hours by adopting the following <lb/>
simple means than is frequently brought about in six <lb/>
months by any other treatment. In bad cases if the <lb/>
Ointment be rubbed into the small of the back over the <lb/>
region of the kidneys, it will quickly penetrate, and, it <lb/>
most instances, give immediate relief. Six or eight on <lb/>
the Pills should be taken nightly accodin to circum­ <lb/></p> 

<p>stances. - -<lb break="maybe"/>Diptheria, Sore Throats, &amp;c, <lb/>
There maladies are of so serious and dangerous a <lb/>
nature that the Ointment would not be recommended <lb/>
un ess the Proprietor was sure of its effect. It will cure, <lb/>
when every other means have failed if applied immedi­ <lb/>
- a telv, and not delayed until the patient is beyond re­ <lb/>
covery. It is a sovereign remedy for sore throats. <lb/>
Settled coughs or wheezing will be promptly removed <lb/>
by rubbing in this unguent, Mothers should rub it <lb/>
into the chests of their infants whenever, there is any <lb/>
hoarseness, tightness, or other affection of breathing. <lb/></p> 

<p>Bad Legs, Bad Breasts—Old Wounds, Sores and <lb/>
Ulcers. <lb/></p> 

<p>It is surprising how quickly a sore, ulcer or wound <lb/>
deprives the body of strength, and unfits it for the <lb/>
º, duties of life; but it is no less wonderful to watch the <lb/>
* effect of Holloway's Healing, Ointment, when it is used <lb/>
according to the printed directions, and assisted by <lb/>
appropriate doses of the Pills. The pain; inflammation, <lb/>
and other morbid manifestations, soon disappear from <lb/>
the affected part and health and strength return. This <lb/>
treatment creates sound flesh, and therefore makes its <lb/>
cures complete. <lb/>
Gout and Rheumatism. <lb/></p> 

<p>Will be cured with the greatest certainty if large <lb/>
quantities of the Ointment, be well worked into the com­ <lb/>
plaining parts. This treatment must be perseveringly <lb/>
followed for some time and duly assisted by powerful <lb/>
doses of Holoway's Pills. The essence of these diseases <lb/>
... lies in the blood, which has floating through each vessel <lb/>
the pain-giving poison which vitiates and inflames every <lb/>
tissue it comes in contact with, and produces the hot, <lb/>
swollen, elastic enlargement about the joints so charac­ <lb/>
teristic of gouty and rheumatic maladies. <lb/></p> 

<p>* <lb/></p> 

<p>Both the Owntment and Pills should be <lb/>
used in the following cases:­ <lb/></p> 

<p>Iſad Legs Chiego-foot |Elephantiasis;Sore-throat <lb/>
Bad Bºast chilblains |Fistulas Gout'Skin-diseaso <lb/>

<p>LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. <lb/>
WEDNESDAY, March 22d. <lb/>
The house met at 4 o'clock. <lb/>
on motion of hon N. STABB, the Volunteer force <lb/>
organization amendment Bill was read a third time, and <lb/>
assed; and it was ordered that it be taken to the lower <lb/>
oute, with a message stating that it had passed the <lb/>
Council with some amendments, and requesting the <lb/>
assent of the Assembly thereto. <lb break="no"/>Hon N. Stabb laid upon the table of the house certain <lb/>
documents in reference to education, asked for by hon <lb/>
Mr. Pinsent on a former day. <lb/>
Third reading of Bill to regulate the inland Posts of <lb/>
this Colony. - <lb break="no"/>Hon. N'Stabb explained the object of this Bill, which <lb/>
was one he said that would be found very useful in re­ <lb/>
gulating the postal affairs of the colony and securing <lb/>
their stufactory and efficient transaction. Many ºf the <lb/>
clauses were introduced at the suggestion of the Post­ <lb/>
master-General, whose experience no doubt pointed out <lb/>
their necessity, towards enabling him to promote more <lb/>
effectually the inland postal interests of the colony. <lb/>
There were alterations upon the existing system in some <lb/>
respects; for instance, it is by this Bill made imperative <lb/>
upon parties posting them to pre-pay all leuters from <lb/>
one part of the colony to the other, or in default there­ <lb/>
of a double rate will be charged to the receiver. Another <lb/>
elause exempts members of the legislature during <lb/>
session of the payment of postage ou letters received, <lb/>
from the various districts, from their constituencies. <lb/>
An ,ther section fixes the various rates of postage, and <lb/>
increases it in some cases, assimulating it to that of the <lb/>
other colonies; and a power is granted to the Post­ <lb/>
maste-General, with the assent of the Governor in Coun­ <lb/>
til, to regulate all new mail routes. The Bill was a very <lb/>
long one, and when the house goes into committee upon <lb/></p> 

<p>dering its details than in its presenº gº. it had been <lb/></p> 

<p>iºn ºmbers will have a better orportunity of cousi­ <lb/></p> 

<p>arerily prºpered by the Attorney General, and nº Gº: <lb/>
8.) .. dº it would prove a most useful and salº­ <lb/></p> 

<p>The Bill was then read a second time, to be com­ <lb/>
mitted to-morrow. <lb/>
Hon R. J. PINsest presented a petition from the <lb/>
tnembers of the St. John's Athenæum and certain other <lb/>
inhabitants of St. John's, <lb/>
Hon. J. O. FRAsert presented a petition from the <lb/>
Reverend Charles Jagg and other inhabitants of Portugal <lb/>
Cove, on the subject of temperance –also, 22 petitions <lb/>
from residents of St. John's, on the same subject;-also, <lb/>
one from Topsail on the same subject, which he begged <lb/>
to lay on the table. <lb/>
Hon JAMEs CoRMACK presented a petition of a similar <lb/>
character from the Sons of Temperance at Carbonear <lb break="no"/>also, another from Carbonear of a like kind; and others <lb/>
from other districts, praying that a measure be enacted <lb/>
by the legislature to prohibit the sale of intoxica ing <lb/>
liquors. <lb break="no"/>Hon. E. MoRRIS called attention to the fact that <lb/>
these petitions were printed, and that therefore it was <lb/>
i. established Parliamentary practice to receieve <lb/>
them. <lb/>
Hon the PRESIDENT—How many of them are printed? <lb/>
Hon E. MoRRis-About a hundred. <lb/>
Hon JAMES CoBMAck—Eleven of mine, Mr. Pre­ <lb/>
sident, <lb/>
Hon the PRESIDENT—Are those presented by hon <lb/>
Mr. Fraser printed P <lb/>
Hon J. O. FRASER—They appear to be all in the <lb/>
same stamp, Mr. President. <lb/>
Hon. the PRESIDENT—By May's Parliamentary <lb/>
Practice, which is our guiding authority, the house cannot <lb/>
receive printed petitions. <lb/>
Hon JAMES CoEMACK-A similar objection was <lb/>
raised the other day in the lower house, when petitions <lb/>
of the same character as these were presented there, <lb/>
but the Parliamentary rule was waived in consideration <lb/>
of the great importance of the subject-matter involved, <lb/>
and the exceptional circumstances of the case. The <lb/>
parties who signed these petitions were guiltless of any <lb/>
intention to violate parliamentary rule, but were most <lb/>
probably ignorant of legislative formalities, or they <lb/>
would have prepared them in the regular way. The <lb/>
names attachei to the petitions he had charge of were <lb/>
very numerous, and he knew them to be highly respec: <lb/>
table; and in consideration of all the circumstances, and <lb/>
of the fact that the petitions were received by the lower <lb/>
house in a printed form, he thought the same considera: <lb/>
tion ought to be extended to them in this Chamber. <lb/>
Hon. the PRESIDENT was for strict adherence to <lb/>
Parliamentary rule, but would be guided by the wish of <lb/>
the house, if it express an epinion that the established <lb/>
rule should be waived in this instance, as the matter was <lb/>
a very important one. It was the duty of the house to <lb/>
sustain the Parliamentary rule. He should like to hear <lb/>
its opinion on the matter. <lb/>
Hôn R. J. PINsext—There can be no question as to <lb/>
the explicit nature of the rule, and so far as the hon the <lb/>
President was concerned, -it was his duty to enforce it. <lb/>
We should not deviate from the established practice on <lb/>
any considerations, except by vote of a m jority of the <lb/>
house; and in the present case he must say he could <lb/>
quite understand the necessity of having printed, sº <lb/>
many petitions, of precisely similar nature, sign'd so <lb/>
numerously and respectably as they were. He thought <lb/>
under the circumstances, and looking at the vast impor­ <lb/>
tance of the matter involved, it would he well that the <lb/>
house should consent to receive them. He would <lb/>
therefore, move that the petitions be received, with the <lb/>
distinct understan ſing that the deviation from the rule <lb/>
of the house on this occasion should not be a precedent <lb/>
for future action. <lb/>
Hon R. KENT—If you depart once from rule, where <lb/>
will it stop <lb/>
Hon R. J. Pinsent—That will be for our determina­ <lb/>
tion, by the voice of the house. This is a peculiar case, <lb/>
and that alone would at any time warrant departure from <lb/>
rule. Under any ordinary circumstances he (Mr. P.) <lb/>
would not suggest it. <lb/>
Hon J. S. CLIF r—The subject embraced in those <lb/>
petitions was truly a most important one, and should be <lb/>
treated with the greatest courtesy; but we should be <lb/>
cautious lest we establish a precedent that may not <lb/>
easily be avoided hereafter. If we are, as the hºn the <lb/>
President states, to be guided by May, and that authority <lb/>
is against the reception of printed petitions, then he <lb/>
(Mr. C.) thought that, even by a majority-vote of the <lb/>
house, we would be hardly warranted in overturning an <lb/>
established and recognized practice. . He made these <lb/>
few observations merely to assist in bringing, about an <lb/>
understanding as to the practice to be observed on future <lb/>
similar occasions, because it might happen hereafter that <lb/>
printed, petitions, of objectionable character (though <lb/>
believed to be otherwise by the signers and the mem. <lb/>
bers who presented them) may come before the house, <lb/>
and the course now pursued may be relied on to sustain <lb/>
them. He should like to have a little further instruction <lb/>
on the matter. <lb/>
Hon. R. J. Pissent—There can be no doubt upon <lb/>
the mind of any hon member that the Parliamentary rule <lb/>
is clear, -that printed petitions ought not to be received; <lb/>
and he (Mr. P.) should be one of the last to urge depar­ <lb/>
ture from the established practice, but the case was a <lb/>
peculiarly exceptional one. If any printed petition do <lb/>
come before the house at a future time, as the hon <lb/>
gentleman (Mr. Cliſt) states, then it will be for the <lb/>
house to say whether the circumstances are or are not <lb/>
such as to make it an exceptional case. If not, then <lb/>
of course it will not be entertained for a moment. <lb/>
Hon the PRESIDENT—It is my duty, and I consider it <lb/>
also the duty of every hon member, to support the rules <lb/>
of the house. <lb/>
Hon. P G, Tessier thought the rule should be ad­ <lb/>
hered to. If it be deviated from now, we may be forming <lb/>
an irregular precedent, which may acted upon in the <lb/>
future. <lb/>
Hon, J. O. Fraser thought that, , regarding the <lb/>
circumstances, it would be a rather arbitrary course to <lb/>
pursue, to reject petition, so numerously and respectably <lb/>
igned, and the object of which was of sº importants <lb/>
character. Most of these petitions were from persons <lb/>
remote from the capital and from the government, and <lb/>
who could not be expected to be aware of the nature of <lb/>
the rules of legislative practice. Lie considered it would <lb/>
not be a very serious deviation from the usual rule, -not <lb/>
sufficiently so as to create ºny apprehension that it <lb/>
would establish a precedent for future action, if these <lb/>
petitions be accorded a reception. <lb break="no"/>Hon the Presidest—There was nothing at all arbi­ <lb/>
trary in the matter—the Parliamentary rule is laid down <lb/>
in ſay, and it is always acted upon by the Imperial <lb/>
Parliamant. <lb/>
Hon Jºo. Fraser—It is not always adhered to.... <lb/>
Hon the President–This is the first instance within <lb/>
my recollection in this house that an attempt has been <lb/>
made to break through it. <lb break="no"/>Hon Mr. Tessień did not recollect any previous <lb/>
instance. <lb/>
Hon. Mr. FRASER—This is an extreme case. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon J. (). FRASER—If these petitions be not received <lb/>
those who have signed and forwarded them for pres—nta­ <lb/>
tion will be deprived of the opportunity of an appeal to <lb/>
the legislature this session, as mºst of them are residents <lb/>
of extern districts. There would not be sufficient time <lb/>
to prepare other petitions. <lb/>
Hon the PRESIDENT –Fwen so, the matter involved <lb/>
will not be affected, because it is probable that if any <lb/>
measure in accordance with the prayer of the petitions <lb/>
be introduced, it will emanate from the lower branch. <lb/>
Hon R. KENT—The hon gentleman (Mr. Fraser) says <lb/>
the parties in the out-ports who signed these petitions <lb/>
were ignorant of the Parliamentary lºw, that petitions <lb/>
to be received should be written and not printed; but if <lb/>
they were ignorant, the prime instigator and leader of <lb/>
the movement, who was a member of the legislative and <lb/>
executive for years, ought to know better. <lb/>
Hon the PRESIOENT—If he knew it was intended to <lb/>
F." the petitions, it is likely he would not have permit­ <lb/>
ted it. <lb/>
Hon R. KENT—I go for the rules, because I think by <lb/>
infringing them once, a dangerous precedent will be es: <lb/>
tablished. <lb/>
Hon. E. MoRRIs had thought it his duty, as a member <lb/>
of the house, to bring the matter under notice, as it was <lb/>
an irregular proceeding. . However, the case was a very <lb/>
exceptional one, and he thought the house might safely <lb/>
allow a devia:ion from the rule in its favor, but with the <lb/>
distinct understanding that it should not be construed <lb/>
into a precedent. <lb/>
Hon N. SrABB read a paragraph from May's Prac'ice <lb/>
of Pariiament, to show that it was irregular to receive <lb/>
any but written petitions in either branch of the Legis­ <lb/>
lature. The rule was therefore, distinct and definite, and <lb/>
the question for the house now to consider was whetherit <lb/>
would consent to forego that rule in favor of the pesent <lb/>
petitions, These petitions have been forwarded from all <lb/>
parts of the Island, most numerously and respectably <lb/>
signed, and the object is one of the most important and <lb/>
praiseworthy character; and taking into consideraion <lb/>
the fact that the petitioners wou:d be deprived of the <lb/>
opportunity of approaching the legislature again during <lb/>
the Fresent session, if they be rejected, now, he as an <lb/>
individual member of the house was inclined to vote <lb/>
for their reception, on the understanding that such a <lb/>
proceeding should not furnish a precedent for future <lb/>
guidance. There was one objection which he (Mr. S.) <lb/>
took to some of these petitions, which did not seem to <lb/>
be understood as irregular by the hon gentlemen who <lb/>
presented them. By the rule of Pariiament, as laid <lb/>
own in M ty, a pe:ition must be signed in the <lb/>
hand-writing of the party whose names are attached <lb/>
thereto, or if unable to write by making their marks. <lb/>
He e was one petition win 67 names signed to it, and <lb/>
some 4) of th'in are written in the same hand writing. <lb/>
Hon JAMEs CoRMACR-They all went to the same <lb/>
school, <lb/>
Hon N. STABB-The signatures to petitions coming <lb/>
to the legislature should be original, and not copies from <lb/>
the original writing, which is ouly permitted in case of <lb/>
the iciness of the parties wishing to sign them. How <lb/>
otherwise could it be ascertained, whether the signatures <lb/>
were bona fide or authorized 2 <lb/>
Hon R. J. PIN-ENT put his motion, that the peti ions <lb/>
be received, and that there reception in a printed torm <lb/>
should not form a precedent in future proceedings. <lb/>
Hon P. G. Tessier saw nothing in the circumstances <lb/>
of the case justi,ying a deviation from the rules of the <lb/>
house, and he begged to move as an amendment that <lb/>
these petitions, being printed, be not received. <lb/>
The amendment was put and lost. For the amendment <lb/>
honbles. Messrs. Tessier and Kent;-against it, honbles. <lb/>
Messrs. Pinsent, Morris, Stabb, Clift, O'Dwyer, Cor­ <lb/>
mºck and Fraser. <lb/>
The original motion was then carried on a similar <lb/>
division, and the petitions were received and laid on <lb/>
the table. <lb/>
Hon P. G. Tessier—If received, it does not follow <lb/>
that they shall be read. <lb/>
Hon the PResident—If received, they must be read <lb/>
because by receiving them the principle is admitted. <lb/>
Hon P. G. Tessier–If the house consents to receive <lb/>
and read printed petitions, where it, is going to stop <lb/>
Hon the PRESIDENT—It has been distinctly stated in <lb/>
the motion of non Mr. Pinsent, that this course is not <lb/>
to form a precedent. <lb/>
Hon; Mr. CoRMAK then presented the petititions he <lb/>
had charge of, witholding those only whose signatures <lb/>
were not bona fide ones. They wire from Burn, En­ <lb/>
glish Harbor, iiants Harbor, Silly Cove and Trinity. <lb/>

<p>SPEECH OF MR. RENUUF. <lb/>
(Continue t.) <lb/></p> 

<p>Would her finances or her population be better off than <lb/>
ours are to day It is idle to say that this Confedera­ <lb/>
tion would make gºod any shortcoming in our prosperity <lb/>
created by bad voyage. Without good fisheries, which <lb/>
are our principal mainstay, ºny, union can do but little <lb/>
for us; and, under Providence, with teturning prosperity, <lb/>
and the properly directed efforts of our people, we shal, <lb/>
have no occasion to sacrifice our cºuntry and all that we <lb/>
value as free men, because of our present distressed state, <lb/>
to enter into a union, whose giardest feature is the <lb/>
wildest speculation. , ſhe hon member, Mr. Shea, has <lb/>
told us that history pointed to Confederations as being <lb/>
generally beneficial to the intereºis of states so tonneº­ <lb/>
fed, and referred to the time of the Heptarchy in Eng­ <lb/>
land, and Henry IV. of France, to show the good effects <lb/>
of such combination of states, as a principal argument in <lb/>
favour of our joining the proposed Confederac, But he <lb/>
(Mr. Renout) failed to discover the sightest analogy in <lb/>
our position and the countries referred to. Neither the <lb/></p> 

<p>etty kingdoms of the Heptarchy, nor the pºiºs of <lb/></p> 

<p>Iance were separate <lb/></p> 

<p>... Neºfound and is separated from the provinces of this <lb/>
intended confederation. The kingdoms of the Hep­ <lb/>
ºrchy and the provinces of France were closely inter. <lb/>
º, with each other, and had a complete iden ity...of <lb/>
interests for trade, commerce and defence, and inutuality <lb/>
of wants, which we cannot pºssibly hºſe "tº those pro­ <lb/>
ºnces we are sought to be allied to. The unlou of Eng­ <lb/>
jani is also p inted to, as an evidence ºf <lb/>
the necessity of our entering Confederatiºn. Here again <lb/>
There is not the slightest analoxy, and of the me." used <lb/>
to bing about that union, he (*ir. Renouſ) would ºf <lb/>
speak, ºu, scouand has no isolation from England, º' <lb/>
is closely connected by sailways, whicº bºg. tne *... <lb/>
tals of the two countries into the close. proximity "it <lb/></p> 

<p>each other. Scotland had no navy, and " ….. great <lb/>
object with her to have the Prº of Bºgº §: <lb/>
her commerce in all parts of the glºº; and willon . <lb/>
greatly conduced to her ad" and prº-Peſº. <lb/>
the union. History aiso pointed to other Confederations, <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon the PREsident—The petitions might be engross­ <lb/></p> 

<p>uty enactment. He begged to move than it be now <lb/>
rºad a second time. <lb/></p> 

<p>ed on parchment or paper, but should be writtent <lb/></p> 

<p>which the hon member, Mr. Shea, studiously aroided <lb/></p> 

<p>d from each by a sea 600 miles in <lb/>
extent, and a barrier of ice for five months of the year.: <lb/></p> 

<p>naming; such as the union of Poland with Russia, and <lb/>
Hungary with Austria, whose histories are written in <lb/>
characters of blond, from the crueities, onoressions and <lb/>
barbarities, which make humanity shudier, practiced <lb/>
against a brave, and generous people. The union of <lb/>
Ireland has also had reference made to it; but it is a most <lb/>
unfortunate one for the hon member. We have but to <lb/>
refer to her splendid public buildings in decay, her <lb/>
commerce destreyed, her nobles and landlords <lb/>
absent, her tenantry evicted from their holdings and <lb/>
starving on the road side, her brave and noble sons <lb/>
expatriated, her taxes made oppressive fºr another's <lb/>
benefit, and her virtuous peasantry flying frem the land <lb/>
of their fathers as from a plague-stricken country, to <lb/>
seek a home in the United States, and we have the <lb/>
honest reply as to what Ireland has gained by her union. <lb/>
The repeal of the union, the late lamented O'Connell, <lb/>
Ireland's liberator, laboured with all his ability and <lb/>
eloqueuce to accomplish, until under the burdens which <lb/>
are unseprable from the reponsible position he had <lb/></p> 

<p>assumed, he sank into almost a prenatºire grave. To <lb/></p> 

<p>enable him to carry that repeal, and consumite his <lb/></p> 

<p>wishes; patriotic Irishmen in all parts of the globe <lb/>
enrolled themselves as Repealers, and deeply sympathized <lb/>
with him in his efforts to accomplish the wish nearest his <lb/>
heart, and the hearts of all his true countrymen. The <lb/></p> 

<p>hon member, Mr. Shea, said it was only better terms <lb/>
the Liberetor sought for Ireland. No doubt better <lb/>
terms they procured and exterted from Bnglan I's fears, <lb/></p> 

<p>but nothing less than a repeal of the Uuion, which would <lb/>
restore to Ireland her own Parliament, would have been <lb/>
sufficient to satisfy his intense love for the freedom of <lb/>
his country. The United States, since the time of the <lb/>
Confederation of the thirteen colonies, which the necess <lb/>
sities of their position for mutual protection and defence, <lb/>
forced upon them, at the time of their separation from <lb/>
Great Britain, have greatly increased in population, <lb/>
wealth and commerce, far beyond elder countries in <lb/>
Europe or America. Her unrivalled position in the New <lb/>
World, her natural resources—genial climate and the <lb/>
great fertility of the soil, and her mid laws and free in­ <lb/>
stitutions afforded all those advantages and inducatments <lb/>
for settlers from different nations of Furope, who brought <lb/>
with them to the new republic, that varied ability, <lb/>
intelligence and industry, which has contributed so <lb/>
largely to her general prosperity. With all thºse advan­ <lb/>
tages, we have for the last ſour years, beheld with hor­ <lb/>
ror the most gigantic struggle of the Southern Sales to <lb/>
secede from the union, which beinz resisted by the <lb/>
Northern States and the Government, had les to the <lb/>
most disastrous consequences with excessive taxation and <lb/>
an immense national debt. The high productive duties <lb/>
in favour of the manufactures of the Northern States, <lb/>
against the producers of the South, have contributed <lb/>
largely to bring about this revºlt, which is decim iting her <lb/>
people by tens of thousands, devastating her fertile lan.'s, <lb/></p> 

<p>and destroying the land marks of her advanced civ list­ <lb/></p> 

<p>tion. The prosperity of Canada since the union of the <lb/>
two provinces, abºut twenty-five years ago, has also been <lb/>
referred to us in glowing terms by out Delegates, as an <lb/>
evidence of what we should necessarily become under <lb/>
Confederation. There can be no doubt that Canada has <lb/>
certair.ly much imprºved since the union, but she should <lb/>
never have been sparated with her distinct Legislatures, <lb/>
&amp;c., where there was not even a natural or imma­ <lb/>
ginary line to point the demarcation of the separate <lb/>
provinces. It is not because the one land, inter­ <lb/>
sected with railways, canals and rivers, and having <lb/>
interests immediately and closely interwoven with ench <lb/>
other, should confederate, that there could be the slight­ <lb/>
est analogy in her position and ours, or that we could <lb/>
directly paticipate in the railways and canals which so <lb/>
closely bind the interests of thos; formerly separate Pro­ <lb/>
vinces, any more than we could paticipate in the Ruil­ <lb/>
ways and canals of England. But with her progress, <lb/>
we must not be forgetful of her large indebtedness since <lb/>
the union, to a great extent brought about by the gross­ <lb/>
est corruption and jobbery of her government, which <lb/>
cannot he more clearly shown than by the following <lb/>
quotations from a lec ire delivered in England before <lb/>
the Society of Arts, by a well known Englishman, Mr. <lb/>
Ashmore, who said:— <lb/>
* In the period which has elapsed since the Provinces <lb/>
of Upper and Lower Canada were united, the public <lb/>
debt has been increased from one million to fifteen mil­ <lb/>
lions sterling, meanwhile the expenditure of this money <lb/>
has been lavished in every discription of loans and advan­ <lb/>
ces on colonial credit, made to the municipalities and <lb/>
for public works, . The members of the House of Assem­ <lb/>
bly being returned by the municipalities, give their sup­ <lb/>
port to the ministry on the condition of the advance of <lb/>
some loan to their constituents for a speculative object <lb/>
of local improvement. 'i he loan is sanctioned out of <lb/>
money which has been raised under public guarantee. <lb/>
It thus happens, not unfrequen ly, that the money so <lb/>
easily obtained is wasted or applied to an unprofitable <lb/>
purpose. The inhabitants cannºt or will not pay the <lb/>
rates impºsed to defray the interest, and the public <lb/>
treasury is hence called upon on the guarantee." "The <lb/>
municipalities, being in this unpleasant condition, are <lb/>
now appealing to the provincial Parliament for aid, upon <lb/>
the ground that, having given them these large powers, <lb/>
they are implicated. Such disclosures do not give up a <lb/>
favºurable estimate of Canadian public morality, and it <lb/>
will be important to consider what may be the result of <lb/>
corruption in the representatives, and no immediate <lb/>
check between the demands of the cun-tituencies and <lb/>
the public exchequer." "We have already stated that <lb/>
the public debt of Canada has increased from one to <lb/>
fifteen millions sterling, and we may furth", observe <lb/>
that along with this continued borrowing, the Canadians <lb/>
have gone on increasing, year by year, the tºes, on our <lb/>
manufactured imports, to pay ourselves the interest. <lb/>
The rates of customs duties levied upon imports <lb/>
range from 10 to 100 per cent. and within the last <lb/>
twelve years, there have been tº fewer than seven <lb/>
| changes of the tariff, increasº the duty upon British <lb/>
manufactures, variously from 19 per cent to 20 aud 23 <lb/>
; per cent." <lb/>
That quotation carries, with is own. Sommentary, on <lb/>
Candian political morality, more powerful than any lan­ <lb/>
guage which he (ºr: Renouſ) could apply to it. The <lb/>
ãon member, Mr. Shea, has. stated that in the event. of <lb/>
the Reciprocity Treaty with the United States being <lb/>
repealed, notice of which intention has been given by <lb/>
tº government, in a fit of petulance, owing tº the <lb/>
jºr of anadian officials in the matter of the sº <lb/>
Alban Raiders, no retallatory measures would be adopted <lb/>
by Canada, and that he, Mr. Shea, spoke advisedly, <lb/>

<p>that with the Reciprocity treaty abolished, and a heavy <lb/>
duty reimposed on the produce of those provinces in <lb/>
the United States,the General Government would admit <lb/>
the prºduce of that country into her markets duty free, <lb/>
and all for the purpose of showing a good example P <lb/>
He (Mr. Renoiſ) had not the slightest faith in the car. <lb/>
rying out of this one-sided doctrine of extreme liber. <lb/>
*lity on the part of the Confederate Government. <lb/>
The hon member, Mr. Shea, also said he did not be­ <lb/>
lieve the Reciprocity Treaty would be abolished. He <lb/>
(Mr Renouf, held a different opinion, which was sus­ <lb/>
tained by facts, and would quote from a debate before <lb/>
the senate at Washington in November last, on this <lb/>
matter, as follows-Vir. Summer stated, "On an esti­ <lb/>
mate founded on the trade before the treaty, Canada <lb/>
would have paid to the United States, in the ten years <lb/>
of the treaty, at least $17,373,800, which she has been <lb/>
relieved of. This sum has actually been lost to the <lb/>
United States. In return Canada has given up only <lb/>
$2,650,890. being the amount it would have collected <lb/>
if no treaty had been made. There is consequently a <lb/>
vast disproportion to the detriment of the United <lb/>
States. During the ten years of the treaty the United <lb/>
States have actually paid in duties in Canada $16,802,­ <lb/>
962, while during the same period Canada has paid in <lb/>
duties to the United States the very moderate sum of <lb/>
$330,445." The foregoing facts and figures are cer­ <lb/>
tainly more reliable than mere speculative opinions, <lb/>
without any sure foundation; and the public will have <lb/>
no difficulty in deciding which of the two they will <lb/>
accept. We have been further told that England will <lb/>
no longer, defend us unless we agree to enter this <lb/>
Confederation; and he (Mr Renouſ) suppºsed on the <lb/>
terms of the Quebec Resolutions. This is another of <lb/>
the wild speculations of our Delegates, for we have not <lb/>
a single word in the Despatch from the Secretary for <lb/>
the Colonies, Mr. Cardwell,on this subject, that would <lb/>
lead us to inſer that the oldest and most loyal colony <lb/>
of the British Empire wºuld be discarded, unless she <lb/>
sacrificed her best interests to gratify the inordinate <lb/>
ambition of a few, to the great injury of the whole <lb/>
country and people. Our defence must be a naval <lb/>
one, and such as England and not the Confederate <lb/>
Government can afford to give us. If England made <lb/>
a present to the general government of her fleet on <lb/>
the North American station, have our Delegates <lb/>
counted the cost of its maintenance in a state of effi­ <lb/>
ciency; and also the additional heavy tax that would <lb/>
create, our proportion of which we should have to <lb/>
contribute? The assertion had been made that there <lb/>
is to be no navy—not for very many years to come, <lb/>
but in view of the fact that the United States intend <lb/>
placing six ironclad steamers on the lakes, ior defence <lb/>
of her territory against raiders from the Canadian side, <lb/>
must not Canada meet the emergency by equipping a <lb/>
similar armament? And is it likely that the British <lb/>
Government will defray the expense? If the United <lb/>
States expand $10,000,000 on her Lake defences; <lb/>
must not Canada be also up, and doing? And he <lb/>
(Mr Benouf) would like to be informed by our Dele­ <lb/>
gates, who must also be sound authorities on naval <lb/>
and military matters, how far will the $1,000,000 go­ <lb/>
being the amount set down by the 32 delegates to build <lb/>
up a naval and military defence, not for Canada alone, <lb/>
but for all the Provinces and Colonies in the Confede. <lb/>
ration? Our Delegates have also said that Newfound­ <lb/>
land, being no longer a benefit to the British Navy, <lb/>
as her extensive commerce furnished a nursery for <lb/>
seamen to man her Navy, she cared little about us, <lb/>
anºl might throw us off withont hesitation. But he <lb/>
(Mr. Renouf) had greater faith in the justice of the <lb/>
mother country, who could not forget that the Banks <lb/>
of Newfoundland contributed to a large extent the <lb/>
neamen who helped to win her most important naval <lb/>
victories. If tue Confederate Government is not to <lb/>
have no navy for many years to come, how are the <lb/>
maritime provinces to be defended from without P But <lb/>
the 13th Section of the 29.h Resolution of the Q lebec <lb/>
Iłeport admits it, and the hon the Speaker, in his <lb/>
reported speech at the de jeuner at Toronto,said, when <lb/>
speaking of the wants of Canada, as fo:lows. <lb/>
want the maritime element, and we are able to give it <lb/>
to you. You may by and by require seamen to man <lb/>
your navy, and where will you be able to obtain them <lb/>
more readily than in Newfoundland?" <lb/>
the event of a war hetween Canada and the United <lb/>
States, and Newfoundland in this Confederation, our <lb/>
fishermen could be drafted to fight the battles of a <lb/>
country in whose quarrel they had no interest. It is <lb/>
very evident that that speech, made by the hon the <lb/>
Speaker at Toronto, was after the champagne began <lb/>
to circulate freely, from the very remarkable fact of <lb/>
his forgetting all the good things he said in behalf of <lb/>
his native land in Canada, and which, since his re­ <lb/>
turn,he was altogether oblivious of, his opinions having <lb/>
undergone a radical change, Newtoundland being only <lb/>
a paltry, poverty stricken, and pauperized country, in <lb/>
the estimation of the hon and learned Speaker. The <lb/>
allusion to the rendezvous of the Russian fleet at New <lb/>
York, two years ago, for the purpose of proceeding to <lb/>
the Pacific, to pounce upon and destroy the Australian <lb/>
colonies, in the event of England interfering on behalf <lb/>
of Poland, was merely an opinion, and not sustained <lb/>
by any information which leaked out from the Cabinet <lb/>
of St. Petersburg! and even if the report was true, <lb/>
it could not be applicable to our position, which <lb/>
would at all times be free from any attack by the <lb/>
Russians. As regards taxation, he (Mr Renouf) <lb/>
would admit that where it was relatively applied, it <lb/>
could not faii to be of general advantage, as in the <lb/>
construction of public works and improvements of a <lb/>
reproductiva character; thereby giving remunerative <lb/>
employment to our operative population; and in this <lb/>
sense it might be said that taxation and civilization <lb/>
wert hand in hand. What was the condition of this <lb/>
country thirty-five years ago, when we had no taxation, <lb/>
and before we had representative institutions? Alamost <lb/>
in a state of wilderness. Now we have roads, bridges, <lb/>
educational establishments, colleges, steam and <lb/>
telegraph communications with the outports and <lb/>
provinces and United States, and many other im­ <lb/>
provements which characterize the advanced civiliza­ <lb/>
tion cf more favoured countries. But the increased <lb/>
taxation which, under Confederation, we would <lb/>
have to bear, would not be for our loc l improvements, <lb/>
but for the extension of railways, bridges and canals <lb/>
in Canada. The hon member, Mr. Shea, stated that <lb/>
the people of Canada paid less taxes per head than <lb/>
ours, e (Mr Renouſ) admitted that fact, because <lb/>
our taxes are made upon imported goods, which are <lb/>
the necessities of all classes of our people, whereas the <lb/>
agriculturists and others in Canada supply their wants <lb/>
with coarse articles of clothing of their own household <lb/>
and do not require to purchase every imported require­ <lb/>
ment, as is the case with us. But what about the <lb/>
other heavy direct taxes which the people of Canada <lb/>
have to pay to meet the reckless extravagance that <lb/>
has been practised by successive governments in the <lb/>
administration of their public affairs, and which has <lb/>
helped to create their huge debt of $64,000,000? If <lb/>
we are now taxed $4 per head of our populatson, it <lb/>
would not probably be less than $6 under Confedera­ <lb/>
tion, with the present Canadian tariff, which would add <lb/>
nothing to the 12s. per head which the people of Can­ <lb/>
ada now pay. Any reduction that was promised in <lb/>
that tariff by our Delegates, which is also speculative, <lb/>
would still have the eff-ct of lessening the taxation in <lb/>
Qanada and increasing it in Newfoundland, providing <lb/>
it was recuced from its present 20 and 25 per cent to <lb/>
15 per cent, which is the highest ra.e we pay on im­ <lb/>
ports. Reference was made to the poverty of our out­ <lb/>
Ports, to many of our houses being unoccupied, and <lb/></p> 

<p>** You <lb/></p> 

<p>So that, in, <lb/></p> 

<p>many with bad tenants,and the alarm of our landlords <lb/>
from fear of increased taxation, which would flow from <lb/>
this measure. As regards the fears of our landlords, <lb/>
they have good reason to dread increased taxation, <lb/>
and feel alarmed too. The present heavy water tax, <lb/>
which owes its parentage to the hon member, Mr. <lb/>
Shea, has given them a foretaste of what they may <lb/>
expect, if the General Government gets the power of <lb/>
taxing them. And in what manner Confederation was <lb/>
to reduce the poverty of the outports, and procure <lb/>
good tenants for our empty houses, and turn out the <lb/>
bad ones, he has not ventured to touch upon, or even <lb/>
to make a promise. He (Mr Renouf) did not believe <lb/>
this Confederation scheme wºuld be such a potent <lb/>
remedy for our ills, but would be somewhat like a cel­ <lb/>
ebrated quack medicine which promised to cure every <lb/>
thing, even ear.hquakes, but after being tried was <lb/>
found to be only an in position for getting money. <lb/>
The hon member, Mr. Shea, also referred to the <lb/>
tradesmens' petition, which he (Mr Renouf) presented <lb/>
to the house a couple of years ago, the prayer of which <lb/>
was protection for their industry, and to prevent them <lb/>
becoming paupers on the government. The principles <lb/>
of protection which he (Mr Renouf) then advocated, <lb/>
in regard to that petition, he was prepared to advocate <lb/>
again; but what support did the hon member, Mr. <lb/>
Shea, who now seems to be a convert to their views, <lb/>
give to that petition? He turned a deaf ear to it; but <lb/>
now tells us that our trades men can get, under his <lb/>
darling scheme, Confederation, all they petitioned for. <lb/>
And why? Is it that there is a brighter vista of future <lb/>
greatless in store in Canada for others than our <lb/>
tradesmen, that he now condescends to notice their <lb/>
wants and wishes. Where is the employment for our <lb/>
people who are not engaged in the fisheries; and even <lb/>
for our fishermen and their families during the inter­ <lb/>
vals between the voyages? Where is the employment <lb/>
for our youth of beth sexes, who crowd our thorough­ <lb/>
fares, and are constrained to live in idleness on the <lb/>
earnings of one or two earners out of each family P <lb/>
Employers they cannot procure, because there are no <lb/>
workshops, and many articles are imported ready <lb/>
made at low duties;iwhich, if made up in the country, <lb/>
would give employment to thousands, many of whom <lb/>
have to take their industry to the United States, <lb/>
or remain here in , a half starving condition, and <lb/>
not unfrequently a burthen upon the public funds <lb/>
of the colony, , which should be appropriated <lb/>
to purposes of public improvement and general bene­ <lb/>
fit. Why do our gºvernment send orders to other <lb/>
countries, which give employment to their people at <lb/>
the sacrifice of our own, for many articles which could <lb/>
be manufactured here, and then accuse them of their <lb/>
poverty, and drive them to apply for poor relief? Is <lb/>
such the case in the oth -r Provinces P. No, whatever <lb/>
the skill and industry of their artisans can accomplish, <lb/>
finds a ready market with them. How different is the <lb/>
case here P Many articles that could be manufactured <lb/>
by our tradesmen, and required for our public institu­ <lb/>
tions, could be supplied both good ani cheap; but <lb/>
there is no protection for home manufactur s. Many <lb/>
articles that we night supply are imported and made <lb/>
a job of, the government preferring to make pa-pers <lb/>
of our artizans, rather than encourage and sti-nulate <lb/>
their industrial pursuits. Our I)-legates who are <lb/>
now such ardent admirers of Canada and her protec­ <lb/>
tion for her manufactures, should took at home; and <lb/>
if she has, by such means, risen to this great state of <lb/>
prosperiºy, what is there to prevent the application of <lb/>
the same means to the industry of a large portion of <lb/>
our people, to make them happy and prosperous; and <lb/>
without Confeleration? But it appears that what <lb/>
benefits Calada cannot bet.efit us, unless we sacrifice <lb/>
ourselves to Codfellerrtion, which is set forth to be the <lb/>
great panacea to cure all ill-, and leave us nothing to <lb/>
desire after it would be effectuated. The hon member, <lb/>
Mr. Shea, said he referred to the tradesmen's peu­ <lb/>
tion, mere y to show the inco:Isistency of hon members, <lb/>
then supporting its principles, an I now repudiating <lb/>
the m wieu they have the power of giving them effect, <lb/>
of coarse, only u-1d-r his darling sche me of Cºnfede­ <lb/>
ration. He (Mr. Rºnou') had no doubt that the hon <lb/>
men er fancies nº can lay the "flattering unction o <lb/>
his soul," and pride himself on his political consisten­ <lb/>
cy on all occasions, in this Assembly and out of it alsc; <lb/>
and that all reliance could be placed on his fixed prin­ <lb/>
ciples, When this important question of Uonfedera­ <lb/>
tion was slightly touch-d upon, in Committee on the <lb/>
address in reply to His Excellency's speech at the <lb/>
opening of this session, he (Mr Renouf) referred to <lb/>
the Canadian tariff of 1863 as applied to our imports <lb/>
for the same year, which would give an increase of <lb/>
taxation of about £40.000. The hon member, Mr. <lb/>
Shea, in preparing his financial statement under Con­ <lb/>
federation, to place before the country, applies the <lb/>
Canadian tariff of 1863 to our imports, instead of the <lb/>
tariff of 1864, the former giving a smaller aunount of <lb/>
increased taxation, a luxury wich the hon member <lb/>
knows is not over palateable to the people, from the <lb/>
experience they have had of the Water Company's <lb/>
tax, which the hon member led the house and the <lb/>
country to believe, when he introduced that measure, <lb/>
would be scarcely felt. The hºn member has to.d us <lb/>
that the Canadian tariff of 1854 was increased for <lb/>
special purposes, which being now accomplished, <lb/>
would be again red iced. There can be little doubt <lb/>
that it was increased for special pulposes, to raise a <lb/>
sufficiency of tevenue to meet their ex ravagani ex­ <lb/>
penditure, which for seven years prior to 1864 was, <lb/>
on an average, $2,914,756 per year over their income, <lb/>
so that there is little chance of the present tariff bein; <lb/>
reduced. In the space of twelve years, Canada has <lb/>
had no less than seven tariffs on the ascending scale, <lb/>
and it was only last year, and ow.ng to unusual pros­ <lb/>
perity, that shs had an excess of revenue over expen­ <lb/>
diture. He (Mir Renoul) held in his hand a Customs' <lb/>
return, of the application of the Canada tariff of 1864 <lb/>
to our imports. whicn would give a total increase of <lb/>
taxation of £64,570, dedicted from which, a total <lb/>
decrease of £17,413 on some artic.es, woºll leave a <lb/>
nett increase of additional taxation of £57.156.-The <lb/>
increased taxes would be on the fouw wing principal <lb/>
articles, viz. rum.f.803; molasses, £3,585; sugars, <lb/>
4.2200, coffee, £568; tobacco, £3, 141; soap, £1 114; <lb/>
boots and shoes, £7,162; wearing apparei, #1,331; <lb/>
leather, É2,401; manufactured goo is, £23,732; cor­ <lb/>
dage, £3,280; bread, 37,181; Guus, powder and slot, <lb/>
£482; paints, &amp;c., £332. Tne decrease would be on <lb/>
the following principal articles, y Z., wniskey, cordials, <lb/>
gin, brandy and wines, 382,756; teas, £7 2; fishing <lb/>
tackie, £1,318; canvas, £990; salt, £336; drieu <lb/>
fruits, £187; rice, £123.−tle (Mr itenout) had <lb/>
prepared a statement (w.uch appears below) which <lb/>
could show prºtty lairly what Newfºundland would <lb/>
have to pay under Confederation, and not including <lb/>
what may be raised in case of emergency, by direct <lb/>
taxation, which power the General Government would <lb/>
pessess, by the 5th section of the 29.n Resolution of <lb/>
the Quebec report, as foliows-"the raising of money <lb/>
by all or any other modes or systems of taxation." <lb/>
This Assembly would, no doubt. hesitate before in­ <lb/>
creasing our taxation to the figures as shewn under <lb/>
the application of the Cauadiat, tarf, which increase <lb/>
we could apply to the purposes of logºl improvement, <lb/>
developing and working our minerals—and opening <lb/>
up new sources of industry for our people, Yet this <lb/>
power, whica we are tearful tº exercise ourselves, we <lb/>
are willing to transfer to the General Government, for <lb/>
ths extension of railways, canals, and other improve: <lb/>
ments in Canada and theiother Provinces, which would <lb/>
be about as beneficial to our direct intereº, as the <lb/>
railways and canals of Great Britain. He (Mr. <lb/></p> 

<p>Renouf) would now refer to our exports of fish, oil, <lb/>
herrings, salmon, skins, &amp;c., which by the 2nd section <lb/>
of the 2s Resolution of the Quebec report, would give <lb/>
to the General Government the following powers: viz. <lb/>
"the imposition or regulation of duties of Gustoms on <lb/>
imports and exports, except on exports of timber, logs, <lb/>
masts, spars, deals and sawn lumber, and of coal and <lb/>
other minerals." There can be little doubt then, that <lb/>
our exports would be liable to the risk of taxation, in <lb/>
case of emergency, notwithstanding all our Delegates <lb/>
might say to the contrary; aud to place the matter <lb/>
beyond the reach of doubt, suspicion or dispute, they <lb/>
should have stipulated that our exports should form <lb/>
an exemption, as well as the timber, &amp;c., of Nova <lb/>
Scotia and New Brunswick. An export tax of 5 per <lb/>
cent on our shipments, would raise another pretty <lb/>
item of revenue for the General Government, of about <lb/>
#260,000 a year, a very small portion of which would <lb/>
fall to our share for local improvements. The hon <lb/>
member, Mr. Shea, calculates there would be a credit <lb/>
balance of $783,471 in favour of the General Govern­ <lb/>
ment, after detraying all expenses, providing in the <lb/>
amplest manner for the defence of the Confederated <lb/>
provinces; which item of defence was put down at <lb/>
only $1,000,000, an amount barely sufficient for <lb/>
Canada alone, and to which might safely be added <lb/>
another $1,000,000 for the other Provinces. Again, <lb/>
would not the promised extension of the canals of <lb/>
Western Canada absorb the credit balance referred to, <lb/>
to pay interest on monies to be borrowed for that pir­ <lb/>
pose? Mr Brown, in his speech at Toronto:—"I am <lb/>
happy to say, that with the unanimous consent of the <lb/>
Delegates, we have agreed to the extension of the <lb/>
Canal system of the West," which would certainly <lb/>
cost many millions of dollars, and would be a set off <lb/>
against the Intercolonial railway for the improve­ <lb/>
ments of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The 69th <lb/>
Resolution promises that the North West territory is <lb/>
to be opened up, when the finances would permit; <lb/>
but poor Newfoundland was to be left out in the coll, <lb/>
and have no place in the grand arrangements which <lb/>
are to secure such prosperity to the other Provinces. <lb/>
He (Mr. Renoaf) was not singular in his opinion, <lb/>
that the improvements and necessities under the Ge­ <lb/>
neral Government woull leave no credit balance, but <lb/>
a deficiency of over $2,000,000, applying the present <lb/>
Canadian tariff to the maritime provinces, a d which <lb/>
deficiency must be met by increaed taxation; and <lb/>
whether indirect or direct, on property, income, bask <lb/></p> 

<p>stock, bills of exchange, &amp;c., is no bugbear or clap­ <lb/>
trap; which hon members who do not agree with the <lb/>
views put forth by our Delegates, on this question, <lb/>
are accused of resorting to. But this question of in­ <lb/>
creased taxation, was the pith and marrow of the <lb/>
scheme, so far as the interests of Newfoundland are <lb/>
concerned; and must form the basis of negotiation in <lb/>
the matter... We have heard a great deal about what <lb/>
Canada could do in supplying us with manufactures of <lb/>
woolens, cottons, boots an I shoes, &amp;c., cheaper than <lb/>
we could import them from Great Britain. How is it, <lb/>
then, that she has not taken advantage of our mar­ <lb/>
ket up to this time, which is as free to her as to the <lb/>
mother country? How is it also that our merchants <lb/>
and shopkeepers do not import from Canada, in pre­ <lb/>
ference to Great Britain, it the articles are as good <lb/>
and the terms better? Great Britain supplies aſ the <lb/>
markets of the world, and successfully competes with <lb/>
all countries in the quality and cheapness of her <lb/>
manufactures, owing , to improved machinery and <lb/>
cheap. labour. Canada is a very large importer of <lb/>
manufactured goods from England, amounting, last <lb/>
year, to $16,000,000, and, in spite of 20 and 35 per <lb/>
cent duties, England was able to undersall them in <lb/>
their own markets. The United States, with her ex­ <lb/>
tensive manufactures, imports largely from Great <lb/>
Britain also; and even the raw cotton and other ma­ <lb/>
terials which England imports from America, she is <lb/>
able to tranship manufactured, and compete with her <lb/>
in price and quality in her own markets. The hon. <lb/>
member, Mr. Shea, asks, is not Britain also an im­ <lb/>
porter to some extent, from France P Certainly she <lb/>
is; of the finer quality of silks, gloves, lices, &amp;c., <lb/></p> 

<p>which we can well dispense with, and is not a parai­ <lb/>
el case. . The infant manufacturies of Canada, with <lb/>
high priced labour, aro not yet, if they ever will be, <lb/>
in a position to supply us and the other provinces on <lb/>
as good terms as we at present enjoy. By a report <lb/>
made to the Executive Council of Canada, and signed <lb/>
by the hon W. P. Howland, Receiver General, it <lb/>
would be understoogd to what extent, and in what <lb/>
articles of manufacture, she could supply our wants. <lb/>
It is as follows. "With a more extended trade be. <lb/>
tween Canada and the Lower Provinces. we should <lb/>
compete in their markets, not with the productions of <lb/>
Great Britain but with those of the United States, <lb/>
These consist mainly of agricultural produce, in rais. <lb/>
ing which we excel, and of articles the manufacture <lb/>
of which is rapidly increasing here," an i that a large <lb/>
proportion of the goods which the maritime provinces <lb/></p> 

<p>now buy in the States could be supplied by Canada. <lb/></p> 

<p>That report fully disposed of the delusions manufac. <lb/>
tured by our Delegates on the subject of Canadian <lb/>
manufactures. We have the ass, riion of the hon <lb/>
member, Mr. Shea, that the tariff of the General <lb/>
Government will be revised, to meet the wishes of the <lb/>
lower provinces; and he has that assurance from <lb/>
Mr. Galt, in a telegram lately received. It must be <lb/>
evident that Air. Galt, who is so very anxious for <lb/>
the consummation of this scheme, would make pro­ <lb/>
mises ad tibitum, by Telegraph, to induce us to lºok <lb/>
more favorably upon it. But would the General <lb/>
Government, not yet in existence, feel itself borind to <lb/>
act on the unauthorized promises of Mr. Galt; <lb/>
Those important points should not be left to the un­ <lb/>
certainty of telegrems between Mr. Shea and Mr. <lb/>
Galt, a mode of do.ng business neither safe nor sat­ <lb/>
isfactory. Once in the union, our wishes would have <lb/>
to be subservient to Mr. Galt, and the Canadians, <lb/>
who would have the power to m,ke them so Another <lb/>
grert consideration urged by the hon member, Mr. <lb/>
Snea, in favour of our becoming a part of this future <lb/>
great empire that is to be, is, the line of ocean stea­ <lb/>
mers connecting us with the mother country and with <lb/>
Canada; and also another steamer on the Western <lb/>
postal route. The hon member is very strong on <lb/>
this quession of steam, in which he takes the deepest <lb/>
interests; but he (Mr. Renouf) failed to discover a <lb/>
single word about it, in the form of a promise, in <lb/>
the Quebec Resulutions; where it should properly <lb/>
appear; and not be left to vague speculations. It <lb/>
may be well to ask how it came that our Deegates <lb/>
did not secure these advantages for us at the Confer­ <lb/>
ence, and have a guarantee for it in the Resolution, as <lb/>
well as the opening up of the North West territory <lb/>
the extensions of the Western canals. and the laying <lb/>
down of the Intercolonial railway. The hon mem­ <lb/>
ber being forced to admit a large increase of taxation <lb/>
under Confederation, asks if this line of ocean steam­ <lb/>
ers that is to be is not worth £10,000 a year to us, <lb/>
and modestly places it in his financial statement, as <lb/>
one of the assets against the new taxes. That was <lb/>
certainly a dexterity in managing finance questions, <lb/>
unrivaled by even the great Finance Minister of <lb/>
Canada, Mr. Galt. A line of ocean steamers was <lb/>
all very well in its way; but, in view of the Cape <lb/>
Race telegraph station, it could never be worth such <lb/>
an amount to this country, where the carrying trade <lb/>
was well supplied by our own first class clipper ves­ <lb/>
sels. . It would be, without doubt, a great conveni­ <lb/>
ence for wealthy persons, to enable them to travel <lb/>
comfortably and expeditiously across the Atlantic, be-, <lb/>
yond whom the great bulk of the people would derive <lb/></p> 

<p><lb break="no"/> </p> 

<p>little or no benefit. If we had £10,000 to spare, after <lb/>
prºviding for the public service, would we be justifi. in <lb/>
voting it is a part subsidy for ocean steamers, and <lb/>
particularly after the Galway line failure? Would <lb/>
this Assembly agree to it, in view of the many more <lb/>
useful purposes to which it might be applied? <lb/>
year ºr two ago, this house was cºjoled into giving <lb/>
£5,000 of our revenue to the Galway §ompany; <lb/>
and how much did it benefit the country? Ajº. <lb/>
was given at a time too, when our languishing re. <lb/>
sources, required sustainment. That money". <lb/>
recklessly thrown away, to carry out a visionary <lb/>
speculation, which was to lift up the country by the <lb/>
introduction of large capital, thereby infusing new <lb/>
life and energy into every, branch of our trade. <lb/>
business. , We could afford to throw away £10,000 <lb/>
on the Galway line of steamers, but could not give <lb/>
one penny to develope our mineral resources, or ene <lb/>
courage our Bank, Mackerel and Herring fisheris, <lb/>
which are successfully prosecuted by strangers, at oº: <lb/>
own doors, or engºurage agriculture, all which would <lb/>
have the great effect of striking at the root of that <lb/>
gigantic evil, pauperism. Then, there is the other, <lb/>
steamer, that is to be running between the capital, <lb/>
western ºutports, and Canada; which has no place <lb/>
either in the Quebec Resolutions, and is set down tº <lb/>
us at the annual value of £4,000, on the same <lb/>
sound principle as the £10,000 for ocean steam. That <lb/>
our tradesmen, labourers and fishermen, when times, <lb/>
would be depressed, and their circumstances poor <lb/>
could take passage in these steamers for Canada, <lb/>
where there would be plenty of employment for then <lb/>
at high wages, is another of the arguments used by <lb/>
our Delegates, although we understood at first thers <lb/>
was to be no more depression in circumstances or <lb/>
povery amongst the people, after we joined this Con­ <lb/>

<p>ST. JOH.V'.S. <lb/>
THURSDAY, MARCH 30, 1865. <lb/></p> 

<p>We referred briefly on Thursday last to the defeat of <lb/>
the Confederation Candidates at the late election in <lb/>
New Brunswick, and while admitting that for the <lb/>
present it delays the accomplishment of that measure, <lb/>
we cannot help thinking that the importance attached <lb/>
to the circumstance by the opponents of Confederation <lb/>
has been inconsiderately exaggerated. The question <lb/>
was one for which the public mind of the Lower Pro. <lb/>
vinces at least could not have been prepared. Though <lb/>
often from time to time a subject of discussion, it had <lb/>
engaged but little attention outside the circle of the <lb/>
few public men who spoke on it, and had never been <lb/>
investigated in the eye of the people at large with a <lb/>
practical meaning. It might be supposed that Mr. <lb/>
TILLY is second to no man in New Brunswick as a <lb/>
competent judge of the sate of public feeling in that <lb/>
Province, and his reputation for political sagacity <lb/>
stands high. Yet we must confess that he mistook his <lb/>
course in precipitating a decision on this question, and <lb/>
gave the workers on popular prejudice an advintage <lb/>
he should certainly have avoid-d. All this will right <lb/>
itselfin due time, but meanwhile the resilt leaves a <lb/>
gap in the way of progress and true reform. The <lb/>
great change Confederation will involva cannot be <lb/>
brought aboat without affecting so us existing inter­ <lb/>
*** injuriously, and creating an undefined apprehension <lb/>
of ill amongst others who do not comprehend the <lb/>
subject, while large numbers who are aven favourably <lb/>
disposed, would keep aloof from the affirmation of the <lb/>
principle where sufficient time has not been affolded <lb/>
for the careful inquiry demanded in a case of such <lb/>
grave importance. With the ignorent who on a ques­ <lb/>
tion like this are necessarily a great mass, the cry of <lb/>
taxation, unfounded or otherwise, is always a potent <lb/>
influence, and when we consider that at the time se­ <lb/>
lected by Mr. Tilly for his appeal to the country, all <lb/>
these agencies would have been alverse, we feel, as at <lb/></p> 

<p>present advised, no small degree of surprise at the <lb/>
apparent rashness which marks his policy in this <lb/>
instance. <lb/>
But while we think that the result, under such cir­ <lb/>
cumstances, should cause no wonder, it cannot be <lb/>
supposed that it has in it any element of permanence. <lb/>
The question was tried without any intelligent know­ <lb/>
ledge of it on the part of the people, and fanaticism <lb/>
and prejudice and timidity acted, where reflection and <lb/>
sober judgment were required for such a conclusion <lb/>
as time and experience could approve. It has been <lb/>
well said that "honest ignorance and dishonest inge­ <lb/>
nuity" were the agencies at work, and they have exe­ <lb/>
cuted their fitting purpose in ejecting from the admin­ <lb/>
istration of public affairs in New Brunswick almost <lb/>
every man of ability and experience in both political <lb/>
parties. Already, however, there are evidences of <lb/>
reaction which this spectacle of ostracised talent could <lb/>
hardly have failed to call up, and no one believes that <lb/>
the Government that will now be formed can have <lb/>
any but a very brief existence. <lb/>
But independent of the special causes that have pro­ <lb/>
duced this bouleversement in New Brunswick, a mo­ <lb/>
ment's reflection on the matter on more general <lb/></p> 

<p>grounds will show how little reason there is for surprise <lb/></p>

<p>e- <lb break="no"/>held out was the large fi ld the Confederation would <lb/>
give to our youth seeking that honourable and lucra­ <lb/>
five employment whic', was debarred them at home, <lb/>
owing to the finited field of operations. From that it <lb/>
would be inferred that our sons are all to get situations <lb/>
in Canada, a d m ºre particularly having eight mem­ <lb/>
bers as their friends to app'y to. It might so happen <lb/>
that our members would b so abso-bed in their own <lb/>
interests as hardly to bestow a thought upon the <lb/>
wants of o here; and we knew to a certainty that no <lb/></p> 

<p>influence those m-mbers could possibly bring to bear || <lb/></p> 

<p>&amp;n the General Government would prevent the Cana­ <lb/>
dians enjoying, as they do at present, the patronage <lb/>
of their offices to make place for ours. Here the Gov­ <lb/>
ernment and every officer under it, the Legislature, <lb/>
&amp;c., are with a few exceptions filled by our sons; but <lb/>
could this state of things continue under Confedera­ <lb/>
tion? We transfer our Customs, Post Office, and <lb/>
Lighthouses to the General Government, and in the <lb/>
event of a vacancy taking place in either of these in­ <lb/>
stitutions, would not the appointment be made at <lb/>
head-quarters and not in favour of a native P The <lb/>
curtailment of our Legislature alone would destroy <lb/>
mcre patronage than we should enjoy at the hands of <lb/>
the General Government. The hon Attorney General <lb/>
grew a little facetious when he referred to the <lb/>
sphere of advancement which Confederation opened <lb/>
up to the hon member for Ferryland, Mr. Glen, in <lb/>
the event of his being chosen a member of the House <lb/>
of Commons at Ottawa. when he might have the <lb/>
chance of holding the office of Rrceiver General, at <lb/>
$5,000 a year. , Politicians of Mr. Glen's great finan­ <lb/>
cial ability and incorruptible honesty would undoubt­ <lb/>
edly be of great advantage to the new State, in place <lb/>
of some of those whose political career was inseparable <lb/>
from official corruption and jobbery; but he (Mr. <lb/>
Henouf) felt confident that all the allurements so <lb/>
blandly put forth would not have the slightest effect <lb/>
in swerving the hon member from the honest and con­ <lb/></p> 

<p>"scientious position which he had taken on this mo­ <lb/></p> 

<p>mentous question. He, (Mr Renouf) it was further <lb/>
stated, might also attain distinction in military affairs <lb/>
under the General Government, nothing less than a <lb/>
Field-Marshal's baton. Strong inducements, certain­ <lb/>
ly, but very unreliable, like the rest of the good things <lb/>
that are in store for us. However, he (Mr Renouf) <lb/>
would contentedly remain a Captain of Volunteers, in <lb/>
defence of his own native land, rather than sacrifice <lb/>
her best interests and the rights and liberties of the <lb/>
people for self-aggrandisament. Our law students also <lb/>
are to have, under Confederation, a large field and <lb/>
every favour, with no end to the briefs and retainers, <lb/>
and reminders too. Why it was only last year that a <lb/>
lawyer from Canada came hera seeking his fortune,and <lb/></p> 

<p>admitted that, bad as the trade was with us, it was far <lb/></p> 

<p>worse where he came from, with 1,571 lawyers and <lb/>
attornies, or one to every 1600 of the population, <lb/>
against one to every 16,000 here, which speaks vol­ <lb/>
umes for the honesty of our country. So much for <lb/>
the enlarged field for our lawyers. The hon Attorney <lb/>
General used another very singular argument in favor <lb/>
of Confederation, which was not hing less than that, in <lb/>
the event of a bad fishery, we would have some pa-ty <lb/>
to fall back upon or apply to for assistance—th it we <lb/>
could go to the General Government and ask them to <lb/>
relieve our people in their distress, No doubt we <lb/>
could make the application, but more than likely their <lb/>
pºrtals of charity would be closed against our appeal. <lb/>
There is, to a certain'y, one thing which they would <lb/>
#. us to relieve the necessities of our distressed <lb/></p> 

<p>shermen, and that would be direct taxation, as per <lb/>
Resolution No. 29. Our political history since 1832, <lb/>
with our elections every four years,is further evidenced <lb/>
by the hon, Attorney General as a potent reason why <lb/>
we should be in this Confederacy, as if every country <lb/>
with representative institutions is not subject to the <lb/>
same ordeal of excitement. , Was there any exception <lb/>
to this rule out of Newfoundland P Would the ascer­ <lb/>
bity of feelirg be less, with a reduced House of Assem­ <lb/>
bly, and with eight members to be returned for the <lb/>
House of Commons in Canada P Was it less so even <lb/>
in Canada or the other provinces? This is a specimen <lb/>
of the humbug and clap-trap used by hon members <lb/>
who favor that scheme; but the delusion was too <lb/>
transparent to merit even serious consideration. Nºw <lb/>
it was evident that certain hon members after selfishly <lb/>
monopolizing for years the emoluments of office <lb/>
amongst themselves and their friea'ſs, were anxious to <lb/>
destroy our Legislature and sacrifice the liberties and <lb/>
privileges of the people which it protects, that they <lb/>
might on its ruins take splendid positions under the <lb/>
new government. The hon Attorney General admits <lb/>
that our population cannot increase very much, where­ <lb/>
as that of Canada would double and treble in a short <lb/>
space ºf time, owing to the tide of emigration setting <lb/>
in in that direction, and owing to natural causes. it <lb/>
cannot be denied that such would be the case; which <lb/>
after every decennial census would give an increase of <lb/>
members tº Upper Canada, that, in not many years to <lb/>
some, would place her representation in excess of <lb/>
lower Canada and all the lower provinces combined, <lb/>
thereby making her mistress of the position, while we <lb/>
should still be confined to eight members. The re. <lb/>
presentation scheme the hon Attorney Generai consid­ <lb/>
ers fair, which it appears to be at first sight, but in <lb/>
reality is not the case. Newfoundland, the key of the <lb/>
St. Lawrence and the Confederation by sea, with her <lb/>
valuable fisheries, rich minerals, extensive 'trade and <lb/>
commerce, splendid harbours, and great natural ad­ <lb/>
vantages, would have only the same representation as <lb/>
a town with the same population in the backwoods of <lb/>
Canada. It was not so much on the basis of popula. <lb/>
tion as by position and resources that she was entitled <lb/>
to a larger representation. It was admitted that the <lb/></p> 

<p>Canadian frontier was long and straggling, and so was <lb/></p> 

<p>that of the United States; but what comparison would <lb/>
the means of defence, resources and supplies of Cana­ <lb/>
da bear to those of the Republic, which have been <lb/>
I. to the mazement of the world during the past <lb/>
ºur years? What were we going to do, was asked by <lb/>
the hon Attorney. General and other pro-confederaté <lb/>
members of the House, if we don't enter the Confede­ <lb/>
ration. In reply, he (Mr Renouf) would ask, what <lb/>
would we do it this grand scheme did not turn up, <lb/>
this great panacea, according to our political doctors. <lb/>
for all our ills, bad fisheries and paupers m ' Trust in <lb/>
Providence, and glapple wun our difficulties with a <lb/>
vigour and manliness equal to the emergency and the <lb/>
means at our disposal. Could we do more in this Cor­ <lb/>
federation, which to some hon members seems to be <lb/>
such a Providenial escape from our present tempor­ <lb/>
ºry ºmbarrassments, and is seized by them with the <lb/>
death grasp of the drowning maliner clinging to the <lb/>
last plank of the wreck P ºrhere could be no doub: <lb/>
that any change which would prove generally beneficial <lb/>
to our country, is a consummation devoutly to be <lb/>
wished for by all; but the extreme change contemplat­ <lb/>
ed by that union must not be based on wild specula­ <lb/>
tions and uncertainties, which would be sure tº result <lb/>
in bitter disappointment and degradation. On the <lb/>
part of the people there could be only one universal <lb/>
ºre tº embrace this Confederation, if they felt sais­ <lb/>
fied or conſinged in their minds that the oºjects to be <lb/>
gained would be for the improvement of the Coantry <lb/>
and the amelioration of our condition. He (Mr Ren­ <lb/>
nouf) had given to that ulost important question the <lb/>
*erious coasideration which its vast importance de­ <lb/>
imanded; and calmly and dispassionately considering <lb/>
** is own merits, and in aſ its bearings in relation <lb/>
tº our hºessities, and was now prepared to fearlessly <lb/>

<p>Mox DAY, Feb. 27. <lb/>
The House met at three o'clock. <lb/>
Mr. LEAMon presented a petition from Abraham <lb/>
Bartlett and John Bartlett, of Brigus, which was re­ <lb/>
ceived and read, setting forth that petitioners, in their <lb/>
two vessels, the Selina and Henrietta Grieve, were <lb/>
engaged in the prosecution of the seal fishery the past <lb/>
sping, but were jammed up in the ice, in Green Bay, <lb/>
till very late in the season, and afterwards drifted <lb/>
out of the Bay, but could not get clear until after the <lb/>
8th day of June; that the friends of petitioners and <lb/>
those of the crew of another vessel, then missing, pro­ <lb/>
cured the services of the steamer Bloodhound, and <lb/>
de-patched her with supplies in search of, and to re­ <lb/>
lieve the said vesses; but that providentially a change <lb/>
of the wiud took place, and petitioners' vessels were <lb/>
released from the ice about two days before the <lb/>
steamer arrived at the place they had been confined <lb/>
in; and that in all probability she would have been <lb/>
the only availabie means of saving themselves and <lb/>
crews, had they not been able to get clear when they <lb/>
did; that petitioners' vessels arrived at Briggs on the <lb/>
12th June, while the steamer was still in search of <lb/>
them, and were deficient of several articles of diet, and <lb/>
had then been on short allowance more than a month, <lb/>
although one of pet tioners, a consideroble time before <lb/>
their return, having been in a position that men could <lb/>
travel on the ice, allowed several to leave, that there <lb/>
might be a little more food for those remaining in the <lb/>
vessel; thot petitioners would remind the hoise that <lb/>
the lives of about 100 persons were apparently at <lb/>
stake, as well as the welfare of their numerous gon. <lb/>
nexions, and of their wives and families; and praying <lb/>
that, as in former similar cases, the house would pay <lb/>
the expense ot sending the Bloodhound in search of <lb/>
thºse missing vessels; also a petition from James <lb/>
Wilcox and others, shipmasters and cther inhabitants <lb/>
of Brigus, which w is received and read, setting forth, <lb/>
that last year the brig Henrietta Grieve,the brigantines <lb/>
Selina and Noel, and other vessels were jammed in <lb/>
the Ige, while prosecuting the seal fishery, until the <lb/>
5:h June i that the crews of said vessels were on short <lb/>
alow ince *...*. for a nonth previously; that <lb/>
the friends of said parties, feeling assured of the peri­ <lb/>
lous situation of said vessels and crews, sent a steamer <lb/>
to their assistance; but said steamer spoke one of the <lb/>
vessels missing, and procceded to the relieſ of the <lb/>
other", and although not neeting the ice they were in <lb/>
till they were clear, would have otherwise effected the <lb/>
object of her mission; that considerable expense was <lb/>
thereby entalled on the owners of the vessels; and <lb/>
that considering the humanity of the proceeding, and <lb/>
hºw many lives were in jeopardy, and thouncerº, nty <lb/>
of such voyages, petitioners humbly pray the House <lb/>
to take the natºr into consi leration, and reimburse <lb/>
the owners of the vessels referred to the expense in­ <lb/>
cur. d in sen ing the 8: eamers to their reli f. <lb/>
Mr; LEAMos, in ineving that these petitions lie on <lb/>
the tablº, said these pºti'ious explained themselves, <lb/>
and it was unnecessary for him to say anything to <lb/>
urge their favourable consideration. The friends of <lb/>
the petitioners became very uneasy on account of their <lb/>
protracted absence at the ice, and applied to Mr. <lb/>
Grieve, the resident partner of Messrs. Baine, John­ <lb/>
ston &amp; Co., who wrote to the Government, requesting <lb/>
that a steamer should be sent in search of the missing <lb/>
vessels, and offered to serd the Bloodhound for £150, <lb/>
provided the government would defray that expense. <lb/>
The government, it appeared, offered to pay half, and <lb/>
some difference having taken place between him and <lb/>
the government as to the terms, the whole amount <lb/>
was charged to the missing vessels, Mr. Grievo allow. <lb/>
ing £50 for his own vessel, the Noel, and charging <lb/>
Messrs. Bartlett £50 each for their own vessels, Hé <lb/>
(Mr Leamon) thought they were entitled to receive <lb/>
some consideration at the hands of the government. <lb/>
He thought-they should not be left to pay the full <lb/>
amount. If these men had not returned when they <lb/>
did, and the steamer had not been sent, there would <lb/>
have been a great outcry; and the government would <lb/>
have been blamed for it. There might even have been <lb/>
loss of life, for they were short of provisions. There <lb/>
were 120 men on board the two vessels, many of them <lb/>
men having families, who if they had lost their fathers <lb/>
would have been reudered entirely destitute, and <lb/>
would require to be provided for by the Government. <lb/>
He did trust, if the government did not pay the whole <lb/>
amount, that they would at least pay a considerable <lb/>
portion of the outlay incurred. <lb/>
Ordered that the petitions lie on the table. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. LEAMon gave notice that on to-morrow he <lb/>
would move an address to his Exoellency the Governor <lb/>
on these petitions. <lb/>
The hon. Acting Colonial Secretary, by command <lb/>
of his Excellency the Governor, presented to the <lb/>
House a detailed statement of the expenditure for <lb/>
shipwrecked sealing crews for the year 1864. <lb/>
Ordered that this document lie on the table. <lb/>
Mr. KAYANAGH presented petitions from David <lb/>
Rocke and others of Outer Cove, and from John <lb/>
Rourke and others, of the same place, which were <lb/>
severally, received and read, praying for grants to <lb/>
open roads in that locality. <lb/>
Ordered that these petitions lie on the table. <lb/>
Mr. McGRATH presented a petition from Samael <lb/>
Coffin and others, of Haystack and Spencer's Cove, in <lb/>
Placentia Bay, which was received and read, praying <lb/>
for a grant to repair the road from Petty Harbor road <lb/>
to Brennan and Miurphy's farms. <lb/>
Ordered that the petition le on the table. <lb/>
The Master-in-Chancery to the Legislative Council <lb/>
brought down &amp; message acquainting the House that <lb/>
they had passed, without amendment, the Bill sent <lb/>
up }. the House to provide for the recovery of <lb/>
penalties becoming due tipon the forfeiture of certain <lb/>
recognizances; also the Bill to regulate the office and <lb/>
duties of Coruners; also the Bill to continue the pun­ <lb/>
ishment of banishment in certain cases; also the Bill <lb/>
to provide for the registration of births, marriages and <lb/>
deaths in this colony and its dependencies. <lb/>
Ordered that this mess"ge lie on the table. <lb/>
Mr. MARCH gave notice that, on to-morrow, he <lb/>
would ask leave to bring in a Bill to amend the <lb/>
Herring Act. - * <lb/>
Mr. Resour presented a petition from inhabitants <lb/>
of Petty Harbor, which was received and read, praying <lb/></p> 

<p>for employment on the public works, <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Resoup, in moving that the petition lie on the <lb/>
table, would make some observations upon it, and on <lb/>
the manner in which the government provided for the <lb/>
destitute fishermen of St. John's, and if the members <lb/>
on the government side of the house, ºr ºver ºn the <lb/>
opposition benches, should walk, 9 it of the hoise by <lb/>
tº and threes, as it was stated in that government <lb/>
rig, the Daily News, they did on Friday, still he (\r <lb/>
Rimouf, bad a duty to discharge to his constituents. <lb/>
and it was not the government nor their hirºling press <lb/></p> 

<p>that would deter him from doing it...These peti-\-<lb break="maybe"/></p> 

<p>tioners prayed that they might be provided with em­ <lb/>
; § the same ... as the distressed fisher­ <lb/>
men of St. John's were, who were employed 4 days in <lb/>
the week, at 1s 6d. a day, payable in flour and molas­ <lb/>
sts. He had never since he had the honor of a seat <lb/>
in that House, made application for any relief to these <lb/>
petitioners, who had always supported themselves by <lb/>
their own industry, and would still do so, if any fish <lb/>
was tº be had during the fishery season. But he must <lb/>
also again refer to the manner in which the distressed <lb/>
fishermen of St. John's were paid for their labour. <lb/>
He did not see why these men should be confined for <lb/>
the snpply of their wan's to the two establishments of <lb/>
Mr. Kitcnin and Mr Macpherson, while there were <lb/>
numbers of others in the same business equally as <lb/>
deserving of the patronage of the government. He <lb/>
found by the public accounts, that these two contrac <lb/>
tors received in a former year, the one over £2,000 <lb/>
and the other over £1,900 for supplies to poor fisher­ <lb/>
men employed on the public works. He understood <lb/>
they were paid 3} cent a pound for flouſ and 50 cents <lb/>
a gallon for molasses, whiie, he (Mr Renouf) found, <lb/>
on inquiry, that at the establishment of Mr Edens, in <lb/>
Water Street, the best molasses could be had at 2s 4d. <lb/>
per gallon, the best flour at 2s 3d. per stone, and con­ <lb/>
siueling the very low wages allowed to these men, he <lb/>
said it was the duty of the government to see that they <lb/>
were supplied at the cheapest possible rates, an I with <lb/>
articles of the best quality. There we e seven or eight <lb/>
estab ishments in the town that would supply good <lb/>
articles at lower prices than the Government had <lb/>
contracted for. The gow t asked for -3 <lb/>
for supplies to the poor labourers, and it appeared <lb/>
that the leader of the government had been in posed <lb/>
upon by the description of provisions supplied to <lb/>
them. Every labourer, all the world over, was worthy <lb/>
of his hire; but it would seem that the poor labourei <lb/>
of Newfoundland was not deemed worth of his hire. <lb/>
The hon leader of the government said that if they <lb/>
paid the labourers in cash, much of it would be spent <lb/>
on liquor. He did not ask that the iabourer, shºuld <lb/>
be paid in casn' But when there were so many shops <lb/>
where molasses and flour, were retailed, why not give <lb/>
these labourers the benefit of the competition between <lb/>
them? Two or three winters ago, one of the establish­ <lb/>
ments now contracted with received £2,033 3: 94. for <lb/>
provisions given to the poor for wºrk, within two <lb/>
montus, while not a shilling was given to these people <lb/>
in cash; and the other establishment received £1,­ <lb/>
92.2 18s 5d.; at the same time that not one shil ing <lb/>
of government money went to any other establishment <lb/>
in town. A more corrupt government was not on the <lb/>
face of the earth; and the sooner they were sent <lb/>
about their business, the better for the country. Mr <lb/>
Seymour got £1,059 9s 2d. for supplies to the eastern <lb/>
districts, when the Chairman of the Board of Work, <lb/>
had an interest in the establishment, which he (Mr <lb/>
Renouf) could prove. <lb/>
The SURVEYOR GENERLL had no interest in that <lb/>
establishment for many years past. <lb/>
Mir RENoºr could prove that he was interested in <lb/>
it. There was an official of the Government allowed <lb/>
to open an establishment for the supply of provisions <lb/>
and groceries. He found it was not Mr Seymour a <lb/>
all, it was John H. Warren, Chairman of the Board <lb/>
of Works, who owned that establishment until lately. <lb/>
Why should these labourers be confined to two esta. <lb/>
blishments for their supplies P Why not give them <lb/>
a general order, to go where they could be best served. <lb/>
Let them go to Mr. Loughnan's, Mr. Edens', Mr <lb/>
Targhiu's or Mr. Stirling's and get what they wanted, <lb/>
at the cheapest rates? It would move the heart of <lb/>
any nuan having the heart of a man, to see how these <lb/>
poor labourers were treated, many of whom had wives <lb/>
sticken down with sickness, who had scarcely <lb/>
strength to make the flour into bread, after it was <lb/>
brought home, and to whom a little tea would be of <lb/>
great benefit, as well as some soap to wash their <lb/>
c.othes. It these men were to be allowed only 6s. a <lb/>
week for their work, why not allow them to go where <lb/>
they please for their supplies, and get a little tea and <lb/>
soap, along with their flour add molasses 2 Why not <lb/>
let them have biscuit, if they preferred it, as many <lb/>
of them had not suitaule means for baking P. Many <lb/>
of these poor persons had not received 6 ſ of money <lb/></p> 

<p>since the end of October. Why not give them general | <lb/></p> 

<p>orders for their wages, and let them go to any provis­ <lb/>
ion establishment they preſer, and let these orders be <lb/>
paid monthly P. There was a number of these esta­ <lb/>
blishments; but the government would only patron­ <lb/>
ize two, while they did not give a shilling to the <lb/>
others, who had rents, water rates, and o her expen­ <lb/>
ses to meet, as well as the favoured establishments. <lb/>
On the last day of last session, in consequence of the <lb/>
disclosures made, showing that the organ of the gov­ <lb/>
ernment in the Legislative Council, the hon N. <lb/>
Stabb, received over £3,000 from the government in <lb/>
one year. for supplies for the poor, part of which was <lb/>
Indian meal, seut to Harbor Grave, charged the high <lb/>
price of 27s 6d a barrel. and which afterwards turned <lb/>
sour, and was sold at 10s a barrel; in consequence of <lb/>
these disclosures, Mr. Wyatt gave notice that <lb/>
on the first day of this session he would move that all <lb/>
supplies tor the poor should be tendered for on pub­ <lb/>
lic notice by advertisement; and why P. Because his <lb/>
establishment and ottiers were overlooked, while so <lb/>
much was given to the organ of the Government. <lb/>
But what had become of the hon member's notice? <lb/>
Why had be not proceeded with it? <lb/>
Mr. WYATT.-His notice would not have effected <lb/>
these contracts. That matter had been arranged pre­ <lb/>
vious to the meeting of the house. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. RENour questioned if the government would <lb/>
have done anything for the poor, if these establish­ <lb/>
ments had not to be subsidized. There must be some <lb/>
great secret in the matter. What had these two es­ <lb/>
tablishments done to get such patronage It did ap­ <lb/>
pear to him (vir Renouf) when the hºn leader of the <lb/>
government sta'al that tenders were received, as <lb/>
somewhat remarkable that these two establishments <lb/>
should have given in the lowest tenders this winter, as <lb/>
well as when the able bodied poor were employed two <lb/>
or three winters ago. But he had since gone round <lb/>
and inquired, and found that it was as he suspected, <lb/>
that only these two establishments were invited to <lb/>
tender. He found that other parties were very much <lb/>
dissatisfied that they had not received any govern­ <lb/>
ment patronage. . Ine way in which these pour peo­ <lb/>
ple were treated was very improper. When they <lb/>
asked for a little so ºp to wash ibeir rags with, they <lb/>
were refused. Wny, a large number of cases had to <lb/>
be sent to the hospital from fever, arising from insuf­ <lb/>
ficient food and the want of proper clea luness; and <lb/>
they would cost more to the government than if they <lb/>
had received more humane treatment. Ile (Mr. Re­ <lb/>
nouf) failed ta discover that Air Seymour, who was <lb/>
formerly so much patronised, had received any portion <lb/>
of government patrouage in 1864. What had be done <lb/>
that he had lost the government patronage P. He was <lb/>
the same obliging active man that he had always been; <lb/>
and there was, he (Mr Renouſ) believed, some-im­ <lb/></p> 

<p>provement in the quality of his goods; but still th <lb/></p> 

<p>patronage of the government was withdrawn from hi 8 <lb/>
Was it because the Chairman of the Board of w. <lb/>
no longer held an interes: in the establishment? W <lb/></p> 

<p>that the secret? Had the honest and hon end. <lb/>
the government found out how matters were, aft <lb/>
iºd on the chairman retiring frºm it, and tº . <lb/></p>

quºs placed in histºniº That came from . <lb/>

What did the poor commissioners say to it? <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon Acting Colonial SECRETARY di <lb/>
think the party knew how to bake it. d not <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. CASEY. The molasses was also sour, <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon RECEIVER GENERAL, That sample was not ac, <lb/>
cording to contract. <lb break="no"/> </p> 

<p>Mr. CASBY, But that was the manner the Coº­ <lb/>
tract was carried out. Let general orders be giv. <lb/>
and let the labourers go where they pleas. This <lb/>
flour of which that sample was made came from <lb/>
Kiuchin's. He Mr.(Casey)received it from one of the la­ <lb/>
bourers, on the steps of the building as he was Coºn = <lb/>
i g into the House, and also another sample, which <lb/>
he now produced, made from flour purchased at P. <lb/>
dergas's 2', a stone, and, which made good brºad <lb/>
while the other was not fit to feed pigs with. º <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon REgºver GENERAL-The hon leader of the <lb/>
government had no responsibiity in that matter, for <lb/>
he was under ths impression, when he made his form. <lb/>
er statement, that all the retailers of flour and provi­ <lb/>
tions were, applied tº. Tenders were got froſſ ºf <lb/>
Kitchin and Mr. McPherson, and the poor comm. <lb/>
sioners were of opinion that they were as low as good <lb/>
articles could be furnished; and as they were mºnot <lb/>
character and responsibility, it was not thought. <lb/>
cessary to ask for further tenders. The prices wºrs <lb/></p> 

<p>tº: <lb/></p> 

<p>for mol . Any viol of the contract, however, <lb/>
would cause the Commissioners to determine it. It <lb/>
was unreasonable, however, to expect that the goy­ <lb/>
ernment should patro ise all the establishment, in <lb/>
the town. As long as they got sound articles, at the <lb/>
cheapest rate at which they could be supplied. they <lb/>
had a perfect right to purchase where they pleaseſ, <lb/>
Some observations were made about the Indian mºst <lb/>
ºnt to Harbor, Grace. ... That meat was purchased <lb/>
20s. a barrel, and not at 27s. 6d. as stated by the hun <lb/>
member for St. John's West, and was perfectly som <lb/>
when sent to Harbor Grace. . It was purchasad in <lb/>
St. Jºhn's ſor the government by vir. Stabb. It iſ <lb/>
was known, that government required it 2. more <lb/>
would have been asket for it. How was it when the <lb/>
late government we e entering into contracks for flour <lb/>
:9 be sent to the outports for the r lef of the poor? <lb/>
Upon one occasion a contract was taken by a party <lb/>
who had not a barrel of flour at the time, and im. <lb/>
mediatetly after entering into it he went into an estab. <lb/>
lishmen; in Wa er street and purchased all the flºur <lb/>
rºquired at 2s. 6d. a barrel under the contract price. <lb/>
With respect to the quality of flour supplied to the <lb/>
labourers this winter, he (hon R. Gen.) understood <lb/>
from the contractors that sometimes flour at 2s, a <lb/>
stone was taken in preference to that coatracted for, <lb/>
so that the 6s, a week might gº further. <lb/>
Mr. KENT. On the former day the hon leader of <lb/>
the government stated that application hid been made <lb/>
to all the dealers in provisions for tenders; and now <lb/>
the Receiver General said the tenuers were only from <lb/>
the two contractors. He thought at first, when he <lb/>
understood th: matter was submited to competition, <lb/>
that it should give satisfaction; but now when it was <lb/>
admitted that the contactors were the only parties <lb/></p> 

<p>that the utmost dissatisfac ion would exis; P There <lb/>
was now a petition from Petty Harbor, and be (Mr. <lb/>
Kent) trusted the government would do for the peti­ <lb/>
tioners as they had done for the distressed tis hermen <lb/>
of St. John's. <lb/></p> 

<p>MR. CASEY had occasion in the early part of the <lb/>
winter to make application for some of the distressed <lb/>
fishermen of Petty Harbor. Two respectable men of <lb/>
that settlement told him that if they coull take their <lb/>
families out cf the country, they would sooner do it <lb/>
than go to the government for relief; but that they <lb/>
were driven to it by necessity. He give the n a le. <lb/>
ter to Dr. Shea, the stipendiary poor commissioner, <lb/>
and he (Mr. Casey) was told that they had then to <lb/>
go without ony relief. Afterwards he had an appli­ <lb/>
cation from a large number of Petty Harbor men <lb/>
who were desirous of obtaining work, and who were <lb/>
in distress. He recommended them to the govern. <lb/>
uent, and beiieved nothing was done for them. He <lb/>
was credibly informed that there was a large nun­ <lb/>
ber in that settlement who were in positive want; <lb/>
and he did not see why the government allould not do <lb/>
the same for them as for the poor in St. John's, give <lb/>
them employment on the roads at 6s, a week. With <lb/>
regard to the system of administering relief, he set <lb/>
his fice against it. It was downright injustee to the <lb/>
other dealers to have two pet establishineats receiv­ <lb/>
ing the whole patronage, while, the obers receiv.d <lb/>
n thing. Why, not give the labourers a general or­ <lb/>
der, to go where they pleased. As to the men spend­ <lb/>
ing their earnings oil s, irits, how could that be pre­ <lb/>
vented by giving then flour and in jasses, which <lb/>
they could barter for spirits, if so inclined P <lb/></p> 

<p>quire into the circumstances of the petitioners, whose <lb/>
applica ion eviden ly proceeded from want; and that <lb/>
emplºyment would be given them. With respect to <lb/>
the in inner in which the labourers were paid in flour <lb/>
and molises at the two establish ments selected by <lb/>
Government, he was astonished to hear it state i that <lb/>
the Goverument had a right to bestow their patronage <lb/>
where they pl'ased. He granted that it was so in <lb/>
appointinents to office; but in such a matter as this, <lb/>
for supplying the public institutions, he held they wers <lb/>
bound to throw it open to public competition by ten­ <lb/>
der. In reference to supplying the able-boiled poor <lb/>
with food, it should be done by tender. It was the <lb/>
fairest way to get the best provisions at the cheapest <lb/>
rates. It would be serving the public interrst to adopt <lb/>
that plan of supplying the poor, for the more of goºd <lb/>
É.'. that wee got with the public money the <lb/>
ess would be the poor expanditure." With regard to <lb/>
****ion that tenders were received only from the <lb/>
two contractory, it exposed a system of favouritism <lb/>
which reflected anyth ng but credit on the commission­ <lb/>
ers. The Receiver General said the leader of the <lb/>
Government had no hing to do with it. No one sus­ <lb/>
pected the hou gentleman of being a party to any <lb/>
*ach proceeding. II* (vir. T-tbot) did trust the mat" <lb/>
ter would be investigated, and that such proceedings <lb/>
would be put an end to, and new tenders' called for; <lb/>
or what would be better, taar they would give uo es to <lb/>
the labourers, and let them go and pu.chasa where <lb/>
they pleased. Let them go to the snops at which <lb/>
tney were accustom d to deal, and they would get <lb/>
more than they were entitled to, for at this tims of th: <lb/>
year, and with such a scarcity of money, there would <lb/>
be compeution for these Government ord-rs, which <lb/>
were equivalent to cash. The leader of tue Gover.1­ <lb/>

dering how the debt of Canada has begu incurred, and <lb/>
jºhº cause of her large expenditure of late years <lb/>
has been. If the liabilities of that province are large, <lb/>
so are her pullic works, which have opelled up that <lb/>
country for settlement, and rendered its agriculture <lb/>
...tive. Are the instructors to be, those who <lb/>
j the millions of wealth drawn annual; from our <lb/>
waters, while they forget that the people ºf the other <lb/>

bºuntry upon a return of good times, regardless of the <lb/>

Wºmes and the call ction of these stray waif: in the <lb/>
ocean of literature, must have been a imatte'. of 1:0 or­ <lb/>
&amp;inary difficulty; and the arrangement of his thateriel <lb/>
in such attracive guise, proved him to be possessed <lb/>
not unly of nature judgment but ºf, rar: discrimina­ <lb/>
tion. He described the progress of the drama in all <lb/>
its stages—from its rude beginning in Greece and <lb/>
Rome, to its present state, contrasted the chor­ <lb/>
actºr, of the tradegies of Æschylus, Sophocles, ând <lb/>
Euripides, with those of the incomparable Shakspeare <lb/>
-glanding also at the atrocities of the Rºmº ºn. <lb/>
phitheatre. In short, the subject received full justice <lb/>
at his hands, whilst the style of composition was at <lb/>
once pure, vigorous, and concisº. Amusement was <lb/>
not forgotten, and the merry ring of laughter fre­ <lb/>
quently attested the felicity of many humourous pas­ <lb/>
sages • <lb/></p>

<p>}r has been officially announced that this session of <lb/>
the legislature is to be prorogued on to-morrow, <lb/>
Friday. it seems to us there is an tºnnecessary <lb/>
degree of haste in this proceeding ºn the part of the <lb/>
Government, taking into account the business yet to <lb/></p> 

<p>be got through for the sessioi might certainly be <lb/>
prolonged a day or two without detainent tº the pub­ <lb/></p> 

<p>hic interest. <lb/></p> 

<p>Is the Assembly the Committee on Roads and Bridges <lb/>
sat on Tuesday, the Government proposing 4:10,000 <lb/>
sig, as this year's Road grant...There was a good deal <lb/>
of discussion upon the inſair apportionment of the <lb/>
amount—districts supporting the Government being <lb/>
cºred for with a manifestly partier hand. The end of <lb/>
all complaint however, was that the proposed disºbu­ <lb/>
tion was carried by those who had the powers <lb/></p> 

<p>On yesterday the principal matter bâſcré the House <lb/>
wit the Bill for protection of sheep, &amp;c, against dogs, <lb/>
which, after much discussion, was passed through <lb/>
committee. It provides that all dogs found at largeºn" <lb/>
leis logg3d with a Tib. log or muzzled, shall be des­ <lb/>
troyed, exſepting pointers and setters, the owners of <lb/>
which are to be subject to "tax of 20s, a year. It also <lb/>
| rescribes that a rate shall be levied on dog owners <lb/>
by the magistrates for compensation of those <lb/>
who lose sheep by dogs, and that all persons who de­ <lb/>
stroy dogs coming within the operation of this Act, <lb/></p> 

<p>shall receive at the rate of 2s. 6d. for each-constables <lb/></p> 

<p>to be obliged to kill them on pain of fine or dismissai <lb/>

Before concluding, the Direſtors think it . <lb/>
to ask your particular attention to the Statemen <lb/>
referred to in a previous part of this Repºrt; relating <lb/>
to the Mortality of the Company; as bearing. ſhore par­ <lb/>
º the rates čharged for Assurance; <lb/>
The <lb/>
ãuce their Rates for various élimatés, arid, they have <lb/>
as they were $ouhá to do, #. these appeals their <lb/>
most seriods tonsidératiºn; but after weighing well <lb/>
in argumºnté, bropght forward, and studying with <lb/>
much are the #e3elts of their own mortality they have <lb/>
come to the conclusion that they have not sufficient <lb/>
data to anthofise their ſhaking the wroposed reduction. <lb/>
here is no doubt that other ºffices are transacting: <lb/>
búsiness at lower, Premiums, in many places, and <lb/>
prove fºrmidable rivals to the Company, but that is <lb/>
iotan argument taken by itself which has any influ. <lb/>
jºrith'Wourijirectors, as they are satisfied that the <lb/>
Col ºnial Ratcs, as far as present reliable knowledge <lb/>
extends, are faſr and equitable. But as soon as tº <lb/>
are satisfied; by the result of sound observation, that <lb/>
these rates are unduly in excess, they, wiłł promptly <lb/>
give the Assured the benefit. Small Institutions, <lb/>
*...* Jage rates of Interest on comparatively small <lb/>
gums, ſo&amp;ally invested, and restricting their *::::: <lb/>
to a narrow circle, may transact business oh 16wer <lb/>
Rates, trusting to the fortunate Köntinuatice čf sučā <lb/>
results during the lives of the Assured, but with these <lb/>
Institutions the 1jirectors do not place theºlves fit <lb/>
competition. They have their local advantagé8, and <lb/>
may be preferred by those especially máre who can <lb/>
tº part in their management and, * * their <lb/>
jºiding. But in the gasãº anyºne whº <lb/>
looks forward with <lb/>
Jefºred as the lifetime of an individual may be, the <lb/>
Colonial seek a reference as standing on a wider <lb/>
