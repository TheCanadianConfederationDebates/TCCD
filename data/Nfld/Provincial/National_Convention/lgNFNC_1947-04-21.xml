<!-- GL, 2017-06-28, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

<!--<p>
     To tie up that great potential asset at this time for 
     <lb/>
     a fee of 15 cent per kilowatt hour cannot be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as in the best interests of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, more especially when that great water<lb break="no"/>power may be used to develop the Quebec side 
     <lb/>
     of the Labrador boundary, giving Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     benefit through labour returns only. It is my belief 
     <lb/>
     that the delegates of the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     should register protest, or demand the agreement 
     <lb/>
     be re-written or changed so as to protect New<lb break="no"/>foundland in greater measure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Going back to the 15 cents per 
     <lb/>
     horsepower, if my memory serves me correct, on 
     <lb/>
     Wednesday one of the delegates and a member 
     <lb/>
     of the Committee, the representative for 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, said when the question was put to him, 
     <lb/>
     that the Commission of Government did not want 
     <lb/>
     to commit themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I must disagree with you there. 
     <lb/>
     Another member of the Convention made that 
     <lb/>
     statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> He replied. I realised some of the 
     <lb/>
     solicitors putting through the deals were New- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     foundlanders and I was a bit sore; but after hear<lb break="no"/>ing that, we will have to pat him on the back, 
     <lb/>
     because if the Commission did not know what to 
     <lb/>
     charge, the solicitors would have said 5 cents a 
     <lb/>
     horsepower. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We have nothing to show that the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Commission did not know what price to fix. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I did not intend to have anything to 
     <lb/>say on this. I appreciate the point brought out by 
     <lb/>Mr. Hickman, Mr. Job and Mr. Smallwood, that 
     <lb/>the Mining Committee are not all as one on 
     <lb/>certain particular sections. Some of us realise the 
     <lb/>act is not so hot as far as Newfoundland is con<lb break="no"/>cerned. We may be wrong. We are trying to find 
     <lb/>out. We ought to have no further debate until the 
     <lb/>chairman of the Mining Committee is prepared 
     <lb/>to bring in a supplementary report. I appreciate 
     <lb/>the point brought out by Mr. Hickman: if we have 
     <lb/>made a bad deal so far, and any water-power they 
     <lb/>want is to be exported, and we have to issue a 
     <lb/>permit for the railway, there may be something 
     <lb/>to save out of the wreck. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I agree with Mr. Hollett's remarks. 
     <lb/>
     Maybe we can do justice to this after we get the 
     <lb/>
     minutes of the meeting. It is well for every man 
     <lb/>
     in this house to be thoroughly acquainted with it 
     <lb/>
     all. This 10 cents per ton is objected to, and the 
     <lb/>
     company hopes to pay Newfoundland substan<lb break="no"/>tially well! I will give you a comparison: up to 
     <lb/>
     recently the Newfoundland fishermen were 
     <lb/>
     charged an export tax of $10 per ton on codfish. 
     <lb/>
     How does it compare with 10 cents on iron ore'.7 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>[The committee rose and reported progress, and<lb/>the Convention adjourned]<lb/>
            </p>-->

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I propose at this time to give you a 
     <lb/>
     picture of the territory that these particular acts<ref target="#fn_02">[2]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     refer to, and with which the second part of our 
     <lb/>
     report deals. As you realise, in the introduction to 
     <lb/>
     the railway bill by Mr. Hugessen of Quebec,<ref target="#fn_03">[3]</ref> he 
     <lb/>
     gave a picture of that area. With your permission 
     <lb/>
     I was going to ask our own senator from Labrador 
     <lb/>
     who was in that area, who was over Grand Falls 
     <lb/>
     and into the mines, if he would give us an account 
     <lb/>
     of the area as he knows it, and any other com<lb break="no"/>ments he would care to give us, so we would be 
     <lb/>
     in a better position to understand it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. Barry</persName> ....There are one or two comments I 
     <lb/>
     would like to make before giving that word pic<lb break="no"/>ture. With the rest of the Committee, I took a 
     <lb/>
     serious view of the change that was made from 
     <lb/>
     10 cents per ton royalty to 5% of the net income. 
     <lb/>
     We thought with 10 cents royalty we would cer<lb break="no"/>tainly get a considerable amount. We found they 
     <lb/>
     changed to 5% of net profits, and there are so 
     <lb/>
     many suspicions of how big companies have a 
     <lb/>
     way of manipulating their profits to avoid taxes. 
     <lb/>
     We thought the 5% of the net profits they would 
     <lb/>
     declare would not give us much revenue.

<p>
     Going further into it, I am personally, I do not 
     <lb/>
     speak for the Committee, not taking such a 
     <lb/>
     gloomy view of what we are going to get out of 
     <lb/>
     the operation in Labrador as I was inclined to at 
     <lb/>
     the beginning. I believe that this company, with 
     <lb/>
     all the money they are going to invest, will be 
     <lb/>
     declaring big profits in the interest of the 
     <lb/>
     shareholders. and seeing that we are going to get 
     <lb/>
     5% of the profits as a royalty, and 35% income 
     <lb/>
     tax — 40% of the profits they declare — I think 
     <lb/>
     we are going to get something substantial out of 
     <lb/>
     it. That will be cold cash. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are some people —I have found them 
     <lb/>
     in my conversations around the city — who think 
     <lb/>
     because we have this great iron deposit and 
     <lb/>
     water-power, the revenue accruing will be suffi<lb break="no"/>cient perhaps to take care of the running expenses 
     <lb/>
     of this country.... If we think in terms like that, 
     <lb/>
     we are going to be disappointed.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another point we have not touched on 
     <lb/>
     very much, the profit that will come to New<lb break="no"/>foundland and Labrador as a result of the labour 
     <lb/>
     that it will give to our people. We have had 
     <lb/>
     figures given to us as to the number who will be 
     <lb/>
     employed on that operation, and it is consider<lb break="no"/>able. Ican visualise men and families going from 
     <lb/>
     all areas of Newfoundland, and from the coast of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador and setting up their future homes, and 
     <lb/>
     that will be a tremendous help to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some people think, "We are fishermen! How 
     <lb/>
     can this country expect fishermen to carry on a 
     <lb/>
     mining operation?" To offset that, I would point 
     <lb/>
     out that in St. Lawrence we have a mine, and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Poynter told us that when they went there 12 
     <lb/>
     years ago, the men around there were fishermen 
     <lb/>
     and knew very little about mining, and now, 12 
     <lb/>
     years hence, they have very fine miners, equal to 
     <lb/>
     any in the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as the people in Labrador are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, we have a small population on the coast. 
     <lb/>
     These people suffer intensely from lack of funds. 
     <lb/>
     This mine is in Labrador. We want to see those 
     <lb/>
     people benefit — uproot themselves from the 
     <lb/>
     coast and go into the interior of Labrador, and 
     <lb/>
     become miners and if anyone is in doubt that the 
     <lb/>
     Labradorians are not capable of making good 
     <lb/>
     miners, they can get that out of their minds. I have 
     <lb/>
     been associated with them for 15 years, and I 
     <lb/>
     know they are capable of hard work and of adapt<lb break="no"/>ing themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When Goose airport started, people from the 
  

            <cb/>
        

     fishing settlements along the coast came to the 
     <lb/>
     airport to work, and helped to build the airport; 
     <lb/>
     and the superintendent there told me they brought 
     <lb/>
     a great contribution to the airport. The young 
     <lb/>
     chap in charge of all the electrical repair work is 
     <lb/>
     a Labradorrian, as is the man in charge of the 
     <lb/>
     oil-heating apparatus.... The people along the 
     <lb/>
     coast will bring a great contribution to the mine, 
     <lb/>
     and I hope our government will help these people 
     <lb/>
     move from a place where they cannot make a 
     <lb/>
     decent living, to a place where they can start 
     <lb/>
     again in life. I would not want to take them from 
     <lb/>
     the fishery if they could make a living, but they 
     <lb/>
     have not been able to do it in the past. It might 
     <lb/>
     help the fishery if the men now associated with 
     <lb/>
     the industry who cannot make a living were taken 
     <lb/>
     where they could make a living, and newer blood 
     <lb/>
     brought in for the fishery. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have lived in that area 15 years, in the same 
     <lb/>
     latitude, same temperatures, same summer, same 
     <lb/>
     winter, I know the climate and conditions they 
     <lb/>
     would have to live under. I think the climate and 
     <lb/>
     the conditions under which they would have to 
     <lb/>
     live are very conducive to a happy, healthy, com<lb break="no"/>fortable era. When the air base started, men from 
     <lb/>
     northern Ontario came to Goose Bay to work, and 
     <lb/>
     I visited the base on a good many occasions, and 
     <lb/>
     the first question they would ask was, "When are 
     <lb/>
     we going to get our winter? You do not have low 
     <lb/>
     temperatures. This is nothing compared with 
     <lb/>
     northern Ontario. We are certain you must have 
     <lb/>
     more severe winter." They found out for themsel<lb break="no"/>ves that conditions are not more severe than the 
     <lb/>
     northern part of Ontario. What is true of Goose 
     <lb/>
     Bay is true where the Labrador Mining and Ex<lb break="no"/>ploration Company is going to operate this iron 
     <lb/>
     ore deposit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have never missed an opportunity oftrying 
     <lb/>
     to point out the atmospheric conditions and living 
     <lb/>
     conditions, and how they are not to be looked 
     <lb/>
     upon as adverse; people moving into the area will 
     <lb/>
     find a good climate, and will be able to grow their 
     <lb/>
     own vegetables and live under similar conditions 
     <lb/>
     to northern Newfoundland and northern 
     <lb/>
     Canada.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it is important that Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     and Labradorians should take advantage of this 
     <lb/>
     mining operation, and anything the government 
     <lb/>
     can do to get our people, who are not making a 
     <lb/>
     comfortable living, to move in there, will add to 
     <lb/>
     what Newfoundland is going to get out of it. As

     well as getting cold cash, one of the greatest 
     <lb/>
     advantages is the employment it will provide and 
     <lb/>
     the revenues that will come; various expenditures 
     <lb/>
     will be made in Newfoundland territory, and the 
     <lb/>
     taxes will come to the government....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Secretary, we will stop at that 
     <lb/>
     point. I would like you to refer to the sections 
     <lb/>
     which we have read. You will be able to follow 
     <lb/>
     our comments easier. Get the 1938 act, and the 
     <lb/>
     1944 act, and I will give you the cements, and 
     <lb/>
     you can check them yourselves.... You will note 
     <lb/>
     from paragraph 1 of the Quebec act the Hollinger 
     <lb/>
     North Shore Co. has 3,900 square miles al<lb break="no"/>together. The Hollinger North Shore is a com<lb break="no"/>pany similar in personnel to the Labrador 
     <lb/>
     Exploration Co. Our concession area is 28,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles. Paragraph 2 provides that they have 
     <lb/>
     rights, in that 3,900 miles, from the date of issue 
     <lb/>
     until 1952, with arenewal period of two consecu<lb break="no"/>tive periods of five years each, making something 
     <lb/>
     roughly like 16 years of a free concession area. it 
     <lb/>
     is not free, because, as you will note from para<lb break="no"/>graph 3 of that act, during all that time they must 
     <lb/>
     pay, beginning with $10,000 at the date of issue 
     <lb/>
     of the concessions, and $6,000 each year during 
     <lb/>
     the period of the concession. Now this area began 
     <lb/>
     in 1936 for 20,000 square miles, and continues 
     <lb/>
     up to 1953, and there is no payment of any kind 
     <lb/>
     during that time. The only obligation of the com<lb break="no"/>pany is to do work up to $50,000 per year during 
     <lb/>
     that time. Now both acts provide that the com<lb break="no"/>pany must pay the cost of survey, boundaries, 
     <lb/>
     etc., in other words thoroughly prospecting and 
     <lb/>
     surveying the area, and in both acts they have to 
     <lb/>
     supply the governments, both ours and the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec government, with all information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In Newfoundland the company and its 
     <lb/>
     predecessors have control of 20,000 square miles 
     <lb/>
     from 1936 until 1953. They are paying $50,000 
     <lb/>
     per year, at least they are spending $50,000 per 
     <lb/>
     year for work, but that is the only amount that 


            <cb/>
      

     they are obligated to spend. Now I say, on the 
     <lb/>
     basis of the land they got from Quebec and on the 
     <lb/>
     basis of the land they got from Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     we should have been paid, at the date of the issue 
     <lb/>
     of the concession, the sum of $50,000, because, 
     <lb/>
     as you will note, the area is roughly five times as 
     <lb/>
     great as the area of the Quebec concession. Ours 
     <lb/>
     is 20,000 miles, theirs is 3,900 miles. For each 
     <lb/>
     year they had this concession they should have 
     <lb/>
     paid us $50,000. Now they get, after a period, a 
     <lb/>
     regular mining license. It is true, and I must point 
     <lb/>
     out to you in all fairness, that after 1952 the 
     <lb/>
     company will get the area that they require up to 
     <lb/>
     2,000 square miles, and at that time they are 
     <lb/>
     obligated to pay 5 cents per acre for 2,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles.... My memory of the act is that they have 
     <lb/>
     the privilege of acquiring 2,000 square miles for 
     <lb/>
     a ten year licence. At any time within that ten 
     <lb/>
     years they have the privilege of picking 1,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles from the 2,000 square miles, and for 
     <lb/>
     the 1,000 square miles they pick they are entitled 
     <lb/>
     to get a 40 year further additional period of time 
     <lb/>
     for 5 cents per acre. In other words ifthey so wish 
     <lb/>
     they could tie up for 50 years 1,000 square miles 
     <lb/>
     of Labrador, which I presume would be the best 
     <lb/>
     Labrador ore section, for 5 cents per acre, for 50 
     <lb/>
     years. Now they would have to pay for that 
     <lb/>
     $64,000 per year if they took the whole 1,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles. At the end of that time, or at any 
     <lb/>
     time during it, they have the right to apply for a 
     <lb/>
     mine lease. If they take out a mine lease they have 
     <lb/>
     the right for 90 years to export and exploit the 
     <lb/>
     mine in Labrador on the concession area. For that 
     <lb/>
     1,000 square miles they pay a royalty, or a rental 
     <lb/>
     rather, of 50 cents per acre, so that if they took up 
     <lb/>
     the full area of the concession, they would have 
     <lb/>
     payed $320,000 per year in the way of rental. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If they operate it and, under the act, have to 
     <lb/>
     pay a royalty to the government, they could 
     <lb/>
     deduct the amount of royalty that they would 
     <lb/>
     have to pay from that $320,000, if the royalty was 
     <lb/>
     not greater than the rental. in other words, if the 
     <lb/>
     royalty did not amount to $320,000 they could 
     <lb/>
     deduct whatever amount they had to pay from the 
     <lb/>
     $320,000. If the royalty amounted to $320,000 or 
     <lb/>
     more no rental had to be paid by them. Is that 
     <lb/>
     clear?

     paragraph 5 of that Quebec act provides that 
     <lb/>
     before the first of May in each year all such 
     <lb/>
     reports (that is of their work) must be given to the 
     <lb/>
     minister, as well as a certified account by the 
     <lb/>
     auditors of the amounts actually spent. Paragraph 
     <lb/>
     6 provides that the company must in the calender 
     <lb/>
     year 1946 spend $25,000, and during the calender 
     <lb/>
     years 1947 — 1951, $39,000 
     <lb/>
     
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How does that Compare? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That compares with our $50,000 
     <lb/>for 20,000 square miles. Paragraph 7 provides 
     <lb/>that the company can only acquire 300 
     <lb/>square miles. In Newfoundland they can get up 
     <lb/>to 1,000 square miles. You will note in paragraph 
     <lb/>7 of that act it says definitely that they are 
     <lb/>definitely obliged to mine on or before January 
     <lb/>1, 1958, and if they don't mine on or before 
     <lb/>January 1, 1958, their licence to mine may be 
     <lb/>cancelled at the option of the government, and 
     <lb/>that proviso also applies if they fail to comply 
     <lb/>with putting in their claim. We have no such 
     <lb/>proviso. The country could be tied up for 50 years 
     <lb/>for $64,000 a year, and a mining license or lease 
     <lb/>could be acquired up to 8 square miles. Paragraph 
     <lb/>10 provides that they have the right, during the 
     <lb/>period of ten years from the coming into force of 
     <lb/>the Quebec act to have a strip of land 10 miles in 
     <lb/>width contiguous to the area reserved for them. 
     <lb/>That is really one thing that they don't have to 
     <lb/>pay anything for.... Paragraph 11 gives the right 
     <lb/>for the period of 60 years for the concession. As 
     <lb/>I said before, our act provides that they may have 
     <lb/>a non-mining licence period at 5 cents per acre 
     <lb/>for 50 years, and a lease period for 90 years. They 
     <lb/>have 60 years. We gave them, for 5 cents an acre 
     <lb/>50 years, and 90 years at 50 cents an acre. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sub-paragraph C of paragraph 1 l: "The Com<lb break="no"/>pany shall pay to the Government of the Province 
     <lb/>
     ... $100,000." That is altogether apart from any 
     <lb/>
     rental or anything else, but, as I must point out to 
     <lb/>
     you again, if the company operating in New<lb break="no"/>foundland-Labrador acquires the whole area 
     <lb/>
     under a mining lease they are obligated to pay 
     <lb/>
     $320,000. If they don't make $320,000 per year 
     <lb/>
     by the way of net profit, or at least royalty on net 
     <lb/>
     profit, whatever they make they can deduct from 
     <lb/>
     that $320,000. And they are not obligated to take 
     <lb/>
     that amount. They can take any part of it, or tie 
     <lb/>
     the whole thing up for 50 years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Paragraph 12 provides that if there is an inter<lb break="no"/>ruption in the shipments of ore in Quebec, if they 


            <cb/>
  

     don't ship for two years, they may have their 
     <lb/>
     licence cancelled. That's another little thought. 
     <lb/>
     Paragraph 14 provides for payment out of the 
     <lb/>
     annual profit resulting from the area.... I want to 
     <lb/>
     make a few comments then on the thoughts which 
     <lb/>
     are shown in that act....

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would like to point out that this

     is an act of some 24 pages, drawn up presumably

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> All right, but you will note that 
     <lb/>
     there are several deductions that we have in our

     <lb/>
     your attention to these.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In other words our corporation tax on that

     <lb/>
     in that act. I have to point out that with respect to 
     <lb/>
     customs duties that may not be such an important 
     <lb/>
     detail in Quebec, as most of the articles they use 
     <lb/>
     would be Canadian manufacture, but there would 
     <lb/>
     probably be some articles that they could not get

     any duty here it is deducted.

     it. 

            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I was wondering if we need go so far 
     <lb/>in discussing this matter, if we could not get the 
     <lb/>basic principles to tie in closely with our terms of 
     <lb/>reference. As I see it, some years ago we had 
     <lb/>some territory on the Labrador which was, at that 
     <lb/>time, worthless. As the world market developed 
     <lb/>we began to realise that we had some potential 
     <lb/>wealth; later, as the market developed further, 
     <lb/>that there was a possibility there of real wealth. 
     <lb/>Now, if we had had the experience, and financial 
     <lb/>resources, and the political climate, it is just 
     <lb/>possible that we might have been able to take our 
     <lb/>potential wealth and develop it solely for our own 
     <lb/>benefit, and the profit would stay entirely in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland; but we have neither the ex<lb break="no"/>perience, the financial resources, nor the political 
     <lb/>climate, that is the whole thing. Therefore we say 
     <lb/>to outside capital, "You have found this potential 
     <lb/>wealth, if you will come in and spend a couple of 
     <lb/>hundred million dollars, dig out the hole and turn 
     <lb/>it into real wealth, the people of this country will 
     <lb/>get value in the form of wages, the government 
     <lb/>of this country will take from the company a 
     <lb/>certain percentage of its profits, which in this case 
     <lb/>turns out to be 40%." I am certainly not a com<lb break="no"/>petent person to discuss matters arising out of this 
     <lb/>law. For example, I have the temerity to question 
     <lb/>the principle of royalties altogether, but who am 
     <lb/>I? It seems to me that we can't expect to get any 
     <lb/>more than we are getting, and for our purpose it 
     <lb/>ought to be enough for us to know that we are 
     <lb/>going to get real wealth in the form of wages, and 
     <lb/>that we are going to get from the company a 
     <lb/>definite percentage of its profits. But we can add 
     <lb/>something to this, because shares are sold to 
     <lb/>Newfoundlanders, so that we can share further in 
     <lb/>the profits which this company may make. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The main thing from my point of view is that 
     <lb/>
    the Labrador mine is going to be developed. In   
     <lb/>the long run it does not make any difference to 
     <lb/>me whether you tax the companies coming in to 
     <lb/>do business or not. The main thing is that the hole 
     <lb/>is there in the ground. We say, "Come and get it 
     <lb/>out. Pay our people good wages, and give us a 
     <lb/>fair share of the profit, which may average over, 
     <lb/>or about 50-50." It seems to me as simple as that, 
     <lb/>and that we ought not to go probing too far into 
     <lb/>the technical details....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I would like to say something about 


            <cb/>
  

     the agreement as it affects the future of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I would not attempt to go through the 
     <lb/>
     maze of documents in connection with this min<lb break="no"/>ing matter. It would take a Philadelphia lawyer to 
     <lb/>
     unravel it all. I would like again to take up this 
     <lb/>
     agreement in the hope that something may be 
     <lb/>
     done to change it before it is forever too late. In 
     <lb/>
     doing so, may I ask you to pierce through the 
     <lb/>
     maze of expert legal phraseology and see in this 
     <lb/>
     amazing document two of the factors that will 
     <lb/>
     materially affect the economy of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and its people for all time. No doubt there are 
     <lb/>
     other important factors hiding behind the profuse 
     <lb/>
     array of facts and figures, but that I prefer to leave 
     <lb/>
     to the good judgement and discernment of the 
     <lb/>
     other delegates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Two key factors I wish to stress now are the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Falls<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> water-power potential, and the 5% 
     <lb/>
     royalty on net profits. The former is, to my mind, 
     <lb/>
     tied up literally for a song. The other is a joke if 
     <lb/>
     it were not so tremendously important; for 5% net 
     <lb/>
     profits, as you all know, can be smothered out so 
     <lb/>
     completely as to leave Newfoundland with noth<lb break="no"/>ing for its mineral excepting labour.... Apparently 
     <lb/>
     that iron ore should be figured in cents for 
     <lb/>
     promoters rather than in dollars for poor old 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and in regard to this I say that 
     <lb/>
     clause in the agreement should be changed to 
     <lb/>
     provide a straight royalty of so much per ton for 
     <lb/>
     the ore exported. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In regard to that key asset in the great Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls water potential, you will have noticed in the 
     <lb/>
     correspondence between one of the wealthy 
     <lb/>
     promoters and our Newfoundland representative, 
     <lb/>
     that there is prospective water-power available in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec that could be used instead of the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls water-power, which in itself, to put it mild<lb break="no"/>ly, is a subtle argument, yet so plain that I am sure 
     <lb/>
     delegates will not fail to take note; for if that is 
     <lb/>
     so, we may be quite sure that it cannot be obtained 
     <lb/>
     at a give-away price, for Mr. Duplessis and his 
     <lb/>
     associates in Quebec will see to that, and I may 
     <lb/>
     add Labrador also, if it can be gotten so cheap and 
     <lb/>
     easy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hope I have said enough to impress you with 
     <lb/>
     the urgency of impressing upon our present trus<lb break="no"/>tees the necessity of having this agreement 
     <lb/>
     changed, so that Newfoundland and its people 
     <lb/>
     shall obtain at least a fair return from its vast 
     <lb/>
     mineral deposits in Labrador before it is forever

     too late. Let us then, all together, send out a 
     <lb/>
     warning from this assembly that will reverberate 
     <lb/>
     through Newfoundland and Labrador against this 
     <lb/>
     agreement, for it seems to me to be cloaked in 
     <lb/>
     sheep's clothing, yet it is in reality a wolf.... 
            </p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> When it was brought out by the 
     <lb/>
     Mining Committee that a very important change 
     <lb/>
     had been made in the taxation that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would get out of this mining company, a change 
     <lb/>
     from the 1938 act of 10 cents a ton on every ton 
     <lb/>
     of ore that company has exported from Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     to the 1944 act, which cut out the 10 cents a ton 
     <lb/>
     and puts in its place 5% of the profits, I must 
     <lb/>
     admit that I shared the feeling Mr. Penney has 
     <lb/>
     just expressed. I too was disgusted with it, and I 
     <lb/>
     so expressed myself on Friday last. Since then I 
     <lb/>
     have been reading the 1938 act and the 1944 act 
     <lb/>
     and also the Quebec act, and whatever other 
     <lb/>
     information I could get, and today I say frankly, 
     <lb/>
     though I may be mistaken, I am not nearly as 
     <lb/>
     disturbed as l was two or three days ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We know, the Mining Committee tells us, that 
     <lb/>
     the great and wealthy iron mine of Lake Superior, 
     <lb/>
     the Mesabi Run I think it is called,<ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> is coming to 
     <lb/>
     its end; another seven or eight or ten years, just 
     <lb/>
     about the time it will take to get this Labrador 
     <lb/>
     mine going, is about how long this great iron 
     <lb/>
     mine will still last in the United States. Now, to 
     <lb/>
     the steel mills of the United States, that is a very 
     <lb/>
    serious situation, Along comes this Timmins out-   
     <lb/>fit of Canada. Some years ago they got the right 
     <lb/>to explore Labrador — 20,000 miles of it — and 
     <lb/>to stake out 1,000 miles of it some day to develop 
     <lb/>the iron ore. That was some years ago. We had 
     <lb/>the 1938 act and the 1944 act, but along comes 
     <lb/>Quebec, just this year, was it not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Last year, but they were in there 
     <lb/>
     since 1942. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, but it's only last year they 
     <lb/>
     passed this act. We are told there are two mines, 
     <lb/>
     one on the Newfoundland side of the boundary, 
     <lb/>
     and the other on the Canadian side, but to all 
     <lb/>
     intents and purposes it is one mine, separated by 
     <lb/>
     a purely artificial, though legal boundary, and 
     <lb/>
     they have not even found out yet where it lies. 
     <lb/>
     They claim that they have got to develop on both 
     <lb/>
     sides of the boundary to make it profitable, and 
     <lb/>
     to do that they have got to spend one quarter of a 
     <lb/>
     billion dollars, of which about half would be 
     <lb/>
     spent in Newfoundland-Labrador and the other 



   <cb/>
         

     half in Quebec-Labrador — New Quebec I 
     <lb/>
     believe they call it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They say Mr. Timmins is a very wealthy man, 
     <lb/>
     and that the men he has associated with him are 
     <lb/>
     very wealthy men also, but nobody supposes for 
     <lb/>
     one single minute that Mr. Timmins and his 
     <lb/>
     friends are going to find out of their own pockets 
     <lb/>
     one quarter of a billion dollars to develop this 
     <lb/>
     great iron mine, which means that they have got 
     <lb/>
     to sell shares on the money markets. No doubt 
     <lb/>
     here in Newfoundland there will be hundreds of 
     <lb/>
     people buying shares in that great corporation. In 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the United States there will be 
     <lb/>
     thousands. It will be a great corporation with 
     <lb/>
     possibly tens of thousands of shareholders. 
     <lb/>
     Would any of us, assuming that we had money, 
     <lb/>
     buy those shares if we were not completely satis<lb break="no"/>fied that they were a good buy, that we were 
     <lb/>
     going to make a profit, and that we were going to 
     <lb/>
     get dividends? So that to sell shares they have got 
     <lb/>
     to prove that the ore is there, second that it is in 
     <lb/>
     sufficient quantities, third in sufficient quality, 
     <lb/>
     and fourth that after putting in quarter of a billion 
     <lb/>
     dollars, that they will be able to run that mine at 
     <lb/>
     a sufficient profit — not the 1% to which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman referred on Friday; but ... around 
     <lb/>
     $10 million a year since they have to sell the 
     <lb/>
     shares, and that they cannot do unless they can 
     <lb/>
     show the public that there is a good chance of 
     <lb/>
     making a profit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the next question is whether there is a 
     <lb/>
     way in which they can hide that profit in such a 
     <lb/>
     way that when the Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     gets 5% of the net profit, that that 5% won't give 
     <lb/>
     them any money. Can they hide it in such a way 
     <lb/>
     that when the tax assessor starts to collect income 
     <lb/>
     tax, their profits will be so hidden that he cannot 
     <lb/>
     collect income tax from them? Well, maybe so. 
     <lb/>
     It would not be the first time it was done, but on 
     <lb/>
     that point we have this reassuring fact, that part 
     <lb/>
     of the company will be operating in Quebec, and 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Quebec ... is well used to 
     <lb/>
     dealing with great corporations. Not only that, 
     <lb/>
     but you have the probability of the federal 
     <lb/>
     government of Canada itself needing to know 
     <lb/>
     what profits that corporation makes. All right. 
     <lb/>
     Cannot the Government of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     whether it be the present Commission, or respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, or confederation, could not 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin for example, if he were Minister of 
  

     <note xml:id="fn_06">[1] Mesabi Range in Minnesota, USA.</note> 


            <pb n="514" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-04-21_Page_0514.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">514</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">April 1947</fw>
          

     Finance, from the knowledge he could get from 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Quebec and the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, easily find out ... what profits that com<lb break="no"/>pany is making? Have they not got to declare 
     <lb/>
     dividends? Won't the shareholders demand 
     <lb/>
     dividends? I am doubtful if they can hide them. I 
     <lb/>
     imagine Major Cashin would be the first to tell 
     <lb/>
     me that these shares will be quoted on the stock 
     <lb/>
     exchange, and will be as familiar to the investing 
     <lb/>
     public as United States Steel or any other great 
     <lb/>
     corporation The full spotlight of publicity will 
     <lb/>
     be playing on that company, because there will 
     <lb/>
     be maybe tens of thousands, or maybe hundreds 
     <lb/>
     of thousands of shareholders wanting to know 
     <lb/>
     what profits they are making. Well, if everyone 
     <lb/>
     knows it, surely the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will know what profits they are 
     <lb/>
     making.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is one thing that gives me worry. It has 
     <lb/>
     not come up today or at any time. Is there any 
     <lb/>
     guarantee that this town of 35,000 souls will be 
     <lb/>
     on Newfoundland soil? Two mines will be 
     <lb/>
     worked together, it is all one mine. If you can 
     <lb/>
     work those two mines as one mine, then certainly 
     <lb/>
     you can have the town on the Quebec side as 
     <lb/>
     easily as on the Newfoundland side. Apart from 
     <lb/>
     the 15 cents per horsepower royalty, if we can get 
     <lb/>
     the town in Newfoundland and not in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and could increase the royalty per horsepower 
     <lb/>
     above 15 cents, then it seems to me it would be a 
     <lb/>
     very fine deal for Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Somebody said here that I was trying for the 
     <lb/>
     sake of confederation to make out that New<lb break="no"/>foundland did not have a good future. In reply I 
     <lb/>
     will say this, that on account of a number of 
     <lb/>
     things — the fact that this man Timmins is as<lb break="no"/>sociated with Hanna —l I have heard of him, he 
     <lb/>
     made and unmade presidents in the United States 
     <lb/>
     — you have these two very big men — for that 
     <lb/>
     reason and for the reason that the iron mines of 
     <lb/>
     the United States are running out, and for the 
     <lb/>
     reason it is going to take one quarter of a billion 
     <lb/>
     dollars to develop, I am convinced that this mine 
     <lb/>
     in Labrador is one of the biggest things that ever 
     <lb/>
     struck this country — utterly monumental. There 
     <lb/>
     is another thing about it. It is a local company, a 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland company, registered in New<lb break="no"/>foundland subject to the laws of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     They are going to tie up in Newfoundland $125 
     <lb/>
     million. That $125 million will not be here in 
     <lb/>
     bonds, shares, cash or bank notes. They cannot 
    

            <cb/>
       

     slip it across the border. That $125 million will 
     <lb/>
     be down there in the form of a railway, a town of 
     <lb/>
     35,000 (almost as big as St. John's), many build<lb break="no"/>ings and mining machinery — a property making 
     <lb/>
     four or five of Bell Island. is not that some 
     <lb/>
     security to Newfoundland? Some security to the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland? We have them 
     <lb/>
     by the short hair if they tie up $125 million in our 
     <lb/>
     territory. I do not see how they can crawl out 
     <lb/>
     without paying the taxes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another side to it. I was wondering 
     <lb/>
    whether we could get back the water-powers. 
     <lb/>Suppose you had an elected parliament, whether 
     <lb/>under confederation or on our own, that House of 
     <lb/>Assembly is sovereign and supreme; suppose this 
     <lb/>country was not satisfied with the Bowater con<lb break="no"/>tract, or if you like AND, or Bell island or 
     <lb/>Buchans; suppose they felt the government was 
     <lb/>not getting enough taxes out of those corpora<lb break="no"/>tions; am I far wrong when I say what parliament 
     <lb/>makes it can unmake? What it does today it can 
     <lb/>undo tomorrow? Its law is supreme when it writes 
     <lb/>it, and passes it in the regular way. it could, if it 
     <lb/>liked, nationalise Bowaters tomorrow, buy them 
     <lb/>out and make them a government proposition in 
     <lb/>the same way that the government of England is 
     <lb/>taking over the mines in England. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> With this exception. I would say. 
     <lb/>It is true what parliament makes it can unmake, 
     <lb/>but we must regard this as a binding agreement. 
     <lb/>If we did what you suggest, it would be extraor<lb break="no"/>dinary if people would do business with us again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am talking of the ability of 
     <lb/>parliament to do it. Naturally they would have to 
     <lb/>consider the consequences that would follow 
     <lb/>from its action. If it is true of Bowaters, AND, 
     <lb/>Buchans, St. Lawrence and Bell island, is it not 
     <lb/>also true of Labrador? Would not that company 
     <lb/>in Labrador have that hanging over their heads 
     <lb/>— especially if I have anything to do with the 
     <lb/>future government of Newfoundland — a warn<lb break="no"/>ing to be on their best behaviour, with the pos<lb break="no"/>sibility that Newfoundland might step in? They 
     <lb/>may have more reason to be scared than you are 
     <lb/>willing to admit. I am fed up with the way this 
     <lb/>country has handled those foreign corporations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     What this Convention has to decide is this: 
     <lb/>
     what are the chances of Newfoundland people 
     <lb/>
     having a decent living? What are the chances of 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Newfoundland balancing its 
     <lb/>
     budget? As far as this report is concemed we have 
    

            <pb n="515" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-04-21_Page_0515.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">April 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">515</fw>
         

     to consider it in the light of these things. Regard<lb break="no"/>less of our desire to knock the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, what we have to decide is what 
     <lb/>
     bearing will this Mining and Exploration Com<lb break="no"/>pany have on the future ability of this country, its 
     <lb/>
     people and its government, to be self-supporting? 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p>Personally, I am quite satisfied. I have my 
     <lb/>doubts about the fishery, doubts about other ac<lb break="no"/>tivities. But so far as Labrador is concerned, I say 
     <lb/>cheerfully and willingly that this, as Major 
     <lb/>Cashin says, is the biggest long-range thing that 
     <lb/>has come to this country: so big that we get lost 
     <lb/>in the details of these acts. Let us not get lost in 
     <lb/>the details. If this company will provide a town 
     <lb/>of 35,000, its wages will provide the future 
     <lb/>government of Newfoundland with an amount of 
     <lb/>maybe 1.5 million a year.

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Before we go any further on the 
     <lb/>matter, I would like to draw your attention to the

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That figure of $125 million 
     <lb/>Mr. Cook assures me, will be for the railway and 
     <lb/>the mine in Newfoundland. He is satisfied that is 
     <lb/>the figure that will be spent in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>alone. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With respect to the income tax, you have 
     <lb/>
     before you the Income Tax Consolidation Act, 
     <lb/>
     1944. When Mr. Allen was before the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee, we asked what the position would be if the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Mining and Exploration Company was 
     <lb/>
     controlled by a parent company, which was a 
     <lb/>
     steel company, and they were selling ore to the 
     <lb/>
     steel company at a price lower than the regular 
     <lb/>
     price. Mr. Allen's answer was that if returns 
     <lb/>
     came in with the price of ore marked $4 a ton and 
     <lb/>
     the real price was $6. he might not know it, but 
     <lb/>
     he would send it to Mr. Claude Howse, who 
     <lb/>
     would give him the proper price. Mr. Howse says 
     <lb/>
     they get weekly prices. He says if the ore market 
     <lb/>
     was artifically depressed, if all the big companies 
     <lb/>
     got together and depressed prices, nothing could 
     <lb/>
     be done about it; not only Newfoundland, but no 
     <lb/>
     other authority could do anything about it. There 
     <lb/>
     would be no reason for them to pay taxes outside 
 

            <cb/>
       

     Newfoundland rather than pay Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     because Newfoundland taxes are less than 
     <lb/>
     Canadian corporation taxes.... His point was 
     <lb/>
     there would be no reason for the companies to 
     <lb/>
     diddle the returns; they would have to pay bigger 
     <lb/>
     profit or income tax outside Newfoundland than 
     <lb/>
     inside. He has the right, if they put in returns he 
     <lb/>
     considers not fair, when dealing with an inter<lb break="no"/>locking company, to go into the matter and deter<lb break="no"/>mine what the fair amount is. Our paragraph 
     <lb/>
     commenting on the suggestion there might be 
     <lb/>
     depreciation value is not critically correct from 
     <lb/>
     the explanation we have now. I believe most of 
     <lb/>
     us are satisfied, we have to admit that now.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I am not going to say much in can 
     <lb/>
     nectin with the Mining Report because I do not 
     <lb/>
     know too much about acts.... As far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned, I think we have gotten a raw deal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I am open to convincing on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador deal. I would like to make certain it is 
     <lb/>
     not a raw deal. I rather resent the approach made 
     <lb/>
     to this matter by some speakers. Some people 
     <lb/>
     went so far as to say that it was not our business 
     <lb/>
     whether we got a good deal or a bad deal. Now 
     <lb/>
     that's wild. Newfoundland's present position is 
     <lb/>
     probably entirely due to the fact that in the past 
     <lb/>
     we did not get deals that were so good. We now 
     <lb/>
     come to a stage today where we made com<lb break="no"/>parisons, and we have worked a lot on this and 
     <lb/>
     we are still open to conviction. Some speakers do 
     <lb/>
     not want to hear it. Why? They argue that it is not 
     <lb/>
     in our economic interest. Can you convince me 
     <lb/>
     that if we get 15 cents per horsepower it is as good 
     <lb/>
     as $1 per horsepower? We might have one mil<lb break="no"/>lion horsepower. I can't see why we refuse to 
     <lb/>
     agree or disagree after we consider it, but you 
     <lb/>
     actually refuse to consider the information that 
     <lb/>
     we humbly place at your disposal. It is immaterial 
     <lb/>
     to me, but we put it to you as fairly and plainly as 
     <lb/>
     possible. I would prefer not to deal with it here, 
     <lb/>
     and I still think it can be dealt with better out of 
     <lb/>
     here, but I am open to conviction and I hope there 
     <lb/>
     are many others too. We have been a long time 
     <lb/>
     on this Mining Report and a lot of people 
     <lb/>
     wondered what we were doing. Some people said 
     <lb/>
     we were not doing very much, and sometimes I 
     <lb/>
     felt the same, because we could not get all we 
     <lb/>
     wanted and if at the last minute something shows 
     <lb/>
     up and we have not formed an opinion on it we 
     <lb/>
     waive the right to go thoroughly into it, but that

     right is not altogether free here this afternoon and 
     <lb/>
     that I resent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In our Mining Committee investigations, we 
     <lb/>
     picked up material everywhere. Some of it was 
     <lb/>
     authentic, and some was fairy tales. Some that 
     <lb/>
     was given as authentic by responsible authorities, 
     <lb/>
     was retracted as late as 12 o'clock today. Can we, 
     <lb/>
     in view of all this, make up our minds and be 
     <lb/>
     straight about it? We looked back to the year 
     <lb/>
     books and other books to find the history of the 
     <lb/>
     iron ore industry and the steel industry, which we 
     <lb/>
     know nothing about in this country. We know 
     <lb/>
     plenty about the iron ore industry and the nig<lb break="no"/>gardly manner in which it has been developed 
     <lb/>
     here, and we find that iron ore mines never pay. 
     <lb/>
     One man said, "We lost 30 cents a ton last year 
     <lb/>
     due to a low dollar rate and 30 cents a ton because 
     <lb/>
     we wrote a contract and the sterling exchange 
     <lb/>
     failed." 60 cents a ton on their ore production, and 
     <lb/>
     they go right on operating! They don't hesitate. 
     <lb/>
     What is the answer? The answer is that they feed 
     <lb/>
     the raw material to the company away, and the 
     <lb/>
     steel company makes a profit. That is a mean 
     <lb/>
     position for Newfoundland to be in. If it can be 
     <lb/>
     avoided in a second instance, it is well worth 
     <lb/>
     consideration for a few minutes today. I don't 
     <lb/>
     want to force you into it, but I do point out that 
     <lb/>
     such is the position, and we may have a repetition 
     <lb/>
     of it again. True, there is everything in the act to 
     <lb/>
     protect us in the net profits and more in the 
     <lb/>
     income tax act, but that company has a right to 
     <lb/>
     sell out to a steel company. and after that our 
     <lb/>
     trouble begins. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We had a question of 10 cents per ton, which 
     <lb/>
     came up before the government some years ago 
     <lb/>
     and was written into the original agreement. The 
     <lb/>
     company argued that they could not operate if 
     <lb/>
     they had to pay 10 cents a ton, but among the 
     <lb/>
     information that we presented to you on page 16, 
     <lb/>
     there is a little tabulation of figures... Let's not 
     <lb/>
     forget that this Labrador Mining and Exploration 
     <lb/>
     Co. could not pay us 10 cents a ton, and let's 
     <lb/>
     compare their operations with present prices in 
     <lb/>
     the Michigan area. We find there is one opera<lb break="no"/>tion, taxes paid the government, 24 cents per ton. 
     <lb/>
     That's the Gogebic, it's underground mining and 
     <lb/>
     we believe the ore content would be about the 
     <lb/>
     same percentage. You have taxes of 24 cents per 
     <lb/>
     ton. You have 33.5 cents per ton royalty.... In the 
     <lb/>
     town you have federal income and excess profits 
     <lb/>
     to the extent of 15 cents a ton. If you add all these 


            <cb/>
       

     up you will find that that mine pays out as royalty, 
     <lb/>
     as these figures add up, 69 cents per ton.... We 
     <lb/>
     find that the Michigan operation pays 69 cents 
     <lb/>
     per ton, and the company coming in here is 
     <lb/>
     flabbergasted at the idea of paying 10 cents a ton. 
     <lb/>
     Has anyone got the answer to that? Give me the 
     <lb/>
     answer to that, and I will sit down quite conten<lb break="no"/>tedly. But the information came at a late date on 
     <lb/>
     a lot of these items, and we have not been able to 
     <lb/>
     cover it thoroughly or give you our definite 
     <lb/>
     opinion, consequently we have the right of 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and we hold that right, and present die 
     <lb/>
     record to you in that same manner. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I don't intend to say much on this. 
     <lb/>
     but I am entirely in agreement with Mr. Miller. I 
     <lb/>
     am thoroughly convinced that Newfoundland as 
     <lb/>
     a country has got a raw deal in this 1944 act, and 
     <lb/>
     I can't understand any man trying to praise it and 
     <lb/>
     saying we got the best act in the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Who said that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I don't know. You might not have 
     <lb/>
     been here. The 1938 act does not look so bad. 
     <lb/>
     There were some chances for the treasury to 
     <lb/>
     obtain some income from it, and after all that's 
     <lb/>
     the only direct value to the treasury — the royal<lb break="no"/>ties and the income tax which can be obtained 
     <lb/>
     from the operations. Under this 1944 act, if you 
     <lb/>
     run through it carefully, you will find that by the 
     <lb/>
     time the company has taken out all the things 
     <lb/>
     which they may take out, it is practically impos<lb break="no"/>sible for them to make any profit whatever, and 
     <lb/>
     they will be like the mine in the Michigan area. 
     <lb/>
     They have been operating at a considerable loss 
     <lb/>
     but still are in operation, and I am quite sure that 
     <lb/>
     all these mines are under the contract of certain 
     <lb/>
     steel manufacturing companies. I am not con<lb break="no"/>vinced yet that this company in Labrador is not 
     <lb/>
     working in conjunction with steel manufacturers, 
     <lb/>
     because I can't understand anyone spending 
     <lb/>
     $125 million without having made some 
     <lb/>
     provision for the sale of their ore, and I think the 
     <lb/>
     steel companies are in league with them on this 
     <lb/>
     deal. It is pointed out that we will have a lot of 
     <lb/>
     men down there in that visionary town. I fail to 
     <lb/>
     see where, in this country, they are going to get 
     <lb/>
     many miners. We have some in Bell Island and 
     <lb/>
     some in Buchans, but no others. If we put them 
     <lb/>
     in Labrador you have to deplete the manpower of 
     <lb/>
     these other places, and you can't expect the men 
     <lb/>
     to leave Bell Island or Buchans to go down to the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador wilderness, so where is the manpower

     coming from? Certainly not from Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     in any numbers, so where will we get any revenue 
     <lb/>
     from the work that will be supplied there? Under 
     <lb/>
     the old act we would get 10 cents per ton, and I 
     <lb/>
     have yet to see who could advise that that 10 cents 
     <lb/>
     per ton be taken off.... Can anybody here tell me 
     <lb/>
     how iron ore mines in Michigan in 1944, when 
     <lb/>
     the war was at its height, how these mines could 
     <lb/>
     operate at a loss and continue operating? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The same as our fish merchants 
     <lb/>
     do. They always operate at a loss.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Where do they get the capital?

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They had a lot when they

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes, I know all about that. I know a 
     <lb/>
     good many fish merchants who had nothing when 
     <lb/>
     they started and have a lot now. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     remind some of my friends here that in Quebec 
     <lb/>
     the royalty paid is per horsepower.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Installed horsepower.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes, $1 per horsepower in Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     and why in Newfoundland should we say that 15 
     <lb/>
     cents is a very good figure? I can't understand it. 
     <lb/>
     Application has been made for the export of 
  

            <cb/>
      

     water-power, and I am of the opinion that the 
     <lb/>
     country, or the government, should not, or rather 
     <lb/>
     that before any such license is granted, the whole 
     <lb/>
     matter of royalties, both on ore and on water<lb break="no"/>power should be again raised. I would almost be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to make a motion to this effect. I can see 
     <lb/>
     that the revenue of this country cannot be en<lb break="no"/>hanced in the next 25 years, either by income, 
     <lb/>
     royalties or labour, through the 1944 act.

     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> ....We are a country with certain

     desirable end. On the other hand there is a com<lb break="no"/>pany which has capital which it wishes to invest, 
     <lb/>
     solely that it may make profits. The two meet and 
     <lb/>
     do a bit of bargaining. The country is not con<lb break="no"/>cerned about the interests of the company, and 
     <lb/>
     neither is the company concerned about the

            <!--<p>
     April 22, 1947 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Cashin Mr Chairman, I move the following 
     <lb/>
     resolution: that the members of this National 
     <lb/>
    Convention desire to record their profound sor<lb break="no"/>row at the passing of Sir John C. Puddester, Com<lb break="no"/>missioner for Public Health and Welfare, and to 
     <lb/>convey to his family the hope that the Almighty 
     <lb/>Father will be present with them in their bereave<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, this morning Sir John Pud- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     dester passed away. I have known Sir John Pud- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     dester, both in public and private life for a period 
     <lb/>
     of over a quarter of a century. In the year 1920-21 
     <lb/>
     and on to 1924 he was prominently identified 
     <lb/>
     with the political party in Newfoundland which 
     <lb/>
     was led by my father. In 1924 he was elected to 
     <lb/>
     the district of Bay de Verde in the Monroe 
     <lb/>
     government, and in 1932 he became Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary in the Alderdice government, follow<lb break="no"/>ing which, Puddester was appointed Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner for Public Health and Welfare, which 
     <lb/>
     office he has filled since the inception of Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Personally, Sir John and I have differed on 
     <lb/>
     many occasions on political matters, but now that 
     <lb/>
     he has passed to his eternal reward, I pay him 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     tribute in this respect, that ever since he assumed 
     <lb/>
     office in 1934 he has devoted all his efforts, to the 
     <lb/>
     best of his ability, to build up the social services 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, and today we have many 
     <lb/>
     memorials to his credit in the form of cottage 
     <lb/>
     hospitals in various sections of the country, 
     <lb/>
     sanatoriums in other sections, and a large exten<lb break="no"/>sion to the St. John's General Hospital, as well as 
     <lb/>
     further extensions to the sanatorium on Topsail 
     <lb/>
     Road. I feel sure that Sir John was prominently 
     <lb/>
     identified with the building and acquisition of 
     <lb/>
     these various institutions, which are essential to 
     <lb/>
     the public health of our people; therefore I feel 
     <lb/>
     that this afternoon it is my sad duty to move this 
     <lb/>
     resolution and to ask that it be sent to the family 
     <lb/>
     of the deceased. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Mr. Chairman, I think perhaps this 
     <lb/>
     resolution might have better been seconded by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Starkes, who was connected with the House 
     <lb/>
     of Assembly. I did not ever come in close contact 
     <lb/>
