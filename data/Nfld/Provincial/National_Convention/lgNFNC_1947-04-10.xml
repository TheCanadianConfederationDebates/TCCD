<!-- GL, 2017-06-23, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

<!--<p>
     for injuries since my return. I was promoted to 
     <lb/>
     commissioned rank in 1944 attaining the rank of 
     <lb/>
     Flying Officer upon my release in 1945. In an 
     <lb/>
     effort to supplement my pension since my return, 
     <lb/>
     I made application for 32 government positions 
     <lb/>
     advertised and was called for nine interviews on 
     <lb/>
     selection boards for junior government positions, 
     <lb/>
     but was unsuccessful. The other 23 positions I 
     <lb/>
     was ignored. I was successful in obtaining a 
     <lb/>
     temporary position with the Tourist Board with a 
     <lb/>
     small salary in the hope that some other position 
     <lb/>
     would open and under present circumstances this 
     <lb/>
     job will soon end. I obtained my Junior Associate 
     <lb/>
     Grade at Trinity East and have three years' train<lb break="no"/>ing at the Baptist Theological College of Mis<lb break="no"/>souri, USA. My war record speaks for itself and 
     <lb/>
     my civilian character can be ascertained from any 
     <lb/>
     of my past employers. I was the oldest person 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland who served in air operations 
     <lb/>
     and took part in all major conflicts from the 
     <lb/>
     evacuation of Dunkirk to the crossing of the 
     <lb/>
     Rhine." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not going to say much about this because 
     <lb/>
     I do not know the set-up but I believe if ever we 
     <lb/>
     get a government of the people for the people, this 
     <lb/>
     is something that should not happen.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I suggest that Mr. Bailey take 
     <lb/>
     that case up with the pensions officer of the 
     <lb/>
     department. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to answer some of the points 
     <lb/>
     brought up in the debate yesterday afternoon and 
     <lb/>
     last night. Major Cashin asked about the amount 
     <lb/>
     given for special food orders. The department 
     <lb/>
     does not give the cost of those food orders per 
     <lb/>
     district. It is in accounts rendered by supplying 
     <lb/>
     merchants and they are issued on recommenda<lb break="no"/>tion of the doctor or nurse. The question was 
     <lb/>
     asked regarding cottage hospitals, whether a doc<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>tor not attached to a cottage hospital and who is 
     <lb/>
     working in the area has a right to send a patient 
     <lb/>
     into the cottage hospital. It is understood that the 
     <lb/>
     doctor in charge will treat the patients; they 
     <lb/>
     charge $4 for services for hospital outside the 
     <lb/>
     area. Some member asked regarding salaries of 
     <lb/>
     district nurses for Harbour Breton, I believe. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEN3">Mr. Spencer</persName> I did not ask for any particular 
     <lb/>section. I asked if there were two nurses, why 
     <lb/>were the amounts different. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> The $4,866.73 charged up for 
     <lb/>
     Harbour Breton is the salaries of the district nur<lb break="no"/>ses of the area, and not in the cottage hospital 
     <lb/>
     alone. The district nurse looks after the area, of 
     <lb/>
     which the hospital is the head. In regard to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Penney's question, the answer is not yet avail<lb break="no"/>able. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>[The section was adopted, and the committee<lb/>then adopted the report as a whole. The commit<lb break="no"/>tee rose and so reporled to the Convention]<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In deference to Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     who raised the question in connection with this 
     <lb/>
     report, its further consideration should be 
     <lb/>
     deferred. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Crosbie I move that this report be not 
     <lb/>
     adopted or received until the Convention and the 
     <lb/>
     public have received the full report regarding a 
     <lb/>
     secret and confidential report¹ given the mem<lb break="no"/>bers in private session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If I may offer you a suggestion, 
     <lb/>
     the best thing to do is to defer it until tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
     That keeps it before the House and we can always 
     <lb/>
     defer it from day to day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy I second that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Moved and seconded that this

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I would like to inform you that the 
     <lb/>
     report which you have in front of you is not

     complete insofar as the mimeographing is con<lb break="no"/>cerned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Subject to your approval, I would like to go 
     <lb/>
     ahead this afternoon with the sections that are 
     <lb/>
     completed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As you will note, the report is divided into nine 
     <lb/>
     sections, made up of the introduction, sections on 
     <lb/>
     Buchans, Bell Island, St. Lawrence, sections 
     <lb/>
     dealing with coal and copper, a section dealing 
     <lb/>
     with various other minerals in the country, and a 
     <lb/>
     table comprising the water-power. Insofar as the 
     <lb/>
     water-power is concerned the Committee felt it 
     <lb/>
     was not strictly a part of its job, but as no other 
     <lb/>
     committee did it, we brought in what we could 
     <lb/>
     on that subject. The other sections left are those 
     <lb/>
     on Labrador and the section containing the sum<lb break="no"/>mary.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I don't intend to comment on the contents of 
     <lb/>
     the report before you, as the introduction deals 
     <lb/>
     very fully with the report itself. I would like, 
     <lb/>
     however, to thank the members of the Mining 
     <lb/>
     Committee for their co-operation in the prepara<lb break="no"/>tion of this report. The Committee worked ex<lb break="no"/>tremely hard and, as none of us, with the 
     <lb/>
     exception of Mr. Jackman, had any real 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the mining industry, it took us a 
     <lb/>
     little longer to get the information and digest the 
     <lb/>
     facts necessary to compile this report.... I suggest 
     <lb/>
     that we might deal with it in sections, taking the 
     <lb/>
     introduction first.

     the next section, which is really part of the intro<lb break="no"/>duction, or is there any question on the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion? I will be glad to answer them now.

     There is no reason why this should not be held

     precarious, and they have to go to outside

     markets, and it looks to me as if the value of the 
     <lb/>
     Buchans mining output will be greatly increased, 
     <lb/>
     and this will no doubt add to our national income. 
     <lb/>
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I may say Mr. Jackman, on that 
     <lb/>point, I have some figures here that were given 
     <lb/>by Mr. W. E. Ralph, Director of the Geological 
     <lb/>Survey, and he gives an estimate of the lifetime 
     <lb/>reserve of the various metals in the USA last year, 
     <lb/>and for lead he says, "Based on present govern<lb break="no"/>ment reserves and the present rate of consump<lb break="no"/>tion, they only have reserves for four years at the 
     <lb/>present time." That's four years of normal use. I 
     <lb/>understand, in fact I know, that the Buchans 
     <lb/>Mining Co. has signed an operation agreement 
     <lb/>with the company syndicate that has the owner<lb break="no"/>ship of La Manche to begin exploration immedi<lb break="no"/>ately, and they are actually there exploring at the 
     <lb/>present time. There is a section on La Manche 
     <lb/>here, and they are hoping to go into production in 
     <lb/>the present year.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Before you pass on from this 
     <lb/>
     section, on page 4 there is a list of expenditures 
     <lb/>
     of the Geological Survey, I was just adding up the 
     <lb/>
     figures, and it comes to about $400,000, and over 
     <lb/>
     a 13 year period it comes to about $30,000 a year. 
     <lb/>
     I am wondering if the Committee thought that 
     <lb/>
     was a reasonable sum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> As far as I remember the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee does say that they would like to see the 
     <lb/>
     amount increased, and the Geological Survey 
     <lb/>
     increased as a whole. We think it is high time that 
     <lb/>
     we had our minerals thoroughly classified and 
     <lb/>
     evaluated.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Before you pass on from 
     <lb/>
     Buchans, what I am a little nervous about is that 
     <lb/>
     as you read over each section there may not be an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to come back to them. I know that 
     <lb/>
     theoretically there is, but practically there may 
     <lb/>
     not be. This Table III, compiled by Mr. Hollett I 
     <lb/>
     believe, follows page 12. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Yes, that was Mr. Hollett's idea. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is a splendid idea. I would 
     <lb/>like to make this point. This table in the first 
     <lb/>column for each year shows the total revenue of 
     <lb/>the Government of Newfoundland, and further 
     <lb/>over in the table there is a column showing the 
     <lb/>estimated amount of that total revenue that came 


            <cb/>
       

     into the country on account of Buchans, and the 
     <lb/>
     final figure shows the percentage it bears to the 
     <lb/>
     total amount. If that were done on the same basis 
     <lb/>
     exactly for Bell Island and for the AND Co. and 
     <lb/>
     Bowaters and a considerable number of other 
     <lb/>
     large companies and corporations and work out 
     <lb/>
     the percentage, I have the feeling that upon this 
     <lb/>
     same basis you would find that 70 or 80 % of the 
     <lb/>
     revenue that the government receives each year 
     <lb/>
     is paid by those eight or ten large corporations. 
     <lb/>
     Now if so, it would be an entirely misleading 
     <lb/>
     table if it were compiled for a large number of 
     <lb/>
     companies, because, as a matter of fact, the 
     <lb/>
     revenue is received mainly from the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and not from eight or ten com<lb break="no"/>panies or corporations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We don't claim that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, it is because the company 
     <lb/>
     is operating. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> In other words that money would 
     <lb/>
     not be there except for Buchans. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That raises the other point I 
     <lb/>
     want to make. I found myself running into this 
     <lb/>
     very danger when I was reading this table — a 
     <lb/>
     sort of comfortable feeling that the Buchans Min<lb break="no"/>ing Co. was paying a good fat slice of taxes to the 
     <lb/>
     government, whereas in actual fact they are not 
     <lb/>
     doing any such thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't see where you get that idea. 

 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, the table does not say so, 
     <lb/>but the general impression I got from this table in 
     <lb/>particular was a comfortable feeling that some<lb break="no"/>how or another, with such grand enterprises out 
     <lb/>there, and the government getting as a result of it 
     <lb/>over 7.5% of the revenue, almost a tenth of the 
     <lb/>whole revenue, Buchans must contribute a lot of 
     <lb/>money to the revenue. That is through thinking 
     <lb/>of Buchans as an operation, but thinking of the 
     <lb/>Buchans Mining Co. and of the Terra Nova 
     <lb/>Properties Ltd.<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> as companies, it is rather star<lb break="no"/>tling. You see here they have made $18 million 
     <lb/>since they have been operating. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> "Total net profits over the said 20 
     <lb/>
     years were close to $18,672,240." By the way 
     <lb/>
     these figures we ascertained from the facts we had.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I know it is a lot to do, but 
     <lb/>
     essentially all they did was this: put some capital 
     <lb/>
     to work, enough to hire men and to open the mine 
     <lb/>
     and build the plant in which to separate the ores. 
     <lb/>
     That's all they did. You can put quotations 
     <lb/>
     around "all" if you like, but the point is that that 
     <lb/>
     mineral was one of the things that God put in the 
     <lb/>
     country when he made it, and he put it there for 
     <lb/>
     us, the people of Newfoundland, not for out<lb break="no"/>siders. It is just a case of digging down into the 
     <lb/>
     earth and getting it and selling it. The day comes 
     <lb/>
     when there is no more to take out, and the asset 
     <lb/>
     is gone, and the net result of it all is that ten years 
     <lb/>
     from now we may look back with a thrill to 
     <lb/>
     recognise that we had at Buchans a wonderful 
     <lb/>
     piece of wealth, that was put there when the 
     <lb/>
     country was made; and a foreign company came 
     <lb/>
     in, because we did not have the capital, and was 
     <lb/>
     given the right to mine it, and, having been there 
     <lb/>
     from 1927 to 1957, they cleaned up something in 
     <lb/>
     the nature of $25-30 million and went off, and 
     <lb/>
     there is no asset left. That's the hard thing about 
     <lb/>
     a mine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Does not that happen everywhere? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, with this big difference, 
     <lb/>that the capital to develop the mine is usually in 
     <lb/>the country, but these profits do not remain in the 
     <lb/>country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Take Canada, does not a great deal 
     <lb/>
     of the capital coming into their mining concerns 
     <lb/>
     come from the States? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, it did. The point I am 
     <lb/>
     trying to get at is this: the Mining Committee is 
     <lb/>
     merely stating the facts, and it is not your fault or 
     <lb/>
     the Convention's fault.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Thank you very much for that! 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But it is the old, old story of a 
     <lb/>corporation coming into the country and being 
     <lb/>given concessions out of which they clean up; 
     <lb/>well, here's one company that's cleaned up $18.5 
     <lb/>million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well it's all the one mine If 
     <lb/>
     they want to split up into two outfits that's their 
     <lb/>
     business. They have cleaned up $18.5 million. 
     <lb/>
     Have you a table showing the total taxes they

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Customs duties, I don't mind at 
     <lb/>
     all, $2.25 million.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Income tax, there you will see. 
   
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, I am coming to that. They 
     <lb/>have paid $2.25 million in custom duties, but that 
     <lb/>is identical with what any company does. I am 
     <lb/>referring to the principle of it. If you start a 
     <lb/>sawmill in White Bay you have to pay customs 
     <lb/>duties on certain materials that you have to use in 
     <lb/>that sawmill. They are not doing us any favour, 
     <lb/>they are just on a par with every sawmill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, it might have happened that 
     <lb/>
     they could have had free entry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That would be that much 
     <lb/>
     worse. We will take income tax. 1 take it they pay 
     <lb/>
     the regular rates? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> As far as we know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I believe it is so. The amount 
     <lb/>
     upon which they pay it may be according to 
     <lb/>
     agreement, but once the amount is determined 
     <lb/>
     they pay the normal amount of income tax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> You have to admit the fairness of 
     <lb/>
     Buchans, they have given us a full disclosure of 
     <lb/>
     all their figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I understand that. They were 
     <lb/>
     very decent in giving us these figures. They have 
     <lb/>
     turned in $5.25 million for the movement of 
     <lb/>
     concentrates. While it is perfectly true that this 
     <lb/>
     money came to the Railway, therefore the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, nevertheless it is not money for nothing 
     <lb/>
     — they got good service. You can't call that 
     <lb/>
     taxes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> But it is money we would not have 
     <lb/>
     had otherwise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Oh yes, but we have been 
     <lb/>
     blinded by that fact all our lives. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Pity we were not blinded a little 
     <lb/>
     more in that case. As far as the Mining Commit<lb break="no"/>tee is concerned, we realise it is a wonderful hole 
     <lb/>
     in the ground at Buchans. We feel that mining is 
     <lb/>
     a gamble in every way, and they were entitled to 
     <lb/>
     the profit they got. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> This does seem as if you were 
     <lb/>
     defending the Buchans Mining Company. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well I am not defending Buchans, 
     <lb/>
     but the profits. I am not going to get into an

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Let me pass on. They get value 
     <lb/>
     for what they paid in for freight and express. In 
     <lb/>
     fact this was brought out in the Report on 
     <lb/>
     Transportation and Communications. They got a

     lot of their freight hauled by the Railway at rates 
     <lb/>
     which were a lot lower than they should have

     been, and since we brought that out these rates 
     <lb/>
     were increased. They got good value for the 
     <lb/>
     $5.25 million they paid the Railway and the $1.1 
     <lb/>
     million. I don't think we have anything to thank 
     <lb/>
     the company for whatever. What you have got 
     <lb/>
     left is royalty. All these come to a lot of money, 
     <lb/>
     it is perfectly true, but the duty is the perfectly 
     <lb/>
     normal thing that any company pays, and also the 
     <lb/>
     income tax, and the freights, etc., they paid the 
     <lb/>
     Railway are subnormal. Well the rest is royalty, 
     <lb/>
     and what is it? Less than $1 million from 1927 to 
     <lb/>
     1946, $933,000, call it a million in all the years 
     <lb/>
     they have been operating. $1 million out of a 
     <lb/>
     profit of $18 million! Of course we are pleased 
     <lb/>
     that we did get that $2.5 million for customs duty, 
     <lb/>
     and that $2 million income tax, and the money 
     <lb/>
     that the Railway got, the $5.25 million and $1 
     <lb/>
     million for freights, a total of nearly $12 million 
     <lb/>
     in those years, that's fine. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> What did labour get? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> $15.25 million, that is salaries 
     <lb/>
     amounted to $2 million, and they spent on lumber 
     <lb/>
     and mine timber nearly $2 million, and other 
     <lb/>
     supplies within the country $3 million, and they 
     <lb/>
     paid to the AND Co. $5.5 million, mostly for 
     <lb/>
     labourhandling concentrates, etc. That would be 
     <lb/>
     in Botwood would it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Yes. That AND Co. handling con<lb break="no"/>centrates is mostly longshore work.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is a total of $40 million 
     <lb/>
     since they have come in, that they paid out. That's 
     <lb/>
     splendid, and I am not complaining or anything 
     <lb/>
     of that nature. The point I am making is that out 
     <lb/>
     of a total of $40 million they have paid to the 
     <lb/>
     government less than $1 million, if you exclude 
     <lb/>
     income tax and custom duties. Now I would like 
     <lb/>
     very much if Mr. Higgins, the convenor of this 
     <lb/>
     Committee, a lawyer and a King's Counsel, and 
     <lb/>
     a member of this Convention, and who is trying 
     <lb/>
     to figure what the future income of the country 
     <lb/>
     and the future income of the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is likely to be, I wonder if 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins, with his specialised knowledge, 
     <lb/>
     could tell us what chance is there of getting more 
     <lb/>
     royalty or special tax out of them, since they are 
     <lb/>
     taking the last bit of mineral we have in the world 
     <lb/>
     in that part of the country? What can we hook out 
     <lb/>
     of them? What stands in the way of hooking more 
     <lb/>
     out of them? If they have made $18 million profit 
     <lb/>
     I am not inclined to turn handsprings of joy, I 
     <lb/>
     want to know what we can do to get more out of 


            <cb/>
     

     them.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't like to give legal informa<lb break="no"/>tion in this matter, but, as you will note, there is 
     <lb/>
     a written agreement between the company and 
     <lb/>
     the government, and you know the difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     breaking a written agreement. You can do it, the 
     <lb/>
     government can do anything it wants, but I think 
     <lb/>
     it extremely unlikely; it would not be in keeping 
     <lb/>
     with governmental policy for a government to 
     <lb/>
     break a written agreement if the conditions are 
     <lb/>
     being carried out by the other party. We realise 
     <lb/>
     that the company is making a very good profit, 
     <lb/>
     and we consider that the Buchans Mining Co. are 
     <lb/>
     probably more entitled to it than the other party

     It's been a very fine deal for the Buchans Mining

     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I would like to have some in<lb break="no"/>formation on Appendix E. In 1945 the duties paid

     were $137,611.72, and for the nine months of 
     <lb/>
     1946, I don't know if that's an estimate or the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> That's quite a drop, although I

     Mr. Ashbourne Thank you for that informa<lb break="no"/>tion. I am glad to see that they are paying such a 
     <lb/>
     large amount into the income tax, and I would 
     <lb/>
     like to know and feel that there are a good many 
     <lb/>
     other mines in Newfoundland that can produce 
     <lb/>
     the wealth that Buchans has produced. Whether 
     <lb/>
     or not we have these mines I do not know, but I 
     <lb/>
     know that I stood on my feet 20 years ago when 
     <lb/>
     this company's bill went through the House,<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> and 
     <lb/>
     I believe they were looking for 20 years free 
     <lb/>
     customs duty, is that right? Were they given that? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't think so. They did have a 
     <lb/>special rate, but I can't tell you what it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I understand that they did have 
     <lb/>
     it for 20 years free. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I believe there were provisions in 
     <lb/>
     the Crown Lands Act of 1930. There may be 
     <lb/>
     special provisions for Buchans, I don't know, do 
     <lb/>
     you Mr. Hollett? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> The title to the Buchans mine 
     <lb/>
     comes from the 1905 act, and the duty rates are 
     <lb/>
     defined in that act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> As my memory serves me they 
     <lb/>
     were looking for exemption for 20 years from 
     <lb/>
     that time. The argument put up was that they did 
     <lb/>
     not know exactly how much ore was there, but it 
     <lb/>
     seemed to be limited. My argument is that if we 
     <lb/>
     have mines in this country of good grade ore, gold 
     <lb/>
     and other things, they have to be prepared to pay 
     <lb/>
     a higher rate of tax than a mine of a doubtful 
     <lb/>
     nature. The answer given me was that I should 
     <lb/>
     not "balk" a certain company. I agree with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood that this has been a very rich 
     <lb/>
     mine, and I realise that they have paid out a lot of 
     <lb/>
     money, but the question is, has the country reaped 
     <lb/>
     the benefit that it should from its natural resour<lb break="no"/>ces? We have these assets, we know that every 
     <lb/>
     ton of ore taken out of the country is one ton less, 
     <lb/>
     and we have to be careful, and our governments 
     <lb/>
     have to be very careful when they give such 
     <lb/>
     sweeping terms and leases of millions of acres of 
     <lb/>
     land to any company. That's a point we want to 
     <lb/>
     try and stress and impress upon any government 
     <lb/>
     that takes power in this country. They are dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the natural resources and assets of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and, whilst it is only right that these 
     <lb/>
     companies that put their capital there should have 
     <lb/>
     a just return, yet the mineral that's in the earth 
     <lb/>
     belongs to Newfoundland and that is where we, 
     <lb/>
     as Newfoundland people, want to see that our 


            <cb/>
         

     interests are safeguarded, and as regards granting 
     <lb/>
     exemptions and certain other concessions, we 
     <lb/>
     should know that they are justified when we 
     <lb/>
     come to do it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, in connection with 
     <lb/>
     this nine months duty of $5l,000, I wonder if 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins could tell us whether they were in<lb break="no"/>formed as to whether or not the government for 
     <lb/>
     the past 12 months ever gave a rebate of duty on 
     <lb/>
     chemicals to the Buchans Mining Co.? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I can't tell you Major Cashin, but 
     <lb/>
     I have been informed that negotiations were 
     <lb/>
     going on between the Buchans Mining Co. and 
     <lb/>
     the government. I presume it must be something 
     <lb/>
     in connection with duties, but the Committee was 
     <lb/>
     not informed that I remember. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> As a matter of fact the government 
     <lb/>
     did give them a concession on their chemicals of 
     <lb/>
     $75,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now we are getting some<lb break="no"/>where. I think it is completely outrageous. When 
     <lb/>
     I look at the burden that customs duty and taxa<lb break="no"/>tion generally constitute to some of our local 
     <lb/>
     industries, and I don't mean local manufacturers 
     <lb/>
     now but the fishermen and the seal hunters, when 
     <lb/>
     I think of the burden of taxation on our own 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland industries and discover after all 
     <lb/>
     this talk of mine that on top of all that that they 
     <lb/>
     are allowed scot-free $75,000 customs revenue, 
     <lb/>
     it is utterly scandalous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have just discovered this here now in "E": 
     <lb/>
     "Customs Duty total $28 million." But in the 
     <lb/>
     very next column: "Total paid to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government and to others: $40 mil<lb break="no"/>lion." What would that be? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Add the seventh column, payments 
     <lb/>
     made to the Newfoundland government, which is 
     <lb/>
     the payment made to others, and you get $40 
     <lb/>
     million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I see, yes. The total of the first 
     <lb/>
     five columns. $11 million, I don't even like that 
     <lb/>
     heading, it was not paid to the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, they got it.

     Co. was not paying enough to them. They had to 
     <lb/>
     dig down and pay the operating deficit because 
     <lb/>
     they gave Buchans and other companies lower 
     <lb/>
     freight rates than they should have. That's not 
     <lb/>
     paid to the government, but to the Railway, so

     you have to cut that in half.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I had something to do with the com<lb break="no"/>pilation of this report, and I don't want the Con<lb break="no"/>vention to get the wrong impression from 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood's remarks. He seems to have got 
     <lb/>
     the idea that we should keep our ores in the 
     <lb/>
     ground and let them stay there till the next mil<lb break="no"/>lenium. I fail to see what value ores are if they are 
     <lb/>
     not dug out and sold I see no reason why we 
     <lb/>
     should keep them mere. If we go back to the other 
     <lb/>
     table we find they contributed 7.6% to the 
     <lb/>
     revenue of the country. Mr. Smallwood drinks 
     <lb/>
     that duties do not go into the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government. I wonder where they do go? They 
     <lb/>
     surely went into the general revenue of the 
     <lb/>
     country. Royalties certainly did, income tax — 
     <lb/>
     there should be no doubt about that, and the 
     <lb/>
     trouble seems to be concentrates, freights, etc. I 
     <lb/>
     will tell you what Buchans get from the 
     <lb/>
     AND Co. for that amount. We will forget that the 
     <lb/>
     cars are loaded with ore when they leave 
     <lb/>
     Buchans. They send two trains a day from 
     <lb/>
     Bishop's Falls to Buchans to haul away ore. The 
     <lb/>
     AND Company put two engineers and one 
     <lb/>
     brakesman and one conductor on the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government's engine. That is con<lb break="no"/>nected up on the cars owned by the Buchans 
     <lb/>
     Mining Co. The government finds just the engine 


            <cb/>
          

     and three or four men to manipulate it. They go 
     <lb/>
     to Buchans and load up and come back again, and 
     <lb/>
     the only part of the Newfoundland Railway 
     <lb/>
     which is touched by these cars is the railway 
     <lb/>
     between Millenown Junction and Bishop's Falls. 
     <lb/>
     In other words, during the past 19 years the 
     <lb/>
     AND Co. for concentrate freight, have paid 
     <lb/>
     $5,375,420, for supplying an engineer and the 
     <lb/>
     men to drive it, to haul their own cars to and from 
     <lb/>
     Millenown Junction and Bishop's Falls. I think 
     <lb/>
     that looks a very good showing.... We merely 
     <lb/>
     threw the point out to the Convention, the value 
     <lb/>
     of that little hole in the ground up in Buchans, 
     <lb/>
     away in the heart of the country, which would 
     <lb/>
     have been of no value whatever if certain cor<lb break="no"/>porations did not secure certain sums of money. 
     <lb/>
     It would have been there yet, and this country 
     <lb/>
     would have been deprived of a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     money, over $40 million. Our men would have 
     <lb/>
     been deprived of labour to the value of over $5 
     <lb/>
     million; we would not have received over $4 
     <lb/>
     million in royalties, income tax, etc., so I fail to 
     <lb/>
     see why Mr. Smallwood gets so hot under the 
     <lb/>
     collar on this question. I would like him to hold 
     <lb/>
     fire until he sees the report which we shall put in 
     <lb/>
     about me Bell Island and Labrador operations. I 
     <lb/>
     felt pretty hot under the collar too when I saw 
     <lb/>
     some of these figures, but we were definitely 
     <lb/>
     informed that ore is absolutely valueless until it 
     <lb/>
     is dug out, freighted from the country and sold. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that if the proper deal had been made 
     <lb/>
     in the first instance, we would either have got 
     <lb/>
     more money, or the corporations concerned 
     <lb/>
     would not have taken the chance. I am prepared 
     <lb/>
     to state that the less taxes you can put on capital 
     <lb/>
     coming into this country in the endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     locate ores and send them out — I would almost 
     <lb/>
     go so far as to say we should let them import all 
     <lb/>
     their machinery free of duty, the better it will be 
     <lb/>
     for this country.... I think the Buchans Company 
     <lb/>
     have made a jolly good thing out of this. I am glad 
     <lb/>
     they have, and I think the country has made a very 
     <lb/>
     good job out of it too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I agree with so much of what 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett says, that it seems ungraeious to dis<lb break="no"/>agree in part. The issue is not whether we should 
     <lb/>
     be glad to have Buchans or not, of course we are 
     <lb/>
     glad, but Mr. Hollett has summed up for me 
     <lb/>
     better than I was able to do myself the whole 
     <lb/>
     attitude to this whole business. He said we should 
     <lb/>
     be grateful about those mining companies com<lb break="no"/>
           

            <pb n="472"

     ing into Newfoundland. That is precisely the 
     <lb/>
     thing that we ought not to be. That's what we 
     <lb/>
     have been. You have five corporations in this 
     <lb/>
     country today. First, Bell Island. The story, if 
     <lb/>
     that's ever written, of the taxes they have paid 
     <lb/>
     and have not paid, would raise anybody's hair in 
     <lb/>
     this country. Some of it has been told, and men 
     <lb/>
     have almost gone to gaol over it, but they have 
     <lb/>
     never been treated as in almost any other country, 
     <lb/>
     except perhaps some oriental country where it is 
     <lb/>
     graft from the top to the bottom. This country has 
     <lb/>
     been treating these foreign corporations in the 
     <lb/>
     most gingerly way, and letting them off from the 
     <lb/>
     paying of taxes. Bell Island, the AND Co., 
     <lb/>
     Bowaters, Buchans and St. Lawrence — here are 
     <lb/>
     five companies. They did not put any minerals, 
     <lb/>
     timber or water-power in the country, but they 
     <lb/>
     have been taking them out and using them up and 
     <lb/>
     never paying to the government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland a just share of the cost of running the 
     <lb/>
     country, a fair share of the government's revenue, 
     <lb/>
     and when I say "just" I am thinking of the stand<lb break="no"/>ard that's laid down in USA and Canada for taxes 
     <lb/>
     for such corporations. Compare our taxes with 
     <lb/>
     the tax that they get in Canada and the United 
     <lb/>
     States. A little later we will have the report on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Mining and Development Co. I am 
     <lb/>
     looking forward eagerly to what the government 
     <lb/>
     has decided they should pay in taxes. I don't want 
     <lb/>
     to anticipate this part of the report, but by all 
     <lb/>
     accounts we are on the very trembling edge of 
     <lb/>
     one of the greatest mines of the earth. Are you 
     <lb/>
     going to have someone standing up 40 or 50 years 
     <lb/>
     from now talking about the short-sightedness and 
     <lb/>
     lack of imagination of the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland in the 1940s in giving away one of the 
     <lb/>
     great resources that God gave us? We are glad of 
     <lb/>
     the labour they have given and the wages they 
     <lb/>
     have paid, though I am not glad of what they gave 
     <lb/>
     us on the Railway, I regret we lost money on that. 
     <lb/>
     If we had refused to let them use the Railway they 
     <lb/>
     would have had to build a railway of their own. 
     <lb/>
     Instead of telling them to build their own railway 
     <lb/>
     we say, "Oh no, we will haul your concentrate for 
     <lb/>
     you at a loss", and that' 5 what we have been doing 
     <lb/>
     instead of letting them build their OWn railway, 
     <lb/>
     or letting them pay the cost. I like Buchans, I have 
     <lb/>
     gone in there on train, airplane, Speeder; every<lb break="no"/>thing but walk in there. I like the company and 
     <lb/>
     the people, and I am not grumbling with them for 
     <lb/>
     not paying more taxes than they are supposed to 


            <cb/>
          

     pay, but I am grumbling against the law and the 
     <lb/>
     attitude Mr. Hollett just expressed. There may be 
     <lb/>
     other companies come in and I would not ap<lb break="no"/>proach them in the way he has. I would stop it 
     <lb/>
     right now, and any other companies, paper com<lb break="no"/>panies, water-power or anything that uses our 
     <lb/>
     natural resources, I'd make them pay for it. You 
     <lb/>
     have to tax them or tax the fishermen. We tax the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen so high that we can't sell the fish in 
     <lb/>
     competition with other countries, and in comes a 
     <lb/>
     big firm that's making $18 million, and what do 
     <lb/>
     we hook off them? A little paltry $1 million. We 
     <lb/>
     ought to be ashamed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I am not ashamed of anything 
     <lb/>
     whatever. I would let companies bring in all the 
     <lb/>
     machinery they wanted duty free, but I would 
     <lb/>
     plank on a big income tax. If you are going to put 
     <lb/>
     a prohibitive tax on machinery, who is going to 
     <lb/>
     come in here? You say God put the ore in the 
     <lb/>
     ground, well who put the fish in the sea? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> If we don't give these people fair 
     <lb/>
     treatment, they won't come here at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I agree with the fair treatment, 
     <lb/>
     but I say we should treat ourselves fairly.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It might be as well if we left that 
     <lb/>
     angle over until the whole report is in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I don't think it is fair for one 
     <lb/>
     delegate to take up so much time on one subject 
     <lb/>
     as the delegate from Bonavista has this afternoon. 
     <lb/>
     He is surely giving the Buchans Mining Co. a 
     <lb/>
     hard time of it, and he told us that God put the 
     <lb/>
     mineral in the ground, and I suppose it is a natural 
     <lb/>
     inference that the Devil took it out, but when we 
     <lb/>
     look at it right, they give some 700 men $2,000 
     <lb/>
     a year; and I think it would be a good thing, 
     <lb/>
     instead of knocking these concerns, if we gave 
     <lb/>
     them praise for what they have been doing, and 
     <lb/>
     we could spend our time in a better way, I think, 
     <lb/>
     to pray that Almighty God would give us direc<lb break="no"/>tion to find out more holes in the ground, with the 
     <lb/>
     help of our friends Mr. Howse and 
     <lb/>
     Dr. Snelgrove, to tell us where mey are so that we 
     <lb/>
     could find them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> I am inclined to agree with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood and Mr. Ashboume. I don't 
     <lb/>
     think the country has got enough out of these 
     <lb/>
     companies. They are using our natural resources 
     <lb/>
     and I think they should pay for them.

<!-- GL, 2017-06-23, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->


            <!--<p>
     April 11, 1947 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Orders of the day. Mr. Jackman 
     <lb/>
     to move the following resolution: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Whereas it is desirable that the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention and the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     should be fully informed, so far as possible, 
     <lb/>
     of all the facts having any bearing upon forms 
     <lb/>
     of government that might be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people in a national referendum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Therefore be it resolved that the ap<lb break="no"/>propriate authorities he advised that the Con<lb break="no"/>vention desires to inform the Government of 
     <lb/>
     the United States of America of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion's wish to learn that government's at<lb break="no"/>titude on the question of the federal union of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland with the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America: and further wishes to ascertain the 
     <lb/>
     terms and conditions on the basis of which 
     <lb/>
     the Government of the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America consider that such federal union 
     <lb/>
     might be effected, for which purpose this 
     <lb/>
     Convention desires to send a delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Washington, D.C. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Be it further resolved that the delegation 
     <lb/>
     shall have no authority whatsoever to nego<lb break="no"/>tiate or conclude any agreement or in any 
     <lb/>
     manner to bind the Convention or the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> Mr. Chairman, in rising to move 
     <lb/>
     this resolution I do not do so with any undue 
     <lb/>
     enthusiasm. I feel very sad about the whole situa<lb break="no"/>tion. I am a Newfoundlander and I am very proud 
     <lb/>
     of my birth. I lost in the first world war the only 
     <lb/>
     brother in the world I could have as a companion, 
     <lb/>
     who laid down his life at Beaumont Hamel in 
     <lb/>
     1916, for the rights of all people to choose their 
     <lb/>
     own way of living. But I do recognise, sir, a 
     <lb/>
     certain subtle line of propaganda which we fell 
     <lb/>
     for in 1933, and which we are beginning to fall 
     <lb/>
    for again today. Mr. Chairman, I have your last 
     <lb/>speech that you gave in this House when you 
     <lb/>were the Leader of the Opposition. I have it home 
     <lb/>on file, I have kept it for years. I just want to note 
     <lb/>one part of it, when you said that the government 
     <lb/>was making serfs of the people of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Now Mr. Chairman, my idea in moving this 
     <lb/>
     resolution is only to satisfy a number of my 
     <lb/>
     constituents who are in favour of this. I have 
     <lb/>
     listened to a number of people apart from my 
     <lb/>
     constituency talking about the same thing. Per<lb break="no"/>sonally, whilst I move this, I do not agree with it. 
     <lb/>
     It sounds inconsistent but nevertheless I cannot 
     <lb/>
     help it. I believe that if we as a people want to get 
     <lb/>
     down to brass tacks, that there is only one way 
     <lb/>
     we can do it, and that is by standing on our own 
     <lb/>
     feet. I do not believe in getting everything from 
     <lb/>
     a government. As John Stuart Mill says, "The 
     <lb/>
     worth of a nation is the worth of the individual." 
     <lb/>
     We have been subjected, not only lately, but for 
     <lb/>
     a number of years, to this line of propaganda: 
     <lb/>
     "Give me your mind, and I will give you some<lb break="no"/>thing to eat." I think it is appropriate to recall a 
     <lb/>
     warning from one of the greatest philosophers of 
     <lb/>
     modern times — by the way he was a German — 
     <lb/>
     Hegel. He told the German people over 100 years 
     <lb/>
     ago, "Men are not free when they are not think<lb break="no"/>ing." Of course the logical follow-up is this: there 
     <lb/>
     is only one way to bring it into action, and that is 
     <lb/>
     by the ballot, a secret weapon which all of us 
     <lb/>
     fought for, and it is sad to think that the battle of 
     <lb/>
     Runnymede, which was fought so long ago, 
     <lb/>
     should have been sabotaged in 1933. I do not 
     <lb/>
     wish to hold up the investigations of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, in fact I am very anxious to get it concluded 
     <lb/>
     as quickly as possible, because as I have said 
     <lb/>
     before, it is the common people who are paying 
     <lb/>
     for it and I don't want to take anything off of 
     <lb/>
     anyone. Now at this time I think it would be very 
     <lb/>
     appropriate to quote a reference from the Bible, 
     <lb/>
     very appropriate. This is it: "For verily I say unto 
     <lb/>
     you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain: 
     <lb/>
     'Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea 
     <lb/>
     and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe 
     <lb/>
     that those things which he saith shall come to 
     <lb/>
     pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Shakespeare says, "Our doubts are traitors, 
     <lb/>
