                                          <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The first question I would
                                          like to <lb/> ask Mr. Wild is, does he think it is good
                                          business <lb/> to borrow money when there is money in the <lb/>
                                          <cb/> treasury? In 1942-43 the government borrowed <lb/>
                                          $1.5 million; from 1940-41 up to the end of 1945, <lb/> $3
                                          million was invested in war savings certifi<lb break="no"/>cates with interest at 3% per annum. $8.5 million <lb/>
                                          was borrowed altogether. We did not have to <lb/> borrow
                                          that money. What was the idea of borrow<lb break="no"/>ing
                                          that money? <lb/>
                                   </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILD1">Mr. Wild</persName> I would like to point out that the <lb/>surplus at the
                                          end of March, 1946, was $28.5 <lb/>million; since then we
                                          have set aside $3 million <lb/>for the redemption of two
                                          sterling loans, which <lb/>leaves us a surplus of $25
                                          million. At the moment <lb/>the revenue from April I,
                                          1946, is considerably <lb/>in excess of expenditure; but
                                          that surplus at the <lb/>moment is no indication that
                                          increases will be <lb/>continuous. Revenue comes in more
                                          quickly <lb/>from income tax in the first two months of
                                          the <lb/>year. It is not a clear indication of the
                                          ultimate <lb/>picture. For instance, we budgeted for a
                                          deficit <lb/>this year on account of reconstruction
                                                 expendi<lb break="no"/>ture. Major Cashin's
                                          question was mainly why <lb/>did the government do a
                                          certain thing? I do not <lb/>know that it is the intention
                                          of the committee that <lb/>the reasons why should be
                                          investigated. There are <lb/>certain answers that I could
                                          give, but on general <lb/>principle, I would say that your
                                          main intention is <lb/>to get the position as it was some
                                          years ago. If one <lb/>is to give reasons for every
                                          action, I am afraid we <lb/>shall not get very far. I make
                                          that as a matter of <lb/>principle. Actually, there were
                                          very good <lb/>grounds for the loans we raised during the
                                          war. <lb/>The main reason was anti-inflation. It was not

                                          <lb/>was what to do with it when we had it. If I had
                                          <lb/>been able to dispose of the money, I would have
                                          <lb/>gone out for bigger borrowing. We had the War

                                          used <lb/>to give us advice before borrowing. It was
                                          largely <lb/>for the purpose of encouraging thrift, and it
                                          had <lb/>been done to a greater extent in other countries.

                                          <fw type="num">59</fw> Newfoundland from the people who
                                          had money <lb/> to invest, money made during the war, in
                                          order to <lb/> pay off sterling debt. It was not spent. It
                                          was a <lb/> conversion operation. That was a sound thing
                                          to <lb/> do. In fact it has been suggested to me quite
                                          <lb/> recently that we should go much further than that,
                                          <lb/> and use our surplus to pay off external debt. It is
                                          <lb/> required either for reconstruction development or
                                          <lb/> to meet the needs of a rainy day. If we use the
                                          <lb/> whole of that money now to pay off sterling loans
                                          <lb/> or other loans — the only ones we have to pay off
                                          <lb/> — and depression hits us, or is required to go <lb/>
                                          ahead with reconstruction development, we <lb/> should
                                          have to borrow again. Why pay off 3% <lb/> loans when, if
                                          the country went out to borrow, we <lb/> would have to pay
                                          more than 3%? It is extremely <lb/> doubtful if
                                          Newfoundland could go into the open <lb/> market and
                                          borrow at 3% to a large extent. If we <lb/> wanted a
                                          limited loan we would get 3%, but if we <lb/> wanted more
                                          than $5-6 million we would have to <lb/> go to Canada. Our
                                          experience in that regard, as <lb/> far as Newfoundland is
                                          concerned, has been dis<lb break="no"/>appointing. Some of
                                          the work of the local <lb/> branches of the savings
                                          committee was, I regret <lb/> to say, disappointing. <lb/>

                                          if we put <lb/> a loan out we would get $2 or 3 million,
                                          but for <lb/> a larger amount we would probably have
                                          trouble. <lb/> If we went to Canada to raise it, the
                                          investors <lb/> would want a higher rate of interest. We
                                          did, in <lb/> addition to using the proceeds of that small

                                          <lb/> there was some delay; some nations were not <lb/>
                                          ready; then the Americans wanted to get the <lb/>
                                          Congressional situation out of the way; and <lb/>
                                          generally it was the political situation which <lb/>
                                          slowed things The timetable is now drawn up. <lb/> The

                                          colonies, will be held in London. The preliminary <lb/>
                                          meeting is not to discuss detailed tariffs but ar<lb break="no"/>rangement of trade agreements such as
                                          banking, <lb/> subsidies and matters of that kind; to
                                          determine <lb/> their general attitude to matters which
                                          were a <lb/> subject of a white paper. If members are

                                          paper, I think we could <lb/> get a copy. The first
                                          meeting will just be a <lb/> preliminary. The second
                                          meeting follows imme<lb break="no"/>diately and is being
                                          attended by the bigger na<lb break="no"/>tions. It is an
                                          international affair. Then the <lb/> delegates go home and
                                          wait until January 1; the <lb/> date tentatively set....
                                          All international discus<lb break="no"/>sions will be held
                                          in London. The Newfoundland <lb/> delegation has not yet
                                          been decided. Had I been <lb/> staying here, I should have
                                          gone myself; actually <lb/> the Chairman of the Board of

                                          <lb/> Gushue. I am hoping that when they come back <lb/>
                                          they will be able to throw light on the general <lb/>
                                          questions as they will affect us. The tariff ques<lb break="no"/>tions will be of most interest. We have
                                          invited <lb/> major manufacturing concerns in Newfoundland
                                          <lb/> to submit their views. We were asked over six <lb/>
                                          months ago to indicate what tariff concessions we <lb/>
                                          would like from the United States. That is what <lb/>
                                          would interest us most. We have had the benefit <lb/> of
                                          the Board of Trade, the Fisheries Board and <lb/> the
                                          paper companies. I have a list of the requests <lb/> we
                                          want to make against other countries and <lb/> dominions;
                                          they in turn will send us a list of what <lb/> they want
                                          from us. We sent another circular to <lb/> different
                                          associations and manufacturing con<lb break="no"/>cerns.
                                          There is a committee of the Board of Trade <lb/> sitting
                                          with Mr. Howell to get this question set<lb break="no"/>tled. I do not think we could do more than that. <lb/>
                                          We have not only to decide what benefits we <lb/> want
                                          from them but what we are prepared to give <lb/> and not

                                          or final inter<lb break="no"/>national conference on
                                          tariffs would be coming <lb/> undoubtedly to the United
                                          Kingdom at pretty <lb/> high levels through the British
                                          embassy in <lb/> Washington. Some of that might trickle
                                          through <lb/> here from London.... I wonder if any of it
                                          would <lb/> be, or has been, of such an interest as to

                                          the <lb/> success of the international conference. Some of
                                          <lb/> these conferences often start off well and end up
                                          <lb/> a complete failure. What are the chances of a <lb/>
                                          successful reduction of tariffs coming out of that <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:WILD1">Mr. Wild</persName> If I had to say "yes" or
                                          "no", I'd say <lb/> "no". The exchange is favourable now
                                          at the <lb/> moment, and it may be more favourable, but if
                                          <lb/> we are going to pay off our sterling debt, there is
                                          <lb/> a big whack of it — about £16 million in loans <lb/>
                                          and sinking fund. It is no good trying to work a <lb/>
                                          conversion Operation, or paying-off policy of a <lb/> big
                                          debt of that kind, unless you wipe the whole <lb/> thing
                                          out, or a large proportion. The finance <lb/>
                                          <cb/> people don't like handling little bits. I raised
                                          this <lb/> point myself during the war. Major Cashin asked
                                          <lb/> about the raising of the local bonds, and I said,
                                          <lb/> had I known how I could have used the money to <lb/>
                                          advantage I would have raised another war bond, <lb/> but
                                          we paid off all we could. I made inquiries as <lb/> to
                                          whether we could pay off some of the 3.5% <lb/> sterling
                                          loan, but it was not an operation in which <lb/> the
                                          people on the other side were interested. The <lb/> loan
                                          is callable any time now up to 1963. The <lb/> main point
                                          is, when you mention paying off part <lb/> of it, you are
                                          thinking of the surplus, you are not <lb/> thinking of
                                          raising more money. <lb/>

                                                 some<lb break="no"/>time before it was due. That
                                          was discussed at <lb/> great length with the National

                                          savings, and we wanted to <lb/> use the money to pay off

                                          eyes wide open, at the <lb/> end of 1943 we went all out
                                          for a savings cam<lb break="no"/>paign, and it was a
                                          successful campaign and did <lb/> a lot of good to
                                          encourage deposits in the Savings <lb/> Bank and we got
                                          our objective. We knew at the <lb/> time that we were

                                          maturity date, but <lb/> they told us no. In the meantime
                                          we got 2% on <lb/> our money on the other side. The
                                          proceeds of war <lb/> savings were loaned to the other

                                          that you have got to drop your exemp<lb break="no"/>tion.
                                          You have to start collecting taxes from your
                                          <lb/>fishermen. The small farmer or fisherman does
                                          <lb/>not pay taxes in Canada. The trouble is your small
                                          <lb/>farmer and fisherman is, in a small way, a
                                          <lb/>capitalist. He is in business on his own, but if we
                                          <lb/>ask him to pay taxes we have to ask him to render
                                          <lb/>a balance sheet, etc., and how many fishermen
                                          <lb/>are going to do that? If the country wanted to tax
                                          <lb/>workers in industry then we would be getting
                                          <lb/>somewhere, but we are a long way from that. The
                                          <lb/>larger proportion will always have to be gotten
                                          <lb/>by some other taxes than income tax. There are
                                          <lb/>many things to be said for it. Income tax may not
                                          <lb/>be quite fair. Why should anybody pay a tax on
                                          <lb/>his smokes and drinks? If you dropped customs <lb/>
                                          <cb/> duties I think we should have to have sales taxes,
                                          <lb/> and sales taxes are rather difficult in application.
                                          <lb/> In Canada they have a very successful tax <lb/>
                                          through the wholesalers, but the other retail taxes <lb/>
                                          mean an awful lot of trouble, you have to have a <lb/>
                                          system of stamps or an army of accountants. One <lb/>
                                          might check on the merchants in St. John's and <lb/> the
                                          big towns, but it would be very difficult in <lb/> other
                                          districts. Sales taxes are possible, but they <lb/> mean a
                                          lot of work. <lb/>

                                          five or ten years, but <lb/>for 50 or a 100. Have you

                                          would <lb/> give another million. The $12.5 million spent
                                          on <lb/> roads and bridges would mean extra expenditure.

                                          question is how far the revenue will <lb/>drop. A lot

                                          <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But how has the
                                          government <lb/> for 13 years, and before that for 90
                                          years, how <lb/> have they been estimating the proportion
                                          of the <lb/> total wealth of the country or anything else

                                          <persName ref="pers:WILD1">Mr. Wild</persName> There has been a great deal
                                          of groping <lb/> in the dark. These are some of the
                                          difficulties of <lb/> finding national wealth or
                                          production. These <lb/> things can be done, but you will
                                          have to increase <lb/> your civil service personnel. If
                                          the Convention <lb/> wants any further information on that
                                          question <lb/> the Commission can't give you the
                                          information. <lb/> I would not like to give you any
                                          suggestion one <lb/> way or the other. <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Why was it that during
                                          the war <lb/> when the railway was so badly in need of new
                                          <lb/> rolling stock, etc., and the Americans needed <lb/>
                                          railway service so badly that, instead of giving <lb/>
                                          money under Lend Lease, instead of giving us the <lb/>
                                          money, they merely loaned us the money with <lb/> which to
                                          purchase new rolling stock, and which <lb/> we have to
                                          repay? This poverty stricken country <lb/> has to borrow
                                          money for them. <lb/>
                                   </p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:WILD1">Mr. Wild</persName> There is a long story to
                                          that. We got <lb/> big freights from them. The Americans
                                          wanted <lb/> to spend $5 million immediately. We were
                                          <lb/> hoping to get something for nothing, and we tried
                                          <lb/> to do so. The one thing we would not touch was <lb/>
                                          Lend Lease. The Americans wanted us to take $5 <lb/>
                                          million on that Lease. They said they never met <lb/>
                                          anyone before who refused to take money. We <lb/> got the
                                          interest down; we got the terms improved; <lb/> we got
                                          2.5%. We just took the amount required <lb/> to finance
                                          the particular scheme which we agreed <lb/> to. There were
                                          a lot of freight cars. We did less <lb/> than they wanted
                                          us to do. At that time we had <lb/> had a surplus. <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is it the intention
                                          that Mr. Wild <lb/> will not come back? <lb/>
                                   </p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:BROW7">Mr. Brown</persName> I would like to support the
                                          proposal <lb/> of a vote of thanks so ably proposed by
                                          Hon. Mr. <lb/> Job. I have known Mr. Wild since he first
                                          came <lb/> to this country. We had many good tiffs; there
                                          <lb/> were times when he was perhaps wrong and there <lb/>
                                          were times when he was critically correct; but I <lb/>
                                          have always found him co-operative and he did <lb/> the
                                          best he could in his way, and he did a fairly <lb/> good
                                          job. Let us wish him bon voyage and hope <lb/> that he and
                                          his good wife reach the homeland <lb/> safely. I hope also
                                          that he will be able to help us <lb/> in the future. <lb/>

                                          and <lb/> supported by Mr. Brown for a very hearty vote of

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Wild, I present you
                                          with <lb/> this vote of thanks and our best wishes for
                                          your <lb/> future. <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
                                          <persName ref="pers:WILD1">Mr. Wild</persName> I deeply appreciate your
                                          kind wishes <lb/> and I can assure you it has been a great
                                          pleasure <lb/> to me to come here and meet you. I am sorry
                                          I <lb/> have not been able to tell you more or spend <lb/>
                                          longer with you. I was in Newfoundland from <lb/> 1934 to
                                          1938 and when I was asked to come back <lb/> again in
                                          1944, I gladly did so. I think, as Mr. Dunn <lb/> says,
                                          Newfoundland gets in your blood. I can <lb/> assure Mr.
                                          Job that when I go back I shall have <lb/> the welfare of
                                          Newfoundland in my heart and <lb/> shall be willing to do
                                          anything I can do. I hope <lb/> Newfoundland will put up a
                                          good show in the <lb/> tariff negotiations, and even
                                          though you are a <lb/> small country, the very fact that
                                          you are small is <lb/> all the more reason that you
                                          perhaps can put <lb/> something across. I do hope that the
                                          deliberations <lb/> of the Convention will go forward with
                                          the same <lb/> promise shown in the last two weeks. I do
                                          wish <lb/> you the very best success in your efforts.
                                          <lb/>
