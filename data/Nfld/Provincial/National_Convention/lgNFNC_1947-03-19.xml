<!-- GL, 2017-06-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
<!--<p>
     the delegation will bring back the answers to all 
     <lb/>
     the points under the different headings and we 
     <lb/>
     will have a complete story. Of that I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Figary Are we in a position to know 
     <lb/>
     whether the Dominions Office will receive a 
     <lb/>
     delegation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We will not know until the re<lb break="no"/>quest goes through. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Dawe One of the most important things is 
     <lb/>
     trade; another is tariffs. What are we going to 
     <lb/>
     develop? Where will we get the machinery? 
     <lb/>
     Whatever form of government we have, men 
     <lb/>
     must work to live. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> The Steering Committee was re<lb break="no"/>quested to bring in a detailed statement. The other 
     <lb/>
     committees which brought in reports, brought in 
     <lb/>
     details. I agree with the other speakers who object 
     <lb/>
     to this report and I wish to register that objection. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>[The motion carried] 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I move the adjournment until the 
     <lb/>
     call of the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I second that motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Before we go on to the adjournment, 
     <lb/>
     there is one matter I would like to have your 
     <lb/>
     ruling on. What manner will the Convention take 
     <lb/>
     in its ending? In what way will the findings of the 
     <lb/>
     different members or the different committees be 
     <lb/>
     presented. In what way will the vote be taken? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise to a point of order. There is a 
     <lb/>motion before the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Under the circumstances, it is 
     <lb/>
     always usual to allow a member to ask for infor<lb break="no"/>mation, even on a motion to adjourn. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Ihave heard it put this way. After the 
     <lb/>
     information is all concluded, some member rises 
     <lb/>
     and proposes that Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     must go on the referendum, and if it passes in the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     House it goes on the referendum, provided the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office is willing. Someone else 
     <lb/>
     proposes responsible government, and a third 
     <lb/>
     party proposes confederation. These three are 
     <lb/>
     placed on the referendum, the Convention is over 
     <lb/>
     and we go home. I would like to be clear on what 
     <lb/>
     the ending of the Convention would be like. I 
     <lb/>
     think now is the opportune time to have the 
     <lb/>
     question taken care of. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In reply to your enquiry, I am 
     <lb/>
     not in a position at the moment to tell you what 
     <lb/>
     resolutions may be introduced on the questions 
     <lb/>
     of what possible forms of government are to be 
     <lb/>
     placed on the ballot. It may be one, it may be two 
     <lb/>
     or three, but it is impossible for me to tell you 
     <lb/>
     that. That really lies in the hands of the 44 men 
     <lb/>
     (or 43 men now, unfortunately) who sit on the 
     <lb/>
     benches. It is in your own hands. The only thing 
     <lb/>
     I can say, which may help you somewhat, is that 
     <lb/>
     the Convention dies when its final recommenda<lb break="no"/>tion has been sent to the British government; it 
     <lb/>
     has no further function after that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Harrington I rise to a point of privilege. In 
     <lb/>
     connection with the recent talk on the delegation 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa, there is an impression gone abroad 
     <lb/>
     that two of my authorities whom I quoted in my 
     <lb/>
     talk, had difference of opinion. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     correct that. i chose to disagree with Professor 
     <lb/>
     Wheare. l quoted from Professor Fraser who 
     <lb/>
     dealt with the political wisdom of this country 
     <lb/>
     going into confederation with Canada. I did not 
     <lb/>
     imply that there was difference of opinion be<lb break="no"/>tween Professor Wheare and Professor Fraser. I 
     <lb/>
     disagreed with the one and agreed with the other. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You fear you left the impression 
     <lb/>they disagreed on the law, whereas the disagree<lb break="no"/>ment was perhaps on the facts. 
     <lb/>

     The secretaries will distribute the ballots. and 
     <lb/>
     you will vote on six of the 25 who have been

     named. The Secretary will call these names again 
     <lb/>
     in a minute as soon as the ballots have been

     St. John's will hear them equally tonight with the
