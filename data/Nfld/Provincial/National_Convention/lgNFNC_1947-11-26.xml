<!--<p>
     legally trained man, but he would not be able to 
     <lb/>
     comply with the other requirements — namely 
     <lb/>
     10 years practice before the bar. Put it this way; 
     <lb/>
     if he is not a lawyer or legally trained man, he is 
     <lb/>
     out. Even if he is, unless he happens to have ten 
     <lb/>
     years experience he cannot qualify for a county 
     <lb/>
     or superior court appointment. Were any sections 
     <lb/>
     which are now administered by magistrate courts 
     <lb/>
     re-constituted into county courts, and the 
     <lb/>
     magistrate could not comply with the two re<lb break="no"/>quirements, I assume they would be automat<lb break="no"/>ically out and have to be replaced by some person 
     <lb/>
     who could comply with the statutory require<lb break="no"/>ments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think what would likely hap<lb break="no"/>pen is this: we now have courts of justice, these 
     <lb/>
     courts are mainly magistrates courts around the 
     <lb/>
     island. Some of them are occupied by magistrates 
     <lb/>
     who happen to be lawyers. The tendency on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the provincial governments is to have as 
     <lb/>
     many county courts as possible, because the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government would not have to pay 
     <lb/>
     their salaries. They would try to push as many as 
     <lb/>
     possible on to the federal government. What 
     <lb/>
     would happen is, in certain districts where they 
     <lb/>
     have lawyers as magistrates, they would be con<lb break="no"/>stituted county courts; or if no lawyer, then the 
     <lb/>
     magistrate would be shifted to a district which 
     <lb/>
     would still be a magistrate's district and a lawyer 
     <lb/>
     put in his place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> For all practical reasons, Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls, Corner Brook and Bell Island would un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly follow the practice employed in the 
     <lb/>
     Maritimes. As I know it, and I have been a 
     <lb/>
     member of that bar for 14 years, these would 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     become county courts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I am not satisfied. Who pays the 
     <lb/>
     salaries of these other magistrates? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> It would be a charge on the 
     <lb/>
     province? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The province pays the salaries 
     <lb/>
     of all magistrates who are not federal judges or 
     <lb/>
     magistrates. The federal government pays all 
     <lb/>
     county court judges. Naturally they would try to 
     <lb/>
     have as many federal judges as possible and as 
     <lb/>
     few provincial judges as possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The answer to Mr. Crosbie's 
     <lb/>
     question is that magistrates would be paid by the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wonder could we read the 
     <lb/>
     next clause? I do not suggest we want to finish 
     <lb/>
     the debate or begin the debate on it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I would suggest that we start that 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Quite agreeable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> As Mr. Crosbie and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood point out, perhaps it would be just as

     <lb/>
     of the next clause until tomorrow.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I move item 2 
     <lb/>on the order paper, and in doing so, I would like 
     <lb/>to make a brief explanation. A few days ago in 
     <lb/>the debate on this order in committee of the whole 
     <lb/>a rather heated exchange, at least on my side, took 
     <lb/>place between Mr. Higgins and myself. I got 
     <lb/>angry, as the Convention may recall, and in the 
     <lb/>course of my remarks said, "All right, let's have 
     <lb/>a showdown, and the whole story will come out". 
     <lb/>I don't know the exact words I used, but I con<lb break="no"/>veyed the impression that there was a story to 
     <lb/>come out. There was nothing out of the way. I 
     <lb/>was not referring to anything that happened in 
     <lb/>Ottawa, and did not even have that in my mind. I 
     <lb/>was thinking of something altogether different, 
     <lb/>and I would like that to be thoroughly understood. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is clear therefore you never 
     <lb/>intended to convey the impression that there was 
     <lb/>room for the slightest doubt upon the integrity 
     <lb/>and character and efficiency of Mr. Higgins. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was not referring to that at all. 
     <lb/>I may go so far as to say this, that the delegation 
     <lb/>in Ottawa were the best possible friends. We 
     <lb/>worked together, we collaborated, each man did 
     <lb/>his work, and his fair share, and there was no bad 
     <lb/>feeling. Mr. Higgins and I worked together on 
     <lb/>several things that the other members of the 
     <lb/>delegation did not work on, on the matter of 
     <lb/>housing for example, because Mr. Higgins hap<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
        pens to be very keenly interested in housing in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's; as I said here yesterday, we had gone to 
     <lb/>
     spend some hours one day talking with the head 
     <lb/>
     of the housing outfit of Canada. We worked 
     <lb/>
     together, as the whole delegation did, and there 
     <lb/>
     was not the slightest suggestion in the world that 
     <lb/>
     the whole seven of us did not work together and 
     <lb/>
     co-operate as Newfoundlanders and as friends, 
     <lb/>
     finding out all we could for the benefit of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention and this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, last night we 
     <lb/>
     finished clause 6 and were ready to go on with 
     <lb/>
     clause 7; well, actually, clauses 7, 8 and 9, and a 
     <lb/>
     number of clauses from here on are under the 
     <lb/>
     general heading "Financial Arrangement". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, with one qualification, and 
     <lb/>
     that is subsection 7 of clause 5 which was 
     <lb/>
     deferred pending the attendance of Mr. Ballam. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I don't know whether it is Mr. Ballam's 
     <lb/>
     intention to address himself on this question or 
     <lb/>
     not, or what the reason was. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think he just wanted to be 
   

            <cb/>
          

     present while we were debating the matter of 
     <lb/>
     pensions and rehabilitation of war veterans and 
     <lb/>
     merchant seamen; I don't understand that it is his 
     <lb/>
     desire to have it gone into at this particular mo<lb break="no"/>ment. We are to go back to it before the debate is 
     <lb/>
     over. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, so that we won't 
     <lb/>
     have to go back again, there are a couple of 
     <lb/>
     matters that I believe the chairman passed over. 
     <lb/>
     One was housing. I believe he said he did not 
     <lb/>
     have his notes there at the time. I don't know if 
     <lb/>
     he discussed it afterwards, but rather than go back

     again over a three page memorandum on the 
     <lb/>
     situation I thought we might finish it now, if that 
     <lb/>
     is satisfactory to Mr. Smallwood. 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, certainly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> This particular memo was 
     <lb/>prepared while we were in Ottawa, and submitted 
     <lb/>to Mr. Mansur at the time, and he agreed to it 
     <lb/>basically — the position of the housing acts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think maybe Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>would not mind if I pointed out that it was Mr. 
     <lb/>Higgins himself who raised this question. Mr. 
     <lb/>Mansur, the head of the Central Mortgage and 
     <lb/>Housing Corporation, I think it is called, could 
     <lb/>only tell us what happens and what can be done 
     <lb/>under the existing arrangements in Canada, and 
     <lb/>if these existing arrangements do not cover our 
     <lb/>Newfoundland situation in the matter of housing, 
     <lb/>then it would become a matter for the minister 
     <lb/>himself; that is the Right Honourable C.D. Howe, 
     <lb/>the minister in charge of that department. Mr. 
     <lb/>Higgins raised the matter with Mr. Howe himself, 
     <lb/>and my recollection is that Mr. Howe said he had 
     <lb/>no doubt that something could be worked out to 
     <lb/>cover the Newfoundland situation from the 
     <lb/>standpoint of housing, but that that would be a 
     <lb/>matter for the future. It was not something that he 
     <lb/>could very well do until and unless New<lb break="no"/>foundland became a province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, well, if you don't mind Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood, if there are any remarks that you 
     <lb/>wish to address based upon what Mr. Higgins has 
     <lb/>to say, I think it would be time to make them later. 
     <lb/>At the moment I am interested in what Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins has to say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">[Mr. Higgins read a summary of Canadian hous<lb break="no"/>ing acts, and information about the committee]</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Now with reference to the few 
     <lb/>remarks that Mr. Smallwood made, I was prin<lb break="no"/>cipally interested in the St. John's Housing Cor<lb break="no"/>poration, and the possibility of obtaining further 
     <lb/>loans under the set-up of their Housing Associa<lb break="no"/>tion up there, and Mr. Mansur and Mr. Howe 
     <lb/>explained that under the present set-up it would 
     <lb/>be impossible to obtain financing for the St. 
     <lb/>John's Housing Corporation. But at the last plen<lb break="no"/>ary session Mr. Howe informally told us that it 
     <lb/>was possible that some legislation would be 
     <lb/>provided whereby loans could be made for the St. 
     <lb/>John's Housing Corporation to continue its 
     <lb/>operations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I want to go a little further, not on the 
   

            <cb/>
          

     Housing Corporation, but just to bring matters up 
     <lb/>
     to date, so that we won't have to go back over 
     <lb/>
     them again. When we were discussing the para<lb break="no"/>graph 5, the Newfoundland Railway, I believe a 
     <lb/>
     question was asked as to whether the present 
     <lb/>
     employees of the Railway would be retained. 
     <lb/>
     And I believe the answer was that they would be 
     <lb/>
     retained.... As you know the committee dealing 
     <lb/>
     with transportation consisted of Mr. Ballam, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood and myself, and we met with the 
     <lb/>
     committee set up by the Canadian govemment, 
     <lb/>
     consisting of Mr. Fairweather of the CNR and 
     <lb/>
     some other officials. As a result of that meeting, 
     <lb/>
     and the facts we gave them, the report made by 
     <lb/>
     the Vice-President and those associated with him 
     <lb/>
     was given to each member of our committee.... 
     <lb/>
     Look for Appendix 7 (Black Book, Volume 2), 
     <lb/>
     and you will see a preliminary statement of what 
     <lb/>
     would be involved in the integration of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland railway and steamship system with the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian railway system.... This particular part 
     <lb/>
     of the report was not included in the Black Book: 
     <lb/>
     "It is not anticipated that the re-arrangement of 
     <lb/>
     the organisation and other duties of the ad<lb break="no"/>ministrative personnel would result in demotions 
     <lb/>
     or dismissals, although no assurance should be 
     <lb/>
     given on that point, since it would be necessary 
     <lb/>
     to have discretionary power to deal with situa<lb break="no"/>tions as they might arise".... Now you have there: 
     <lb/>
     "It is noted that the staff of the railway at the 
     <lb/>
     present time numbers 2,990, and of the steamers 
     <lb/>
     761, a total of 3,751" ... but this is not included: 
     <lb/>
     "This looks to be an undue number in relation to 
     <lb/>
     the size of the operation, but only a careful, 
     <lb/>
     detailed study would reveal whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     staff would likely be decreased under Canadian 
     <lb/>
     National administration".... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now that is all on that, but before I finish I 
     <lb/>
     want to get it all over and done with, and there 
     <lb/>
     was a debate yesterday on the advantages that 
     <lb/>
     would accrue to Prince Edward Island under con<lb break="no"/>federation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There were some questions 
     <lb/>
     asked, I believe, by Mr. Bailey.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I think there was quite a bit yester<lb break="no"/>day.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Not on the advantages or other<lb break="no"/>wise accruing to Prince Edward Island. There 
     <lb/>
     was some discussion of the ferry service. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There was a discussion in a

     qualified sense on the advantages of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion to Prince Edward Island insofar as it affected 
     <lb/>
     the ferry service between Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     and the mainland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> And arising out of that, sir, do you 
     <lb/>
     permit me to admit any reference as to the value 
     <lb/>
     of confederation to Prince Edward Island at the 
     <lb/>
     same time? I understood it was opened up for that 
     <lb/>
     one aspect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is rather a wide field if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins opens that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I did not intend making any speech 
     <lb/>
     myself, I was merely quoting, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     from the Premier. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Of course it was opened up, but 
     <lb/>
     not altogether in a general sense. The discussion 
     <lb/>
     thus far, if I remember correctly, was confined to 
     <lb/>
     a specific aspect of the advantages of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion to Prince Edward Island, and I.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Was not the statement made that 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island had improved as a result of 
     <lb/>
     confederation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, it was restricted to the ferry 
     <lb/>
     service only. That point was discussed, and the 
     <lb/>
     impression I gathered was that Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island had benefitted in that particular only. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, would you permit me to refer 
     <lb/>you to a few remarks by the Premier of Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island with respect to the advantages 
     <lb/>derived from confederation? I think it is in order, 
     <lb/>from what little I know of the debate yesterday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If Mr. Higgins is permitted to

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Just a moment, please. Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins is obviously entitled to quote the Premier of

     Prince Edward Island provided he is quoting him 
     <lb/>
     on a matter which has been discussed or is under 
     <lb/>
     discussion. At the moment I am rather afraid, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins, at this particular time it would not be 
     <lb/>
     relevant. I am not questioning your right to do it 
     <lb/>
     in the course of the present debate, but in view of 
     <lb/>
     the fact that I don't want....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It has to do with the ferry service, 
     <lb/>
     as well you know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Then I will ask you to confine

     your remarks as nearly as possible to the benefits,

     <lb/>
     result of the ferry service.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I will do it as nearly as possible, I 
    

            <cb/>
          

     can assure you. I am referring now to one of the

     official handbooks that were supplied in Ottawa,

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I think our debate yesterday was on 
     <lb/>
     the ferry and the train service, and the changeover 
     <lb/>
     from narrow gauge to broad gauge. I think that 
     <lb/>
     was brought in, on what could happen to us if we 
     <lb/>
     came into confederation with regard to our ferry 
     <lb/>
     service. That is what I was speaking about. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, that is my understanding, 
     <lb/>
     and I am reluctantly but none the less compelled 
     <lb/>
     to ask you if you will please confine your remarks 
     <lb/>
     to these two specific matters.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I will do the best I can. Naturally 
     <lb/>
     you will allow me a certain amount of leeway. 
     <lb/>
     After all, I was only quoting the Premier of Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island, and I believe one of the main 
     <lb/>
     ideas he had at that time was trying to force the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Is your point this, that in order 
     <lb/>
     to deal with these two specific aspects of con<lb break="no"/>federation as they effect Prince Edward Island, it

     now becomes necessary for you to quote a

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Higgins, through the words 
     <lb/>
     of the Premier of Prince Edward Island delivered 
     <lb/>
     in 1945, has been telling us something about the 
     <lb/>
     conditions on Prince Edward Island. Let us first 
     <lb/>
     of all remember where and when Premier Jones 
     <lb/>
     made that statement. The Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     had called a conference of all the provinces in 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa to lay before the nine provinces proposals 
     <lb/>
     for the rearrangement of certain taxing powers. 
     <lb/>
     Each provincial premier got up and washed all

     the dirty linen of his province. Premier Jones did 
     <lb/>
     it on that occasion. Prince Edward Island ... is 
     <lb/>
     one-twentieth as large as the island of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Its population is double that of St. 
     <lb/>
     John's, 90,000-odd people, yet it is a province.... 
     <lb/>
     It is just one big farm, and it has only a handful 
     <lb/>
     of people. Ever since they came into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion in 1873 they have been clamouring and 
     <lb/>
     clamouring for more and for more from the 
     <lb/>
     federal government, and they have been getting 
     <lb/>
     more and more from the Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Since 1917, the Government of Canada has spent 
     <lb/>
     $40 million to provide that little island with a 
     <lb/>
     ferry service. In 1917 they built them a train ferry 
     <lb/>
     at a cost of$1 million.... In 1927 the government 
     <lb/>
     built them a new ferry — a $2 million ferry. Just 
     <lb/>
     two years before that we thought we did very well 
     <lb/>
     when we got the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Caribou</hi> on the Gulf. She cost 
     <lb/>
     half a million dollars.... They ran that from 1927 
     <lb/>
     until she was lost last year. They ran that for the 
     <lb/>
     people of Prince Edward Island at a loss of $1 
     <lb/>
     million a year, after spending $2 million to put 
     <lb/>
     her there. And this year they gave them a brand 
     <lb/>
     new ferry at a cost of $5 million; and on top of 
     <lb/>
     that they spent another $6 million to build up-to- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     date wharves and terminals at each end of that 
     <lb/>
     ferry run. Let's look at the ferry. She is the biggest 
     <lb/>
     ice-breaker ferry in the world today; carries 750 
     <lb/>
     passengers, 60 motor cars, and 20 train cars. Now 
     <lb/>
     I don't know how many that would be equal to of 
     <lb/>
     our cars for our railway. The Canadian cars are 
     <lb/>
     bigger than ours, and 20 Canadian cars would 
     <lb/>
     perhaps be equal to something between 20 and 
     <lb/>
     30 of our cars.... On top of all that, sir ... Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island has another ferry that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government subsidises every year. 
     <lb/>
     Now what is their complaint? In 1945 they did 
     <lb/>
     not have the big new one, they still had the $2 
     <lb/>
     million ferry and the extra ferry that the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government was subsidising. What was Premier 
     <lb/>
     Jones' complaint made at the annual provincial 
     <lb/>
     council that Mr. Higgins was quoting from? 
     <lb/>
     What was his complaint? That the ferry boat 
     <lb/>
     would not take trucks and buses while the other 
     <lb/>
     one would, so that you could load up your truck 
     <lb/>
     somewhere on the island and run her right on to 
     <lb/>
     the ferry.... The main ferry would not take it, but 
     <lb/>
     the other one would, the one that the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government was paying a subsidy to. $40 million 
     <lb/>
     since 1927 the Government of Canada has spent 
     <lb/>
     to provide that little farming province ... with a 
   

            <cb/>
      

     good ferry service, and from 1873 to 1927 it was 
     <lb/>
     nearly another $40 million. And when you dis<lb break="no"/>cover what that tiny province has cost the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada just to give them ferry 
     <lb/>
     service, just about as much as our whole railway 
     <lb/>
     system has cost us, then you have to ask yourself 
     <lb/>
     the question, would the federal government treat 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island as well as you know.... 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think we are getting beside the 
     <lb/>point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I agree, sir, but Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     raised it, and I have the right to do the same thing; 
     <lb/>
     and I am willing to take it province by province, 
     <lb/>
     the whole nine provinces of Canada, and argue 
     <lb/>
     from now till doomsday as to whether it did them 
     <lb/>
     good or bad to go into confederation.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not willing to listen to that.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But you are willing to listen to

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, I don't know what you are 
     <lb/>doing, but I want to make this clear. I did state 
     <lb/>that Mr. Higgins was entitled to quote from the 
     <lb/>Premier of Prince Edward Island upon the rail<lb break="no"/>way and steamship service, but I insisted that he 
     <lb/>should quote, and not attempt a paraphrase. If, to 
     <lb/>cover his point, he was compelled to deal with 
     <lb/>other matters, I had to decide that we would hear 
     <lb/>his quotation or we would not. In view of the fact 
     <lb/>that the quotation in part had a bearing upon the 
     <lb/>discussions, I ruled he was entitled to quote. I did 
     <lb/>not hold that Mr. Higgins was entitled to go into 
     <lb/>the general terms of confederation as existing 
     <lb/>between the Canadian Parliament and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I did not read it all.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> On one occasion I was com<lb break="no"/>pelled to rule you out. Would you please, Mr.

     upon the question, I must allow it.

            <p><persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Mr. Higgins has quoted something;

            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No. We must draw the line

            <p><persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> ....Mr. Higgins has quoted

     <lb/>sections are in the possession of other members 
     <lb/>of the delegation. If that is the case in connection 
     <lb/>with the Railway, have members other sections? 
     <lb/>I think that is a fairly serious matter. We had quite 
     <lb/>a fuss a while ago about another delegation that 
     <lb/>went to London; some members were in posses<lb break="no"/>sion of certain information, others were not, and

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The position is this: there was

     <lb/>
     is the point raised by the member for St. John's

     West, Mr. Harrington, in which he expresses the

     information which has not been generally made

     and he raised the question, quite properly,

     whether such information is to be made available 
     <lb/>
     to members. The point I would like you to address 
     <lb/>
     yourself to is whether there is in the possession

     Railway and steamship experts having been

     given what information we could give them, then 
     <lb/>
     made on their own ... a study of our railway and

     steamship system, insofar as they could make a 
     <lb/>
     study on the information they had. There was not 
     <lb/>
     the time to come to Newfoundland and make a 
     <lb/>
     study of the Railway on the spot. They took the 
     <lb/>
     data and information that we gave them, and on 
     <lb/>
     that information they wrote a report on our rail<lb break="no"/>way and steamship system, not for the New<lb break="no"/>foundland delegation, but for their employers — 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada. I have never seen it, 
     <lb/>
     but I was informed that it was a long report. A 
     <lb/>
     small extract from that report was provided to the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Transportation Committee of the 
     <lb/>

     ber, and without a doubt he received a copy of it 
     <lb/>
     also. What was it? It was merely a small extract 
     <lb/>
     from that very large report provided to the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada by its own experts. It was 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada which compiled these 
     <lb/>
     two Black Books, and it was the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada which decided what should go in these 
     <lb/>
     books and what should not. It was their choice. If 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada chose, in inserting 
     <lb/>
     into this Black Book, part of the report they had 
     <lb/>
     received from their own officials, it was their 
     <lb/>
     right to do so. What we have is the same as you 
     <lb/>
     have here, with the very significant exception 
     <lb/>
     that one or two clauses have been dropped from 
     <lb/>
     the Black Book that were in the original report. 
     <lb/>
     Why is it significant? The original report, the 
     <lb/>
     copies of which were handed to the three of us, 
     <lb/>
     contained the clause which Mr. Higgins has read 
     <lb/>
     out this afternoon. You don't find that clause in 
     <lb/>
     the Black Book. The Black Book is what the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada compiled, what their own 
     <lb/>
     officials compiled as their report to them. What 
     <lb/>
     we go by is this Black Book.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am not questioning that for 
     <lb/>
     one moment. I am merely drawing this distinc<lb break="no"/>tion, that as it appears in the Black Book it is 
     <lb/>
     officially inserted by the Government of Canada; 
     <lb/>
     the other thing is not official because it did not 
     <lb/>
     come from the Government of Canada. It came 
     <lb/>
     from officials of the Government of Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     had not been passed on by the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Did I understand you to take the 
     <lb/>
     position that when the provinces were called 
     <lb/>
     together to consider the implementation of the 
     <lb/>
     Royal Commission which brought in that report, 
     <lb/>
     that any statement made by the premier at that 
     <lb/>
     conference is not to be regarded as an official 
     <lb/>
     statement? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was not referring to that, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, what were you referring 
     <lb/>
     to? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was referring to the paragraph 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Higgins read concerning the railway of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, a paragraph which he read from 
     <lb/>
     a document, which paragraph does not appear in 
     <lb/>
     the Black Book. What I say is this: that so far as 
     <lb/>
     concerns our Newfoundland Railway service, 
     <lb/>
     which includes the steamships, we have here a 
     <lb/>
     document, put in this Black Book by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada. Mr. Higgins quotes a paragraph 
     <lb/>
     from another document, which was written by 
     <lb/>
     officials of the Government of Canada. What we 
     <lb/>
     must take as being official is what the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada itself put in this Black Book, not 
     <lb/>
     another document which has not been put in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am afraid we have to part 
     <lb/>
     company on that point. I said that the fact that we 
     <lb/>
     have to accept that as official, as you put it, by no 
     <lb/>
     means implies that we are not to accept some<lb break="no"/>thing else as official. Suppose I accept your 
     <lb/>
     premises that that is official, then I say that that 
     <lb/>
     is official so far as it goes, but that is not to be 
     <lb/>
     taken to mean that that is to be the sole source of 
     <lb/>
     information available to the members of this 
     <lb/>
     house if and when it is discussed. There are other 
     <lb/>
     sources of information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, sir. I agree with you com<lb break="no"/>pletely, but what I say is this, that so far as our 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Railway service is concerned we 
     <lb/>
     have here in the Black Book a document inserted 
     <lb/>
     by the Government of Canada. That we take as 
     <lb/>
     being the official statement. We have also, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ballam, Mr. Higgins and I, another document... 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That's the point! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We have another document 
     <lb/>
     which has not been given to us by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, because it does not form part of 
     <lb/>
     the Black Book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't care about that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No sir, so long as that is made 
     <lb/>
     clear. Understand, I was not objecting to the 
     <lb/>
     production of that other document, from which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins is quoting, I was merely pointing to 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the one we go by is the official one 
     <lb/>
     inserted here by the Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not going to make a ruling

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I say whether it is Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, or Mr. Higgins, or Mr. Ballam or 
     <lb/>
     anyone else, if they had in their possession infor<lb break="no"/>mation which came to them while they were 
     <lb/>
     serving in the discharge of duties assigned to 
     <lb/>
     them by this Convention, it is clear and unmis<lb break="no"/>takable to me that it is their duty to produce these 
     <lb/>
     supplementary documents and make them avail<lb break="no"/>able to members. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> I was on that committee, and I agree 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Smallwood that that quotation there was 
     <lb/>
     taken from the report that these gentlemen made 
     <lb/>
     to the Canadian government, and the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government findings are included in this Black 
     <lb/>
     Book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I agree with you as far as you go. 
     <lb/>
     I am not suggesting for one moment that any 
     <lb/>
     information gathered by any member of that 
     <lb/>
     delegation from any source other than the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government is official and therefore 
     <lb/>
     has to be introduced. Let me make myself clear. 
     <lb/>
     I say that any information that the members of 
     <lb/>
     that delegation, or any committee of that delega<lb break="no"/>tion, received as such, should be and is, as far as 
     <lb/>
     I am concerned, a proper matter to be placed 
     <lb/>
     before the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I put this to you, Mr. Chairman. 
     <lb/>
     Some members of the delegation received from 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada a certain secret and 
     <lb/>
     confidential book which had been prepared for 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada, by their own experts 
     <lb/>
     and officials, and we were given the courtesy... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now just a moment, before you 
     <lb/>go any further. In what capacity did they receive 
     <lb/>it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Who, sir? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The members. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Purely as a courtesy and kind<lb break="no"/>ness, so that we could read it and gather what 
     <lb/>
     information was in it, but on condition that it was 
     <lb/>
     strictly secret and confidential. We have it, I have 
     <lb/>
     a copy now, and I tell you that all the Conventions 
     <lb/>
     that are created will never get me to divulge it — 
     <lb/>
     not all the Conventions in the next hundred years. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not suggesting for one mo<lb break="no"/>ment that you should break faith.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Is it improper, sir? I brought that 
     <lb/>
     up. I did not think it was improper at this par<lb break="no"/>ticular point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Insofar as it did not cover rail<lb break="no"/>way and steamships or ferry service it was ir<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
          

     relevant. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I was not talking about the Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island affair, but this business about the 
     <lb/>
     Railway and with reference to two things that 
     <lb/>
     were not included in the Black Book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now just a moment. How did 
     <lb/>
     you come to receive it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Sometime prior to July 31, I am not 
     <lb/>
     sure of the exact date now, there was a committee 
     <lb/>
     set up consisting of Mr. Ballam, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     and myself, to meet with representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government, who would be buttressed 
     <lb/>
     by their railroad 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You were appointed a commit<lb break="no"/>tee by the chairman of the delegation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The chairman of the delegation, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley, appointed Mr. Ballam, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood and myself to be a committee from 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland delegation to meet with rep<lb break="no"/>resentatives of the Canadian government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You were deputising for the 
     <lb/>
     delegation as a whole? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That's right. We met with that 
     <lb/>
     committee sir, and, to the best of my recollection 
     <lb/>
     we only met them once, but information that we 
     <lb/>
     asked from the government here was supplied. I 
     <lb/>
     believe Mr. Ballam will bear me out in that. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> We met them twice. The second 
     <lb/>time was to do with the steamship part of it. We 
     <lb/>met the railway part only once. I think that's so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Twice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> All right, we met them twice. Now 
     <lb/>
     as a result of that meeting we did not discuss 
     <lb/>
     anything with them, and again I am going by 
     <lb/>
     memory, except give them what information they 
     <lb/>
     required. All that we had with us, and all that they 
     <lb/>
     wanted that we had to acquire from New<lb break="no"/>foundland, we gave them that. As a result they 
     <lb/>
     made a report to, I presume, the committee that 
     <lb/>
     was meeting us from the Canadian government. 
     <lb/>
     I presume that because the only thing I have to go 
     <lb/>
     by now is our minute of our meeting, a memoran<lb break="no"/>dum of July 31, and at that meeting it is stated that 
     <lb/>
     the secretary... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The secretary of the plenary 
     <lb/>
     session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Yes, the secretary of the plenary 
     <lb/>
     session had reported that the sub-committee had 
     <lb/>
     reviewed the whole matter and the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     members had obtained a substantial amount of 
     <lb/>
     information from the Newfoundland members of 
  

            <pb n="860" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-26_Page_0860.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">860</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
          

     the sub-committee, and had submitted reports to 
     <lb/>
     the chairman of the sub-committee, the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Transport. This special sub-committee had 
     <lb/>
     obtained the information and had submitted it to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chevrier, who acted as chairman of this 
     <lb/>
     sub-committee on transportation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The substance of these reports had been made 
     <lb/>
     available to members of that delegation, and I, 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Ballam and Mr. Smallwood, was passed 
     <lb/>
     these copies at that time. I read the report in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book, and I read this, and you will find that 
     <lb/>
     practically everything that's in the report is in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book, with the exception of these two very 
     <lb/>
     important matters. I make no report on it, I merely 
     <lb/>
     draw it to your attention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> But I still have to deal with the 
     <lb/>
     report raised by Mr. Harrington, and as I have not 
     <lb/>
     discussed it yet, would you mind answering my 
     <lb/>
     question. Had I been in Ottawa as a private 
     <lb/>
     professional man would I have received that 
     <lb/>
     document? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I doubt very much if the other 
     <lb/>
     members, Mr. Burry and Mr. Ashbourne, 
     <lb/>
     received it. I don't know, I am not able to say. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> How did it come into your pos<lb break="no"/>session? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> From the secretary, Mr. Baldwin. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> By virtue of the fact that you 
     <lb/>were a member of the committee? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That's right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well now, while you are on your 
     <lb/>
     feet let us try to dispose of this. Is that the property 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention, and if not, why not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That's the point. In my opinion it 
     <lb/>
     is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sir, speaking on that, we have 
     <lb/>
     two documents picked and inserted in the Report 
     <lb/>
     of the Ottawa Delegation by the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The other is another document al<lb break="no"/>together. There has been a process of selection 
     <lb/>
     carried out by the Government of Canada. If the 
     <lb/>
     other document, the one which Mr. Ballam, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins and I received, is tabled, let it be tabled, 
     <lb/>
     but on the clear understanding that the official 
     <lb/>
     one is the one that is selected by the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada and put in the Black Book. I don't 
     <lb/>
     object to it, but I want the distinction drawn, and 
     <lb/>
     when you remember what are the two para<lb break="no"/>graphs, you will see the necessity for the distinc<lb break="no"/>tion. Officials are hired men, they are civil 
     <lb/>
     servants, employees of the government. Those 
  

            <cb/>
          

     officials of Canada are not concerned with 
     <lb/>
     politics, or policy. They are not concerned with 
     <lb/>
     matters of high level policy, or decision, they 
     <lb/>
     merely report on the conditions of a railway. It is 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada which decides what 
     <lb/>
     it will do about that railway should we become a 
     <lb/>
     province, therefore the document which is com<lb break="no"/>piled by officials is not official from our 
     <lb/>
     standpoint, and the one that is inserted in the 
     <lb/>
     report is official, because it is from the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     decides that this is to be regarded as official, I am 
     <lb/>
     not quarrelling with the decision of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government at all.... But that does not mean that 
     <lb/>
     information which came to the delegation while 
     <lb/>
     in Ottawa from official sources should be kept 
     <lb/>
     from members.... If there is other documentary 
     <lb/>
     information in the possession of members of that 
     <lb/>
     delegation, unless they received it upon the ex<lb break="no"/>press condition and understanding that they were 
     <lb/>
     not to divulge it, I am duty bound to say that it 
     <lb/>
     should be made available to us for what it is 
     <lb/>
     worth.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> And always on the under<lb break="no"/>standing that it was not the final picture. The final 
     <lb/>
     picture is in the Black Book.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, that was my 
     <lb/>
     understanding sir, about the situation, that at the 
     <lb/>
     last plenary session we had with Mr. St. Laurent, 
     <lb/>
     that this was the official declaration or documents 
     <lb/>
     that we were to take to Newfoundland, and the 
     <lb/>
     others, which we received as members of sub<lb break="no"/>committees, as far as I am concerned myself, 
     <lb/>
     were given to us as secret and confidential; and 
     <lb/>
     that's as I understand it. Now Mr. Higgins can see 
     <lb/>
     how he misunderstood it. He was there at the last 
     <lb/>
     meeting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Ashbourne will agree that up 
     <lb/>
     to the point that we came back I was there. We 
     <lb/>
     can't have anything secret and confidential from 
     <lb/>
     the delegation, surely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is a matter for members to 
     <lb/>
     decide in their own consciences.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All the documents handed to us 
     <lb/>
     from time to time had in broad scarlet letters on 
     <lb/>
     the cover "Secret" and "Confidential", and I hope 
     <lb/>
     that all documents we received from time to time 
     <lb/>
     are superseded, and put right out of date, by this 
     <lb/>
     official Black Book in two volumes. This is what 
     <lb/>
     we go by, together with the Grey Book, which

     <lb/>
     them down there, we all have, marked "Secret"

     and "Confidential" in broad red on the cover.

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We only got three of these, you

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, I got dozens.

            <p>

     received by His Excellency the Governor of

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> These were not received from His

            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> They were received by us from the

     Department of External Affairs. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The Department of External 
     <lb/>
     Affairs was merely the department through 
     <lb/>
     which the government functioned. It was from 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I submit that the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada did not see these so-called Black Books 
     <lb/>
     before they were delivered to us, because they 
     <lb/>
     were only completed and finished and delivered 
     <lb/>
     to us as we got on the train. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Even so, the Department of Ex<lb break="no"/>ternal Affairs is for all purposes the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I think we are getting away from 
     <lb/>
     the point.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> May I suggest that we are wasting 
     <lb/>
     too much time on generalities. It is one and a half 
     <lb/>
     hours since this Convention was opened, and we 
     <lb/>
     have not touched upon this, I don't know what 
     <lb/>
     you call it, this Grey Book, and it will be a week 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow since we started this business, and we 
     <lb/>
     are not down to page 2 yet; according to that we 
     <lb/>
     will never get through it till Doomsday, let alone 
     <lb/>
     Christmas. I think there ought to be some way, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, of cutting this down. The whole 
     <lb/>
     matter of terms of confederation means one thing 
     <lb/>
     to me; it is an attempt to sell out Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     for a price. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I demand that Mr. Penney 
     <lb/>
     withdraw that remark. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, I am afraid you will have 
     <lb/>
     to withdraw that remark. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> If it is inflammatory or not, on your 
     <lb/>
     request I will, but certainly not on Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I must ask you to withdraw it. 


            <cb/>
          

     Mr. Penney I withdraw it at your request, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The position is that you have 
     <lb/>
     dragged me into matters of conscience, and I 
     <lb/>
     don't see how I can go around the place probing 
     <lb/>
     the minds of the Ottawa delegation, or the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government or anybody else. All I can 
     <lb/>
     do, Mr. Harrington, is to ask members to confine 
     <lb/>
     themselves to the Black Books and the Grey 
     <lb/>
     Book; and if any reference is made to anything 
     <lb/>
     else I will require the members desiring to quote 
     <lb/>
     from it to satisfy me (1) that he is free to quote 
     <lb/>
     from it, and (2) that it is necessary to an under<lb break="no"/>standing of the position as reflected in the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books and the Grey Book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> As far as I can see we made a mistake 
     <lb/>
     in sending this delegation to Ottawa. We should 
     <lb/>
     all have gone, and then we would all have the 
     <lb/>
     information. I said from the first, whatever infor<lb break="no"/>mation was given, privately or publicly, was 
     <lb/>
     given to the Ottawa delegation as servants of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. We are the delegates of the people, 
     <lb/>
     and they were sent there by us, and whatever 
     <lb/>
     information is private or secret, there is not any 
     <lb/>
     more honour in a man from Bay St. George than 
     <lb/>
     there is in a man from Trinity South. We are all 
     <lb/>
     the same men, doing the same job, and whatever 
     <lb/>
     information there is should not be kept from 
     <lb/>
     anybody. I can't see why a thing should be secret 
     <lb/>
     when 25 or 30 men elected to send these men to 
     <lb/>
     get it for them. Now I don't say to put it all over 
     <lb/>
     the earth, but we do have private sessions here, 
     <lb/>
     and whatever is necessary we should have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not going to ask any mem<lb break="no"/>ber to prostitute his undertaking.... I am not going 
     <lb/>
     to put any member in the position where he is 
     <lb/>
     expected to repudiate an undertaking, that he 
     <lb/>
     would regard as confidential and secret the infor<lb break="no"/>mation which was passed to him on that express 
     <lb/>
     condition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I agree with you 100%, but any 
     <lb/>
     member of a delegation should not be bound by 
     <lb/>
     that. That is my meaning. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, that is something else, but 
     <lb/>
     having given that undertaking, then I think it 
     <lb/>
     would not only be highly immoral but highly 
     <lb/>
     improper for me to suggest that he should violate 
     <lb/>
     the confidence reposed in him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Perhaps I have not made myself 
     <lb/>
     clear. He should not be asked to do it. After all 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada was talking to 45

     elected members of this National Convention, 
     <lb/>
     and whatever was given to one man should be 
     <lb/>
     given to the whole Convention. Why should 
     <lb/>
     things be culled out, and why should they be 
     <lb/>
     passed on to some? Then we can get down and 
     <lb/>
     get a clear picture of the whole thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Whether they should have given 
     <lb/>
     that undertaking or not is something on which I 
     <lb/>
     am not prepared to comment. I am sure that they 
     <lb/>
     were acting in good faith, but whether they 
     <lb/>
     should have given the undertaking or not is en<lb break="no"/>tirely immaterial. If they gave the undertaking 
     <lb/>
     you have no right to require them to break the 
     <lb/>
     undertaking. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> But my argument is that they should 
     <lb/>
     not have been placed in that position in the first 
     <lb/>
     place, because every member of this National 
     <lb/>
     Convention should have access to the same infor<lb break="no"/>mation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I would like to make myself clear on 
     <lb/>
     that point. When I accepted these minutes and 
     <lb/>
     other information in those envelopes marked 
     <lb/>
     "Secret", I accepted them as secret, but not with 
     <lb/>
     the understanding that it was to be kept away 
     <lb/>
     from this Convention. It was a convenience 
     <lb/>
     agreed among us that it should be done that way, 
     <lb/>
     and we were to receive official documents when 
     <lb/>
     we left; and these are the official documents. I 
     <lb/>
     have read them through, and I have my secret 
     <lb/>
     information and minutes, and I have read these 
     <lb/>
     through, and there is nothing in that secret infor<lb break="no"/>mation that is not embodied in these documents 
     <lb/>
     here, if not word for word, certainly in the spirit 
     <lb/>
     of it. I accepted the secret information with the 
     <lb/>
     understanding that it would be given to us offi<lb break="no"/>cially, and we were to take back to this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion official documents that we would agree upon 
     <lb/>
     as a result of our meeting there. There is nothing 
     <lb/>
     in the secret documents that I would not have this 
     <lb/>
     Convention receive. If I had known that I would 
     <lb/>
     not have accepted them. When I went to Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     I went there to do my best, and to bring back 
     <lb/>
     everything that went on there, as far as I could 
     <lb/>
     possibly do it. I have done it, sir, in these official 
     <lb/>
     documents, and I have nothing whatever to hold 
     <lb/>
     back from the Convention.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I am glad that this point was 
     <lb/>
     brought up. I was going to ask why they were left 
     <lb/>
     out, but I don't have to ask now. Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     has said that what was in the Black Book, the 
     <lb/>
     official handout from the Canadian government, 
 

            <cb/>
       

     was selected by the Canadian government, and I 
     <lb/>
     can quite understand why some paragraphs may 
     <lb/>
     have been left out. The Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     would not select something that would not look 
     <lb/>
     very good to some Newfoundlanders. I brought 
     <lb/>
     up that question yesterday, and asked Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood if there was any assurance or any 
     <lb/>
     guarantee that if the Canadian National Railway 
     <lb/>
     took over our Railway that they would retain the 
     <lb/>
     same number of employees that we have working 
     <lb/>
     today. Mr. Smallwood said that there was no 
     <lb/>
     assurance, and possibly there would not be. I can 
     <lb/>
     quite see that, but, as Mr. Fogwill just pointed 
     <lb/>
     out, when I asked him this question, and if he had 
     <lb/>
     this information in front of him, why could he not 
     <lb/>
     have answered me and told me that? As it says 
     <lb/>
     here: "This looks to be an undue number in 
     <lb/>
     relation to the size of the operation." If that's the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the officials who constitute the 
     <lb/>
     government and from whom the cabinet take 
     <lb/>
     their findings, it may be that they might say, "We 
     <lb/>
     will cut this staff 25%, and lay 90 or 100 men 
     <lb/>
     off." I asked that yesterday, and I don't see why 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood could not have brought that out. 
     <lb/>
     It would have satisfied me. I heard nothing about 
     <lb/>
     it until Mr. Higgins brought it up today. I don't 
     <lb/>
     want to say too much, but it doesn't seem right to 
     <lb/>
     me the way some things are going. Twice Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood was reading words there that were 
     <lb/>
     not in the report, and if we are going to have the 
     <lb/>
     report... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I rise to a point of order. I ask 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman to take that back. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> You read the other night "freely 
     <lb/>
     provided", and it was not in the report.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Hickman, you are not en<lb break="no"/>titled to say that. Where it said "gratuitously" he 
     <lb/>
     said "freely", which of course has the same 
     <lb/>
     meaning. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I am not making insinuations, but 
     <lb/>
     I want to get what is in the Black Book, and not 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood's interpretations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> But it happens to be a fair inter<lb break="no"/>pretation of the word "gratuitously", and I don't 
     <lb/>
     think you are imputing any ulterior motive to

     him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I was not imputing an ulterior

     motive, but I can't agree that "gratuitously" and 
     <lb/>
     "freely" are the same in this matter here.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, if Mr. Hickman

     did not refer to the paragraph in this other docu<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We have been here two hours 
     <lb/>
     and accomplished practically nothing. I am not in 
     <lb/>
     a position to rule on this question because there 
     <lb/>
     are three schools of opinion amongst the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation as to what is confidential, if it is confi<lb break="no"/>dential, and to what extent it is confidential. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, since I can't get unanimity of opinion, 
     <lb/>
     all I can do is to say that we will go on as we have 
     <lb/>
     been going, and if any member is going to refer 
     <lb/>
     to anything outside the Grey Book and the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books I will have to ask him to lay his foundation 
     <lb/>
     for it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Meanwhile, I feel that if members of the 
     <lb/>
     delegation came into possession of information 
     <lb/>
     ... and if they have given an undertaking to keep 
     <lb/>
     it secret then I can't ask them to violate it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I am not laying any stress on the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation. I am laying the stress on this, 
     <lb/>
     that the Government of Canada should have 
     <lb/>
     given to each and every individual everything 
     <lb/>
     they gave to the Ottawa delegation. It was us that 
     <lb/>
     sent them there, and it is up to us to know what 
     <lb/>
     went on. Whether we work for or against con<lb break="no"/>federation, and whether it is a good thing or a bad 
     <lb/>
     thing, that's what we sent the delegation to Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa for, and that is what the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment should have given them — not a little bit 
     <lb/>
     here and little bit there. Mr. Fogwill asked the 
     <lb/>
     question, and Mr. Hickman asked the question. 
     <lb/>
     There's nobody going to be laid off in the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Railway. That's balderdash, as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins said.

     The position then would be that Canada would

     take over $63,569,000, and Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would have $6,354,000. I don't know that there

     is anything I need to add to that. This public debt 
     <lb/>
     falls under two headings — what is guaranteed 
     <lb/>
     by the United Kingdom, and what is held here 
     <lb/>
     locally.... Canada will take over our external debt, 
     <lb/>
     and the Province of Newfoundland would be left

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, there are a couple of 
     <lb/>
     questions there. Do I take it, Mr. Smallwood, that 
     <lb/>
     Canada takes over $63 1/2 million of our debt? 
     <lb/>
     That's about right isn't it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The outstanding debt then would be 
     <lb/>
     about $6 1/2 million from Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> When you were discussing this na<lb break="no"/>tional debt offer, did you talk to them at all with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the per capita debt of Canada as against 
     <lb/>
     the per capita debt of Newfoundland, and what 
     <lb/>
     was their reply? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We did, Mr. Chairman, we had 
     <lb/>
     a committee on public debt. I know I was on it, 
     <lb/>
     but there are two others as well. I was secretary 
     <lb/>
     of the delegation, and I was therefore a member 
     <lb/>
     of all the committees. I forget now — it is in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We met the men from the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Finance, and also some man from 
     <lb/>
     the Bank of Canada, and they gave us the history 
     <lb/>
     of what had been done by the federal government 
     <lb/>
     with the different provinces as they came in, what 
     <lb/>

     highest amount of provincial debt that Canada 
     <lb/>
     ever took over was $50 a head of the debt of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island. In our case I don't know 
     <lb/>
     what it works out at, but it is more than that. It is

            <fw type="num">864</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
        

     the highest proportion yet. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> $50. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That's not my point. My point is 
     <lb/>
     this: This delegation went to Ottawa to get terms, 
     <lb/>
     or what would be a good base to go into con<lb break="no"/>federation. If you and I are going into partnership, 
     <lb/>
     the first thing I will say to you is, "Now what have 
     <lb/>
     you got?" And you will say, "Cashin, I owe 
     <lb/>
     $100"; I will say, "I owe $50", consequently I am 
     <lb/>
     $50 better off than you. Now Canada owes 
     <lb/>
     roughly $1,300 or $1,400 per head, and New<lb break="no"/>foundland owes $150 per head. Now we are 
     <lb/>
     going into business with Canada, and according 
     <lb/>
     to this thing here, we are going to forget our 
     <lb/>
     indebtedness of $150 a head and take on an 
     <lb/>
     indebtedness of $1,300 or $1,400 a head. That 
     <lb/>
     does not sound like good business to me. In 1895, 
     <lb/>
     if my memory serves me right, a delegation went 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa and was there 11 days, and that's where 
     <lb/>
     that $50 a head came in, and the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government had a less per capita debt than New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and our people here, because Canada 
     <lb/>
     would not take over $5 million of our debt, 
     <lb/>
     refused to go into confederation at that time. Now 
     <lb/>
     the boot is on the other foot. The position today 
     <lb/>
     is that Newfoundland has a net per capita debt say 
     <lb/>
     of $150 per head, and Canada has $1,300 per 
     <lb/>
     head. It is more than that I think, and consequent<lb break="no"/>ly the difference between the two is $1,150. Now 
     <lb/>
     if you multiply $1,150 by 320,000 people, you 
     <lb/>
     will find that if we carried out their agreement, or 
     <lb/>
     the arrangements in 1895, that Canada would 
     <lb/>
     have to pay Newfoundland to go into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion somewhere around $350 million. The posi<lb break="no"/>tion now as I see it is that they are taking over our 
     <lb/>
     indebtedness of $63 1/2 million. What do they get 
     <lb/>
     for it? All Newfoundland, and all Labrador, the 
     <lb/>
     Railway and buildings and everything for $63.5 
     <lb/>
     million; a railway which cost $72 million; all our 
     <lb/>
     public buildings, everything for $63 million. I 
     <lb/>
     think that's poor business. Now apart from my 
     <lb/>
     prejudices with regard to confederation, I feel 
     <lb/>
     that this situation on the public debt is not a 
     <lb/>
     square deal.... They are going to take on a debt of 
     <lb/>
     $50 per head, and we will take on a debt of 
     <lb/>
     $1,300. Is it going to be easier to pay off $l,300 
     <lb/>
     than it is to pay of $50? Other people may see it, 
     <lb/>
     but I can't. I will probably have more to say on 
     <lb/>
     this debate before it is concluded, but I want to 
     <lb/>
     know whether the delegation directly asked the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government that question, whether, 
    

            <cb/>
          

     based on our per capita debt, that they did not 
     <lb/>
     think that Newfoundland was entitled to the dif<lb break="no"/>ference between $150 a head and $1,300 or 
     <lb/>
     whatever it may be.... In making up the estimates 
     <lb/>
     of expenditure — I have not looked at it — did 
     <lb/>
     you take into account the interest and sinking 
     <lb/>
     fund? That is $350,000 added to the provincial 
     <lb/>
     expenditure, not included in the books. Do our 
     <lb/>
     interest and sinking fund go into the provincial 
     <lb/>
     budget study? It is not included in here, when 
     <lb/>
     those figures were made up of what the provincial 
     <lb/>
     expenditure would be. I would like to know 
     <lb/>
     whether the delegation asked the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government what they were prepared to do for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland now in view of the fact that our 
     <lb/>
     debt is $150 a head and their debt is $1,300 a 
     <lb/>
     head. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am glad Major Cashin raised 
     <lb/>
     that point. He put it very well. Two men going to 
     <lb/>
     join a partnership. Major Cashin says, "What do 
     <lb/>
     you owe?" And one says "$50". The other says, 
     <lb/>
     "I owe $100". Difference of $50. Something 
     <lb/>
     should be done about that, when they start in 
     <lb/>
     partnership. The Government of Canada owes 
     <lb/>
     per capita somewhere between $1,000 and 
     <lb/>
     $1,100. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> A little more. They added to it a 
     <lb/>
     couple of days ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> A paltry $300,000, temporary 
     <lb/>
     accommodation. It is like my going to the bank 
     <lb/>
     and borrowing $30 or $40. The per capita debt of 
     <lb/>
     Canada is $1,000 to $1,200, and our per capita is 
     <lb/>
     $200 or somewhere around there. The difference 
     <lb/>
     is quite a bit. Therefore something should be done 
     <lb/>
     to compensate us for that. That is perfectly true. 
     <lb/>
     I hold something has been done. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada has got to pay into New<lb break="no"/>foundland, one way or another — some direct to 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government, and some to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland direct. Some of it is for 
     <lb/>
     the performance of services for the people — 
     <lb/>
     running the railway, lighthouses, post offices, 
     <lb/>
     etc. The Government of Canada has got to pay 
     <lb/>
     something between $10-l5 million a year into 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Point of order. My question was, 
     <lb/>
     when you were talking to the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment, did you or did you not put to them the 
     <lb/>
     question about the difference in the debt? I do not 
     <lb/>
     care what they will pay in here. If you did not ask 
     <lb/>
     them, well and good. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We went into the question of 
     <lb/>
     public debt—that question was raised, discussed 
     <lb/>
     across the table, as we might in your office, 
     <lb/>
     informal and friendly. The answer was, "No". 
     <lb/>
     The reason was that the terms given one 
     <lb/>
     province must be guided by the terms given to 
     <lb/>
     other provinces. The Government of Canada for 
     <lb/>
     many years will have to pay into Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     between $10-15 million more than they can take 
     <lb/>
     out of Newfoundland. I hope it will not be too 
     <lb/>
     many years; I hope the day will come when things 
     <lb/>
     will be so developed, industries so productive, 
     <lb/>
     our people so prosperous that we will be paying 
     <lb/>
     a lot more taxes to the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     than we will be paying for some years to come. 
     <lb/>
     Put it at $10 million — the difference between 
     <lb/>
     what the Government of Canada will pay into 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and what they take out — that is 
     <lb/>
     $100,000 every ten years. These subsidies are 
     <lb/>
     paid; some in return for the grant of certain taxes, 
     <lb/>
     direct taxes, income taxes, corporation taxes and 
     <lb/>
     death duties. The government will take so much 
     <lb/>
     money in taxes. That government will pay so 
     <lb/>
     much into Newfoundland every year. If we take 
     <lb/>
     it at the lowest figure — $10 million — that is 
     <lb/>
     $100,000 a year that the Province of New<lb break="no"/>foundland would cost the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. That is something. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One other point far more important — the per 
     <lb/>
     capita debt of any country, the public debt is 
     <lb/>
     important to the people of that country for one 
     <lb/>
     outstanding reason, ... and in this I hope Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin will agree ... you have to service that debt, 
     <lb/>
     pay interest on it, put a sinking fund forward; and 
     <lb/>
     you have to pay it back when it falls due. You pay 
     <lb/>
     so much a year for this debt, you pay in your 
     <lb/>
     taxes. So what matters in a country, what counts, 
     <lb/>
     is not so much the size of the public debt, but the 
     <lb/>
     size of your taxation.... That includes public debt, 
     <lb/>
     it includes family allowances, it includes public 
     <lb/>
     services, it includes the Railway, your taxes that 
     <lb/>
     you pay, the total amount you pay.... There is not 
     <lb/>
     a special tax collected from people to pay the 
     <lb/>
     interest on the debt, it is paid out of the regular 
     <lb/>
     revenue that the government collects, and the 
     <lb/>
     only real importance of a public debt is how much 
     <lb/>
     it adds to your taxation.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Incidentally, in Newfoundland too there are 
     <lb/>
     very bitter experiences with public debt. We have 
     <lb/>
     in this country a great horror of public debts. I 
     <lb/>
     find that in larger countries they don't have that

     same dread. In Canada, certainly Mr. Higgins and 
     <lb/>
     all our delegation will agree, all the officials and 
     <lb/>
     cabinet ministers used to smile at our great con<lb break="no"/>cern and our dread of public debt. Maybe they 
     <lb/>
     can afford to smile, because nearly all their debt 
     <lb/>
     is internal. It is owned in Canada. When they pay 
     <lb/>
     interest on it they are paying it to Canadians. It 
     <lb/>
     still stays in Canada. I think every year it is 
     <lb/>
     around $400 million that the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada pays on the public debt, and nearly all of 
     <lb/>
     it goes to Canada and is used for the general 
     <lb/>
     purposes of providing capital. Maybe that is why 
     <lb/>
     they don't fear public debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If a country is growing, has good industries 
     <lb/>
     and their prospects seem to be very good, then 
     <lb/>
     they look upon debts as something natural, not 
     <lb/>
     something to be scared of; because if they were 
     <lb/>
     to be scared the United States today would be a 
     <lb/>
     nation frantic with fear and debt; and the same 
     <lb/>
     applies to Great Britain.... However, the question 
     <lb/>
     of public debt is so much connected with the 
     <lb/>
     question of taxation, because taxation includes 
     <lb/>
     public debt, that I hesitate to go into the matter 
     <lb/>
     now. I would suggest to Major Cashin that we 
     <lb/>
     have got to get down to brass tacks in this debate 
     <lb/>
     before it is over, get down to this question of 
     <lb/>
     taxation, then we can have it out about our public 
     <lb/>
     debt as well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I think I am inclined to agree with 
     <lb/>
     my friend Mr. Smallwood for once. To go into 
     <lb/>
     the matter of revenues and expenditure and 
     <lb/>
     public debt is a very important matter in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with this debate. It is the only matter really 
     <lb/>
     that is worth talking about, and I think that this 
     <lb/>
     matter should be put off until some of the ques<lb break="no"/>tions that appear on the order paper are correctly 
     <lb/>
     answered, because I don't want to be guessing 
     <lb/>
     any more. Whilst I want to get this thing over, I 
     <lb/>
     want to be in a position to discuss the public debt 
     <lb/>
     from an economic standpoint as far as the country 
     <lb/>
     is concerned. So far I have got the answer that 
     <lb/>
     they put it up to the Canadian government who 
     <lb/>
     said they were not prepared to give us anything 
     <lb/>
     for the difference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would you allow me for a mo<lb break="no"/>ment? We did not exactly put it up to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, we put it up to the financial men, 
     <lb/>
     and we got so little encouragement that we did 
     <lb/>
     not raise it in the plenary session at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> In other words you got no pity and 
     <lb/>
     you gave it up.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I think we were told that it would 
     <lb/>
     be out of the question. The amount would be too 
     <lb/>
     high. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Regarding the matter of the 
     <lb/>
     difference between debts, I particularly raised 
     <lb/>
     that point.... If I mistake not the matter was gone 
     <lb/>
     into and I believe one of the officials of the 
     <lb/>
     committee went into the matter and in one of our 
     <lb/>
     meetings read us a memorandum or a digest of 
     <lb/>
     the points to cover that, and I don't know where 
     <lb/>
     that is. I don't know if Mr. Bradley has it, or the 
     <lb/>
     secretary, Mr. Smallwood... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think I have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> It was very enlightening, and as 
     <lb/>
     far as I am concerned I realise that some of the 
     <lb/>
     assets of Newfoundland have been put on the 
     <lb/>
     other side to look after the debt. It is a small 
     <lb/>
     country with a small debt and small assets, 
     <lb/>
     whereas in a big country like Canada it would 
     <lb/>
     naturally be expected that they have big assets. 
     <lb/>
     There are other countries contiguous to Canada 
     <lb/>
     that have a bigger debt than Canada has, and on 
     <lb/>
     the other side as well, but that does not debar 
     <lb/>
     them from raising money. If they are in a liquid 
     <lb/>
     position, it is the assets they have that you have 
     <lb/>
     to look upon.... Furthermore, I would like to ask 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin, since he gave us the figures of the 
     <lb/>
     per capita debt that we would be called upon to 
     <lb/>
     pay, if he would kindly give us the amount of 
     <lb/>
     interest at 2 1/2% that is on that money over in the 
     <lb/>
     Bank of England. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> What is it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Would you kindly give us that 
     <lb/>
     amount of interest and deduct it from the 
     <lb/>
     $3,232,000 that is over on the other side? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Oh no, you are wrong there, that 
     <lb/>
     $3,232,000 that is over on the other side is put 
     <lb/>
     there for a particular purpose, and it is to pay a 
     <lb/>
     debt that is coming due in 1950-52. That is not 
     <lb/>
     included in the $6 1/2 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Oh, yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Oh, no. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> It is included in the $10 million. 
     <lb/>
     What is the rate of interest if we have got to pay 
     <lb/>
     that on $6 million — 5-6% isn't it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The $3.5 million coming due in 
     <lb/>
     1950-52 is taken care of by the setting aside of 
     <lb/>
     £800,000, which is invested at the present time 
     <lb/>
     by the Crown Agents in London at 2 1/2%. There 
     <lb/>
     is one loan coming due in 1950, and they will pay 
     <lb/>
     it out of that, and the other comes due in 1952, 
  

            <cb/>
          

     and the accrued interest added on to that 
     <lb/>
     $3,232,000 will be sufficient to meet both of 
     <lb/>
     these loans, consequently that's out altogether. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore the balance of the loan would be 
     <lb/>
     charged up to the government, as I said it would 
     <lb/>
     be $6.25 million or $6.5 million. Now on that 
     <lb/>
     $6.25 million you have got to find $300,000 
     <lb/>
     annual interest and sinking fund, and when you 
     <lb/>
     come to these matters as to where you got your 
     <lb/>
     revenues and expenditures, etc., it is not provided 
     <lb/>
     in here in the estimates of expenditure at all. That 
     <lb/>
     is another amount that's got to go on to this 
     <lb/>
     so-called deficit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> When we were drawing up our 
     <lb/>
     guess, if you like, of what it would cost to run the 
     <lb/>
     province, we left out all the interest on public 
     <lb/>
     debt, because we hoped that Canada would take 
     <lb/>
     over our debt, not leave us even with $6 million 
     <lb/>
     as they have done.... But on the question of rais<lb break="no"/>ing the cost of running the province, I suggest that 
     <lb/>
     we leave that until we come to it. I don't want to 
     <lb/>
     duck it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All this financial stuff should 
     <lb/>
     be left until we come to the discussion of taxation,

     etc.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is a good thing that Mr. Ash<lb break="no"/>bourne did labour the point. The story would be

     that we start off with a public debt of anywhere 
     <lb/>
     between $400,000 a year, and pay the interest 
     <lb/>
     and sinking fund on it. This would have to be 
     <lb/>
     provided by the provincial government, and 
     <lb/>
     added in to the provincial government's budget. 
     <lb/>
     We start off as a province with a debt of roughly 
     <lb/>
     $6 million, and we would owe that to ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     and the interest on it we would be paying to our

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is quite a tall order to ask 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada to do, to give you the

     taxation in every municipality in Canada. If you 
     <lb/>
     were to ask the provincial governments of the

     nine provinces you would get it; after all, it is no

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, yesterday we 
     <lb/>
     had got as far as clause 7 dealing with what would 
     <lb/>
     happen to the public debt. I do not know if the 
     <lb/>
     House wants to continue debating that clause or 
     <lb/>
     if it is ready to move on to clause 8. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I understood from Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     yesterday that we were going to defer this finan<lb break="no"/>cial section and go on with the others; that we 
     <lb/>
     could leave the financial end until we wound up. 
     <lb/>
     The financial thing is the main thing. There have 
     <lb/>
     been a lot of questions asked to which we have 
     <lb/>
     not yet received replies, and I imagine it is going 
     <lb/>
     to take time. I would suggest to Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     that we defer from there up to the end of section 
     <lb/>
     14. All that is financial. We could go on from 
     <lb/>
     there to representation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I sympathise with the point 
     <lb/>
     made by Major Cashin that the debate on these

            <milestone type="unknown"/>

     clauses under the general heading of Financial 
     <lb/>
     Arrangements — clauses 7 to 14 inclusive — 
     <lb/>
     might be deferred until replies have been 
     <lb/>
     received to the various questions tabled, but I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if it would not be as well to go as rapidly 
     <lb/>
     as possible through these clauses so that they 
     <lb/>
     would be a matter of record. As far as any clause 
     <lb/>
     dealt with up until now, the house can revert to 
     <lb/>
     them and so with these particular clauses. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
