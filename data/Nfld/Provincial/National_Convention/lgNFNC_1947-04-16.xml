<!-- <p>
     production he stepped up? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> It is more or less the old crude way. 
     <lb/>
     The clay is taken from the pits by wheelbarrow, 
     <lb/>
     and goes to elevators and into the crusher, and 
     <lb/>
     down into the moulds, and the bricks are cut off 
     <lb/>
     by a string of wires passing through the moulds. 
     <lb/>
     Afterwards they are taken out and pass to the kiln, 
     <lb/>
     then they are sun dried. It's the old crude 
     <lb/>
     methods, and I believe if they had more modern 
     <lb/>
     methods the production would be stepped up, but 
     <lb/>
     then again you are up against the imported article 
     <lb/>
     being superior, and in order to make the industry 
     <lb/>
     worthwhile you will have to condemn the clay 
     <lb/>
     pits and use the shale. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, the duty on 
     <lb/>
     machinery coming in for brick is free. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Won't Mr. Vardy confirm the 
     <lb/>
     fact that one of the gentlemen making brick down 
     <lb/>
     his way went away recently to the States and 
     <lb/>
     visited a number of up-to-date brick factories, 
     <lb/>
     and has plans to improve his plant in Trinity Bay? 
     <lb/>
     Isn't that true? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Yes, I understand it is true. They 
     <lb/>
     have plans in mind to get together on it over there 
     <lb/>
     and try to use the shale. There is an unlimited 
     <lb/>
     quantity of shale. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> The machinery for making brick is 
     <lb/>
     duty free, and your Committee must have made 
     <lb/>
     a mistake. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I have not consulted the tariff on this 
     <lb/>
     myself. That was always my knowledge, and I 
     <lb/>
     know Mr. Smith had trouble on that. Is that a 
     <lb/>
     recent tariff? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Well this tariff is issued by the 
     <lb/>
     Customs in June, 1946, and included quite a lot 
     <lb/>
     of machinery for various purposes, including 
     <lb/>
     machinery for making brick, and it's duty free the 
     <lb/>
     same as cordage machinery for making twine, 
     <lb/>
     that's duty free. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Its nice to know the Mining Com<lb break="no"/>mittee made one slip! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> All those bricks that are made, 
     <lb/>
     are they used locally? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I don't know of any local made brick 
     <lb/>
     being exported. I know we are importing a lot of 
     <lb/>
     brick, but I don't know of any being exported. It 
     <lb/>
     has been stated that the main complaint against 
     <lb/>
     our local brick is that it is very coarse and absorbs 
     <lb/>
     too much moisture. It can't stand up over a period 
     <lb/>
     of years against the hard brick. Of course, there 
     <lb/>
     is the hard and soft, I may say they use the hard 
     <lb/>
     brick for chimneys, but I think that's the main 
     <lb/>
     complaint. The brick manufactured from clay has 
     <lb/>
     been very porous, but the brick manufactured 
     <lb/>
     from this shale can be hardened up so that, as the 
     <lb/>
     report says, "it will be like steel". The opinion is 
     <lb/>
     that an industry should be started immediately. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I don't want to disagree with 
     <lb/>Mr. Vardy again, but there has been some brick 
     <lb/>exported. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I said "to my knowledge"; I did not 
     <lb/>
     say there was not any exported. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> With reference to 12 rivers 
     <lb/>
     given in this list, in each of them it says from two 
     <lb/>
     years (in three cases three years) after granting 
     <lb/>
     the water-power, they were supposed to develop 
     <lb/>
     them. The grants were issued 1910, 1911, 1912, 
     <lb/>
     1913, 1914, 1896, 1897, 1921 and 1924. All 
     <lb/>
     these, according to the conditions, were supposed 
     <lb/>
     to be developed within two or three years. Could 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Mr. Banfield tell us the position with regard to 
     <lb/>these water-powers? Are they still under grant, or 
     <lb/>did the grant lapse when they failed to develop? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> All these pay annual rentals with 
     <lb/>the exception of three rivers — Rattling Brook, 
     <lb/>Indian Brook and Pismire Brook. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How can they pay in the case 
     <lb/>
     of Pipers Hole? They have to pay one peppercorn 
     <lb/>
     on demand. Also Black River. In other cases they 
     <lb/>
     pay 25 cents a horsepower developed. In these 
     <lb/>
     cases here, they pay annual rental or royalty on 
     <lb/>
     10, 20, 25. I cannot understand it. Does the ac<lb break="no"/>ceptance of these rentals cover the leases of the 
     <lb/>
     water-powers? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> I may say that they have not 
     <lb/>
     developed the water-powers, but I think they 
     <lb/>
     have some other agreement to pay an annual 
     <lb/>
     amount to hold the water-powers. 
     <lb/>
     
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Take the case of Little River 
     <lb/>(Burgeo and Lapoile), 100,000 horsepower. Ac<lb break="no"/>cording to agreement they have paid $1 a year 
     <lb/>since 1911 — a 99 year lease on 100,000 hp of 
     <lb/>hydro-electric energy, on the condition they shall 
     <lb/>develop water-power on the river. The condition 
     <lb/>of getting that tremendous grant was that within 
     <lb/>two years they would develop the water-power 
     <lb/>and the same table says "no development". Is the 
     <lb/>government accepting $1 a year on potential 
     <lb/>horsepower from John Finlay Stewart of England 
     <lb/>and Bowaters? Can they tie it up for 99 years? 
     <lb/>Suppose I want to go up there and develop? Does 
     <lb/>it mean that for the remainder of 99 years no one 
     <lb/>can develop that 100,000 hp or any of it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> There must be some

     <lb/>Mr. Banfield gave out the Operating horsepower,

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That "could be" developed. 
     <lb/>That is the capacity. Could Mr. Banfield tell us if 
     <lb/>the government has the figures as to the total 
     <lb/>water-power in Newfoundland? I know a 
     <lb/>hydroelectric engineer is coming down; but does 
     <lb/>that mean the government does not know what 
     <lb/>the water-power in Newfoundland is?

            <p><persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> That is the situation. That man is

     getting away with $10 to $20 a year. We have to

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I must agree with Mr. Smallwood. 
     <lb/>l was amazed to see the terms under which 
     <lb/>various individuals and corporations were given 
     <lb/>these water-power leases. One is for one pepper<lb break="no"/>corn a year. Harveys has a lease for payment of 
     <lb/>one peppercom a year on demand.<ref target="#fn_05">[2]</ref> I suggest we 
     <lb/>go to Harveys and ask them for 50-odd pepper<lb break="no"/>corns. Then these other leases granted a consid<lb break="no"/>erable amount of water-power on terms of $1 up 
     <lb/>to $5 a year. In those leases there was a proviso 
     <lb/>that in up to five years they were to develop the 
     <lb/>water-power. I am sure that those I know have 
     <lb/>done no development. Why the government 
     <lb/>should accept a $1 fee in order to assist these 
     <lb/>individuals, I cannot understand, and I would like 
     <lb/>to go on record as suggesting when the time 
     <lb/>comes round for these people to pay their fee, the 
     <lb/>government refuse to accept it, and then act on 
     <lb/>the proviso which says they must develop within 
     <lb/>two to five years. A good many people are hold<lb break="no"/>ing on, waiting for someone to come in and 
     <lb/>develop, and then make a scoop. I would suggest 
     <lb/>that the government cancel the leases if those 
     <lb/>people do not develop the water-power. This is 
     <lb/>preventing people from coming in and develop<lb break="no"/>ing these water-powers. Then when we look at 
     <lb/>the paltry amount paid into the revenue, it does 
     <lb/>not give a pleasant taste in your mouth.

            <p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I would like to clear up the question 
     <lb/>of the tariff on machinery for the making of brick. 
     <lb/>I consulted the Customs and found they reduced 
     <lb/>the rate on power machinery from 45% to 20%. 
     <lb/>There is no provision in the tariff for free entry; 
     <lb/>it would have to be approved by the government. 
     <lb/>For special machinery coming in, if the duty is 
     <lb/>over $100 and the matter was approved by the 
     <lb/>Board of Customs, it comes in duty free....

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> ....With respect to Bell Island, 
     <lb/>the Mining Regulations Act of 1908 governs that. 
     <lb/>The return of value is the value of the crude 
     <lb/>material. At Bell Island the figure would be the 
     <lb/>value of the ore when it is raised to the surface, 
     <lb/>irrespective of operation of equipment on the 
     <lb/>surface, or transporting it on the surface. The 
     <lb/>weighing is not done at Bell Island but at Sydney. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Thank you for the explanation. 
     <lb/>That figure $2.55 does not reflect the true present 
     <lb/>day value of ore. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is greater this year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The fact of the matter is that the 
     <lb/>figures showing the value of iron ore exported 
     <lb/>from Newfoundland, we might as well tear up. It 
     <lb/>is the value taken up and laid on the surface, not 
     <lb/>the export value. My complaint is with the Cus<lb break="no"/>toms. If you will recall, every budget speech 
     <lb/>would contain the values of iron ore exported 
     <lb/>from Newfoundland, and not one word was 
     <lb/>worth the paper it was written on. It was a sort of 
     <lb/>nebulous value of the ore as it comes out of the 
     <lb/>ground and not the export value. What country in 
     <lb/>the world does not know the value of its exports? 
     <lb/>The only thing we have in Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>enable us to determine the amount of wealth, the 
     <lb/>gross national production, is our figures of ex<lb break="no"/>ports. Here is one where our figures are inac<lb break="no"/>curate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I understand this company or 
     <lb/>other companies associated with Bell Island have 
     <lb/>exported up to 40 million tons of ore. I would like 
     <lb/>to know the real value of that ore, not the nominal 
     <lb/>value. Everything that goes out of the country 
     <lb/>should have some value. I do not see why, if 
     <lb/>Buchans has to put down the present day value, 
     <lb/>this company should not do it....

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am glad of the opportunity to say 
     <lb/>a few words in connection with the Labrador 
     <lb/>Mining and Development Company. Conse<lb break="no"/>quently I will begin from 1935. Some of my 
     <lb/>remarks may not be quite accurate, but I trust the 
     <lb/>Convention will forgive me, as I have no notes 
     <lb/>here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In 1935 the Weaver Minerals applied to the 
     <lb/>Newfoundland government for the right to 
     <lb/>prospect 20,000 square miles of territory in 
     <lb/>Labrador. I should say that to Mr. A.H. MacKay, 
     <lb/>whose name is signed to the application, would 
     <lb/>have to go the credit for any big development. At 
     <lb/>that time, this Mr. MacKay and three other in<lb break="no"/>dividuals joined and formed this Weaver 
     <lb/>Minerals. They applied and received, through a 
     <lb/>letter (no act), the right. There was no act passed 
     <lb/>until 1938. They undertook to spend $50,000 on 
     <lb/>Labrador. This particular area had been held by 
     <lb/>local interests who were unable to finance it. 
     <lb/>Mr. MacKay and his associates spent $80,000. 
     <lb/>People in Newfoundland did not know that. A lot 
     <lb/>of money went up in the air. He employed 
     <lb/>Dr. Retty, geologist. The following year they felt 
     <lb/>they were throwing money away and were 
     <lb/>prepared to forget it. But this gentleman, 
     <lb/>Mr. MacKay, was a speculator. He and his as<lb break="no"/>sociate carried on. The following year 
     <lb/>Mr. MacKay's associate died and he had to carry 
     <lb/>on alone. Then Mr. Timmins of the Hollinger 
     <lb/>Co. contacted Mr. MacKay in Montreal. Hol<lb break="no"/>linger Co. is a large gold producing company. 
     <lb/>Hollinger controls 30% of the stock in the Noran<lb break="no"/>da mine. MacKay's money was nearly all gone. 
     <lb/>Eventually a deal was made. After Hollinger 
     <lb/>became interested, they probably spent about $1 
     <lb/>million; $200,000 of which is going up in the air; 
     <lb/>they have to fly in supplies and machinery. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have noticed in the 1938 act<ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> that this 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Mining Company "shall be in British 
     <lb/>
     territory." Now the idea is to electrify that rail<lb break="no"/>way. When they electrify it they are going to run 
     <lb/>
     it into Canada. Are they going to run only to the 
     <lb/>
     border line? Is the government going to charge 
     <lb/>
     export rate? If so they are going to have difficulty, 
     <lb/>
     because they will have to tell them to haul it the 
     <lb/>
     rest of the way. It is anticipated this Labrador

     Mining Co. will have a production of 10 million 
     <lb/>
     tons a year. I am sorry we did not know of the 
     <lb/>
     1944 act.<ref target="#fn_07">[1]</ref> I claim that is taking $1 million 
     <lb/>
     revenue away from Newfoundland. Under the 
     <lb/>
     1938 act they were getting 10 cents a ton royalty 
     <lb/>
     plus 3% on the gross value of other materials. 
     <lb/>
     Now under the 1944 act that is changed, and we 
     <lb/>
     get 5% on the net profits. I say we will get 
     <lb/>
     nothing. I am not giving the legal interpretation 
     <lb/>
     of the act, but I say 15 cents per hp is nothing. 
     <lb/>
     Here we have the greatest water-power in the 
     <lb/>
     world and the Commission of Government gave 
     <lb/>
     it away for 15 cents a horsepower. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is not given away.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It would be the subject of an inde<lb break="no"/>pendent act. After the comments made by Major

     will not.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Let us see what it means: assuming 
     <lb/>
     they would produce 5 million tons a year and 
     <lb/>
     employ 2,500 people. If we are going to get no 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     profit of half a million a year...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Let us assume they produce 5 mil<lb break="no"/>lion tons of ore annually; 60% of that is in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and 40% is in Canada. Three million

     tons would be our share. What does it mean in 
     <lb/>
     earning power? There will be no profits tax. They 
     <lb/>
     will say they made no profits. We had a job

     getting it out of Dominion Iron and Steel. Add it

     And in Newfoundland they get it free. We hold a 
     <lb/>
     trump card in getting it here instead of in Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     I have that from one of the officials of the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Mining Co. The export of power should 
     <lb/>
     be given particular attention, and I am glad the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee has been instrumental in 
     <lb/>
     bringing it to the attention of the government, and 


            <cb/>
     

     that they are considering doing something about 
     <lb/>
     it. It was our only way to drive it home, to see 
     <lb/>
     they did not give any more away. We had that in 
     <lb/>
     mind when Major Flinn was before the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee. He indicated that in his opinion the water<lb break="no"/>power was practically under the control of the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Mining Company.

     that the company is given permission to develop

     only interest the Labrador Exploration Co. has. I

     <lb/>were not mining men at all, but a bunch of fools 
     <lb/>to consent to 10 cents on iron ore; that it was an 
     <lb/>unfair tax. Bell Island has been paying 10 cents a

     <lb/>
     here after the Labrador Exploration took over and 
     <lb/>
     they cajoled our mining experts — got them to 
     <lb/>
     change that section and gave them under the new 
     <lb/>
     act 5% net profits. What the revenue hopes to get 
     <lb/>
     out of this 5% tax is absolutely nil.... The com<lb break="no"/>pany is allowed to take 15% of all monies which

     they put into this area before they start to calcu<lb break="no"/>late the profits. I maintain whoever was respon<lb break="no"/>sible did not know what they were talking about.

     For some reason or other somebody was per<lb break="no"/>suaded to have this go through. The only thing

     we as a country will get from the development of

     these mines is the payment for the labour, and

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I notice some remarks have been 
     <lb/>
     made about one of the remarks of a certain mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this Convention yesterday. I don't exactly 
     <lb/>
     know what these references were, but I do know 
     <lb/>
     this: that this Convention was definitely referred 
     <lb/>
     to yesterday as a debating society. If we are 
     <lb/>
     purely and simply a debating society, I think there 
     <lb/>
     is very little room for these microphones here. 
     <lb/>
     That came up, as I remember, in a discussion on 
     <lb/>
     the matter of privilege. We were compared to a 
     <lb/>
     debating society, and had no more privilege than 
     <lb/>
     that. I feel that the presence of the microphones 
     <lb/>
     very certainly informs the general public as to the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings that have taken place. I do feel, 
     <lb/>
     however, that there are occasions when it would 
     <lb/>
     be wise that the prior discussion of certain mat<lb break="no"/>ters, at any rate, should not go out over the air, 
     <lb/>
     but merely the decision arrived at by the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion by a discussion which, in some cases, might 
     <lb/>
     possibly be heated. I don't think that is conducive
