<!-- GL, 2017-06-28, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

 <!--<p>
     Daily Express. True, it is an opposition paper — 
     <lb/>
     it probably wishes to make political capital out of 
     <lb/>
     the facts. But does that dispute the existance of 
     <lb/>
     these facts? Does it prove that they are not a true 
     <lb/>
     statement of conditions? Gentlemen, it is my 
     <lb/>
     opinion that we should not waste much time on 
     <lb/>
     this report. The answers to our questions could 
     <lb/>
     have been obtained by means of a registered 
     <lb/>
     letter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I close my remarks with this message: the 
     <lb/>
     people amongst us who love freedom, who love 
     <lb/>
     the traditions of this fine land, who cherish our 
     <lb/>
     traditions, must prepare themselves to defend 
     <lb/>
     these things if they would preserve them. At this 
     <lb/>
     very moment the lines of battle are drawn up, and 
     <lb/>
     walking amongst us are those whose burning 
     <lb/>
     ambition it is to see this country passed into the 
     <lb/>
     hands of strangers; to haul down the flag of our 
     <lb/>
     fathers and replace it with an alien one; to make 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     the Ode to Newfoundland a forgotten thing on the 
     <lb/>
    lips of our children, and to extinguish the torch 
     <lb/>which our liberty-loving ancestors cherished for 
     <lb/>nearly 100 years. All these things they will try to 
     <lb/>do under a banner to which they have nailed the 
     <lb/>dollar sign. But I tell them they will not succeed. 
     <lb/>Once before in our history our country had to 
     <lb/>meet such an attack. Once before there were those 
     <lb/>who sought to destroy her identity and sabotage 
     <lb/>her liberty, but a far poorer country and a less 
     <lb/>enlightened people gave them their answer. Shall 
     <lb/>we of today, blessed inhabitants of one of the 
     <lb/>most solvent countries in the world, fail where 
     <lb/>our fathers triumphed? I feel that I have the 
     <lb/>endorsement of all right-thinking New- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>foundlanders with me when I say that we shall 
     <lb/>not fail. 
     <lb/>

     the progress being made in connection with the

     matter of the arrangements for the conference

     between the delegation of this Convention and

            <p>
     The latter part of last week the delegation met 
     <lb/>
     and decided to advise the Government of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     through His Excellency the Governor, that the 
     <lb/>
     delegation would wish to meet with the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government as early as possible in the month of 
     <lb/>
     June. That presumably was communicated by 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency to His Majesty's Government in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and l have here before me a letter which 
     <lb/>
     has just been handed to me by His Excellency

     I write to inform you that, owing to 
     <lb/>
     various important events that are to take 
     <lb/>
     place in Canada during the early part of June, 
     <lb/>
     the earliest date that would be convenient for 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Government to receive the 
     <lb/>
     Delegation from the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     would be either June 25th or July 2nd. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     I would be glad if you would inform me 
   

            <cb/>
           

     respecting the preference of the Delegation 
     <lb/>
     in the matter.

            <p>That, presumably, is the substance of a despatch 
     <lb/>from His Majesty's Government in Canada to the 
     <lb/>Governor in Newfoundland. It is a development 
     <lb/>which I may say I anticipated to some extent. 
     <lb/>Many of you are aware of the fact that President 
     <lb/>Truman of the United States is likely to visit 
     <lb/>Ottawa in the early part of June, which will 
     <lb/>doubtless take up a considerable portion of the 
     <lb/>time of the Canadian government for three or four 
     <lb/>days, and a little later there is a very large con<lb break="no"/>gress which will meet in Ottawa, and which will 
     <lb/>bring into the city I believe about 150,000 
     <lb/>pilgrims. These proceedings will occupy a con<lb break="no"/>siderable period of time, and the Canadian 
     <lb/>government will be of course engaged to some 
     <lb/>extent in them. I would ask the Canadian delega<lb break="no"/>tion to meet me in my office when the House 
     <lb/>adjoums this evening.

     on getting the clear-cut reply it has brought us

     from the British government. The reply is clear,

     crisp and unmistakable. Except as to one point,

     <lb/>
     bonds at a saving of one-half of one percent. That 
     <lb/>
     will save us roughly half a million dollars a year 
     <lb/>
     in interest on our debt. That Britain will do 
     <lb/>
     whatever form of government we choose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Interest-free loans — the British government 
     <lb/>
     has $9 million of our money that our government 
     <lb/>
     loaned them during the war, free of interest. 
     <lb/>
     Britain says now she isn't anxious to pay interest 
     <lb/>
     on it, but whatever form of government we 
     <lb/>
     choose we can have the $9 million back when<lb break="no"/>ever we ask. They say they hope we won't ask 
     <lb/>
     them for it yet, because their own financial con<lb break="no"/>dition is pretty black — but whatever form of 
     <lb/>
     government we have, we can have that $9 million 
     <lb/>
     when we demand it. Development loans — 
     <lb/>
     whatever form of government we decide to have, 
     <lb/>
     Britain will not be able to lend us money for 
     <lb/>
     development purposes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Gander — so long as we are under Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government, Britain will pay two-thirds of 
     <lb/>
     the operating losses on Gander, and New<lb break="no"/>foundland one-third, with Newfoundland paying 
     <lb/>
     all the loss up to quarter of a million a year. Under 
     <lb/>
     any other form of government, the British 
     <lb/>
     government will not pay any of the losses on 
     <lb/>
  Gander. American bases — Britain will not try to 
     <lb/>
     get anything from the US for us in return for the 
     <lb/>
     American bases. She tells us that she sees no 
     <lb/>
     reason to think that the States would give us 
     <lb/>
     anything. It's Britain's opinion that no matter 
     <lb/>
     what form of government we may have, we will 
     <lb/>
     not get anything from the States. However, 
     <lb/>
     should we ever have our own government, 
     <lb/>
     Britain would be willing to help us try to get 
     <lb/>
     something from the States, even though she her<lb break="no"/>self does not think that the States would listen to 
     <lb/>
     it. Fish and ore — no matter what form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment we may have in future, Britain sees very 
     <lb/>
     little hope of any long-term contracts to sell New<lb break="no"/>foundland fish or iron ore in Great Britain. And 
     <lb/>
     that's the story, Mr. Chairman — these are the 
     <lb/>
     things the British government will do, or will not 


            <cb/>
           

     do, under this or that form of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But it's not the whole story. For example, the 
     <lb/>
     delegation asked the British government whether 
     <lb/>
     the national referendum could contain only two 
     <lb/>
     forms of government for the people to vote on — 
     <lb/>
     Commission government and responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, they asked them that question. No. 
     <lb/>
     said the British government, that is not so, the 
     <lb/>
     Convention can recommend other suitable forms 
     <lb/>
     of government. The National Convention Act, 
     <lb/>
     they tell us, clearly authorises the Convention to 
     <lb/>
     make recommendations as to possible future 
     <lb/>
     forms of government <hi rendition="simple:italic">in addition</hi> to Commission 
     <lb/>
     government and responsible government. And 
     <lb/>
     the British government told the delegation some<lb break="no"/>thing else. They said that if the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people should vote for responsible government, 
     <lb/>
     then from that minute that government would be 
     <lb/>
     completely responsible for Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     finances. The British government would no 
     <lb/>
     longer take the responsibility they took for New<lb break="no"/>foundland when we went under Commission 
     <lb/>
     government in 1934. If we vote for responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, then we are cut off without even the 
     <lb/>
     proverbial shilling; we'll be completely on our 
     <lb/>
     own, we'll have to paddle our own canoe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There's nothing surprising in that statement, 
     <lb/>
     nothing new in it. It's exactly what we expected, 
     <lb/>
     for in that statement the British government has 
     <lb/>
     only repeated one of the oldest, one of the most 
     <lb/>
     widely recognised principles of the British 
     <lb/>
     constitutional system. Back in 1894 the banks 
     <lb/>
     went broke. There are people in this country who 
     <lb/>
     remember that now. It was a desparate situation 
     <lb/>
     that confronted the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, as desparate a situation as ever con<lb break="no"/>fronted the Newfoundland government. The 
     <lb/>
     cabinet met, I believe it was Sir William 
     <lb/>
     Whiteway who was prime minister, they met day 
     <lb/>
     after day to see what they could do to deal with 
     <lb/>
     that desperate situation, and finally, on February 
     <lb/>
    11, 1895, the cabinet asked the Governor to send 
     <lb/>
     a cable to the Secretary of State, and this is the 
     <lb/>
     cable he sent:

            <p>
     The general principle of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment is plain and simple. If a British colony is 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting, then it's entitled to responsible 
     <lb/>
     government if it wants it. But the very fact that a 
     <lb/>
     British colony has responsible government is 
     <lb/>
     taken as meaning that it is not entitled to financial 
     <lb/>
     help from the British government. If the colony 
     <lb/>
     gets financial help from the British government 
     <lb/>
     it has to give up responsible government, because 
     <lb/>
     no colony is supposed to have responsible 
     <lb/>
     government unless and until it is fully self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting: and if it is fully self-supporting then it 
     <lb/>
     does not need financial help from the British 
     <lb/>
     government. Financial help and responsible 
     <lb/>
     government are like oil and water — they just 
     <lb/>
     don't mix, and so it is not surprising that the 
     <lb/>
     British government tells us that you can have 
     <lb/>
     responsible government if the people vote for it, 
  

            <cb/>
        

     but if you have it don't count on financial help 
     <lb/>
     from us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And now there is one final piece of informa<lb break="no"/>tion that the British government gave our London 
     <lb/>
     delegation: if the Newfoundland people decide to 
     <lb/>
     stay under Commission government, then the 
     <lb/>
     British government will go on being responsible 
     <lb/>
     for our Country's finances. They'll be responsible 
     <lb/>
     for us if we stay under Commission government. 
     <lb/>
     That, Mr. Chairman, is a gallant offer by the 
     <lb/>
     mother country — a very gallant offer indeed. It 
     <lb/>
     is an offer that stirs our emotion. The very gal<lb break="no"/>lantry of it brings the tears to our eyes. The old 
     <lb/>
     mother country is on the broad of her back. Men 
     <lb/>
     around the world are wondering privately if 
     <lb/>
     Britain is headed for a financial smash. She has 
     <lb/>
     just come through the worst calamity in history. 
     <lb/>
     She has been blitzed and smashed almost to 
     <lb/>
     pieces — millions of her homes and buildings 
     <lb/>
     levelled to the ground by bombs. Her industries 
     <lb/>
     have been drained of their vitality, her factories 
     <lb/>
     and mills have fallen into decay, her shipping has 
     <lb/>
     been sent to the bottom in millions of tons. She 
     <lb/>
     opened her very veins and poured out her blood 
     <lb/>
     in her own defence and the defence of the 
     <lb/>
     civilised world. Britain gave her all, to the last 
     <lb/>
     farthing. Her people are bowed down now with a 
     <lb/>
     public debt of $100,000 million — over $10,000 
     <lb/>
     for every family. The British people have the 
     <lb/>
     highest public debt in the whole world. Britain is 
     <lb/>
     in debt to her very eyes — you could almost say 
     <lb/>
     she's mortgaged up to the hilt, to the very limit, 
     <lb/>
     yes, and beyond. the limit.... Altogether in the 
     <lb/>
     world today the mother country owes more than 
     <lb/>
     $20 billion.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The whole world is aware of Britain's plight. 
     <lb/>
     She's being kept alive today by blood plasma in 
     <lb/>
     the form of American and Canadian dollars 
     <lb/>
     loaned to her. And we are given to understand 
     <lb/>
     that shortly she is coming to Canada to ask for 
     <lb/>
     another loan of $500 million on top of the $2,000 
     <lb/>
     million that the Canadian government loaned her 
     <lb/>
     last year. Australia the other day gave Britain a 
     <lb/>
     gift of $80 million. New Zealand on the same day 
     <lb/>
     gave her a gift of $40 million. Those were not 
     <lb/>
     cash gifts, those two British countries simply 
     <lb/>
     reduced by those amounts the debts that Britain 
     <lb/>
     owed them. It was a gesture of goodwill to the old 
     <lb/>
     mother country in her calamity, something like 
     <lb/>
     the bowl of hot broth that a neighbour in New<lb break="no"/>foundland carried to a sick patient next door. For 
    

            <pb n="538"

            <fw type="dateline">538</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw>
          

     that is what Britain is today — she is the sick 
     <lb/>
     patient of this world. It will take her many years 
     <lb/>
     to pull through, and she is going to need all kinds 
     <lb/>
     of help to do it even then. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And that is why, Mr. Chairman, Britain's 
     <lb/>
     offer to Newfoundland is such a gallant one — 
     <lb/>
     one of the most pathetically gallant offers this 
     <lb/>
     world has ever seen. It is an offer to share her 
     <lb/>
     poverty with us, with Newfoundland. As long as 
     <lb/>
     the old mother country has a crust of bread she 
     <lb/>
     offers to share it with us. Let us reverence her for 
     <lb/>
     it. In 1934 she took over financial responsibilty 
     <lb/>
     for Newfoundland. She said if we gave up 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, and came under Com<lb break="no"/>mission government, she'd come to our rescue. 
     <lb/>
     Britain was better off then than we were. It was 
     <lb/>
     a little better than a crust of bread that she offered 
     <lb/>
     to share with us then in 1934. That was six years 
     <lb/>
     before the war broke out. Today she is letting 
     <lb/>
     rich India, Burma, rich Palestine go, she is giving 
     <lb/>
     up her vital control of Greece to the United States. 
     <lb/>
     She is cutting some of her terrible losses, but out 
     <lb/>
     of her poverty offers to continue to be responsible 
     <lb/>
     for Newfoundland if we should decide to hold on 
     <lb/>
     to Commission government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I wonder what Britain's 
     <lb/>
     private thoughts are about this matter. Is she 
     <lb/>
     privately hoping that Newfoundland will not take 
     <lb/>
     her up on that offer? Does Britain make us this 
     <lb/>
     offer out of a sense of honour?.... Does she make 
     <lb/>
     it in the hope that we here in Newfoundland know 
     <lb/>
     enough about Britain's own terrible plight not to 
     <lb/>
     take her up on it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to take a look, a 
     <lb/>
     close look, at what, this magnaminous, this gal<lb break="no"/>lant offer of Britain really boils down to. Suppose 
     <lb/>
     we Newfoundlanders in the referendum vote to 
     <lb/>
     go on under Commission government. Just what 
     <lb/>
     will that mean? Just what help would it mean to 
     <lb/>
     us from the mother country? We've got two 
     <lb/>
     things to judge by. We have the period from 1934 
     <lb/>
     to 1940, when we desperately needed help from 
     <lb/>
     Britain, when she was much better off than she is 
     <lb/>
     today. What did Britain give us then?.... Out of 
     <lb/>
     her taxes Britain paid over to us certain modest 
     <lb/>
     amounts, just barely enough to keep our people 
     <lb/>
     alive, hardly that. The Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment between 1934 and 1940 was always hard- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     up, always short of money. They couldn't do this 
     <lb/>
     and they couldn't do that. Our public services 
     <lb/>
     were starved. It was only after 1940 that they 
  

            <cb/>
          

     really began to spend money and then they were 
     <lb/>
     getting it from us Newfoundlanders. In fairness 
     <lb/>
     to their own taxpayers, the British government 
     <lb/>
     could only hand money over to us in dribs and 
     <lb/>
     drabs, in very small amounts between 1934 and 
     <lb/>
     1940. That is the first thing we have to judge by. 
     <lb/>
     The other thing is Britain's own condition now 
     <lb/>
     and for years to come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, judging by these facts, what help would 
     <lb/>
     Britain give us in future, if we did vote for Com<lb break="no"/>mission government? Suppose hard times fell 
     <lb/>
     upon us, another depression, just what financial 
     <lb/>
     help could we expect from the mother country? 
     <lb/>
     Here is how it works. In the fall of the year the 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner for Finance sends around to all 
     <lb/>
     the departments; he says we are going to make up 
     <lb/>
     a budget, you let me know what your department 
     <lb/>
     will need, and let me have it as soon as you can. 
     <lb/>
     The departments send back estimates, and from 
     <lb/>
     those estimates the Commissioner makes up his 
     <lb/>
     budget. He says for the year beginning April 1, I 
     <lb/>
     am going to spend say $15 million; the only 
     <lb/>
     revenue I can collect is $13 million. I am going 
     <lb/>
     to have a deficit of $2 million. What does he do 
     <lb/>
     next? He sends his budget to the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office, hands it over to the accountants of the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury.... If they approve that budget they are 
     <lb/>
     going to have to pony up $2 million. What do they 
     <lb/>
     do? They cut down the expenditure. They say to 
     <lb/>
     the Commission, "We will allow you a deficit of 
     <lb/>
     $1 million or $500,000, that is what we are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to pay." When the Commissioner for 
     <lb/>
     Finance was before the committee some time 
     <lb/>
     ago, we asked him how the British government 
     <lb/>
     exercised control over the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government and he said, "They control our 
     <lb/>
     budget." If we go on under Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, what can we expect in 1948 or 
     <lb/>
     1958? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am driven to the conclusion that this offer 
     <lb/>
     that the United Kingdom government has made 
     <lb/>
     us, this offer to go on being responsible for our 
     <lb/>
     country if we really do decide to hold on to 
     <lb/>
     Commission government — I am driven to 
     <lb/>
     believe that any help we would get would be on 
     <lb/>
     the smallest possible scale, just bare token pay<lb break="no"/>ments each year. Dole would be the lowest pos<lb break="no"/>sible scale, our public services would be starved. 
     <lb/>
     The Commission government would always be 
     <lb/>
     short of money. The only money they would have 
     <lb/>
     would be what taxes we might be able to pay 
    

            <pb n="539"

     them, and a small trickle of money from the old 
     <lb/>
     country. The mother country would share her 
     <lb/>
     poverty with us. That is what Commission of 
     <lb/>
     government would mean in future, if we New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders decide to take up the old country's 
     <lb/>
     gallant offer to us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, our people must have a free hand in this 
     <lb/>
     matter. If they want to vote to go on under Com<lb break="no"/>mission govemment, they must have the right to 
     <lb/>
     do it — after all, it is their country, it is not ours. 
     <lb/>
     But if they vote for Commission government, 
     <lb/>
     they deserve to know what they will be voting 
     <lb/>
     for. I believe that in voting to go on under Com<lb break="no"/>mission government, our people would be voting 
     <lb/>
     for financial help from Britain that just would not 
     <lb/>
     be forthcoming. They would be voting for a 
     <lb/>
     shadow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Finally, I want to say a word of congratulation 
     <lb/>
     to Major Cashin on his speech yesterday. I have 
     <lb/>
     no doubt that he fought in London, along with the 
     <lb/>
     other delegates, to get all he could for New<lb break="no"/>foundland; but I also know that in his heart it must 
     <lb/>
     have been very little he expected from a country 
     <lb/>
     that is up against what Britain is up against today. 
     <lb/>
     I do not expect that he or the delegates can be 
     <lb/>
     disappointed. If I wanted to be nasty, I could take 
     <lb/>
     up his speech and criticise it, but I want Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin to back me up. I want to make him my 
     <lb/>
     minister of finance. He has been fighting for 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, and I believe he is as 
     <lb/>
     sincere in that as I may be in fighting for con<lb break="no"/>federation if we get good terms. If I wanted to 
     <lb/>
     make him angry, I would say what Sir Edward 
     <lb/>
     Morris said (standing about where I am standing 
     <lb/>
     now) to Sir William Coaker. He said (pointing his 
     <lb/>
     finger at Sir William), "I will get you when I want 
     <lb/>
     you." I will not say that, because I am sure of one 
     <lb/>
     thing; if the day ever comes when Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     makes up his mind that there is a better chance to 
     <lb/>
     get rid of Commission of Government by going 
     <lb/>
     into confederation, I believe he will be a con<lb break="no"/>federate from that day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Yesterday Major Cashin gave us some news. 
     <lb/>
     He told us that he brought back from London the 
     <lb/>
     firm opinion that the British government would 
     <lb/>
     be pleased if Newfoundland did throw in her lot 
     <lb/>
     with the Dominion of Canada. I do not know if 
     <lb/>
     Lord Addison or the prime minister told him that, 
     <lb/>
     but he told us, and I hope he is right. Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin, like myself, is an old-timer; he has been 
     <lb/>
     gauging public opinion for a long time. If the 
   

            <cb/>
        

     people of Newfoundland thought that the British 
     <lb/>
     government would like us to link up with Canada, 
     <lb/>
     that will make more confederates in New<lb break="no"/>foundland than Joe Smallwood could make if I 
     <lb/>
     am talking for a year. There is another hit of news. 
     <lb/>
     He said that up in Ottawa they are pleased that 
     <lb/>
     this delegation is going up there; they are 
     <lb/>
     delighted; they are not writing back and demand<lb break="no"/>ing to know this, that, and the other thing; they 
     <lb/>
     said, "Come on up", with their heart in their hand. 
     <lb/>
     He said the joy bells will ring. I hope they are 
     <lb/>
     glad, because if the joy bells ring out in Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     it means they really want Newfoundland; and that 
     <lb/>
     means they will give us better terms than I am 
     <lb/>
     hoping for now, and I will get out fighting for 
     <lb/>
     confederation and a better Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I agree with Mr. Smallwood when 
     <lb/>
     he said that some members of the delegation were 
     <lb/>
     not disappointed. I know I was not disappointed 
     <lb/>
     with the information we got. I was very pleased 
     <lb/>
     we got the information from the Dominions Of<lb break="no"/>fice that the people themselves would have the 
     <lb/>
     right to decide what form of government we 
     <lb/>
     would have in this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We ought to remember the plight of the British 
     <lb/>
     people is a very serious one. No one could go to 
     <lb/>
     England, meet the people and see what they have 
     <lb/>
     to put up with in the way of shortages, without 
     <lb/>
     realising how high a price they paid for victory, 
     <lb/>
     and are still paying. On top of that, they have had 
     <lb/>
     a good deal of bad luck. Everything seemed to 
     <lb/>
     come together and it is astonishing to see how 
     <lb/>
     cheerful they are in the face of all their trouble, 
     <lb/>
     and how sure they are of coming back to 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have heard it said we went to England to ask 
     <lb/>
     for help. That was never in my mind, and I am 
     <lb/>
     sure it was never in the mind of any of my 
     <lb/>
     colleagues on the delegation. We did not want 
     <lb/>
     help, and sought for nothing except what we felt 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was entitled to, and what was fair. 
     <lb/>
     We did want information, and we thought we 
     <lb/>
     were entitled to discuss and ask for trade agree<lb break="no"/>ments with England.... On the financial side, all 
     <lb/>
     we wanted was the right to suggest that the money 
     <lb/>
     on interest-free loan in England should be used 
     <lb/>
     to reduce our debt. That would have saved us 
     <lb/>
     about $400,000 a year in interest and sinking fund 
     <lb/>
     at no cost to Britain. In fact, since she guarantees 
     <lb/>
     the debt, it would be helpful to her to have a good 
     <lb/>
     slice of it paid off by our cancellation of a dollar 
   

            <pb n="540"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-20_Page_0540.jpg"/>

     loan. We were told that the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government did not think it prudent, having 
     <lb/>
     regard for the development requirements of the 
     <lb/>
     country, to use the balance of the loans for debt 
     <lb/>
     reduction. The Commission of Government did 
     <lb/>
     not think it prudent to save this country $400,000 
     <lb/>
     a year in interest. The Commission is spending 
     <lb/>
     more money than any government ever dreamed 
     <lb/>
     of spending on what it calls development. Unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately, none of it is productive development. 
     <lb/>
     And this extravagant government does not think 
     <lb/>
     it <hi rendition="simple:italic">prudent to reduce our debt and save us 
     <lb/>
     $400,000 a year</hi>. That, sir, was as far as we could 
     <lb/>
     get on that issue. The Commission did not think 
     <lb/>
     it prudent. The Dominions Office agreed, and 
     <lb/>
     that was that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What inference can we draw from all this? If 
     <lb/>
     we used that $10 million to reduce the debt we 
     <lb/>
     would still have $20 million left on which to draw 
     <lb/>
     if need should arise. Does this mean that the 
     <lb/>
     Commission expects to have so much of the 
     <lb/>
     surplus spent by 1950 that it will have to draw on 
     <lb/>
     that money in England? If that is the case, then I 
     <lb/>
     say the quicker we get them out the better, for no 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government would ever think of 
     <lb/>
     spending money on that scale to so little purpose, 
     <lb/>
     and have any hope of saving its political neck. 
     <lb/>
     There is no special cause to be grateful for the 
     <lb/>
     conversion of the sterling debt coming up next 
     <lb/>
     January. Money can be borrowed in the open 
     <lb/>
     market at 2.5% and we should be getting the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of it. We should also have the debt 
     <lb/>
     reduced by the amount of the sinking fund. I am 
     <lb/>
     not particularly grateful for this intention to con<lb break="no"/>vert, because it should be done, it costs nobody 
     <lb/>
     anything and it saves us something worthwhile. 
     <lb/>
     It was suggested to Commissioner Wild by the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee sometime before he left for 
     <lb/>
     England. No doubt the prudent Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government will be able to use the saving on debt 
     <lb/>
     interest to good advantage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are many things about our visit to Lon<lb break="no"/>don to which I would like to refer. I did not like 
     <lb/>
     the attitude of the Dominions Secretary about 
     <lb/>
     Gander airport. I did not like his attitude about 
     <lb/>
     the US bases, I did not like a lot of things he said, 
     <lb/>
     and I liked least of all the way in which he was 
     <lb/>
     able to turn aside any questions of importance 
     <lb/>
     when it did not suit him to answer them. We were 
     <lb/>
     only a group of Newfoundlanders, the elected 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the people, trying our best to 
 

            <cb/>
          

     get some accounting of stewardship, and some 
     <lb/>
     improvements in our financial relations with 
     <lb/>
     Britain, and all we got was frustration at every 
     <lb/>
     step. I have no personal axe to grind, but I felt that 
     <lb/>
     we were unwelcome visitors who were going to 
     <lb/>
     get as little information as possible. In fact, it was 
     <lb/>
     clear that the quicker we relieved England of our 
     <lb/>
     presence, the happier the Dominions Office 
     <lb/>
     crowd would be 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But there is one thing that made me more 
     <lb/>
     angry than anything else, and that was the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of our trade with Britain. I do not have to tell 
     <lb/>
     the Convention or the country that our problem 
     <lb/>
     is markets. During the war years we built up our 
     <lb/>
     frozen fish industry from about 3 million to 30 
     <lb/>
     million pounds a year. During these years we 
     <lb/>
     could have sold most of our output to the United 
     <lb/>
     States, but Britain's urgent needs naturally 
     <lb/>
     caused the producers to give priority to United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom markets at prices below those ob<lb break="no"/>tainable elsewhere. That was the right thing to do, 
     <lb/>
     nobody can have two opinions on this point. 
     <lb/>
     When the war was over the demand for New<lb break="no"/>foundland fish was greatly reduced, not because 
     <lb/>
     Britain could not use our fish, but because the 
     <lb/>
     Ministry of Food had to buy it elsewhere. I intend 
     <lb/>
     now to give a brief history of the negotiations that 
     <lb/>
     went on this year for the sale of 20 million pounds 
     <lb/>
     of frozen fillets to the British market. A price was 
     <lb/>
     agreed which was lower than fish could be 
     <lb/>
     bought from other suppliers. Our products met 
     <lb/>
     difficult conditions relating to shipment. Every<lb break="no"/>thing seemed to be in the bag, and then the 
     <lb/>
     Ministry of Food reneged, and the news came to 
     <lb/>
     us from other sources that the order was going to 
     <lb/>
     Norway. The trouble, it was said, was the scarcity 
     <lb/>
     of dollars. It was then proposed that Britain 
     <lb/>
     should take payment for the new Railway 
     <lb/>
     steamers in fish, but this proposition was 
     <lb/>
     rejected, presumably because the dollars had al<lb break="no"/>ready been transferred, even though the first ship 
     <lb/>
     would not be ready before July, and the others 
     <lb/>
     much later. So the last word local suppliers had, 
     <lb/>
     was that the Dominions Office had reported 
     <lb/>
     having carried the matter to the highest quarters, 
     <lb/>
     and had been advised to tell the New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders that there was nothing doing. It 
     <lb/>
     reminds me of the famous remark of a French 
     <lb/>
     queen who, when told the French peasants had no 
     <lb/>
     bread, asked, "Why don't they eat cake?" 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This fish matter was very much on my mind 


            <pb n="541"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-20_Page_0541.jpg"/>

     when I went to England. I am not in the frozen 
     <lb/>
     fillet business, but I know what diversification 
     <lb/>
     can mean to the fish industry. People had put 
     <lb/>
     large sums of money into cold storage and 
     <lb/>
     processing equipment. New draggers had been 
     <lb/>
     built. The fresh frozen fishery was changing the 
     <lb/>
     lot of many thousands of fishermen by giving 
     <lb/>
     them cash returns and relieving them of the toil 
     <lb/>
     and uncertainty of curing salt cod. However, to 
     <lb/>
     keep up production until the American and other 
     <lb/>
     markets expand, we have to find an outlet for our 
     <lb/>
     full production for a period of two or three years 
     <lb/>
     of readjustment. Britain had taken most of our 
     <lb/>
     fillets. Now she is cutting us off completely, and 
     <lb/>
     giving orders to Norway and Iceland. When this 
     <lb/>
     matter was raised, Lord Addison did admit that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland fish was preferred by the Ministry 
     <lb/>
     of Food. When he was then asked why negotia<lb break="no"/>tions were going on for the purchase of 12,000 
     <lb/>
     tons of Icelandic fish at higher prices, while New<lb break="no"/>foundland had fish to offer, he said that Iceland 
     <lb/>
     was a soft money country. I told him that the 
     <lb/>
     Icelanders had to get goods, if, <hi rendition="simple:italic">with this money 
     <lb/>
     they were unable to buy things in other markets</hi>, 
     <lb/>
     because, you know, you can't eat five pound 
     <lb/>
     notes, and then Lord Addison tried to change the 
     <lb/>
     subject. I referred to our suggestion that New<lb break="no"/>foundland lend dollars out of her surplus to help 
     <lb/>
     Britain pay for our fish, and all the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Secretary did was to tell us we had no right to be 
     <lb/>
     discussing trade matters. These were outside our 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference. It was pointed out that we had 
     <lb/>
     to report on the economic prospects of the 
     <lb/>
     country, and had to know something about these 
     <lb/>
     trade matters, and all we met was a brick wall. 
     <lb/>
     The only possible conclusion was that it was a 
     <lb/>
     political matter and that, for reasons best known 
     <lb/>
     to herself and not for shortage of dollars, Britain 
     <lb/>
     was willing to buy Icelandic fish that she did not 
     <lb/>
     like as well as ours, and was willing to pay more 
     <lb/>
     for it than our producers wanted. If that is a square 
     <lb/>
     deal, I don't know what the term means.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On other matters we were left in a state of 
     <lb/>
     uncertainty. We can get no assurance that they 
     <lb/>
     will keep on buying Bell Island ore, even though 
     <lb/>
     very soon the British government itself will own 
     <lb/>
     and operate the steel mills through nationalisa<lb break="no"/>tion, and thus will not have to intercede with 
     <lb/>
     private owners. We can get no assurance they will 
     <lb/>
     continue to buy other local products they can use. 
     <lb/>
     They turned us down cold on our proposition to 
    

            <cb/>
           

     lend them dollars, and then they expect us to 
     <lb/>
     come home happy and tell you what grand people 
     <lb/>
     they are because they got us a car to see the sights 
     <lb/>
     of London, and tickets for a football match, and 
     <lb/>
     tickets to an A.P. Herbert show. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     the very existence of the people of this country is 
     <lb/>
     bound up in these trade matters, but it seems to 
     <lb/>
     me that the position of our people is less of 
     <lb/>
     importance than the special British interests in 
     <lb/>
     Iceland and elsewhere. In the end, on all matters 
     <lb/>
     that they didn't want to talk about, we were told 
     <lb/>
     that we were outside our terms of reference. We 
     <lb/>
     were reminded we were not a government, al<lb break="no"/>though I cannot help thinking that, as the only 
     <lb/>
     elected representatives of the people, we have 
     <lb/>
     more right to be considered their spokesmen than 
     <lb/>
     this prudent Commission whose voice may be its 
     <lb/>
     own, but whose acts are those of the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office. Time and again we were told the Com<lb break="no"/>mission was the government, and it was up to 
     <lb/>
     them to propose this or suggest that. We said the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office was the real government, 
     <lb/>
     which they half-denied and half-admitted. I can 
     <lb/>
     assure you the Dominions Office is the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and Commission government only its 
     <lb/>
     agents, in fact one Commissioner asked us to 
     <lb/>
     remember that they were only agents.... It is all 
     <lb/>
     very well for them to tell us that if we choose 
     <lb/>
     Commission government they will guarantee our 
     <lb/>
     debt and our solvency. They hedge these guaran<lb break="no"/>tees about with such qualifications as "to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of our ability" and so on. In any case, Lord 
     <lb/>
     Addison can safely promise for the time being 
     <lb/>
     because our prudent Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     still has $30 million to spend and seem to be 
     <lb/>
     getting through it with anything but the prudence 
     <lb/>
     that Lord Addison gives them credit for. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Just a word about Gander. What I didn't like 
     <lb/>
     was their ramming down our throats the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the British taxpayer will have to foot this 
     <lb/>
     $500,000 a year as their share of Gander's deficit. 
     <lb/>
     I am as sorry for the British taxpayer as anyone 
     <lb/>
     can be, but don't let this get out of line. The 
     <lb/>
     people of Britain are poor in goods. They are not 
     <lb/>
     short of money, but even if they had lots of money 
     <lb/>
     and all that money was dollars, it would be the 
     <lb/>
     same thing as far as I am concerned. Gander is 
     <lb/>
     directed by the British government. The special 
     <lb/>
     position of the United Kingdom in New<lb break="no"/>foundland has enabled the British government to 
     <lb/>
     get special concessions from other countries for 
 

            <pb n="542"

     its nationalised airline. Those privileges are 
     <lb/>
     worth more than money. We are not allowed to 
     <lb/>
     operate Gander as a private enterprise, to see if 
     <lb/>
     we can make it pay. We are not allowed to lease 
     <lb/>
     it to PICAO<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> or anyone else so that we can escape 
     <lb/>
     the deficit. We have no rights there, and then 
     <lb/>
     when we say that we should not have to be 
     <lb/>
     saddled with the deficit of $750,000 on Gander 
     <lb/>
     because it is not being run on business lines, they 
     <lb/>
     tell us this $500,000 a year to pay two-thirds of 
     <lb/>
     the deficit is at the expense of the British tax<lb break="no"/>payer. It is not cricket to give us that kind of 
     <lb/>
     answer and they know it. Why should they throw 
     <lb/>
     us this stuff about the British taxpayer as if we 
     <lb/>
     were trying to rob the poor, when we object to 
     <lb/>
     paying the deficit on an airport we are supposed 
     <lb/>
     to own and don't control? And with all due sym<lb break="no"/>pathy to that British taxpayer, Mr. Chairman, I 
     <lb/>
     would point out that the Chancellor of the Exche<lb break="no"/>quer expects to have a large surplus in the present 
     <lb/>
     fiscal year. We, in this country, with the highest 
     <lb/>
     revenue we have ever had, are expected to have 
     <lb/>
     a deficit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I got a great surprise in the discussion of the 
     <lb/>
     US base deal. I always thought that it was not part 
     <lb/>
     of the destroyer deal. That was officially stated 
     <lb/>
     at the time. To my astonishment, Lord Addison 
     <lb/>
     said the Americans would not have given the 
     <lb/>
     destroyers without the bases in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     We were deceived even there. I know the 
     <lb/>
     Americans drove a hard bargain. I still don't think 
     <lb/>
     that the agreements should have been made 
     <lb/>
     beyond the duration without some reciprocal ar<lb break="no"/>rangement. The Americans got from us, through 
     <lb/>
     their hard bargain with a desperate Britain, 
     <lb/>
     privileges which they would have given millions 
     <lb/>
     to get by purchase, They got all these things out 
     <lb/>
     of Britain's need in order to serve their own 
     <lb/>
     defence interest. I don't know what would have 
     <lb/>
     happened if we had a Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     that said Britain could give America everything 
     <lb/>
     we had for the duration, and we would reserve 
     <lb/>
     the right to enter into reciprocal negotiations 
     <lb/>
     afterwards. I don't mind venturing the guess that 
     <lb/>
     Britain would still have got the destroyers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have come back a disappointed man. I ex<lb break="no"/>pected nothing that was not fair and reasonable. 
     <lb/>
     I am as loyal and patriotic as any man in this 
     <lb/>
     country. I want no part in imposing new burdens 
     <lb/>
     on Britain in her present need. But we asked for 
   

            <cb/>
           

     nothing that was not fair, that was not right, and 
     <lb/>
     that would have put any new hardships on the 
     <lb/>
     British government or the British people. We did 
     <lb/>
     not get the kind reception we expected. I did not 
     <lb/>
     expect to see flags waving and the Lord Mayor 
     <lb/>
     standing in his robes at the entrance to the City 
     <lb/>
     of London to greet us. But I did think that the 
     <lb/>
     people who have been trustees for this country, 
     <lb/>
     and who have disposed of so many of our assets 
     <lb/>
     in these past 14 years, might at least have been a 
     <lb/>
     bit more cordial in their discussions. It looks to 
     <lb/>
     me, sir, that Newfoundland is still the Cinderella 
     <lb/>
     of the Empire. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We suggested they reduce our debt by apply<lb break="no"/>ing the $10 million interest-free loan to its reduc<lb break="no"/>tion. They said no, although it cost them nothing, 
     <lb/>
     and it would have saved $400,000 a year in 
     <lb/>
     interest and $100,000 a year in sinking fund 
     <lb/>
     charges. We suggested lending them dollars to 
     <lb/>
     buy fish they wanted and were going to take at 
     <lb/>
     higher prices from other countries, and they said 
     <lb/>
     no, and told us we had no right even to talk about 
     <lb/>
     it. They would make no definite promises about 
     <lb/>
     a few million dollars worth of ore from Bell 
     <lb/>
     Island, although they want ore and have to buy it 
     <lb/>
     from Spain or Sweden if not from New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and pay for it in something the 
     <lb/>
     Swedes or Spaniards can use. The only pledge of 
     <lb/>
     any kind was that, if we got into financial difficul<lb break="no"/>ties after all our surplus was gone, they would try 
     <lb/>
     within the limits of their financial position to help 
     <lb/>
     keep us solvent. Well, I know what that means. 
     <lb/>
     When they had plenty of dollars the best that was 
     <lb/>
     done for us by the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     was to pay out dole at the rate of 6 cents a day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I am not afraid to stand alone 
     <lb/>
     as a Newfoundlander. We are a fine people. We 
     <lb/>
     should be an independent people. I want no 
     <lb/>
     presents or gifts from anyone, and I think what 
     <lb/>
     we have heard as a result of our visit ought to 
     <lb/>
     suggest to us that we should decide to stand on 
     <lb/>
     our own feet and work out our future by our own 
     <lb/>
     efforts. As I see it, what we were told in London 
     <lb/>
     leaves us no choice. I am a Britisher and I intend 
     <lb/>
     to stay one. I have, as I said before, the greatest 
     <lb/>
     sympathy for the ordinary people of Britain, and 
     <lb/>
     I want nothing from them. But I am not satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that this country has the kind of sympathy that 
     <lb/>
     ought to exist between blood relations, and for 
     <lb/>
     that I blame the Dominions Office and not the

     British people, who would be as amazed as l was 
     <lb/>
     if they knew the truth. Mr. Chairman, we know 
     <lb/>
     where we stand. I hope we have the guts to do 
     <lb/>
     what our fathers would have done, and show the 
     <lb/>
     world that Newfoundlanders are able to stand on 
     <lb/>
     their own feet and run their country as well as any 
     <lb/>
     other people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Lastly, gentlemen, I am going to surprise you 
     <lb/>
     by telling you of two statements Lord Addison 
     <lb/>
     made with which I agree one hundred per cent. 
     <lb/>
     At the finish of our last interview, one statement 
     <lb/>
     was, "God bless Newfoundland"; and when one 
     <lb/>
     delegate replied, "God help Newfoundland", he 
     <lb/>
     replied, "God helps them that help themselves." 
     <lb/>
     Whether or not Lord Addison realised it, he hit 
     <lb/>
     the nail on the head, because if we are not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to help ourselves and fight for a better 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, irrespective of class and creed, 
     <lb/>
     through co-operation together, we have no right 
     <lb/>
     to expect help from others, and if we do, we 
     <lb/>
     certainly have no right to expect manna. So I say 
     <lb/>
     to us all as Newfoundlanders, let's forget petty 
     <lb/>
     jealousies, and pull altogether for Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Newfoundland only. I am confident that if we 
     <lb/>
     do, our standard of living will be much higher, 
     <lb/>
     and many of our problems will disappear like 
     <lb/>
     chaff before the wind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> ....The report of the delegation is clear 
     <lb/>
     and unmistakable, printed so that everybody can 
     <lb/>
     read it for themselves, but there are certain im<lb break="no"/>pressions arising out of the visit to England which 
     <lb/>
     I would like to pass on. Before doing so, however, 
     <lb/>
     and I do this rather tentatively, I must say that it 
     <lb/>
     sounds to me that some of the remarks of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood came perilously near to non<lb break="no"/>sense. He said, "The British government have 
     <lb/>
     really done something which ought to stir our 
     <lb/>
     emotions and bring tears to our eyes when they 
     <lb/>
     said they would be responsible for our finances 
     <lb/>
     if we stay under Commission of Government." I 
     <lb/>
     read that statement of Lord Addison's, and to my 
     <lb/>
     mind it has absolutely no meaning unless we are 
     <lb/>
     going to wait until Britain can say, "We have the 
     <lb/>
     dollars to help you", or until all the surplus dollars 
     <lb/>
     we have are gone, because the position is that the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom has told us that she has not got 
     <lb/>
     the dollars to help us, but she said, "You are a 
     <lb/>
     prosperous country — you have the dollars". I 
     <lb/>
     cannot understand how anyone can think in terms 
     <lb/>
     of the form of government we are going to have 
     <lb/>
     in ten or 15 years from now in the changing world 
    

            <cb/>
           

     of the present. I contend that that statement of 
     <lb/>
     Lord Addison has no meaning unless you think 
     <lb/>
     in terms of five or ten years time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another thing, I am not a financier, but some<lb break="no"/>thing else which sounds like nonsense to me is 
     <lb/>
     this, "The principle of a guarantee of a 
     <lb/>
     govemment's loan cannot hold true when we 
     <lb/>
     have responsible government." In 1933 or 1934 
     <lb/>
     when we gave up (shall I say?) our responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, the United Kingdom government 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed our loan. What was done in effect was 
     <lb/>
     this: an act was passed which said that the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland should issue ster<lb break="no"/>ling bonds, on the back of which the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom put her guarantee. It appears to me that 
     <lb/>
     no matter what form of government we have in 
     <lb/>
     the future that guarantee stands. I can't see how 
     <lb/>
     they can get out of it if we hold them to it.... I said 
     <lb/>
     before, other documents speak for themselves, 
     <lb/>
     but there are one or two observations which I 
     <lb/>
     would like to make on the treatment accorded to 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland delegation by the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As an example, I am going to take the method 
     <lb/>
     of procedure which I consider to be pretty poor. 
     <lb/>
     First we had a meeting which was nothing more 
     <lb/>
     than "How do you do". At the second meeting it 
     <lb/>
     was clear that it was only going to be a general 
     <lb/>
     discussion of the problems, and we got a 
     <lb/>
     transcript of this document which we could study 
     <lb/>
     afterwards until the next meeting. What actually 
     <lb/>
     happened was that we were presented with this 
     <lb/>
     document on behalf of the British government 
     <lb/>
     and Lord Addison said, "You may consider this 
     <lb/>
     as my mature consideration, and not much 
     <lb/>
     change will be made in it anyway." As a result of 
     <lb/>
     that the Newfoundland delegation were deter<lb break="no"/>mined they were going to have something to say, 
     <lb/>
     and so we put in this memorandum.... We were 
     <lb/>
     told then in no uncertain terms, "You have no 
     <lb/>
     business to be talking about these things".... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let us turn to the document. First of all 
     <lb/>
     there was the sterling debt. I had in my mind the 
     <lb/>
     position of the British government and people 
     <lb/>
     when we approached them on the sterling debt, 
     <lb/>
     but I also had in mind Newfoundlanders who, for 
     <lb/>
     the last 200 years, have suffered plenty and more 
     <lb/>
     than that because of debt, which we contracted I 
     <lb/>
     grant you. At one stage of the game we were 
     <lb/>
     paying half our revenues and a little more in 
     <lb/>
     interest. I had in my mind at the same time the 


            <pb n="544"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-20_Page_0544.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">544</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw>
          

     fact that Newfoundland was suffering because of 
     <lb/>
     her debt, and England was now suffering because 
     <lb/>
     of certain debts contracted because of the war, 
     <lb/>
     and so were we, but at the same time we were 
     <lb/>
     asking for something to be done; and on that same 
     <lb/>
     date the daily newspapers carried the heading 
     <lb/>
     "Lord Dalton declares war on war debts". Lord 
     <lb/>
     Addison had never heard of Alberta or Australian 
     <lb/>
     war finance. He had never heard of these things 
     <lb/>
     except insofar as Newfoundland was concerned, 
     <lb/>
     and Newfoundland was asked to pay.... The point 
     <lb/>
     is this: that the British government, and make no 
     <lb/>
     doubt about it, have already started to scale down 
     <lb/>
     these war debts, and in one way and another they 
     <lb/>
     will do it, and it is up to Newfoundland to see that 
     <lb/>
     our debts, no matter how contracted, which are 
     <lb/>
     having a disastrous effect, ought to have been put 
     <lb/>
     in the background. We were faced with an un<lb break="no"/>compromising, "This is a Newfoundland obliga<lb break="no"/>tion, incurred by previous Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     governments, and His Majesty's Government 
     <lb/>
     will naturally expect etc." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we turn to the interest-free loans. All we 
     <lb/>
     wanted to say was that by using these dollars over 
     <lb/>
     there Newfoundland would be helped and they 
     <lb/>
     would do the right thing by Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     "United Kingdom cannot undertake to pay inter<lb break="no"/>est on these loans". That's a plain "no" 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I skip over the development loans — they are 
     <lb/>
     not really important at the moment — and come 
     <lb/>
     to the various base deals, and here I have no 
     <lb/>
     words to express my indignation at the way in 
     <lb/>
     which a government acting as trustees for the 
     <lb/>
     people violated our sovereign rights. Coldly they 
     <lb/>
     come back to us with this statement, "There is no 
     <lb/>
     reason to think that the United States government 
     <lb/>
     will be prepared to agree to any substantial varia 
     <lb/>
     tion." In other words, "Run along home. We did 
     <lb/>
     this and we are not going to find out if there is 
     <lb/>
     any reason." It was not like that in 1857.<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> The 
     <lb/>
     French fishermen were given a guarantee of an 
     <lb/>
     unlimited amount of bait. What happened then? 
     <lb/>
     The Newfoundland government protested 
     <lb/>
     strongly, and it resulted in a statement of an 
     <lb/>
     important principle. It reads like this:

     pay half the cost of services for foreign com<lb break="no"/>panies doing business in Newfoundland. It is 
     <lb/>
     wrong in principle. Then we get this statement 
     <lb/>
     which brought up all that I have heard for many, 
     <lb/>
     many years in my lifetime: "Oh but you get the 
     <lb/>
     labour". That's all Newfoundland has ever got. It 
     <lb/>
     is true that we got the labour, but if your deficit 
     <lb/>
     is $250,000, you pay the full deficit, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I don't know that there is anything more I 
     <lb/>
     would like to add except this, that I have come 
     <lb/>
     back from London satisfied that there is only one 
     <lb/>
     basic principle for Newfoundland, and that is that 
     <lb/>
     if you want anything done, and done properly, 
     <lb/>
     you do it yourself — that you fight on behalf of 
     <lb/>
     yourself, your family, your country, and your 
     <lb/>
     nation until you get your rights.... 
     <lb/>
     
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, I don't know if the 
     <lb/>gentleman steering this report through could 
     <lb/>answerthis question, I presume you could answer 
     <lb/>it yourself. With respect to the memorandum 
     <lb/>dealing with the United States bases.... It appears 
     <lb/>that your delegation must have discussed with the 
     <lb/>officials of the home office the question as to any 
     <lb/>changes that might be made in that base deal 
     <lb/>under a return to responsible government. I 
     <lb/>presume that's the meaning of the question and 
     <lb/>the answer? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It was a general discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The answer given you by Lord Ad<lb break="no"/>dison, wherein it states, "Article 28 of the Agree<lb break="no"/>ment provides that the Government of the 
     <lb/>
     USA and the Government of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom agreed to give sympathetic considera<lb break="no"/>tion to any representations which either may 
     <lb/>
     make after this agreement has been in force a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable time, proposing a review of any of the

     provisions of this agreement to determine 
     <lb/>
     whether modifications in the light of experience 
     <lb/>
     are necesary or desirable. Any such modifica<lb break="no"/>tions shall be by mutual consent". That is copied 
     <lb/>
     from the Bases Act, I presume? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There are certain portions 
     <lb/>
     which are quotations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Is the suggestion that the general 
     <lb/>
     principle of the bases agreement might be 
     <lb/>
     changed completely, or is it merely small items 
     <lb/>
     that would be, after mutual discussion, changed 
     <lb/>
     somewhat? There is no suggestion that if any 
     <lb/>
     government, responsible or otherwise, went to 
     <lb/>
     the United States, that it would have them agree 
     <lb/>
     to relinquish the bases? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would say that depends upon 
     <lb/>
     the correct interpretation of the clause itself . I can 
     <lb/>
     put my interpretation on it and you can put yours, 
     <lb/>
     and Major Cashin can put his. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> My interpretation was that these 
     <lb/>
     were not major considerations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> They would not go to the root of 
     <lb/>
     the whole deal, I don't think. That's as I would 
     <lb/>
     interpret it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> This particular article being 
     <lb/>
     quoted was a mild brush-off, is that it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That's what I would say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I did not quite get the meaning of 
     <lb/>
     what Mr. Crosbie said in the Icelandic deal 
     <lb/>
     regarding soft money. I presume you put up to 
     <lb/>
     them the question of why they were buying 
     <lb/>
     Iceland fish and not ours. They could very well 
     <lb/>
     take our fish. Could you enlarge on it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> As I gathered from the conversation 
     <lb/>
     ... they had finished negotiations for 12,000 tons 
     <lb/>
     of Iceland fish. They were asked what the mean<lb break="no"/>ing of "soft money" was, and the answer did not 
     <lb/>
     materially change the situation. It was merely a 
     <lb/>
     name. They were buying fish from Iceland and 
     <lb/>
     not from us. They put the dollar business right 
     <lb/>
     over to us again, and when we brought up that we 
     <lb/>
     had advanced $2.5 million for three ships they 
     <lb/>
     were building over there, they could not see why 
     <lb/>
     we could not send the cash over and not the fish. 
     <lb/>
     They were indignant that we should question the 
     <lb/>
     matter of us sending the cash and their not buying 
     <lb/>
     the fish. Furthermore they were buying a lot of 
     <lb/>
     fish from Norway and not from here. They gave 
     <lb/>
     them fish for that. There was some kind of a deal 
     <lb/>
     in that respect. It was just another brush-off. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> There was no real explanation? Is 


            <cb/>
    

     there any explanation, other than appears in the 
     <lb/>
     record, with respect to iron ore, as to what they 
     <lb/>
     will or will not guarantee? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is the same old story. As a matter 
     <lb/>
     of fact the Mining Committee brought up that 
     <lb/>
     contract of 750,000 tons for this year. We were 
     <lb/>
     pushing them to get a continuous contract for a 
     <lb/>
     number of years. It came out in our talks that the 
     <lb/>
     actual money for this year's iron ore has not been 
     <lb/>
     approved by the Treasury at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     Whilst they are negotiating, and are prepared to 
     <lb/>
     take the ore, it is still in the hands of the Treasury. 
     <lb/>
     We were told that the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had been pushing that matter — the Com<lb break="no"/>mission has been pushing everything. They 
     <lb/>
     pointed out the freight rates were somewhat high 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the transportation of ore. The 
     <lb/>
     British Ministry of Shipping controls freight 
     <lb/>
     rates. They make or break them. I feel we are 
     <lb/>
     going to have that contract for 750,000 tons of 
     <lb/>
     ore, but for next yearl would not bank on it. Even 
     <lb/>
     though the steel industry is going to be 
     <lb/>
     nationalised, even when we pointed that out, they 
     <lb/>
     would not say whether or not they would buy the 
     <lb/>
     ore. You will notice from the last memorandum, 
     <lb/>
     the matter came up and we were told we were not 
     <lb/>
     the government. In other words we were given a 
     <lb/>
     smack on the hand, and told to go home and be 
     <lb/>
     good boys. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It has been intimated that planes 
     <lb/>
     flying the Atlantic and scheduled to land at Shan<lb break="no"/>non, still had to pay landing fees whether they 
     <lb/>
     landed or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It did not come up in our talks. I 
     <lb/>
     have heard that even though they fly over Ireland, 
     <lb/>
     they have to pay whether they land or not. I have 
     <lb/>
     no official information to confirm that. I believe 
     <lb/>
     they should pay for flying over Ireland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Having read the report, I think that 
     <lb/>
     we here are indebted to the delegates that went 
     <lb/>
     across.... I was told the delegation really did put 
     <lb/>
     up a very worthwhile case for the country in their 
     <lb/>
     discussions, and that at times it was not altogether 
     <lb/>
     as peaceful as even it is in this House sometimes. 
     <lb/>
     I understand people were called to order at times, 
     <lb/>
     and that in the staid atmosphere of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords people were shocked at the expressions 
     <lb/>
     used. I wish to congratulate them on the work 
     <lb/>
     they have done. I feel confident that the work they 
     <lb/>
     have done and the answers obtained will be of the 
     <lb/>
     greatest importance to us of the Convention. We 
   

            <pb n="546"

     did not want any help from England, but we did 
     <lb/>
     want to find out the position. Now we know 
     <lb/>
     where we stand and can act accordingly. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know if there is going to be any more debate on 
     <lb/>
     the report, but for me, the position is extremely 
     <lb/>
     clear. I am not trying to stifle debate but in view 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that we have to try and finish the other 
     <lb/>
     reports, I suggest we cut the debate as short as 
     <lb/>
     possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Before I proceed with my few 
     <lb/>
     remarks I would like to refer to what Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood said, that the British government is 
     <lb/>
     not prepared to discuss base deals with us. The 
     <lb/>
     British government is prepared to leave that mat<lb break="no"/>ter in the hands of Newfoundlanders — provided, 
     <lb/>
     however, they get their own government; then 
     <lb/>
     they will discuss the matter with us. As far as this 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting business is concerned, it is a nig<lb break="no"/>ger in the woodpile. Who is self-supporting? Is 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain self-supporting? Is Canada self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting? Not at all! Why put the burden on top 
     <lb/>
     of us, gentlemen?.... We are the only people who 
     <lb/>
     pay cash for democracy; the rest can have it 
     <lb/>
     charged. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As a member of the delegation I feel that I am 
     <lb/>
     called upon to add my cements to those which 
     <lb/>
     you have already heard. I fully endorse the 
     <lb/>
     opinions expressed by Major Cashin and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Crosbie. I, like them, have come back from 
     <lb/>
     our visit keenly disappointed with the results 
     <lb/>
     obtained, and the general tenor of our reception. 
     <lb/>
     I feel as if I had been on some kind of a wild goose 
     <lb/>
     chase. On the plane which brought us back to this 
     <lb/>
     country, we might have marked the words: 
     <lb/>
     "Returned Empty." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During my years as a representative of labour 
     <lb/>
     unions, I have had the experience of being a 
     <lb/>
     member of many delegations and sitting in at 
     <lb/>
     meetings with many official bodies, both 
     <lb/>
     governmental and otherwise. But in all such 
     <lb/>
     cases I came away from such meetings knowing 
     <lb/>
     that matters had been discussed openly and frank<lb break="no"/>ly, and in a common sense manner. But that was 
     <lb/>
     not my experience on this delegation, for I found 
     <lb/>
     little of common sense and less of frankness. I 
     <lb/>
     had the new experience of seeing certain persons 
     <lb/>
     present whispering into the Chairman's ear. I saw 
     <lb/>
     people pulling other people's coat-tails, and fur<lb break="no"/>ther whispering take place. It made me wonder 
     <lb/>
     sometimes where I was. Was this a meeting with 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the British government? Or 
   

            <cb/>
          

     was it some underground conspiracy, planning 
     <lb/>
     some illegal movement? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Like Major Cashin, I was witness to the man<lb break="no"/>ner in which the Chairman, Lord Addison, acted. 
     <lb/>
     I saw the great exhibition which he gave us as 
     <lb/>
     how not to answer a question, and how to avoid 
     <lb/>
     an issue. The noble lord had three stock answers, 
     <lb/>
     and when one failed he used the others. He said 
     <lb/>
     either that our question was one which we could 
     <lb/>
     not discuss as it was only in the power of the 
     <lb/>
     government to do so; or he said that the matter 
     <lb/>
     was already under consideration by the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion; and when all else failed, and he was ap<lb break="no"/>parently stuck for an answer, he said he would 
     <lb/>
     make a note of what we said. I am prepared to 
     <lb/>
     believe that if the Chairman had been asked if we 
     <lb/>
     could have Bell Island towed to the mainland, he 
     <lb/>
     would reply that the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     had it under consideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some people in this country were somewhat 
     <lb/>
     astonished by the reports of the meetings of the 
     <lb/>
     delegation which appeared in the English papers, 
     <lb/>
     condemning the treatment we received. But 
     <lb/>
     having been on the inside I can say that the 
     <lb/>
     reports were what the old politicians used to call 
     <lb/>
     "critically correct." We brought home nothing 
     <lb/>
     from this trip, and the simple reason is that we 
     <lb/>
     were given nothing we could bring home. But it 
     <lb/>
     is often said that good sometimes comes out of 
     <lb/>
     evil. And from this angle I can say that we did 
     <lb/>
     bring something home, and that was the lesson 
     <lb/>
     that we can expect nothing from any outside 
     <lb/>
     sources that will be of any assistance to us in our 
     <lb/>
     future. It taught me that if Newfoundland is to get 
     <lb/>
     anywhere, if she is to make any progress, she 
     <lb/>
     must go ahead under her own steam and with her 
     <lb/>
     own native sons at the wheel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As a representative of the common man, as 
     <lb/>
     one whose adult life has been spent in the ranks 
     <lb/>
     of the workers, I have always had the interests of 
     <lb/>
     my fellow workers in mind. My politics are the 
     <lb/>
     politics of the common man. I know that if labour 
     <lb/>
     goes down to defeat, I must go with it. I know that 
     <lb/>
     if labour prospers, I prosper. And so it is that 
     <lb/>
     when I regard the position of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     today, I look at it from the attitude of the working 
     <lb/>
     man. In the present instance I tell the worker of 
     <lb/>
     this country that it is no use looking to Canada or 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom or anywhere else for his 
     <lb/>
     future. He must, and I must, and we all must, look 
     <lb/>
     to ourselves. There is an old saying that "every 
 

            <pb n="547"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-20_Page_0547.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">547</fw>
          

     man's fortune lies in himself", and this applies 
     <lb/>
     also to countries. It applies to Newfoundland. She 
     <lb/>
     must look to herself for her fortune and her 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. Today she is in a happy position. She 
     <lb/>
     is one of the most solvent countries in the world. 
     <lb/>
     She has money, she has brains, she has the assets, 
     <lb/>
     and she has the men who can govern her and 
     <lb/>
     protect her sovereign rights. What then is holding 
     <lb/>
     us back? Why do we hesitate? What are we afraid 
     <lb/>
     of? What is all this talk about tying ourselves onto 
     <lb/>
     someone else's apron strings? We are not 
     <lb/>
     children, we are men! We are the sons of liberty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     loving people. The job awaits us, and we are able 
     <lb/>
     to do the job. Then let us get on with it! For 
     <lb/>
     myself, I have faith in my country and her people. 
     <lb/>
     Every time the challenge came to our fathers, 
     <lb/>
     they stood up to that challenge. They fought and 
     <lb/>
     they won. As I see it, such a call has come to us 
     <lb/>
     today. And in the historic words of Nelson, 
     <lb/>
     "Newfoundland expects every man to do his 
     <lb/>
     duty." With us, our first duty is to take over the 
     <lb/>
     control of our country — to get back what we lost. 
     <lb/>
     When this is done, then time enough to talk about 
     <lb/>
     making deals with other countries. After all, what 
     <lb/>
     do we want from other countries? All we want is 
     <lb/>
     a chance to do business with them. We only want 
     <lb/>
     their trade, not their traditions, not their politics, 
     <lb/>
     not their ideas. All these things we have ourselves 
     <lb/>
     in full measure, and we don't want to change 
     <lb/>
     them for a foreigner's. As I see it, it is a waste of 
     <lb/>
     time, a mistake, for us to think of sending delega<lb break="no"/>tions to Canada or anywhere else. If there are a 
     <lb/>
     certain number of people who are curious to 
     <lb/>
     know what terms would be offered us by these 
     <lb/>
     countries, then they could have their desires satis<lb break="no"/>fied by simply having the government of this 
     <lb/>
     country send a letter asking for such terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I agree with Major Cashin that we should not 
     <lb/>
     waste time with any lengthy discussion of the 
     <lb/>
     report before the Chair. We all know now what it 
     <lb/>
     means without going further into the matter. We 
     <lb/>
     should now get on with the job. That job is to give 
     <lb/>
     the people of the country a chance to express 
     <lb/>
     themselves by the ballot. If we do not soon do 
     <lb/>
     this, then there will be no country to hand back 
     <lb/>
     to the people, and the treasury itself will be 
     <lb/>
     emptied. In closing, then, I ask that every man, 
     <lb/>
     woman and child in the country unite their voices, 
     <lb/>
     their strength, and energies, in the great common 
     <lb/>
     task of giving Newfoundland back to New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, and bring victory to this old and 
 

            <cb/>
          

     loved land in 1947.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What with the shades of Sir Edward 
     <lb/>
     Morris and Sir William Coaker, I feel rather 
     <lb/>
     dubious about getting to my feet, especially after 
     <lb/>
     hearing the eloquent addresses of the various 
     <lb/>
     speakers.... First, I am not disappointed in the 
     <lb/>
     replies which we received from the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office. I did not expect to bring home something 
     <lb/>
     in a basket. As you knew from the first. an attempt 
     <lb/>
     has been made to work out our destiny by powers 
     <lb/>
     other than the popular vote of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country. I felt it before I went to London, and I 
     <lb/>
     am confirmed that that attempt has been, and will 
     <lb/>
     continue to be made. We must take note of these 
     <lb/>
     things, and endeavour to exercise the prerogative 
     <lb/>
     of every man and woman in the British Empire. 
     <lb/>
     The mother of democracy is doing something no 
     <lb/>
     mother in a democratic world should ever try and 
     <lb/>
     map out for her child.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We were asked to consult with the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office on matters relative to public debt, interest- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     free loans, development loans, the position aris<lb break="no"/>ing out of the various base deals, financing and 
     <lb/>
     control of airports, and trade and tariffs — the one 
     <lb/>
     concerning trade and tariffs is the most important 
     <lb/>
     and the one to which we got the most disappoint<lb break="no"/>ing reply from Lord Addison — and any other 
     <lb/>
     matter which the delegation may raise and which 
     <lb/>
     the British government may feel disposed to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Dominions Office was well aware of 
     <lb/>
     these subjects which we wanted to discuss, and 
     <lb/>
     they had expressed their willingness to receive 
     <lb/>
     your delegation and to answer and to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     matters. What happened? We were handed these 
     <lb/>
     replies which, in my opinion, could easily have 
     <lb/>
     been sent at a cost of 20 cents. Why therefore was 
     <lb/>
     it necessary to have 12 people travel all the way 
     <lb/>
     from St. John's to London to be handed this 
     <lb/>
     document? Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, you 
     <lb/>
     may answer this question how you wish. This is 
     <lb/>
     my answer, and I have given it much thought. But 
     <lb/>
     before I give you that answer, let us look at what 
     <lb/>
     they will do about the debt. First, the two 3.5% 
     <lb/>
     sterling loans amounting together to about 
     <lb/>
     £870,000 which mature in 1950 and 1952; that 
     <lb/>
     has been taken care of — "In making available to 
     <lb/>
     the UK Government interest-free loans...." How 
     <lb/>
     delightfully smart of them; how sweetly naive to 
     <lb/>
     say this action was taken at the instance of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government. They tell us that the 


            <pb n="548"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-20_Page_0548.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">548</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw>
         

     £400,000 temporary loan we may consider can<lb break="no"/>celled. Remember that that £400,000 was the 
     <lb/>
     price of keeping your brothers in Flanders Fields 
     <lb/>
     in 1916, 1917 and 1918. It was never intended at 
     <lb/>
     the time it was raised that our people would be 
     <lb/>
     called upon to pay it. Is there any concession 
     <lb/>
     there? They say that the question of convening 
     <lb/>
     the debt to a lower rate of interest had been raised 
     <lb/>
     by the Commission of Government with the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom government, and that a conver<lb break="no"/>sion operation can be carried out in January 1948, 
     <lb/>
     provided the Commission gives them three 
     <lb/>
     months' notice — and we hope the Commission 
     <lb/>
     does not forget to give them notice. You will 
     <lb/>
     agree that all these things were ours of right. The 
     <lb/>
     sinking fund should naturally have been applied 
     <lb/>
     to the debt long ago, ever since 1937 and 1938. 
     <lb/>
     The £400,000 — it was never intended we should 
     <lb/>
     pay it, otherwise we should not have gotten off 
     <lb/>
     so easily. This supposedly generous action of 
     <lb/>
     converting from 3% to 2.5%, that is in line with 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom cheap money policy, and 
     <lb/>
     also the Canadian cheap money policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Why then, I repeat, why was it necessary to 
     <lb/>
     send a delegation to London? The answer, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, is simply this: the Dominions Office 
     <lb/>
     wanted the Convention to send a delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Canada! Why? Because Canada wanted the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office to send a delegation there! 
     <lb/>
     They know very well that only by receiving the 
     <lb/>
     English delegation was it possible to achieve 
     <lb/>
     their principal aim. You will all remember the 
     <lb/>
     resolution of the member from Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>
     — that the delegation to Canada should not be 
     <lb/>
     sent until after the return of the English delega<lb break="no"/>tion. That is the only reason why the answers of 
     <lb/>
     Lord Addison were not sent by airmail. Receive 
     <lb/>
     a delegation to England? Of course! What shall 
     <lb/>
     we do when we get them here? Oh, we shall brush 
     <lb/>
     them off somehow. We shall make a gesture 
     <lb/>
     about the debt. Oh yes, we must be careful to tell 
     <lb/>
     them that if they vote for responsible government 
     <lb/>
     we shall no longer guarantee their financial 
     <lb/>
     stability. That is exactly what they did. You have 
     <lb/>
     heard Lord Addison's statement given the press 
     <lb/>
     — "Vote for responsible government and your 
     <lb/>
     financial stability will no longer be guaranteed." 
     <lb/>
     Just what did they mean by financial stability? 
     <lb/>
     That is what they assured us in 1933 when they 
     <lb/>
     took away our constitution — "We will look after 
     <lb/>
     you", "We will look after your financial 
 

            <cb/>
          

     stability." What did it amount to from 1933 to 
     <lb/>
     1940? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Any of you who have lived on our coast where 
     <lb/>
     our fishermen go out from day to day in the shore 
     <lb/>
     fishery, where our bankers go out on the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Banks and risk their lives and toil from long 
     <lb/>
     before daylight to dark, if any of you lived on 
     <lb/>
     these portions of the coast between 1933 and 
     <lb/>
     1940, you must ask yourselves, "What does Lord 
     <lb/>
     Addison mean by financial stability?" If any of 
     <lb/>
     you acted as relieving officers during that period, 
     <lb/>
     as I did, and saw our people go from a robust, 
     <lb/>
     hardy people, down to a very gaunt, starved 
     <lb/>
     population, is that financial stability? Is that the 
     <lb/>
     financial stability which is to be taken away from 
     <lb/>
     us if we vote for responsible government? I ask 
     <lb/>
     you to consider it well. Ask yourselves what the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office means by financial stability. 
     <lb/>
     Does it mean a starved beri-beri race? Does it 
     <lb/>
     mean a TB race? Gentlemen, if that's the finan<lb break="no"/>cial stability which Lord Addison promises you, 
     <lb/>
     I ask you to reject it without any hesitation 
     <lb/>
     whatever. I won't go into the question as to 
     <lb/>
     whether, if they guarantee it, they can carry it out. 
     <lb/>
     I have no patience with those people who are 
     <lb/>
     putting up this austerity business about Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain. 1 ask you to remember that the British 
     <lb/>
     Empire has granted credits to the extent of 
     <lb/>
     £750,000 to European countries. £300 million 
     <lb/>
     worth of credits have been given out to Greece, 
     <lb/>
     Turkey, Holland, Belguim, Italy and God knows 
     <lb/>
     how many other countries, and most of those, it 
     <lb/>
     has been stated, need never be paid back. We, 
     <lb/>
     300,000 Britishers here, who gave our young 
     <lb/>
     men in two wars and suffered starvation over a 
     <lb/>
     period of years, shall not have financial stability 
     <lb/>
     if we endeavour to exercise that right which our 
     <lb/>
     forefathers won. You will not get financial 
     <lb/>
     stability. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us take another look at Lord Addison's 
     <lb/>
     answers to our questions, and I do not forget that 
     <lb/>
     the Chairman of the Commission government 
     <lb/>
     and the Commissioner for Justice had a hand in 
     <lb/>
     forming these answers. for did not the Secretary 
     <lb/>
     of State state that these two gentlemen had been 
     <lb/>
     invited to London by him to assist him? It is my 
     <lb/>
     opinion that these answers were formulated 
     <lb/>
     before our visit began, and that these gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     as Professor Wheare said, "simply concurred". 
     <lb/>
     Now as to interest-free loans and development 
     <lb/>
     loans and base deals, these things have been very 


            <pb n="549"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-20_Page_0549.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">549</fw>
          

     well explained to you by other members who 
     <lb/>
     have spoken. With regard to the base deals we did 
     <lb/>
     have a very extended conversation and it was 
     <lb/>
     admitted by the Chairman, "Yes, we made the 
     <lb/>
     base deals, we had to save our lives and keep our 
     <lb/>
     ships from sinking. We never would have done it 
     <lb/>
     but for that." In other words Lord Addison admits 
     <lb/>
     that these base deals would not have been made 
     <lb/>
     had it not been that they wanted to save their 
     <lb/>
     lives. We have no kick about the base deals as far 
     <lb/>
     as granting them to the United States at that time 
     <lb/>
     is concerned, but we do have a kick when Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain gives away our land for 99 years without 
     <lb/>
     any saving clause whatever. Go back to the 
     <lb/>
     Treaty of Versailles when most of our northern 
     <lb/>
     coast was given to France.<ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> Go back to the time 
     <lb/>
     when concessions regarding our lobster fishery 
     <lb/>
     were given to USA,<ref target="#fn_05">[2]</ref> and come down to this war 
     <lb/>
     and you get another piece given away. Why, for 
     <lb/>
     70 years responsible government fought for that 
     <lb/>
     which Great Britain gave away freely and 
     <lb/>
     without concession. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Regarding Gander, that was explained and 
     <lb/>
     you are let in for a deficit of at least $250,000, 
     <lb/>
     and that may be multiplied. Regarding debt and 
     <lb/>
     tariffs, that end of it was taken care of as far as 
     <lb/>
     we could. We pointed out that if they did not have 
     <lb/>
     the dollars over there, apart from the fact that we 
     <lb/>
     have $9 million there, we pointed out that rather 
     <lb/>
    than let our fish industry go to the wall, the 
     <lb/>Commission government might be able to find it 
     <lb/>convenient to advance a credit to Great Britain to 
     <lb/>take care of the sale of fresh fish from this 
     <lb/>country. Well, that was not entirely turned down, 
     <lb/>we were simply told it was none of our business, 
     <lb/>which we know We replied to that by a 
     <lb/>memorandum on 7 May which has been read. I 
     <lb/>ask you to study it carefully, and then take a look 
     <lb/>at Lord Addison's reply. He replied, "I have 
     <lb/>studied your memorandum". After prolonged 
     <lb/>and careful study he arrives at his conclusions. 
     <lb/>Don't you think they are momentous con<lb break="no"/>clusions? Listen: "In my view, it goes beyond the 
     <lb/>terms of reference of your delegation, and indeed 
     <lb/>of the National Convention itself." Just imagine 


            <cb/>
          

     that! Forty-five men elected by a free people in 
     <lb/>
     this country have not the right to discuss trade and 
     <lb/>
     tariffs with the government. Why? Because it 
     <lb/>
     goes beyond the terms of reference of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention Act. If that's not an answer that would 
     <lb/>
     make anyone weep, I don't know what is. Let me 
     <lb/>
     quote you section 3 of the Convention Act: "To 
     <lb/>
     examine the position of the country". And yet we 
     <lb/>
     could not possibly talk about fish and iron ore. 
     <lb/>
     Now let me go on to his momentous answer to 
     <lb/>
     our memorandum: "Most of the items to which 
     <lb/>
     you refer have already been raised with the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom Government...." That is excel<lb break="no"/>lent news. I am proud of our Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment to think that they raised all these points, 
     <lb/>
     probably before this Convention was ever 
     <lb/>
     thought of, according to that we have been berat<lb break="no"/>ing the Commission of Government just a little 
     <lb/>
     too much. All matters you gentlemen have raised 
     <lb/>
     here, they have been taking over to Lord Addison 
     <lb/>
     and the Dorninions Office, and they have been 
     <lb/>
     pressing them very hard for concessions for this 
     <lb/>
     country. I ask you gentlemen to reconsider your 
     <lb/>
     views on Commission of Government. I am sure 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood will agree with me on that. He 
     <lb/>
     says: "I have throughout been as helpful as I can 
     <lb/>
     be. I do not however regard it as the function of 
     <lb/>
     this delegation to debate with me questions of the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the Newfoundland government in cur<lb break="no"/>rent administrative and other issues, or seek to 
     <lb/>
     negotiate trade arrangements between the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government and the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland." Now I want you to study and 
     <lb/>
     read that again, and if you can show me any 
     <lb/>
     criticisms of the Commission of Government or 
     <lb/>
     the government of Great Britain, then there is 
     <lb/>
     something wrong with my eyesight. We did say 
     <lb/>
     we could not understand the attitude of the Com<lb break="no"/>mission on the matter of interest-free loans, but 
     <lb/>
     if that's a criticism, I don't know what criticism 
     <lb/>
     means. We could not understand their attitude. Is 
     <lb/>
     that criticism? No. We wanted an explanation of 
     <lb/>
     why a thing that would save the people $400,000 
     <lb/>
     could not be put into effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I feel that your delegation did all it was 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

     humanly possible to do over there. I got the 
     <lb/>
     impression that when we were handed the first 
     <lb/>
     memorandum that they considered that the whole 
     <lb/>
     matter was closed. The answers were put before 
     <lb/>
     us when we sat down at the first meeting and we 
     <lb/>
     were supposed to discuss them intelligently.... 
     <lb/>
     But it seemed as if they said, "There's your 
     <lb/>
     answer. We will take you here and there, and we 
     <lb/>
     will meet again before you go back, and say 
     <lb/>
     goodbye", but we were not having that and im<lb break="no"/>mediately studied the memorandum and shot 
     <lb/>
     back another memorandum in answer to theirs. 
     <lb/>
     Their answer was a flat, "No, we have said what 
     <lb/>
     we have said, and can do nothing more in the 
     <lb/>
     matter." Your action in sending a delegation to 
     <lb/>
     London and raising all these points will redound 
     <lb/>
     to the good of this country, which you love and 
     <lb/>
     which you serve. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> Mr. Chairman, now that all the 
     <lb/>
     other members of the London delegation have 
     <lb/>
     said what they had to say, that leaves only the 
     <lb/>
     Walrus to have further things to say about this 
     <lb/>
     delegation of tribunes of the people which recent<lb break="no"/>ly went up to London to beard the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Secretary in his den. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I wish to dissociate myself completely from 
     <lb/>
     all the petty furore about the delegation's not 
     <lb/>
     being treated with due deference in London. As 
     <lb/>
     far as I am concerned we were. We were received 
     <lb/>
     in right good spirit and were extended many 
     <lb/>
     courtesies. Anyone with an opinion to the con<lb break="no"/>trary must have been expecting a salute of guns 
     <lb/>
     and red plush carpets. It is utterly ridiculous that 
     <lb/>
     I should have to go into this matter. The treatment 
     <lb/>
     we received was quite considerate, and I am 
     <lb/>
     appreciative of the courtesies extended. How<lb break="no"/>ever, there seems to have been such a furore here 
     <lb/>
     at home that I feel I should have somewhat more 
     <lb/>
     to say. I remember what happened in London this 
     <lb/>
     way. On arrival at Heathrow we were met by 
     <lb/>
     Rear Admiral Sir Arthur Bromley, who wel<lb break="no"/>comed us on behalf of the Secretary of State, and 
     <lb/>
     then conducted through Immigration and Cus<lb break="no"/>toms with diplomatic immunity. In that there was 
     <lb/>
     no discounesy. Next we were driven in special 
     <lb/>
     cars to our hotel. There, some delay was oc<lb break="no"/>casioned on the doorstep because, through some 
     <lb/>
     misunderstanding, the hotel management had us 
     <lb/>
     booked for two days subsequently. However, the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty was ironed out and those of us who 
     <lb/>
     wished to moved into the hotel forthwith. In any 
  

            <cb/>
           

     case, the delay at the hotel did not involve, as far 
     <lb/>
     as I was concerned, any discourtesy, merely a 
     <lb/>
     misunderstanding.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am quite satisfied, too, that every effort was 
     <lb/>
     made to secure for the delegation the best pos<lb break="no"/>sible accomodations. We arrived in London at a 
     <lb/>
     time of a great influx of visitors. Besides oursel<lb break="no"/>ves, there were some 15 other delegations in 
     <lb/>
     London for consultations with the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government. There were buyers there 
     <lb/>
     to attend the British Industrial Fair. And there 
     <lb/>
     were fans from all over the United Kingdom to 
     <lb/>
     attend the soccer and rugby cup tie finals. Lodg<lb break="no"/>ings were not at a premium, they were just simply 
     <lb/>
     unobtainable. We were advised by responsible 
     <lb/>
     officials that every effort had been made to secure 
     <lb/>
     the best accomodations available. I believe them. 
     <lb/>
     I was quite comfortable, and the food was ade<lb break="no"/>quate. Incidentally, a New Zealand delegation 
     <lb/>
     was housed in the same hotel shortly before our 
     <lb/>
     arrival, and as far as I know found no reason to 
     <lb/>
     work themselves up into an international incident 
     <lb/>
     about their accomodations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The officials of the Dominions Office went 
     <lb/>
     out of their way to make our visit a pleasant one. 
     <lb/>
     Cars were put at our disposal. A tour of London 
     <lb/>
     was arranged. Tickets were procured for those of 
     <lb/>
     us who wished to attend the mgby finals and a 
     <lb/>
     showing of A.P. Herbert's new play. Arrange<lb break="no"/>ments were made for us to sit in the Dominions' 
     <lb/>
     Gallery during a session of the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. We were entertained at luncheon at the 
     <lb/>
     Savoy Hotel. The prime minister took time out to 
     <lb/>
     meet the delegation informally in the cabinet 
     <lb/>
     chamber at 10 Downing Street. In all of these 
     <lb/>
     goings-on I saw no evidence of discounesy no 
     <lb/>
     reason to be insulted. And that I hope will dispose 
     <lb/>
     of the discounesy myth forever. There is this 
     <lb/>
     much more that needs to be said of the furore that 
     <lb/>
     was raised here at home about our reception. I 
     <lb/>
     have often heard of a mountain being made of a 
     <lb/>
     molehill. This was the first time I have seen an 
     <lb/>
     international incident made of a molehill. 
     <lb/>
     Shakespeare was a piker. From us he could have 
     <lb/>
     learned things he never knew about how to make 
     <lb/>
     much ado about nothing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Turning now to the results that came of the 
     <lb/>
     London mission. I think I should review the 
     <lb/>
     powers that were conferred on the London 
     <lb/>
     delegation by motion of this Convention for it 
     <lb/>
     was on interpretation of function that dissension 


            <pb n="551"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-20_Page_0551.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">551</fw>
        

     arose in London within the delegation. The mo<lb break="no"/>tion that provided for the London delegation em<lb break="no"/>powered it to ask questions only to seek 
     <lb/>
     information. That was a right and proper projec<lb break="no"/>tion of the Convention's own powers, which are 
     <lb/>
     purely fact-finding. The delegation had no man<lb break="no"/>date to advise as to policy. It had no power to 
     <lb/>
     bargain or negotiate agreements. It had no jus<lb break="no"/>tification to advise as to the disposition of the 
     <lb/>
     national assets of Newfoundland. Even if it had 
     <lb/>
     so wished, the Convention could not have <choice><sic>en<lb break="no"/>doweded</sic><corr>endowed</corr></choice> the delegation with such powers, for it 
     <lb/>
     has no such powers itself. When a position was 
     <lb/>
     taken to the contrary, the Chairman and I had no 
     <lb/>
     choice but to dissent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The dissension within the delegation arose in 
     <lb/>
     this way. At the final meeting but one with the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom representatives, there was 
     <lb/>
     handed to us a paper setting forth the considered 
     <lb/>
     replies of the United Kingdom government to the 
     <lb/>
     questions we had put. Subsequently there began 
     <lb/>
     the preparation of a memorandum that would set 
     <lb/>
     forth the case as advanced by the delegation. The 
     <lb/>
     delegation considered the first draft of the 
     <lb/>
     proposed memorandum at a meeting held on the 
     <lb/>
     morning of Monday, May 5. We did not make 
     <lb/>
     much progress, as disagreement occurred almost 
     <lb/>
     immediately on the specific point of recommend<lb break="no"/>ing the application of the balance of interest-free 
     <lb/>
     loans to the reduction of the public debt. The 
     <lb/>
     specific sentences with which issue was taken 
     <lb/>
     were: "In addition to the above the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Delegation are of opinion that the 
     <lb/>
     balance standing to the credit of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     in the way of interest-free loans to Great Britain, 
     <lb/>
     and which is now lying idle, should be devoted 
     <lb/>
     to the further reduction of Newfoundland's ster<lb break="no"/>ling debt." Also: "We cannot understand the at<lb break="no"/>titude of Commission of Government when they 
     <lb/>
     advise you that, in their opinion, it would not be 
     <lb/>
     prudent to adopt this last-named procedure in 
     <lb/>
     reference to interest-free loans, which procedure 
     <lb/>
     as we have just pointed out will mean a saving to 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland Treasury of some $400,000 
     <lb/>
     annually." And, "... there lies to the credit of the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Treasury in the Bank of Montreal 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, well over $20 million which in 
     <lb/>
     our opinion, is ample for any immediate or 
     <lb/>
     foreseeable construction or development 
     <lb/>
     programme." And again, "We strongly urge such 
     <lb/>
     a policy and we seek some assurance from the 
  

            <cb/>
         

     United Kingdom Government before our depar<lb break="no"/>ture to report back to the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     and through it to the people of Newfoundland." 
     <lb/>
     Finally, "Furthermore we consider this proposal 
     <lb/>
     a sound business proposition." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> and I disagreed. We dissented on 
     <lb/>
     the grounds that to advise policy was not the 
     <lb/>
     concern of the delegation, that we had no man<lb break="no"/>date to urge the disposition of the national assets 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, especially since no reduction 
     <lb/>
     in the principal of the public debt could be ef<lb break="no"/>fected until January, l948. The disposition of the 
     <lb/>
     balance of the interest-free loans was a matter 
     <lb/>
     properly to be left for the decision of such New<lb break="no"/>foundland government as might by that time 
     <lb/>
     materialise. Further, we had no guarantee that a 
     <lb/>
     mere $20 million would be ample for immediate 
     <lb/>
     or foreseeable development programmes. After 
     <lb/>
     all what is $20 million when it comes to financing 
     <lb/>
     an industrial revolution which is just exactly 
     <lb/>
     what we need in our fishing industry? A mere 
     <lb/>
     drop in the bucket! Why, already we have $5 
     <lb/>
     million invested in fresh fish plants in this 
     <lb/>
     country, and the surface has hardly been 
     <lb/>
     scratched. There were far too many im<lb break="no"/>ponderables and unpredictables involved to 
     <lb/>
     agree that $20 million was ample, and in the event 
     <lb/>
     that it should prove to be not nearly enough, it 
     <lb/>
     would then appear as decidedly unsound business 
     <lb/>
     to have eliminated a $9 million loan at 2.5% only 
     <lb/>
     to have to borrow a like, or perhaps a greater sum 
     <lb/>
     at a higher rate of interest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now suppose we turn for a moment to the 
     <lb/>
     results that came of the London talks. Suppose 
     <lb/>
     we try to look at them objectively without 
     <lb/>
     benefit of emotionalism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Public Debt</hi>. The truth of the matter is 
     <lb/>
     that we have no case in absolute justice for the 
     <lb/>
     cancellation of that debt. it was an honourable 
     <lb/>
     debt, honourably incurred by honourable men — 
     <lb/>
     and in honour and injustice should be met. I 
     <lb/>
     imagine that those men of honour who made 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland — those men of the past who 
     <lb/>
     were giants in their day and generation — would 
     <lb/>
     disown this day and generation if it sought to 
     <lb/>
     avoid such an obligation. We have a conditional 
     <lb/>
     case for the cancellation of the public debt. That 
     <lb/>
     case is set out in the memorandum submitted to 
     <lb/>
     the British government by the delegation. The 
     <lb/>
     condition upon which the case rests is Britain's 
     <lb/>
     being in a position to cancel, and being willing 


            <pb n="552"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-20_Page_0552.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">552</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw>
 

     to. As a matter of fact Britain is in no position to 
     <lb/>
     cancel anything for anybody. She simply has 
     <lb/>
     nothing left. Under these circumstances the con<lb break="no"/>version of debt offer must be interpreted as a 
     <lb/>
     generous gesture. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Interest-Free Loans</hi>. The disposition of the 
     <lb/>
     balance of interest-free loans is to remain at the 
     <lb/>
     discretion of the Newfoundland government — 
     <lb/>
     a right and proper thing 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Development Loans</hi>. The answer given is 
     <lb/>
     most reasonable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. <hi rendition="simple:italic">The position arising out of the various base 
     <lb/>
     deals</hi>. It is my unqualified opinion that New<lb break="no"/>foundland should have received, and still should 
     <lb/>
     receive, a suitable <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> for the territories 
     <lb/>
     that were alienated. We have been told that if we 
     <lb/>
     want something done about all that, that we 
     <lb/>
     should get ourselves a government and do it 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. Sound advice, mind you, and maybe 
     <lb/>
     we should be doing something about it instead of 
     <lb/>
     sitting here Fiddling while we burn. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     5. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Financing of Gander Airport</hi>. Admittedly 
     <lb/>
     the arrangement for the financing of Gander is far 
     <lb/>
     from satisfactory. Again, it is a matter of getting 
     <lb/>
     ourselves a government and of doing something 
     <lb/>
     about it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     6. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Trade and Tariffs</hi>. It was unfortunate that 
     <lb/>
     Britain could not give us an understanding to do 
     <lb/>
     more with regard to our fish and iron ore. I say 
     <lb/>
     "understanding" not "undertaking", for the 
     <lb/>
     delegation was not such a body as an undertaking 
     <lb/>
     could be given to. We were not empowered to 
     <lb/>
     negotiate any trade agreements. The hard fact is 
     <lb/>
     that just now, out of utter necessity, Britain must 
     <lb/>
     consider herself and what will best suit her pur<lb break="no"/>pose first — and all other things second. And no 
     <lb/>
     arguments to the contrary are likely to move her 
     <lb/>
     in that at this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     7. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Forms of Government</hi>. Anyone who was 
     <lb/>
     not expecting exactly the answer received was 
     <lb/>
     not a realist. He was building castles in Spain 
     <lb/>
     with visions of United Kingdom guarantees and 
     <lb/>
     grants-in-aid. The answer does emphasise a point 
     <lb/>
     I have always tried to make — that any people to 
     <lb/>
     be sovereign unto themselves, must first be suf<lb break="no"/>ficient unto themselves. Responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment to be really responsible must be able to 
     <lb/>
     finance its own way, and be its own adequate 
     <lb/>
     guarantee in the credit markets of the world. For 
     <lb/>
     it to be anything else would be not to be really 
     <lb/>
     responsible, since its sovereignty would be open 
 

            <cb/>
           

     to dictation from the source that would foot the 
     <lb/>
     balance of the bill. Even in governments, he who 
     <lb/>
     pays the piper calls the tune. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am going to repeat something I have aleady 
     <lb/>
     said to the press of St. John's. I am convinced that 
     <lb/>
     Lord Addison and the United Kingdom govern<lb break="no"/>ment have dealt with us in good faith. They have 
     <lb/>
     given direct answers to the questions asked. The 
     <lb/>
     answers are clear, concise, unmistakable. We 
     <lb/>
     may not like those answers. We may find some 
     <lb/>
     of them to be hard answers. But they are answers 
     <lb/>
     that call a spade a spade. And they are straight 
     <lb/>
     from the horse's mouth. And we know now 
     <lb/>
     where we stand. Yesterday Major Cashin made 
     <lb/>
     another one of those speeches. He said some 
     <lb/>
     things with which I agreed. Those were the things 
     <lb/>
     that had reference to the actual facts in the case 
     <lb/>
     of the London mission. He said some other things 
     <lb/>
     with which I did not agree. Those had to do with 
     <lb/>
     his constructions, interpretations and opinions. 
     <lb/>
     Indeed, he said so many things with which I 
     <lb/>
     disagree as would take a considerable period of 
     <lb/>
     time for me to go into in detail — something 
     <lb/>
     which I have no intention of doing. I am going to 
     <lb/>
     content myself with a blanket disavowal. As far 
     <lb/>
     as I am concerned all the opinions, interpreta<lb break="no"/>tions, conclusions and so forth voiced by Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin yesterday, were entirely his own. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Finally, I have a word to say to the people of 
     <lb/>
     this island. All my life I have been close to the 
     <lb/>
     common man of this land All my life I have lived 
     <lb/>
     on the wrong side of the tracks. All my life my 
     <lb/>
     associations have been with the labour and co<lb break="no"/>operative movements. I have done what I could 
     <lb/>
     in my time to help the little fellow the better to 
     <lb/>
     make both ends meet. And all over this land today 
     <lb/>
     there are some ordinary people who will at this 
     <lb/>
     time of decision hear my voice and believe it. To 
     <lb/>
     them — to the woodsman filing his bucksaw for 
     <lb/>
     a day in the woods tomorrow, to the man mending 
     <lb/>
     his herring nets or lathing his lobster traps, to the 
     <lb/>
     miner resting after a hard day in the mines — to 
     <lb/>
     all the little people all over this land, struggling 
     <lb/>
     away for their three square meals a day, and a 
     <lb/>
     decent suit of clothes on the back, and a tight roof 
     <lb/>
     over the head — to all you, and not forgetting my 
     <lb/>
     last forgotten fisherman on the bill of Cape 
     <lb/>
     St. George — to all of you, I say that this time 
     <lb/>
     you are going to get a square deal. The British 
     <lb/>
     government is not going to try to sell you up the 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence. It is not going to try to railroad you

     back to responsible government. The British 
     <lb/>
     government will facilitate in every way an ex<lb break="no"/>pression of your opinion as to the form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment you really do desire. And if you should be 
     <lb/>
     sold out or railroaded into anything, the thing will 
     <lb/>
     be done by people here in this island. In the days 
     <lb/>
     that lie ahead you will be bombarded with 
     <lb/>
     propaganda designed to convince you of the 
     <lb/>
     merits of this form of government or that. All that 
     <lb/>
     you hear will not be true. Much of it will be 
     <lb/>
     confusing. But all of you have had a sufficient 
     <lb/>
     experience of the stark realities of life in this 
     <lb/>
     island to enable you to decide in the end what will 
     <lb/>
     be best for you. If then, when comes the referen<lb break="no"/>dum, you will each seek to disregard the 
     <lb/>
     emotionalism that will be poured at you, and 
     <lb/>
     judge according to the facts and the dictates of 
     <lb/>
     your own conscience, I have every confidence 
     <lb/>
     that in the making of this greatest decision that 
     <lb/>
     you, the people of this island, have ever had to 
     <lb/>
     make — I have every confidence that in the 
     <lb/>
     making of that decision you shall not err. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName><ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> Mr. Cashin, why is it we can't have 
     <lb/>
     a verbatim report of the whole proceedings in 
     <lb/>
     London? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I will answer that question, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Reddy. When the discussions began, it was 
     <lb/>
     drawn to our attention by Lord Addison that there 
     <lb/>
     were two courses open. One, to have a free dis<lb break="no"/>cussion at which every member of both delega<lb break="no"/>tions, if I may use that term, could, as it were, let 
     <lb/>
     his hair down, to use a more or less feminine 
     <lb/>
     expression, and talk freely. There would be no 
     <lb/>
     necessity to pick and choose one's words. That 
     <lb/>
     was one course. If that course were adopted, 
     <lb/>
     obviously it would be necessary that the actual 
     <lb/>
     proceedings should be regarded as confidential 
     <lb/>
     and only the formal documents be for public use. 
     <lb/>
     The other was to stick strictly to formal debate, 
     <lb/>
     which naturally would make free discussion 
     <lb/>
     very, very difficult. It was decided that we should 
     <lb/>
     adopt the former course; that we should talk 
     <lb/>
     freely, and that whatever was said, and which was 
     <lb/>
     reported of course in full, should be regarded as 
     <lb/>
     confidential, and the transcript of the reporter's 
     <lb/>
     notes should be for use only by the delegates 
     <lb/>
     themselves. Consequently, the actual speeches or 
     <lb/>
     statements made by the different delegates can<lb break="no"/>not be disclosed to the public. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the 
   

            <cb/>
          

     explanation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Mr. Chairman, is there any 
     <lb/>
     reason why the transcripts of these notes cannot

     be seen by the Convention in a private session? 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The transcript of these notes can

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Mr. Chairman, clause 7 of the 
     <lb/>
     resolution — that's Mr. Hollett's resolution of 
     <lb/>
     March 10 — other matters relative to New<lb break="no"/>foundland affairs, that the delegation may raise 
     <lb/>
     in the United Kingdom if they're willing to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss them. I'd like to ask if any other matters were 
     <lb/>
     raised.... If my memory serves me right, when the 
     <lb/>
     delegation went to Government House in 
     <lb/>
     February, I think it was, that particular section 
     <lb/>
     which brought in the name of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     we were quietly calmed down by being reassured 
     <lb/>
     that when the delegation went to England, they 
     <lb/>
     could take up these matters. Now that was more 
     <lb/>
     or less a promise. Was there any reference made 
     <lb/>
     to the annexation of the United States to New<lb break="no"/>foundland? Not that I would be one to propose it, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, but I do want to know for the benefit of this 
     <lb/>
     house and for the benefit of the country, since 
     <lb/>
     people here this afternoon are talking to the 
     <lb/>
     country. I came here to talk to this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     not to talk to the country, not to make a political 
     <lb/>
     set-up out of it. I want just the facts for myself 
     <lb/>
     and for my fellow candidates. I'd like to have a 
     <lb/>
     little more information on that, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I cannot recollectjust now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Miller, that the question of annexation with the 
     <lb/>
     United States was discussed at all. Do you 
     <lb/>
     remember that, Mr. Cashin? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, not right directly. It was in<lb break="no"/>timated there at one time, I think, by one of the 
     <lb/>
     delegates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, I have some recollection of 
     <lb/>
     that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We were told, as far as my memory 
     <lb/>
     serves me, that on matters of trade or anything 
     <lb/>
     with the United States, that we would have to 
     <lb/>
     have our own government to do any business of 
     <lb/>
     that nature. We were told that any future business 
     <lb/>
     that might be contemplated by the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland in connection with the bases, 
     <lb/>
     we would have power to go and talk to them about 
     <lb/>
     it....

     when we were discussing the question of these 
     <lb/>
     bases. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> And this base question was at our 
     <lb/>
     first meeting, and there was no stenographic 
     <lb/>
     report as far as I'm concerned. It came up later in 
     <lb/>
     the second meeting, when one of our delegates 
     <lb/>
     took the matter up. I think he's going to say 
     <lb/>
     something right now, by the look of him over 
     <lb/>
     there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There was a stenographic report 
     <lb/>
     at the first meeting. They have it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I drew to Lord Addison's attention 
     <lb/>
     that in this house two members had asked regard<lb break="no"/>ing discussions with the United States, and the 
     <lb/>
     late Chairman of that time gave the answer, "Yes, 
     <lb/>
     it was a matter that could be discussed." And 
     <lb/>
     Professor Wheare concurred. I think I brought 
     <lb/>
     out that in my opinion there were more people in 
     <lb/>
     this country interested in talks with United States 
     <lb/>
     than in confederation with Canada. That is what 
     <lb/>
     I said, and I'm prepared to defend it. I am some<lb break="no"/>what surprised at my friend across the row there, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Keough.... I'm not looking for a hand-out. I 
     <lb/>
     never had always a silver spoon and I don't know 
     <lb/>
     if I ever had either one, but I have had good and 
     <lb/>
     I've had bad. People call us poor, and plenty over 
     <lb/>
     there, but that's more than the British people got 
     <lb/>
     over there. They haven't got food in plenty — far 
     <lb/>
     from it. Now I'm of the opinion that when the 
     <lb/>
     matter was referred to in connection with bases, 
     <lb/>
     because of the fact that Great Britain was depend<lb break="no"/>ing largely upon loans from the United States, 
     <lb/>
     Lord Addison did say that... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Fudge, I have to draw your 
     <lb/>
     attention to the fact that you have no right to 
     <lb/>
     repeat anything that Lord Addison said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> What right did he have to repeat 
     <lb/>
     what we said before we got here to the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not aware that he has 
     <lb/>
     repeated anything that you said. If he has done 
     <lb/>
     so, then he is guilty of a breach of Confidence. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> ....That's the information that was 
     <lb/>given in the House of Commons before the 
     <lb/>delegation arrived here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That was a pronouncement as to 
     <lb/>
     the results of the conferences by Lord Addison 
     <lb/>
     which he had a perfect right to make. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I am of the opinion, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     that the information or the discussions that took 
     <lb/>
     place over in that House is the property of the 
   

            <cb/>
         

     people of Newfoundland, they should have it. it 
     <lb/>
     shouldn't be hidden from them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I can't go as far as Mr. Fudge has 
     <lb/>
     gone as to whether or not the conversations which 
     <lb/>
     took place between the delegates and the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office officials should be made 
     <lb/>
     public or not. I am of the opinion that this Con<lb break="no"/>vention elected a delegation to go to England, and 
     <lb/>
     they expected that delegation to bring back to 
     <lb/>
     them the fullest report possible. I have no recol<lb break="no"/>lection whatsoever of any agreement on keeping 
     <lb/>
     things which happened in the Convention room 
     <lb/>
     or delegates' rooms from them. No agreement 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever. I do think that we were the servants 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention. There are things brought out 
     <lb/>
     in the conversation which this Convention should 
     <lb/>
     know. I agree entirely if Mr. Fudge will confine 
     <lb/>
     his statement to the fact that this Convention 
     <lb/>
     should know exactly the results — the 
     <lb/>
     stenographic report which was made by our 
     <lb/>
     reporter during these conversations — because I 
     <lb/>
     maintain there are things in these statements 
     <lb/>
     made by officials over there which you must have 
     <lb/>
     if you are to get a real true perspective of the 
     <lb/>
     report which is now being submitted and laid on 
     <lb/>
     the table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The two alternatives, either a 
     <lb/>
     free discussion or a formal discussion, were 
     <lb/>
     presented to all present. And Lord Addison made 
     <lb/>
     the statement that he assumed if we agreed to 
     <lb/>
     conduct our negotiations or our conversations, 
     <lb/>
     whichever you like to call them, freely, it would 
     <lb/>
     be essential that all statements made by in<lb break="no"/>dividual members should be regarded as com<lb break="no"/>pletely confidential. I agreed. No one so far as I 
     <lb/>
     know dissented. Consequently, Lord Addison 
     <lb/>
     was justified in assuming thateverything that was 
     <lb/>
     said would be kept confidential. Now, if there's 
     <lb/>
     any particular statement that was made by 
     <lb/>
     anyone present, that any member of that delega<lb break="no"/>tion thinks should be laid before this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     there is a way for him to get it. And that is obtain 
     <lb/>
     the permission of Lord Addison to disclose it. But 
     <lb/>
     until that is done, no member of that delegation 
     <lb/>
     has any right to disclose a single statement made 
     <lb/>
     by Lord Addison or by anyone else during those 
     <lb/>
     conferences. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman, I think it's up to this 
     <lb/>
     National Convention to know what should be 
     <lb/>
     done or shouldn't be done. I cannot see why the 
     <lb/>
     six or the seven men that went across to Britain

     and got this information have got the right to keep 
     <lb/>
     it from the 44 of us. We're getting the same pay. 
     <lb/>
     We represent the same people. I believe firmly 
     <lb/>
     that we as a body of men should receive it in 
     <lb/>
     secret and put out what we believe the people 
     <lb/>
     should know as near as we can, on account of it 
     <lb/>
     was to be kept in. I know there are things as you 
     <lb/>
     said when your hair is let down, but I firmly 
     <lb/>
     believe that whatever's been said should be let 
     <lb/>
     known to the representatives of the people. Can't 
     <lb/>
     the 44 of us keep it as quiet as six of us? I, as a 
     <lb/>
     member of this Convention, demand that we now 
     <lb/>
     have the report.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, I happened to be a 
     <lb/>
     member of that delegation. I have a clear 
     <lb/>
     memory.... I attended the first meeting of that 
     <lb/>
     conference over there, and to my recollection I 
     <lb/>
     don't remember Lord Addison saying that we 
     <lb/>
     were to keep these things confidential. That is my 
     <lb/>
     recollection. I do remember him saying, the last 
     <lb/>
     day we were there, five or six minutes before we 
     <lb/>
     disbanded, that we've had very fine talks be<lb break="no"/>tween ourselves, and these are confidential talks. 
     <lb/>
     These were his exact words. That was five 
     <lb/>
     minutes before we disbanded. That is the posi<lb break="no"/>tion. There were matters in connection with 
 

            <cb/>
        

     American bases and so forth which wouldn't 
     <lb/>
     probably be made public. But as far as before we 
     <lb/>
     started saying, "Well now gentlemen, all our 
     <lb/>
     talks here have got to be confidential", there was 
     <lb/>
     no such statement made. That's all there is to it.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Just a moment please, just a 
     <lb/>moment. I have made a statement here which I 
     <lb/>stand by.

            <p>That this National Convention appoint a

     Report of the London Delegation:¹ 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Late in yesterday's session I asked 
     <lb/>
     whether or not any discussion took place in Lon<lb break="no"/>don as to possible future relations between the 
     <lb/>
     United States of America and Newfoundland. I 
     <lb/>
     did not receive a satisfactory answer; in fact, I 
     <lb/>
     received no answer. So now I ask again: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. Was the matter discussed? 2. If so, why 
     <lb/>
     was it not included in the report of the London 
     <lb/>
     delegation? 3. Is the delegation, having not 
     <lb/>
     reported on the matter, at liberty to answer from 
     <lb/>
     this floor? 4. If there is a "hush-hush" policy on 
     <lb/>
     this question, who, in the opinion of the delega- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     tion, are the parties behind it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have one further remark to make, I think it 
     <lb/>
     very unfair for Lord Addison to pledge our 
     <lb/>
     delegation to secrecy on matters that concern us. 
     <lb/>
     I think that British diplomacy was gone pretty 
     <lb/>
     low when that happened. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> As chairman of the delegation I 
     <lb/>
     have to say, as far as my recollection goes, there 
     <lb/>
     was no discussion as to possible future relations 
     <lb/>
     between United States and Newfoundland. It did 
     <lb/>
     come up in connection with the bases; beyond 
     <lb/>
     that I have no recollection as to discussions of
