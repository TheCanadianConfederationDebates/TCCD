<!--            <p>vanced, when the people of British North <lb/>
America. witnessed the heroic resistance
that <lb/>
a comparatively small number of
men in the <lb/>
Southern States made against overwhelm<lb break="no"/>ing odds, a large amount of sym<lb break="no"/>pathy was excited in the minds of <lb/>
many—that sympathy which is always excit<lb break="no"/>ed when a small body is seen contending <lb/>
with great bravery against superior numbers— <lb/>
in favour of the South. But although that <lb/>
feeling has existed to some extent—although <lb/>
there have been persons in this country who <lb/>
believe that the material
interests of British <lb/>
America would be promoted by a separation <lb/>
between the Northern and
Southern States, <lb/>
and that great Republic being thus divided <lb/>
into two governments; yet I am
confident <lb/>
that there is not a British subject in British <lb/>
America who will learn the untimely death <lb/>
of President Lincoln and the circum<lb break="no"/>stances under which it has occurred <lb/>
without the feeling of the most unfeign<lb break="no"/>ed sorrow and the most profound regret. <lb/>
It is well known that President Lincoln was <lb/>
elected the President of the United States of <lb/>
America by the intelligent and
freely express<lb break="no"/>ed voice of the people of that great country; <lb/>
and no man who has observed the course that <lb/>
he has pursued can entertain a doubt that he <lb/>
has regarded it as a conscientious duty—a
duty <lb/>
from which, under no circumstances, he was able <lb/>
in the slightest degree, to shrink—to maintain <lb/>
the sovereignty of his government over the <lb/>
entire country. That he has persistently pur<lb break="no"/>sued that policy with an inflexibility of deter<lb break="no"/>mination and strength of purpose which must <lb/>
for ever mark him as a man of command<lb break="no"/>ing talents, no one can deny, and I am satisfied <lb/>
that the sentiment of the people, and of those <lb/>
who are placed over the people, throughout <lb/>
British North America, will agree in the
opinion <lb/>
that he has been actuated by a conscientious <lb/>
discharge of what we believed to be a patriotic <lb/>
duty in that crisis of his country's history. <lb/>
Under these circumstances I feel that it is <lb/>
right that the neighboring governments in B. N. <lb/>
America should, as far as their means would <lb/>
permit, exhibit on the present occasion their <lb/>
deep sympathy with the people of the neigh<lb break="no"/>bouring states who have lost their Chief,
<lb/>
Ruler, and, at the same time, mark their deep <lb/>
abhorrence of the atrocious crime by which <lb/>
he has been removed. I have, therefore, to of<lb break="no"/>fer to the House the following resolution: <lb/>
            </p>
  
            <p> Resolved unanimously:
that this House have <lb/>
heard with the most profound regret that the <lb/>
President of the United States of America has <lb/>
fallen by the hand of an
assassin, and that, as <lb/>
a. mark of sympathy with the people who <lb/>
have thus been deprived of their Chief Ruler, <lb/>
and of their abhorrence of the atrocious crime <lb/>
that has been committed, this House do ad<lb break="no"/>journ until Monday next. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. Stewart Campbell, who seconded the <lb/>
resolution, said:—On any ordinary
occasion I <lb/>
should regret the absence of the learned mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Colchester, who occupies a position in <lb/>
this House which would peculiarly call upon <lb/>
him to second any resolution
demanding the <lb/>
united action of all parties in this House. But <lb/>
this resolution is of no party, and requires
not <lb/>
that any particular individual should second <lb/>
it. It is indeed one that need not be form<lb break="no"/>ally ascended by the lips, for it is sustained by <lb/>
the feelings of every gentleman
around these <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p> benches. The hon. Provincial Secretary
has <lb/>
referred to the awful tragedy of which we have <lb/>
just received the painful intelligence, in terms <lb/>
so feeling, and so appropriate and just, that <lb/>
although according to parliamentary usage, I <lb/>
have undertaking my present
duty, but little <lb/>
observation is requisite on my
part to confirm <lb/>
or endorse those sentiments. We all feel, Sir, <lb/>
that an occurrence has taken place which at <lb/>
the present age of the world is not only an <lb/>
outrage upon an individual and a nationality, <lb/>
but is an ourage upon mankind and the civili<lb break="no"/>zation of the world at large; and although we <lb/>
belong to another Empire than that in which <lb/>
this dreadful scene has been enacted, we are <lb/>
deeply moved by the awful fact that there has <lb/>
been a gross outrage committed against those <lb/>
feelings which are and ever will be, respected <lb/>
in every country that prides itself in the pos<lb break="no"/>session of the privileges of civilization and the <lb/>
blessings of christianity. I think the course <lb/>
taken by the government in adjourning this <lb/>
House as a mark and testimony of its feelings <lb/>
on the present melancholy occasion is extreme<lb break="no"/>ly appropriate, and will be sure to meet with <lb/>
the cordial approval of every member in this <lb/>
House and of every man in this country. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The resolution passed unanimously, and
the <lb/>
house adjourned. <lb/>
            </p>-->

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP4">Mr. C. J. CAMPBELL</persName> presented a petition <lb/>
from Malagawatch, Inverness, praying
that <lb/>
the act passed in 1862, depriving them of
their <lb/>
church properties, should be repealed. He <lb/>
stated that there were several petitions on the <lb/>
same subject on the table, and the petitioners <lb/>
had undoubtedly much reason for complaint, <lb/>
but owing to the lateness of the session he was <lb/>
afraid the house could not take the matter up, <lb/>
and give it that consideration which its impor<lb break="no"/>tance demanded. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HATF2">Mr. HATFIELD</persName> resented a petition, and a <lb/>
bill in accordance therewith, giving the propri<lb break="no"/>etors of the old meeting house at Tusket per<lb break="no"/>mission to sell the same. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The house then went into committee, and <lb/>

<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>tlemen to continue the debate, although
not <lb/>
very well prepared at the present moment to <lb/>
address the house, rather than that time should <lb/>
be wasted, I shall take advantage of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent opportunity to offer the few remarks 1 in<lb break="no"/>tend to make upon the subject now under dis<lb break="no"/>cussion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> In the first place I shall refer to the
observa<lb break="no"/>tions made by the hon. Pro. Sec. on Thursday <lb/>
last upon a subject analagous to that now be<lb break="no"/>fore the house. He challenged the accuracy of <lb/>
the statement I then made that seven-eighths <lb/>
of the people of this country were opposed to <lb/>
the Confederation scheme, and asserted that <lb/>
so far from that being the case, at least that <lb/>
number were in favor of it. Now, sir, if he <lb/>
believes that to be the case—pledged as he is <lb/>
by his action at the Quebec Conference to carry <lb/>
out the scheme—why does he content himself <lb/>
by laying on the table of the house a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion which asks the house to go back to the <lb/>
olicy of last year—in favor of a union of the <lb/>
Maritime provinces—and declares that the <lb/>
larger union is impracticable? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Voting, as I did, last year for a
resolution si<lb break="no"/>milar to that now before the house I should be <lb/>
prepared to maintain it now, were it not for the <lb/>
observations of the hon. Pro. Sec.—reiterated <lb/>
by the leader of the opposition—that he re<lb break="no"/>garded this as a stepping stone for the larger <lb/>
union of the British North
American Provinces. <lb/>
Believing, as I do, that the effect
of a union <lb/>
with Canada would be to deprive us of our <lb/>
present locus standi and to make us a mere de<lb break="no"/>endency of that Province, I feel
cempelled, <lb/>
olding these views, to vote against the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, and I do so, as I have said, principally on <lb/>
account of the remarks made by the two hon. <lb/>
gentlemen I have referred to. Now, sir, I think <lb/>
the house will agree with me that the speeches <lb/>
Which we have listened to from,
the hon. Pro. <lb/>
Sec. and the hon. leader of the opposition have <lb/>
had very little connection with the resolution <lb/>
under discussion.  Scarcely a word has fallen <lb/>
from their lips upon the question of a union of <lb/>
the Maritime Provinces. As regards that <lb/>
union I may say that I am not opposed to it, <lb/>
provided that it can be effected
upon terms fa<lb break="no"/>vorable to the province; but I am most
decid<lb break="no"/>edly opposed to it as a means of accomplishing <lb/>
the larger union. We have been told that the <lb/>
views of Mr. Howe, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. <lb/>
Young were all in favor of union. Even sup<lb break="no"/>posing that this was the case, I do not see why <lb/>
their opinions should be binding upon us. <lb/>
They have passed away into a different arena <lb/>
—whilst here they reflected the opinions of <lb/>
their constituents—we are here now in
their <lb/>
places, not to carry out their views, but to re<lb break="no"/>present the feelings and the interests of the <lb/>
whole people of Nova Scotia. Before alluding <lb/>
to the financial aspect of this question there <lb/>
are one or two matters to which
I shall briefly <lb/>
refer—one is in connection with the loss of <lb/>
privileges which will be entailed upon the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this country by the
adoption of the <lb/>
scheme of union. The right of being taxed, <lb/>
only through the action of their representatives
<lb/>
has always been considered one of the
dearest <lb/>
privileges a free people can possess,
and it is <lb/>
one that comes home to every man's mind. At <lb/>
present not a single penny of
taxes can be im<lb break="no"/>posed upon the country except with the consent <lb/>
of the representatives of the
people; but what <lb/>
will be the result after we are annexed to Ca<lb break="no"/>nada? What chance would 300,000
poeple<lb/>
            
            <cb/>    
             have against three millions—or what stand<lb/>
could the representatives of Nova Scotia make<lb/>
against the overpowering influence of the go<lb break="no"/>vernment of Canada? We would be in the <lb/>
position that we would have to submit, no<lb/>
matter how iniquitous the tax, or else be taunt<lb break="no"/>ed as rebels. Now we have the glorious privi<lb break="no"/>lege of electing our own representatives and <lb/>
arranging our own tariff, and I am happy to<lb/>
say that so far we have done so in a manner<lb/>
that has redounded to the credit of the province<lb/>
and has doubled the resources of the country<lb/>
in the last few years. But what would be the <lb/>
consequence if this attempt to barter away out<lb/>
rights and privileges were carried out? In<lb break="no"/>stead of as now—enacting our own laws, subject<lb/>
to the exercise of the royal prerogative—we<lb/>
would, by our own act, surrender to the su<lb break="no"/>preme government at Ottawa the right of pass<lb break="no"/>ing any laws, no matter how obnoxious they<lb/>
might be to our people, and we would be com<lb break="no"/>pelled to submit, or else be branded as rebels. <lb/>
Under the present sysyetm, if an act was pass<lb break="no"/>ed which was not suited to the wants of the<lb/>
people, it could be repealed at the next session—<lb/>
but adopt this union, and we surrender to the<lb/>
Ottawa government all control over our legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and leave ourselves entirely at their<lb/>
mercy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I regret very much that no abler<lb/>
man than myself should be found to raise his<lb/>
voice against this attempt to barter away our<lb/>
dearest rights and privileges,—sorry am I that<lb/>
Nova Scotia's most gifted sons should be found<lb/>
to have entered into this unholy compact to de<lb break="no"/>stroy our political existence; but, sir, humble<lb/>
as I am, I should consider myself recreant to <lb/>
my principles, and unworthy of the confidence<lb/>
of those who sent me here, if I failed to de<lb break="no"/>nounce, feebly it may be, but to the best of my<lb/>
ability, this scheme, which I consider so detri<lb break="no"/>mental to the best interests of the people of<lb/>
Nova Scotia. Sir, we all remember the old<lb/>
story of Esau selling his birthright for a mess <lb/>
of pottage, and how he aftwewards regretted it<lb/>
with an exceeding bitter cry—but there was<lb/>
this to be said in excuse for his conduct, that he<lb/>
sold it when he was hungry, and at all events<lb/>
he received some return,—whereas the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Nova Scotia was not hungry, and the<lb/>
only return she would receive for the surren<lb break="no"/>der of her rights would be a mess of bitter<lb/>
herbs, to be eaten in sorrow and digested in<lb/>
tears. We have been told that we would not be<lb/>
left without a Parliament—that the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the people would be in the same po<lb break="no"/>sition as when such men as Archibald, and <lb/>
Uniacke, and Haliburton adorned these halls<lb/>
by their presence. But it does not require<lb/>
much argument to prove that such will not be<lb/>
the case. They were the representatives of a <lb/>
Province having its own laws—its own tariff—<lb/>
the control of its own resources—while we will<lb/>
represent a dependency of Canada, with pow<lb/>
ers about as great as the Grand Jury and Ses<lb break="no"/>sions of a county. I do hope, if this scheme is <lb/>
carried out, for the credit of old times, and old<lb/>
associations, that the title of the representa<lb break="no"/>tives will be changed, and that instead of the<lb/>
time-honored name of M. P. P., they will sub<lb break="no"/>stitute taht of M. C. P., or Member of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil of Puppets. I do  not intend, Mr. Speaker,<lb/>
to go very largely into the financial question,<lb/>
so ably treated by the member for East Hali<lb break="no"/>fax (Mr. Annand), but I find that although in<lb/>
the main we agree, yet starting as we did from<lb/>

<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>
             different
premises, we naturally arrive at dif<lb break="no"/>ferent conclusions.  This difference has arisen<lb/>
principally I think from the member for<lb/>
Halifax basing his calculations upon<lb/>
the whole amount of this year's expen<lb break="no"/>diture, without taing into consideration the<lb/>
balance in the Receiver General's hands at the<lb/>
end of the year. Now, Sir, I assume the civil<lb/>
list is to be paid by the General Government;<lb/>
and I am in doubt as to one item—the pensions<lb/>
for the Judges. I should like to ask the Prov.<lb/>
Secretary whether, by the Constitution, that is<lb/>
to be borne by the General or Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I assumed in my calculation that they<lb/>
would be paid by the General Government. <lb/>

            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, here are the figures; and I defy
the<lb/>
hon. Fin Sec. to take the papers and show any<lb/>
thing more favorable to the Province. But,<lb/>
separate and apart altogether from this finan<lb break="no"/>cial view of the subject, there are other con<lb break="no"/>siderations which should have some effect upon<lb/>
our action in this matter. It is well known<lb/>
that our public works are progressing, and<lb/>
the our revenue is increasing year by year;<lb/>
but it must be remembered that under this<lb/>
scheme, no matter how prosperous we might<lb/>
become, no matter how largely our resources<lb/>
might increase, it would not be for the benefit<lb/>
of Nova Scotia, but the General Government <lb/>
at Ottawa. It is true that we might become a <lb/>
large manufacturing country, and the great<lb/>
seaport of all the Colonies; yet, still all the<lb/>
benefit we would derive from the general<lb/>
prosperity would be the 80 cents per head<lb/>
            <cb/>
            which the Constitution gives us. When I look<lb/>
at the position of affairs as between Canada<lb/>
and the United States—when I consider that <lb/>
the Reciprocity Treaty is about to expire, and <lb/>
that the Canadians, feeling themselves agriev<lb break="no"/>ed, will seek to retaliate upon the United<lb/>
States, while at the same time they will put<lb/>
money in their own pockets, I am driven to <lb/>
the conviction that they will accomplish their<lb/>
objects at the expense of the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—that they will impose a duty upon<lb/>
flour, which we now import from the United <lb/>
States—a duty of at least a dollar a barrel,—<lb/>
and that we will have no other option than to<lb/>
submit. That will be the time when the effects<lb/>
of this Union will be brought home to us in a <lb/>
practical shape, and when it is too late, the <lb/>
people of this Province will begin to realize<lb/>
the force of the objections we now raise<lb/>
against it. </p>
            
            <p>I maintain if we go into this union with Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, we will be treated, as all small provinces<lb/>
ever have been treated—whch have been an<lb break="no"/>nexed to large countries. Our interests will<lb/>
be respected just so far as it is to the advantage<lb/>
of the larger province to do so. I need not as<lb break="no"/>sure the house, Mr. Speaker, that I have no in<lb/>
terest to serve in this matter. I have no other<lb/>
object than to advance the welfare of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Nova Scotia; but I must candidly<lb/>
say that if this union is effected I believe  that <lb/>
the people of Canada will use the people<lb/>
of these lower provinces for the purpose of pass<lb break="no"/>ing off on them their surplus agricultural pro<lb break="no"/>ducts, which we will be compelled to receive<lb/>
at a higher rate than we can now im<lb break="no"/>port them from the United State. We have <lb/>
been pointed, sir, to Cape Breton as an instance<lb/>
of the benefit of union, and have been told<lb/>
that under it she has received more than her<lb/>
rights. Sire, I deny it; and I have only to refer<lb/>
to the universal feeling of execration, which  <lb/>
even now, after a lapseof twenty years, exists<lb/>
over the whole Island for the act which de<lb break="no"/>prived them of their rights and privilieges to <lb/>
prove the truth of my statement. That same<lb/>
feeling, I believe, before many years will be<lb/>
widespread throughout Nova Scotia, for the<lb/>
men who have endeavored to wrench from <lb/>
them their dearest rights without giving them<lb/>
a single iota in return. </p>
            <p>Sir, I feel deepy on this subect, and, as I <lb/>
said before, I regret that Nova Scotia's most <lb/>
gifted sons could not have found a better subject<lb/>
to coalesce upon then in this attempt to barter<lb/>
away our rights and liberties. But, sir, it has<lb/>
been siad that we are too insignificant in our<lb/>
present position—that we ought to become a <lb/>
great country. Well, sir, I for one am content<lb/>
to remain under that great and glorious flag<lb/>
that waves over us to-day—and poor and in<lb break="no"/>significant as we Nova Scotians may be, we<lb/>
have the consolation of knowing that we have<lb/>
always been loyal and true to that flag, which <lb/>
is more than can be said of that great country<lb/>
to which some gentlemen are so anxious to be<lb/>
united. It has also been urged that the United <lb/>
States is prepared to gobble us up, if we remain<lb/>
dis-united from Canada. Now, sir, I cannot see<lb/>
in what better position for defence we will be<lb/>
in by the Union. Will we be able to number a<lb/>
man more, or to shoulder an additional mus<lb break="no"/>ket? I think not. But now, under the ægis<lb/>
of Old England, we are secure. She has pro<lb break="no"/>mised to defend us, so long as we manifest a <lb/>
disposition to defend ourselves. When we<lb/>

<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>


come to
look at our militia estimates for this<lb/>
year, I think it will be found that we
have done <lb/>
more for our defence than Canada, in pro<lb break="no"/>portion to our resources and population,
and <lb/>
therefore when I say that we are more loyal<lb/>
I prove it by the law on the statute book,
and<lb/>
by the liberal provision contained in the
esti<lb/>
mates. The Pro. Sec. told us that this
union<lb/>
will give us a character and nationality we<lb/>
do not now possess—that we have now no
locus<lb/>
standi and have no weight amongsth the
nations<lb/>
of the world. I ask how is it going to
improve<lb/>
our position in that respect to annex us
to Ca<lb break="no"/>nada? Is it going to add to our importance
of<lb/>
position to deprive us of our Lieutenant
Go<lb break="no"/>vernor, and our character as a province,
and <lb/>
reduce us to the condition of a mere
depend<lb break="no"/>ency of a larger province? If it does, I
certain<lb break="no"/>ly am at a loss to understand it. It is
not a <lb/>
very difficult matter to account for the
anxiety<lb/>
of Canada for this union. Everybody knows<lb/>
the troubled state of affairs that have
existed in <lb/>
that country for years, and it is natural
that<lb/>
they should turn to us, not from any
regard to<lb/>
our interests, but as a panacea for their
own<lb/>
ills. They saw a country with a low tariff,<lb/>
able to uphold all her institutions and
her pub<lb break="no"/>lic works—able to devote $80,000 for her
de<lb break="no"/>fence, and have a surplus besides—and, like<lb/>
Napoleon's giant and the dwarf, they are
pre<lb break="no"/>pared to squeeze us, affectionately it may
be,<lb/>
but it is the giant's nature to squeeze
hard.<lb/>
The hon. Pro. Sec. told us as an
irresistible ar<lb break="no"/>gument in favour of his views—that that
great<lb/>
organ, the Times, had declared in favour
of the <lb/>
shceme, and therefore we must submit. In<lb/>
fact, as Nebuchadneezer told the
Babylonians<lb/>
of old—we must bown down and worship the <lb/>
graven image he has sat up. Now I will,
with<lb/>
the permission of the house, read a few ex<lb break="no"/>tracts from the letter of the
correspondent of <lb/>
that paper, who came here during the visit
of <lb/>
H. R. H. the Prince of Wales—and who was <lb/>
so well up in the geography of the country,<lb/>
that on his way to Halifax he found
himself at<lb/>
Toronto. Hear what he says abour Windsor:</p>

            <p>"So on I got to Windsor, a village of shan<lb break="no"/>ties and some 1,200 people, where a well
mean<lb break="no"/>ing, but mistaken, individual has built an<lb/>
hotel large enought to accommodate all the
in<lb break="no"/>habitants. The latter, however, as might
have <lb/>
been anticipated, prefer living in their
huts; so <lb/>
this hotel has never been opened to this <lb/>
day. * * *</p>

            <p>This sir, is the way in which the
accredited <lb/>
correspondent of this great paper maligns
the<lb/>
people of this Province, on an occasion
when, I<lb/>
am proud to say, they did themselves honor
in <lb/>
the reception they give their Prince.</p>

            <p>Then again, in speaking of the daughters
of <lb/>
Acadia, who are renowned the world over for<lb/>
their beauty, their intelligence, and
their vir<lb break="no"/>tue—this is the way he dares to speak of
them:<lb/>
"Halifax, at first, does not impress one
fa<lb break="no"/>vorably; for the entrance from the station
in<lb break="no"/>cludes, as usual, all the worst
thoroughfares<lb/>
and meanest houses, where the sun burnt na<lb break="no"/>tives loll out of their windows all day,
and<lb/>
where brightly dressed Indian squaws, with<lb/>
their great splaw feet, covered with thick<lb/>
mocassins, tramp along with little papooses<lb/>
tied hand and foot to a flat piece of
board, and<lb/>
looking like some curious preparation of an<lb/>
infant being dried in the sun."</p>

            <p>And yet this is the paper that the
Provincial<lb/>
Secretary thinks should influence the judg<lb break="no"/>
            <cb/>
ment of the people of this country in the
consi<lb break="no"/>deration of this great question. Now, sir,
I<lb/>
shall not detain this house with any
further re<lb break="no"/>marks. All I can say is, if the people of
this<lb/>
country are willing to surrender their
rights<lb/>
and liberties, let them do so. I have done
my<lb/>
duty in warning them against it. I may not<lb/>
live long enough to see them reaping the
bitter<lb/>
fruits of their own folly; but I shall
have the<lb/>
proud satisfaction of knowing that my
children<lb/>
can point to my tomb, and say—There lies
one <lb/>
who has the manliness to raise his voice
in the <lb/>
halls of parliament against this unholy
alliance.</p>

the views propounded by my political party<lb/>
leader; and let me say that no act of my
little<lb/>
political life has given me half the pain
I feel<lb/>
in being compelled to take a position in
oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to that hon. gentleman,.There are
other<lb/>
considerations which might well cause me to<lb/>
hesitate: not only is the question the most<lb/>
momentous ever discussed here, but there
is <lb/>
the further consideration that it has been
ma<lb break="no"/>tured by thirty-three gentlemen who claim,<lb/>
and perhaps not undeservedly, to be among<lb/>
the ablest in British America. But if I
might<lb/>
be disposed to hesitate from these
considerat<lb break="no"/>tions, I remember that I am here to act
upon<lb/>
my own conscientious convictions of wht is
<lb/>
right and wrong—of what may be or may not<lb/>
be for the good of my country—and not upon<lb/>
other men's capabilities of forming a
correct<lb/>
judgement. For apart from considerations
of a <lb/>
political nature which may and do too often<lb/>
influence men, there are occasions when the<lb/>
most enlarged and comprehensive minds<lb/>
overlook the useful and the practical in
the<lb/>
contemplation of the ideal. So had it been,<lb/>
I believe on the present occasion. Men<lb/>
have given up to an idea, or a sentiment
that <lb/>
which they should never have yielded,
except<lb/>
to sound argument and strong conclusive
fact.<lb/>
I believe that the idea or sentiment of
union<lb/>
has had very much to do with influencing<lb/>
men's minds upon this subject. When the<lb/>
Provincial Secretary, in addressing the
house<lb/>
on the history of this question, referred
to the <lb/>
most unanimous applause with which the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of union had been greeted when
mention<lb break="no"/>ed on platform or festive occasions, I
thought<lb/>
at the time that very much of that applause<lb/>
was given to the sentiment or idea of union<lb/>
which has always a charm for men's minds<lb/>
and not so much to the practical workings
of a <lb/>
union of these provinces. There are perhaps<lb/>
few words in the English language that
have <lb/>
such an influence over men's minds as that
lit<lb break="no"/>tle word "Union." We have seen in the
neigh<lb break="no"/>boring republic how powerful an influence
this <lb/>
"union sentiment" exercises over the
people.<lb/>
Many years ago when the question of the ad<lb break="no"/>mission of Texas into the Union was under<lb/>
consideration, Daniel Webster, than whom<lb/>
America has not known a mightier intellect,<lb/>
warned the Senate against the extension of
<lb/>
territory Southward. That warning voice was<lb/>
unheeded. The union sentiment prevailed,<lb/>

and that union took place. With the greatness <lb/>
and prosperity of the country there grew up an <lb/>
interest in the South, which finding its own <lb/>
centre within itself, and growing antagonistic <lb/>
to the North, at length culminated in a demand <lb/>
for a separation. We are all familiar with the <lb/>
history of events from that time to this—that <lb/>
the difficulty resulted in a war which has been <lb/>
unparalled in its magnitude and in its severity <lb/>
—a war which has furrowed with
the graves of <lb/>
the slain the face of that country as thickly as <lb/>
the furrows in a farmer's field. Looking at the in<lb break="no"/>fluence which this sentiment has exercised over <lb/>
men's minds at all times, I must conclude that <lb/>
it has also operated largely in the provinces, <lb/>
and that men have been carried away by that <lb/>
sentiment, and have sought a union irre<lb break="no"/>spective of provincial rights and the conse— <lb/>
quences that may flow from it. They have for<lb break="no"/>gotten the union that already exists between <lb/>
these provinces—that we are united by the <lb/>
same loyal sentiments—that we are, as the hon. <lb/>
member for Richmond says, citizens of the <lb/>
same Empire—subjects of the same Queen.<lb/>
The same flag that floats over Buckingham <lb/>
Palace floats over our Citadel, and
protects the<lb/>
inhabitants of these provinces as well as
those<lb/>
of London. Under that protection we enjoy<lb/>
every blessing and privilege that is known
in <lb/>
civilized and enlightened society; and I
asked<lb/>
myself when the Provincial Secretary, the<lb/>
other night, was speaking of the progress<lb/>
and prosperoty of this province, and
telling<lb/>
us how much we had to be grateful for, why<lb/>
we could not withal cultivate the virtue of<lb/>
contentment. But they tell us that there
are<lb/>
circumstances outside of our own borders
that<lb/>
prevent the continuance of these things.
In <lb/>
the first place, we have been told that
there is<lb/>
a disposition on the part of England to
cast us<lb/>
adrift. It is hardly necessary to spend
much<lb/>
time on part of the subject, because opi<lb break="no"/>nions lately propounded in the British
parlia<lb break="no"/>ment show that there is a determination on<lb/>
the part of Great Britain to preserve her
colo<lb break="no"/>nies so long as they remain loyal to the
crown<lb/>
of England. We naturally expected this de<lb break="no"/>claration. We have seen that the expansion<lb/>
and maintenance of colonies has been the<lb/>
policy which England has pursued from time<lb/>
immemorial, and it is that which has given<lb/>
her her proudest title—"mistress and sover<lb break="no"/>eign of the sea." In the many long years of<lb/>
struggle with other powers to obtain that
title,<lb/>
it was not so much the staunchness of her<lb/>
ships, or the bravery of her crews, as
from the<lb/>
training to the seas which they had
acquired<lb/>
in the wide commerce afforded by colonies.<lb/>
Before passing away from this part of the<lb/>
subject, I may add it is still more
unlikely<lb/>
that England should have adopted this
policy<lb/>
of abandoning her colonies at a time when
her<lb/>
great rival France has adopted it, and in
every<lb/>
part of the habitable globe, where she can
ob<lb break="no"/>tain a foothold, is planting colonies that
she<lb/>
too may have a widely extended commerce—<lb/>
that she may train from their youth a
large <lb/>
number of her people to "go down upon the<lb/>
seas in ships, to do business upon the
mighty<lb/>
waters," and thus prepare them for that
mag<lb break="no"/>nificent navy she is building. Again,
England<lb/>
requires, in large quantities, the
products of <lb/>
the American continent, and it would be im<lb break="no"/>politic to allow a foreign power to
control all<lb/>
those products. When Louis Napoleon took<lb/>
possession of Mexico, and made of her a
vir<lb break="no"/><cb/>tual
dependency of France, he said, "We have<lb/>
an interest
indeed in the republic of the United<lb/>
States
being prosperous and powerful; but not<lb/>
that she
should take possession of the whole<lb/>
gulf of
Mexico, thence to command the Antilles<lb/>
as well as
South Smerica, and to be the only<lb/>
dispenser
of the products of the New World.<lb/>
If this be
the policy of Napoleon—if he felt an<lb/>
anxiety that no foreign power should
control<lb/>
the products of a continent, how much more
is<lb/>
it the interest of England that a foreign
power<lb/>
shall not have the entire command of
products<lb/>
essential to her existence. England has
justly<lb/>
been called the "workshop of the world,"
but<lb/>
in materials for manufacture, she procures<lb/>
from other countries the value of over one
hun<lb break="no"/>dred millions of pounds sterling, while one<lb/>
third of her people receive the food upon
which<lb/>
they live from abroad. Hence it s vastly<lb/>
more important to England than to iFrance<lb/>
whose necessities in those particulars is
not so<lb/>
great that no one power should control the<lb/>
grain and material for manufacture produced<lb/>
by the continent of America. Therefore I
feel<lb/>
that circumstances do not warrant any man
in<lb/>
saying that it is the intention of England
to<lb/>
cast these colonies off. Earl Russell said
a few<lb/>
years ago: "I firmly believe it is our
duty, to<lb/>
maintain our great and valuable Colonial
em<lb break="no"/>pire," while Early Grey added: "I belive
that<lb/>
much of the power and influence of this
coun<lb break="no"/>try depends upon having large Colonial pos<lb break="no"/>sessions in different parts of the world;"
and<lb/>
but a few days ago we saw the same expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion as delivered by Lord
Palmer<lb break="no"/>ston. So I feel it was unwarranted for any
<lb/>
gentleman to say that it was the intention
or<lb/>
policy of England to cast their colonies
adrift.<lb/>
But we are told that we are in dnager of
being<lb/>
wrested from Great Britain, that there are
a <lb/>
number of circumstances existing in the
United<lb/>
States which endanger the connection with
the<lb/>
parent state. I cannot help admiring the
zeal<lb/>
with which the hon. gentlemen who are advo<lb break="no"/>cating this Confederation have been blowing<lb/>
the War Trumpet. They tell us that the King<lb/>
of Terrors who has been holding high
carnival<lb/>
in the valleys of the Shenandoah will soon<lb/>
come to a grand banquet in the valleys of
Nova<lb/>
Scotia. When the Pro. Secy. drew a picture
of<lb/>
this in addressing the house, I thought I
saw<lb/>
his cheek pale, but at th time it occurred
to <lb/>
me that possibly the direction in which
the <lb/>
hon gentleman was looking had something to<lb/>
do with this. He was looking at Mr. Tilley<lb/>
from New Brunswick, who was sitting outside<lb/>
the benches, and perhaps there ran through
his<lb/>
mind all that had grown out of the
resolution<lb/>
moved by him last year. That through his
ac<lb break="no"/>tion, and instrumentality the able Premier
of<lb/>
New Brunswick had been hurled from his po<lb break="no"/>sition, and that when the Pro. Secy's cheek<lb/>
blanched it was because he felt that Ban<lb break="no"/>quo's ghost was sitting at the feast.
Subse<lb break="no"/>quently when the hon. delegate from South<lb/>
Colchester, in "blowing the war trumpet,"
ex<lb break="no"/>hibited a tremor of voice unusual to him,
I had<lb/>
to acknowledge that both these hon.
gentlemen<lb/>
were really alarmed at the terrors they
pictur<lb break="no"/>ed. That the "great Wizards" who went<lb/>
"North" were terrified at the apparition
they<lb/>
had conjured up to frighten honester folks.<lb/>
We read in fabled story of sculptor who<lb/>
wrought from a block of marble a statue<lb/>
of Jupiter armed; and when he had finished<lb/>
and looked upon the workmanship of his own <lb/>
            
            <pb n="251" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1865-04-17_Page_251.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">251</fw>
<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>
            hands was
overwhelmed with terror. So are<lb/>
these hon. gentlemen overcome by the work<lb break="no"/>ings of their own imaginations.<lb/>
We are told by these gentlemen danger is <lb/>
really imminent, that it will come upon us sud<lb break="no"/>denly; then, I ask, is it the course of wise men<lb/>
to undertake a change in our constitutional<lb/>
administration that will require years to per<lb break="no"/>fect. Why the instincts of the lowest order of<lb/>
animal life tell us better. The insect, when it<lb/>
is about to undergo a transformation is perfect<lb break="no"/>ed; and shall we enter upon the throes of this<lb/>
great constitutional transformation at an hour<lb/>
when we are told danger is coming upon us.<lb/>
Let us not put off the olf harness until the <lb/>
time has come when we can safely put on the<lb/>
new and have it adjusted. Th illustration<lb/>
given by the late Abraham Lincoln, that it is<lb/>
no time to swap horses when you are crossing <lb/>
a stream, ought to be sufficient for these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen. The hon. member for Colchester has<lb/>
spoken of the great change which has occureed<lb/>
in the character and position of the American<lb/>
people. He has told you that a very few<lb/>
years ago that people was engaged in their<lb/>
workshops and factories of the country, but<lb/>
now they have been drawn from all these, and<lb/>
have formed an army that had placed that<lb/>
nation among the first military powers of the<lb/>
world. But he neglected to tell us these men<lb/>
from their industrial pursuits than were per<lb break="no"/>haps ever before found combined.
            </p>

            <p>They felt
not only called to rescue their <lb/>
            country, in whose greatness they felt a
just<lb/>
pride, from being rent in fragments, but to<lb/>
wipe from their national escutcheon the
foul<lb/>
stain of slavery. That great work they
seem <lb/>
to have accomplished. When at our last
meet<lb break="no"/>ing the tidings reached us that their
PResident<lb/>
had fallen by the hand of a foul assassin,
and <lb/>
when we sat in silence no man daring to
trust<lb/>
his voice in expressing the sympathies—the<lb/>
sorrow that swelled our hearts—further
than to<lb/>
give official form to our feelings, I
asked my<lb break="no"/>self what must be the effect of these
tidings<lb/>
upon the people over whom Abraham Lincoln<lb/>
presided, when they so affect us. Surely,
sir,<lb/>
that people have now drank the last drop in<lb/>
their cup of bitterness, and whatever other
ef<lb break="no"/>fects may flow from this act, I believe the<lb/>
American people will, with the blood of
Abra<lb break="no"/>ham Lincoln, seal a covenant with the Most<lb/>
High that the clank of the slave chain
shall no<lb/>
more be heard in their land. That he who
had<lb/>
this object deep in heart, and who, while
ably<lb/>
presiding over them, led them on gradually
step<lb/>
by step to proclaim freedom to the black
man,<lb/>
will in his death so fix and stamp the
national<lb/>
mind to that high purpose that when the
hour of<lb/>
peace comes, as in the good Providence of
God<lb/>
it seems nigh, there will, in the
arrangement of<lb/>
terms, be no temporizing, no yielding o
South<lb break="no"/>ern interests and wishes on this question.
Soon,<lb/>
therefore, will many in those armies be
found<lb/>
going back to their industrial avocations,
sad<lb break="no"/>dened no doubt by the great sacrifice they<lb/>
have witnessed, yet consoled by the
glorious<lb/>
thought that they have aided in giving to
the<lb/>
term liberty a meaning and a signification<lb/>
hitherto unknown upon their soil, that
hence<lb break="no"/>forth it embraces all classes, creeds and
colors.
            </p>
            <p>The hon. member will tell us that there
are <lb/>
others in that army who will not so
readily go<lb/>
to industrial employments; this is true
but all <cb/>
               those will find sufficient employment 
               in re-or<lb break="no"/>ganizing the Southern portion of the empire<lb/>
and in restoring it from the wreck and debris<lb/>
of this terrible civil strife. Consider also the<lb/>
spirit of the Sourthern people. The men have<lb/>
shown in the hardships they have endured—<lb/>
in the sacrifices they have made—and in their<lb/>
daring acts that a feeling of hostility to the<lb/>
North lies deep in their hearts. Nor have the<lb/>
Southern women been less remarkable for<lb/>
patient endurance, high courageous spirit and<lb/>
deep-seated hatred ; and can we for a moment<lb/>
suppose that the children born of such parents,<lb/>
nourished and trained by these women, will<lb/>
not inherit their feelings and so render it im<lb break="no"/>perative on the Northern portion of the nation<lb/>
to keep for many years a strong hand upon the<lb/>
South. The Provincial Secretary has told us<lb/>
that he has looked upon slavery as the great<lb/>
guarantee of our safety. I don't so read Ame<lb break="no"/>rican history. So far as I can judge, the men<lb/>
who have been most bitter in their hositility to<lb/>
England, and most desirous of finding causes<lb/>
of war with that country have been Southern<lb/>
statesmen. The circumstances dependent upon<lb/>
slavery have been such as to lead them to a<lb/>
breach of the peace. The fact that England, <lb/>
with a magnanimity that did her infinite honor,<lb/>
gave twenty millions to redeem her slaves—a<lb/>
fact that stood a perpetual censure as it were<lb/>
upon the South, no doubt was a cause of irrita<lb break="no"/>tion upon their minds. Again, England kept<lb/>
up a large force upon the African coast to keep<lb/>
down that traffic which tended to give rise to <lb/>
this feeling of animosity. Again, north of them <lb/>
there was a frontier line over which when the<lb/>
slave passed into Canada he gained free<lb break="no"/>dom. This was, perhaps, the strongest<lb/>
inducement for the Southerners to make war<lb/>
upon these colonies for the purpose of wiping<lb/>
away this boundry line, and enabling them<lb/>
to follow wherever the slave might go, and re<lb break="no"/>turn him to his chains. These were great<lb/>
causes of animosity to England, and now, <lb/>
since, under the blessing of God, this slavery<lb/>
has been blotted out, I believe peace is much<lb/>
more likely to be preserved between England<lb/>
and America. Had the Southerners succeed<lb break="no"/>ed in obtaining their independence, the likeli<lb break="no"/>hood of hostilities with England would have <lb/>
been much greater. The Northern people<lb/>
thwarted and smarting under the mortification<lb/>
occasioned by their inability to conquer the<lb/>
South, would have been more likely to<lb/>
turn their army—for which they would not<lb/>
have employment—upon these Provinces,<lb/>
than they will be now when they have suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in accomplishing the great object that<lb/>
they had on calling these armied into existence.<lb/>
The hon. delegate alluded to a number of cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances—the passport system, the propos<lb break="no"/>ed armament upon the lakes, and the abroga<lb break="no"/>tion of the Reciprocity Treaty—as so many <lb/>
evidences of the feeling of the Northern peo<lb break="no"/>ple towards us. When he was reading his<lb/>
summary I wondered why he omitted to refer<lb/>
to a fact which was known here some weeks<lb/>
ago—that the notice in reference to the arma<lb break="no"/>ment upon the lakes had been withdrawn, and<lb/>
arrangements made for a mere police force.<lb/>
Earl Russell, however, justifies the notice, he <lb/>
says:</p>
            <p>"Coupled with this notice is a notice given with <lb/>
respect to the armament of the lakes. I think it must<lb/>
be admitted that recent occurences on the lakes—<lb/>
namely, the seizure of vessels by the agents of the<lb/>
Confederacy and other acts of hostility—completely

<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>
             justify
the United States in giving notice of the ter<lb break="no"/>mination of the convention. My lords, it was net<lb/>
to be expected that the United States should submit<lb/>
passively to such acts of violence without availing<lb/>
themselves of all the means of repression within their<lb/>
power."</p>
            <p>An act then
which seems to strike horror<lb/>
into the mind of Colonial statesmen appears to<lb/>
British statesmen as merely a necessary means<lb/>
of self-protection. Mr. Cardwell, on the 23rd<lb/>
March, informing the British Parliament of the<lb/>
force to be employed on the lakes, says:</p>
            <p>"Since I
came into the House I have received from<lb/>
the noble lord the Governor-General of Canada<lb/>
(Lord Monck) a despatch which confirms the agree<lb break="no"/>able reports which had already reached us through<lb/>
the ordinary channels of intelligence. He informs<lb/>
me that he had received a telegraphic despatch from<lb/>
Mr. Burnley, at Washington, to this effect:—'The<lb/>
Secretary of State informs me that his government<lb/>
intends to withdraw the notice for the abrogation of<lb/>
the Treaty of 1817 (cheers), and the passport system<lb/>
will cease immediately.' (Renewed cheers.) Sir, I<lb/>
refer to that announcement with feelings of the great<lb break="no"/>est pleasure: and now I trust we may proceed to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss the important practical question which is before<lb/>
us in no spirit of panic, but in that just spirit which<lb/>
becomes the consideration of what is due to the hon<lb break="no"/>our and interests of our country, and which has char<lb break="no"/>acterized the mode in which the proposal has been<lb/>
considered by the house. (Hear, hear.) Because you<lb/>
are on friendly terms with the American Government,<lb/>
because you hope that the friendly spirit which ani<lb break="no"/>mates you is reciprocated by them, and because you<lb/>
are confident that two might nations of one blood,<lb/>
one origin and one language are united by ties which<lb/>
should forever forbid the possibility of bloodshed be<lb break="no"/>tween them,—those considerations do not render it<lb/>
the less necessary that you should temperately consi<lb break="no"/>der the nature of your defences, and that you should<lb/>
be dependent for your safety only upon the power of<lb/>
your own country."</p>
            <p>Lord Palmerston also says:</p>
            <p>"Many gentlemen have argued this question
as if<lb/>
there was a general impression and belief that war<lb/>
with the United States was imminent, and that this<lb/>
proposal of ours was for the purpose of meeting a sud<lb break="no"/>den danger which we apprehended to be hanging over<lb/>
us. Now, I think there is no danger of war with<lb/>
America. Nothing that has recently passed indicated<lb/>
any hostile disposition on the part of the United States<lb/>
towards us, and, therefore, I do not base this mo<lb break="no"/>tion on the ground that we expect war to take place<lb/>
between this country and America.</p>
            <p>The view taken by British statesmen must be<lb/>
felt to be perfectly correct by every dispassionate<lb/>
man—that it was necessary for the United States,<lb/>
in view of raids across the frontier, the capture of<lb/>
steamers, the robbing of banks, the burning of<lb/>
hotels, to take some precautionary measures for<lb/>
self-protection, which should not be considered in<lb break="no"/>dications of hosilities with Britain.</p>
            <p>It has been argued that we are so small a
ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, that we should endeavour to unite with<lb/>
some larger country, in order to enlarge our scope<lb/>
for action. I cannot understand why people who<lb/>
enjoy all the privileges, rights, and immunities of<lb/>
the British Empire, should desire to form any<lb/>
other connection in order that they may have<lb/>
greater room and scope. I cannot see how<lb/>
any connection that we can form with other<lb/>
territoy can increase the relative conjunctions<lb/>
of Nova Scotia to the British Empire.</p>
            <p>Turn to the American States, and contrast
the size<lb/>
of Nova Scotia with some States there, and form<lb/>
which we have heard no talk of forming any<lb/>
Union with any other state, in order to increase<lb/>
their importance in the "Union." There are the<lb/>
            <cb/>
               States of New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode
Island,<lb/>
Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusettes, Mary<lb break="no"/>land, &amp;c.—all very much smaller in area than<lb/>
Nova Scotia, and yet from these we hear of no<lb/>
Union being formed among them, in order that<lb/>
the citizens may have more area or room for<lb/>
development. NovaScotia contains 20,436 square<lb/>
miles ; New Hampshire 9,280 ; Vermont 9,056 ; <lb/>
Connecticut 4,730 ; Massachusetts, that occupies <lb/>
so conspicuous a position in the American nation,<lb/>
7,800. Yet Nova Scotia, that our statesmen look<lb/>
down upon with contempt, is larger than any<lb/>
two other States I have named ; and where we<lb/>
find the Americans perfectly satisfied with the<lb/>
proportions these States occupy in the American<lb/>
nation, we should, also, be content, that whilst<lb/>
we are Nova Scotians we are, at the same time,<lb/>
citizens of the British Empire, with all the room<lb/>
and scope which it afford for development.</p>
            <p>Again it is contended we have not
population<lb/>
sufficient to give us an importance. Whist those<lb/>
who advocate Confederation, have not shown<lb/>
that the scheme will of itself increase our popu<lb break="no"/>lation, 
               they seem to forget that our Province is<lb/>
very much younger than those American States<lb/>
with whose condition they contrast ours. All we<lb/>
require is a little time, as our growthis more rapid<lb/>
now than theirs. I have examined the census<lb/>
returns of eighteen States from Maine Southward,<lb/>
and the average rate of increase for ten years is<lb/>
16 7-10, while the increase of Nova Scotia in the<lb/>
same period was 19 9-10, so that if those gentle<lb break="no"/>men will have a little patience, our population<lb/>
will become sufficiently numerous.</p>
            <p>It seems, however, the determination of
the Prov. <lb/>
Secretary; that we shall not remain in our pres<lb break="no"/>ent happy and prosperous condition, that nothin<lb/>
short of a Union with some other province will<lb/>
satisfy him. When last year he introduced his<lb/>
resolution for a convention to consider the Union<lb/>
of the Maritime provinces, but little importance<lb/>
was attached to it,  as it was not likely to lead to any<lb/>
practical result ; but when it became known that<lb/>
the convention had arranged a Union of the<lb/>
whole British North American Colonies, and<lb/>
when the terms of the proposed Union were made<lb/>
public, the province was convulsed from the centre to<lb/>
circumference ; men at once set about petitioning <lb/>
this Legislature, and but for the opinion which<lb/>
got abroad that the Delegates had abandoned the<lb/>
scheme, your table would have been covered with<lb/>
petitions. So strong was public opinion found to<lb/>
be against the Quebec arrangement, that the Pro.<lb/>
Secretary has not had the courage and the manli<lb break="no"/>ness to carry it out, although bound in all faith<lb/>
to the other Provinces to make the attempt. When<lb/>
I consider the position of our delegates, I am re<lb break="no"/>minded of the fable of the fellows who sold a<lb/>
"bearskin" before they had killed the bear which<lb/>
so happily illustrates the case that I shall trouble<lb/>
the House with it.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Five fellows, needing funds and bold,</l>
               <l rendition="tccd:textIndent">A bearskin to a furrier sold,</l>
               <l>Of which the bear was living still,</l>

               <l>Four of the friends sprung up a tree:</l>

            </lg>
            <p>Now our dealers not finding Sir Bear
disposed<lb/>
to quietly part with his skin have determined to<lb/>
get him into a trap. They seek by this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion on the table for another convention to en<lb break="no"/>trap Nova Scotia into the scheme as arranged at<lb/>
Quebec. My hon. friend from Richmond is cor<lb break="no"/>rect in stating that they have not other object in <lb/>
view, and I shall ask the House to follow me<lb/>
while I consider the constitution prepared for us<lb/>
at that Quebec conference.</p>
            <p>We are told by the Provincial Secretary of
the <lb/>
government they proposed to constitute a Defer<lb break="no"/>ation of British North America. And it appears<lb/>
to me that in the very outset, in the second reso<lb break="no"/>lution of this report, they have given the evidence<lb/>
which shows that this Federal Union cannot be<lb/>
stable under the circumstances. They allude there<lb/>
to the "diversity of the interests of the several<lb/>
Provinces."</p>
            <p>The fact that the interests of the
Provinces are<lb/>
so diversified that each has its own interest, and<lb/>
its centre of interest within itself—precluded the<lb/>
possibility of a Federal Union being formed to<lb/>
work harmoniously. Under present regulations<lb/>
our seperate interests are not brought into<lb/>
             <cb/>
               antagonism—why then should we bring about<lb/>
a change which will make the interests of the <lb/>
several Provinces clash and destroy that harmony<lb/>
of feeling that is existing among these Colonies?<lb/>
The hon. member for South Colchester, read to<lb/>
you from Judge Story, that when Provinces<lb/>
unite they make mutual sacrifices and concessions<lb/>
in order to obtain some great purpose. One pur<lb break="no"/>pose for which they would make that sacrifice <lb/>
would be, that they might obtain mutual<lb/>
aid. In this case there would not be that<lb/>
influence at work in order to induce us to<lb/>
consent to a sacrifice of our interests—an attack<lb/>
upon one is under present regulation an attack upon<lb/>
all—besides we have now the protection of Eng<lb break="no"/>land—we have the command of her armies. She<lb/>
has told us that her honour demands that she<lb/>
should protect her Colonies. Therefore, while<lb/>
they are loyal, no necessity exists why we should<lb/>
make such sacrifices as is prposed. And if the<lb/>
necessity be not apparent the people will not sub<lb break="no"/>mit to them.</p>
            <p>I come now to another branch of the subject—<lb/>
the nature of the representation. We have to have <lb/>
local governments, and a General Government<lb/>
over all. In that General Government, Nova<lb/>
Scotia is to have a representation of 19 out of 194.<lb/>
Now the Provincial Secretary tells us that this is<lb/>
as much as we have any right to expect accord<lb break="no"/>ing to our population, and he stated that if these<lb/>
terms were not just, we had only the delegates to<lb/>
blame. I contend, in view of the geographical<lb/>
position of Nova Scotia—800 miles may form the<lb/>
capital, and almost an island—that the principle<lb/>
of representation by population was not at all<lb/>
sufficient to do her justice. You don't ive to the <lb/>
city of Halifax a representation proportioned to<lb/>
the population because you feel that by the<lb/>
Parliament meeting here, influences can be<lb/>
brought to bear upon it that compensates for a less<lb/>
representation. As you recede from the place of<lb/>
the meeting of Parliament, representation should<lb/>
increase in order to give a balance of influence.—<lb/>
The city of London, with a population of nearly<lb/>
3,000,000—one-tenth of the Empire—has only<lb/>
16 representatives. If you adopted the principle<lb/>
in question, she ought to have one-tenth of the <lb/>
whole number in Parliament. The reason why it<lb/>
is not carried out, is the Parliament meets there,<lb/>
and that the influence given the city thereby, is<lb/>
sufficient for her. On examination of a table pre<lb break="no"/>pared in 1859, I find that as you recede from the <lb/>
place of meeting of Parliament—the proportion of<lb/>
representatives of counties to the population in<lb break="no"/>creases. The Counties of Middlesex, Surrey and<lb/>
Kent (exclusive of London) with a population of<lb/>
3,185,424 have 43 members ; one to every 74,074<lb/>
of the population ; in the extreme North, Cumber<lb break="no"/>land, Northumberland, and Durham, with a <lb/>
population of 890.059 have 29 members ; one to <lb/>
30,691 of population. On the extreme South, <lb/>
Cromwell, Devon and Dorset, having a population<lb/>
of 1,106,863 returns 50 members ; one to 22,137<lb/>
of population ; on the extreme west, Anglesea,<lb/>
Cameron and Denbigh have 237,780 population<lb/>
and 7 members. And so should there be an in<lb break="no"/>crease here, because the great distance from

<fw type="num">254</fw>
<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>wa will
prevent us from exercising any influence<lb/>
upon the Government there, other than is given us<lb/>
by our representation. The influences of the in<lb break="no"/>terests of a country like ours (almost an island)<lb/>
are necessarily confined within her lines, and<lb/>
when the legislation for our interests is placed<lb/>
in a parliament beyond our borders we should<lb/>
have an increase of numbers in representation to<lb/>
compensate for the entire want of local influences.</p>

            <p>But the Provincial Secretary tells us that
we <lb/>
have a large representation in the Legislative<lb/>
Council which fully compensates us for the want<lb/>
of representation in the Assembly. My. George<lb/>
Brown, arguing that question, said that the com<lb break="no"/>plaint had been made that they had given us too<lb/>
large a representation in the Upper House ; but<lb/>
he says "in the Lower House, Canada shall<lb/>
hold the purse strings." You will further remem<lb break="no"/>ber that all the Lowor Provinces combined have<lb/>
only 24 members in the Legislative Council, <lb/>
whilst united Canada has 48. But whatever dif<lb break="no"/>ferences of opinion may have hitherto existed<lb/>
between Upper and Lower Canada, there is no<lb/>
doubt you will find them as one when their in<lb break="no"/>terests come in collision with those of the Lower <lb/>
Provinces. When a man and wife quarrel,<lb/>
and a third party steps in, they both unite against<lb/>
him. Upper and Lower Canada may have dis<lb break="no"/>putes at times toom but whenever the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces come in, they will unite as one Province<lb/>
against us. The Provincial Secretary tells us<lb/>
that if our Representatives band together, they <lb/>
can exercise an influence which will make them<lb/>
sufficiently felt in the Canadian Parliament, and <lb/>
referred in illustration of his argument to the <lb/>
influence that the members of Cape Breton exer<lb break="no"/>cise here ; but he did not tell us that these form<lb/>
a much larger proportion to the whole number<lb/>
in this House than would the Representatives<lb/>
from Nova Scotia exhibit in a Parliement of 194<lb/>
at Ottawa. But suppose they did band together<lb/>
to make their influence felt in that Parliament.<lb/>
Now, I ask the hon. Prov. Sec'y. to consider the <lb/>
position in which he places this Province and her <lb/>
Representatives. I cannot conceive a more de<lb break="no"/>graded, a more humiliating position that the Re<lb break="no"/>presentatives of a spirited people compelled to forego<lb/>
their political opinions—their conscientious convic<lb break="no"/>tions on all public questions, in order to obtain for<lb/>
their people a considereatio nin the distribution of<lb/>
the funds. But even supposing our 19 Represen<lb break="no"/>tatives could so far forget themselves as to turn<lb/>
political hucksters, and offer to sell themselves,<lb/>
body and sould, they will never obtain more than<lb/>
a few pickings from the public chest, which we<lb/>
shall do more than our share in filling. Under<lb/>
any circumstances, however, humiliating, we shall<lb/>
be powerless to enforce a just consideration of<lb/>
interests. There is a beautiful work of art, re<lb break="no"/>presenting two hounds chained together by the<lb/>
neck—one is large and powerful, looking down<lb/>
with contempt and indifference upon his lesser<lb/>
companion, who is as beautiful i nthe formation<lb/>
of limb, apparently as swift to follow the game, <lb/>
and as keen of scent as the other, yet crouches,<lb/>
overawed and helpless. Often as I have looked<lb/>
upon that work, I have felt an impulse rising<lb/>
            <cb/> within me
to strike the chain from the little fel<lb break="no"/>lows neck, and let him free. And ever since this<lb/>
Confederation scheme has been published—every<lb/>
time I have looked upon a miniature copy
of that<lb/>
work, I have thought of Confederation. I
have<lb/>
seen in it Nova Scotia, bound and chained
by the<lb/>
neck to Canada, and thinkingof my country<lb/>
thus helpless, powerless, and prostrate at
Ottawa,<lb/>
with a Representation of only nineteen in
a Par<lb break="no"/>liament of 194, the exclamation rises from
my<lb/>
heart—"God help the little fellow." Around<lb/>
me sit the men to whom the constituencies
of<lb/>
Nova Scotia entrusted her Constitutional
rights<lb/>
—her interests and wlefare—to whom she, for<lb/>
four years, bared her neck—is there—can
there be<lb/>
one among us who will help to fasten upon
that<lb/>
neck, this chain, prepared by the
delegates? No, <lb/>
let us rather keep sacred that trust—let
us rather<lb/>
go back to the people, and learn of them
at the <lb/>
polls their wished on this great question,
lest in<lb/>
after years, they have just reason to
execrate our<lb/>
memories—lest they pray Heaven to strike
palsied<lb/>
every hand that touched to fasten a rivet
of that <lb/>
chain. 
            </p>

            <p>I come now to the finanical terms of this scheme<lb/>
of Union. The delegates have adopted at Quebec<lb/>
a scale, and arranged the debt of the Provinces<lb/>
pretty much as they did representation, upon a <lb/>
plan of population irrespective of the incomes<lb/>
which the Provinces possessed. It seems to me <lb/>
at the very outset, the hon. delegates laid down<lb/>
the wrong principle, instead of arranging the<lb/>
debt according to population ; they should have<lb/>
looked at the incomes—at the revenues, and<lb/>
funds, what each had in the treasury. If any<lb/>
gentleman should propose to form a partnership<lb/>
with another on Granville street, what is the first<lb/>
question that is asked? The amount of his in<lb break="no"/>come—not how many persons are to enter the<lb/>
partnership. Taking it upon this ground, little<lb/>
Nova Soctia, as represented by these gentlemen,<lb/>
has not received justice. Canada is allowed to<lb/>
come into the Confederation with a debt of $62,<lb break="no"/>500,000, Nova Scotia with one of $8,000,000.<lb/>
Now, in the year in which this arrangement was<lb/>
made, the income of Canada was $5,884,594—<lb/>
whilst that of Nova Scotia was $861,989—in both<lb/>
cases derived from Customes and Excise. Accord<lb break="no"/>ing to that income of Canada, as compared with<lb/>
that of Nova Scotia, she should have only been<lb/>
entitled to come in with a debt of $54,000,000.<lb/>
But the hon. gentlemen should not have taken<lb/>
the present income only into consideration. They<lb/>
should have considered that under Confederation<lb/>
we shall be placed on the same tariff, and there<lb break="no"/>fore they should have looked to the effect of this<lb/>
increase of tariff. It has been ascertained by close<lb/>
calculation, that under the Canadian tariff, Nova<lb/>
Scotia's revenue would have been $1,330,514.<lb/>
Taking it upon this basis, if we were allowed only<lb/>
8 millions, Canada should have only $35,452,507,<lb/>
or reversing it, if Canada is allowed $62,500,000,<lb/>
NovaScotia should have been alowed $14,107,330.<lb/>
By adopting the principle of income, instead of<lb/>
population, it would have given us over six mil<lb break="no"/>lions more than we are actually to receive under<lb/>
this agreement.</p>

            <p>But we have not received justice in respect<lb/>
to the quality of the debt. Very nearly the<lb/>
whole of the debt of Nova Scotia has been
cre<lb break="no"/>ated by the construction of the Railway,
and we<lb/>
have been told time and again by those
dele<lb break="no"/>gates, that as soon as we get our railway
sys<lb break="no"/>tem completed, our road will be a paying<lb/>
property, and in reality be no debt at
all. It is<lb/>
very different with the debt of Canada. In
an<lb break="no"/>swer to a question put by the hon. member
for<lb/>
Halifax, the hon. Prov. Secy. laid on the
table<lb/>
a financial statement, containing the
debt, in<lb break="no"/>come, &amp;c., of Canada, issued by Mr.
Galt. At<lb/>
the dinner given last autumn to the
Canadian<lb/>
delegates, the hon. Prov. Secy. told us
Mr. <lb/>
Galt had the power of making a deficit of
a <lb/>
million apear a surplus of the amount.<lb/>
I must confess, looking at the paper
before me,<lb/>
there is a great deal of truth in that
remark.—<lb/>
In this balance-sheet we find the whole
liabili<lb break="no"/>ties of Canada are put down at
$176,223,066.65.<lb/>
This, however, is so balanced, even to the
last<lb/>
five cents, that we are almost led to
believe<lb/>
that Canada in reality does not owe a
dollar.<lb/>
But on an examination, I find to make that
ba<lb break="no"/>lance they have put down at cost and
accumu<lb break="no"/>lated interest all the public buildings,
bridges,<lb/>
roads, harbors, lighthouses, canals,
railroads,<lb/>
&amp;c., of the country. Now, if we were
to put a <lb/>
valuation upon all onr roads and bridges,
our<lb/>
public buoldings, Chubenacadie and St.
Peter's<lb/>
Canals, Arisaig Pier, Parsboro Snag, and
simi<lb break="no"/>lar property, we should far overbalance
all our<lb/>
indebtedness, without touching the
railroads.<lb/>
I have examined the financial returns of
Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, to see the actual net income of the
pro<lb break="no"/>perty claimed in this balance-sheet, and I
find<lb/>
the net income from over seventy millions<lb/>
of it is only $471,461, which represents <lb/>
a capital of less than eight millions, <lb/>
leaving about 62,000,000 dollars from which<lb/>
no available profits are derived. The
princi<lb break="no"/>pal sources from which any income is
derived<lb/>
is from the Canals and Municipalities, We<lb/>
have the Railways put down for loans and
in<lb break="no"/>terests unpaid at something like
$30,000,000. It<lb/>
will be perhaps in the knowledge of the
House<lb/>
that in 1857 the Grand Trunk Company came<lb/>
to the Canadian Parliament and said: We
can<lb break="no"/>not proceed further, and we wish you to
give<lb/>
up your claim on out lines—just as the
Shube<lb break="no"/>nacadie Canal people asked us to give up
our<lb/>
lien on the undertaking. The Legislature,
in<lb break="no"/>stead of giving up the claim entirely,
consented<lb/>
to give up the first lien and allow new
share<lb break="no"/>holders to come in,— the province, then,
to hold<lb/>
the third position. In consequence of this
ar<lb break="no"/>rangement, no interest is paid, and the
accu<lb break="no"/>mulation is now $9,642,000. Anybody who<lb/>
knows anything of the management of these<lb/>
great public companies will perceive, that
<lb/>
after working expenses and the interest to
the <lb/>
first two sets of bondholders are paid,
the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment will never receive a cent of
interest<lb/>
upon its loan. Again, there is the
Municipal <lb/>
Loan Fund debt, amounting in principal and<lb/>
interest ot $12,890,837—very much of which<lb/>
has been fruitful of the greatest possible
po<lb break="no"/>litical corruption, and will never prove an<lb/>
available asset. Some of the municipalities<lb/>
have borrowed nearly $300 per head of the<lb/>
population or interest. The town of Port
Hope, <lb/>
with a population of 4,160, borrowed
$740,000,<lb/>
and had arrears of interest Dec. 31st,
1861, of<lb/>
$312,303. The town of Niagara, with 2,070
in<lb break="no"/><cb/>habitants, borrowed $280,000, and owed for<lb/>
interests $148,974. I hold in my hand a list of <lb/>
seven municipal cities, conatining 40,600 in<lb break="no"/>habitants, who have received from this fund<lb/>
$5,594,400, and owed as arrears of interest<lb/>
Dec. 31st, 1861, $2,359,406—together nearly<lb/>
eight million dollars—the amount Nova Scotia<lb/>
is to be permitted to owe on going into Con<lb break="no"/>federation.</p>
            <p>It is therefore evident that very little can be<lb/>
counted upon from the municipalities. It is to<lb/>
be supposed, however, that there is in this ba<lb break="no"/>lance sheet some property that is profitable. <lb/>
The whole amount of the liabilities are put<lb/>
down at $76,223,061. They claim funds imme<lb break="no"/>diately available to reduce this to $67,500,000,<lb/>
five millions more than Canada is to enter the<lb/>
Confederation with. This five millions the lo<lb break="no"/>cal government of Canada are to assume,—<lb/>
but with the debt are to have the property re<lb break="no"/>presented by it. Hon. George Brown, speak<lb break="no"/>ing of this arrangement, says very disticntly,—<lb/>
and there is a clause in the report of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates authorizing it—that the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments of Upper and Lower Canada are to take<lb/>
this available property—as an offset to the<lb/>
debts that they are called upon to assume.<lb/>
Now it is not reasonable to assume that Upper<lb/>
and Lower Canada, whose public men are so<lb/>
astute, will take liabilities that have no income.<lb/>
They will select the best they can.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName>—They have no power to <lb/>
make the selection.</p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:MCLE4">Mr. MCLELAN</persName>—I will read, in corroboration<lb/>
of my statement, the 58th clause of the consti<lb break="no"/>tution,—"All assets connected with such por<lb break="no"/>tions of the public debt of any Provinces as are<lb/>
assumed by the local governments, shall also<lb/>
belong to those governments respectively."<lb/>
These local governments will not assume any<lb/>
debt unless there is an asset connected with it.<lb/>
I will also tell you what hon. George Brown of<lb/>
Canada says:—</p>
            <p>"But Mr. Speaker, I am told that the ar<lb break="no"/>rangement as the debt is unfair—that we<lb/>
have thrown on the Federal exchequer the<lb/>
whole of the debts of the Maritime Provinces,<lb/>
and only a portion of the debt of Canada. There<lb/>
is not a particple of force in this objection. The<lb/>
whole debt of Canada is $67,500,000, but five<lb/>
millions of this is due to our own people, to<lb/>
meet which there are certain local funds. Now<lb/>
if we had thrown the whole $67,500,000 on the <lb/>
Federal treasury, we must also have handed<lb/>
over to it the local revenues which, so far as<lb/>
these five millions are concerned, would have<lb/>
been precisely the same thing. But as regards<lb/>
the public debt with thich the Federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment would start, it would not have been the<lb/>
same thing. By restricting the debt of Canada<lb/>
to $62,500,000, we restricted the debt of the Ma<lb break="no"/>ritime Provinces to the same proportion on $25<lb/>
per head of their population; but had we thrown<lb/>
our whole debt of sixty-seven and a half mil<lb break="no"/>lions on the Confederation, the proportion must<lb/>
have been increased, and the whole debt very<lb/>
greatly augmented."</p>
            <p>The hon. delegates cry "Hear, hear," but I<lb/>
believe every gentleman present hears enough<lb/>
to convince him that the Canadians are to take<lb/>
five millions worth of available property with<lb/>
the debts they are to assume, leaving the ba<lb break="no"/>lance, $62,500,000, comparatively worthless.</p>

to me to be any question on this point. The<lb/>
very fact that Canada has to resort to a stamp<lb/>
act in order to raise funds, was sufficient proof<lb/>
to me that they had run to the full extent they<lb/>
could in the imposition of duties. If there be<lb/>
any one mode of raising taxes that is more ob<lb break="no"/>noxious 
               to the people then another, it is a<lb/>
stamp duty—a stamp tax on every note, bill,<lb/>
receipt, or paper. We are told that there will<lb/>
not be a very large increase of duty, because<lb/>
Canada admits many articles duty free. I<lb/>
have been to some trouble in turning to the re<lb break="no"/>turns of articles imported by Canada, and I<lb/>
find the result of the examination to be that<lb/>
the whole amount of imports for 1863 amoun<lb break="no"/>ted to $45,964,000. Now we are told $23,000,000, or<lb/>
or one-half, are free goods, and that since<lb/>
Canada has so many free goods, the conse<lb break="no"/>quence is, that running the tariff over the<lb/>
whole, she has a lower scale than Nova Scotia,<lb/>
In order to arrive at the incorrectness of this<lb/>
assertion, you must look at the nature of her<lb/>
importations, and see what those free goods<lb/>
are made up of. I find articles under the<lb/>
Reciprocity treaty $12,330,000. Of course these<lb/>
are free goods there as here, and would con<lb break="no"/>tinue to be so under Confederation. Again,<lb/>
coin and bullion is put down, although in Nova <lb/>
Scotia it is never called an import; but when<lb break="no"/>ever a Bank gets in a qualty of money, in<lb/>
Canada, it is placed among the Imports; the <lb/>
amount given is $4,652,287. I find down for<lb/>
books $455, 941. Again, the vehicles and car<lb break="no"/>riages of travellers crossing the lines to see<lb/>
their friends are down at $104,585. Again<lb/>
gravel and clay are among their imports; clo<lb break="no"/>thing and army and other stores for mili<lb break="no"/>tary and naval purposes, nearly a million<lb/>
more. Therefore you see that they put down<lb/>
among their imports articles which were never<lb/>
dreamed of here. The amount of these arti<lb break="no"/>cles I have enumerated as free here, or which <lb/>
we do not call an import, is $22,516,223.</p> 
            <p>There being in all their free goods only
half<lb/>
a million which would pay duty under our
ta-<lb/>
riff. Add this to the amount of goods
paying<lb/>
duty under their own, and the whole imports<lb/>
of dutiable goods will only amount to
$23,448,-<lb/>
270, being $9.35 per head of population,
from<lb/>
which would be collected $2.40 by their
tariff,<lb/>
making it over 25 per cent; whilst our
imports,<lb/>
deducting free goods and articles
re-exported,<lb/>
amounted to $5,360,106—being $16.20 to each<lb/>
inhabitant yielding $2. 53 per head in
duty,<lb/>
equivalent to 15 3-5 per cent tariff. It
has been<lb/>
asserted on some occasion that under Confe-<lb/>
deration we will not necessarily be called
upon<lb/>
to come under this high Canadian tariff.
Now<lb/>
I claim that under the arrangements of this<lb/>
confederation the new expenses involved
will<lb/>
necessitate an increase of tariff. We find
in<lb/>
the report a number of new servies which
in-<lb/>
volve new expenses. First, there is the
inter-<lb/>
est on the Intercolonial railway $707,000
a year.<lb/>
Then we have the expenses of the civil
govern-<lb/>
ment $540,000; the legislative charges
$630,000.<lb/>
In 1863 Canda, with a less number of repre-<lb/>
sentatives than is proposed to be given in
the <lb/><lb/>
general government, the expenses were
$627,-<lb/>
373. At the the same rate the expenses for
the<lb/>
large government would be $850,000; but the<lb/>
delegates have put the amount down at
$630,<lb break="no"/><cb/>000. Then
it is proposed to give on million<lb/>
for militia, which would be about $500,000 ad<lb break="no"/>ditional. The public works and buildings put<lb/>
down at $400,000. Then there is an additional<lb/>
sum given to Canada for local purposes. She<lb/>
retains her local revenues, $1,297,043, and re<lb break="no"/>ceives a subsidy of $2,006,121, being a total of<lb/>
$3,303,164; while the average sum she has had<lb/>
in four years was $2,021,979—which gives her<lb/>
an increase of $1,281,185. In the same way<lb/>
there is an increase in local expenses to P. E.<lb/>
Island of $61,712, and to Newfoundland $124,<lb break="no"/>000. Add to all these for interest on additional<lb/>
dedt allowed Nova Scotia and New Brunswick<lb/>
$215,000 and you have a total of new charges<lb/>
upon the confederated colonies of $4,458,897.<lb/>
From this may be deducted reduction in local<lb/>
services in Nova Scotia $297.000, and in New<lb/>
Brunswick $71,047—together $350,047—leaving<lb/>
the new expenditures $4,108,850. Now the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian tariff of 25 per cent average on all duti<lb break="no"/>able goods applied to the Maritime Provinces<lb/>
will realized a part of this sum. Nova Scotia, <lb/>
it has been ascertained by calculation, will pay<lb/>
additional $468,525; New Brunswick estmated<lb/>
to pay $200,000; Newfoundland and P. E. Is<lb break="no"/>land $300,000—in all $968,525, which will still<lb/>
leave, after we are all placed under the Canadi<lb break="no"/>an tariff, $3,140,335 to be provided by a furtehr<lb/>
increase of taxation. Now suppose we only pay<lb/>
one-tenth of this, #3,140,335 it will make, added<lb/>
what we shall pay, under the present Canadian<lb/>
tariff, an addition to our present annual taxa<lb break="no"/>tion of $782,560, for the benfit of the Ottawa<lb/>
Government. Whilst those who have addres<lb break="no"/>sed the house more particularly on the local<lb/>
expenses, have shown that we shall have to<lb/>
raise by direct taxation a large sum to meet<lb/>
the wants of roads, bridges, education, and<lb/>
other services, I may here remark that Nova <lb/>
Scotia has now the largest sum of any of the<lb/>
Colonies for local purposes per head $1.96, but<lb/>
under the Quebec arrangement will have the <lb/>
least—$1.12¼.</p>

</p>
            <p>But it is not disparagement to Canada to be<lb/>
thus exceeded by Nova Scotia. consider the <lb/>
difference in our resources. I have spoken of<lb/>
the size of our Province—its area, but Nova <lb/>
Scotia should be measured for its cubic con<lb break="no"/>tents, and the measurers rod should also be run<lb/>
out three miles to sea—our fishing grounds<lb/>
are a part and parcel of Nova Scotia, as much<lb/>
as the field which the farmer cultivates—for<lb/>
all round the thousand miles of our sea coast<lb/>
we draw a perpetual harvest, provided by the<lb/>
waters of the world. For agriculture we have<lb/>
lands on both sides of the Bay of Fundy,<lb/>
unsurpassed—yielding produce of the high<lb break="no"/>est class, whilst the districts represented<lb/>
by the hon. member for Kings furnish fruit fit<lb/>
for the palate of Royalty itself. Looking down<lb break="no"/>ward, we have mines of gold and iron, whose<lb/>
wealth, as yet, is almost untouchedm but which<lb/>
is being graudally developed in coal. We are<lb/>
richer than the richest. Examine the geolo<lb break="no"/>gical map of Nova Scotia hanging in our <lb/>
library, and you see almost every part, not<lb/>
occupied by gold and iron, marked by coal<lb/>
measures. And who shall estimate the wealth<lb/>
of these mines, or the influence which Nova<lb/>
Scotia shall, through their possession, have<lb/>
upon the world. As bearing upon the value <lb/>
of our coal fields, let me read to the house an <lb/>
extract from an article by the Professor of <lb/>
Natural History, in the University of Glas<lb break="no"/>gow:—</p>
               
            <p rendition="simple:centre">THE POWER REPRESENTED BY COAL</p>

            <p>"Interesting and impressive comparisons
have been<lb/>
instituted between the mechanical force of a given<lb/>
weight of coal applied as fuel in the steam-engine and<lb/>
the dynamic energy of a man. The human labourer<lb/>
exerting his strength upon a tread-mill,—a very eco<lb break="no"/>nomical mode of using it,—can, it be stated, lift his<lb/>
own weight,—we will say 150 lb.,—through a height<lb/>
of 10,000 feet per day, the equivalent of which is 1 lb.<lb/>
raised 1,500,000 feet in the same time. Now, the me<lb break="no"/>chanical virtue of fuel is best estimated by learning<lb/>
the number of pounds which a given quantity—let it <lb/>
be one bushel—will elevate to a given height, say one<lb/>
foot, against gravity. Applied in the steam-engine,<lb/>
this performance of the bushel measure of coal is call<lb break="no"/>ed its duty. In some improved modern Cornish en<lb break="no"/>gines, this duty,—the bushel's work,—is equivalent to<lb/>
the amazing result of raising 125,000,000 lb. one foot

<cb/>
high, or 1 lb. 125,000,000 feet hight.
Now, as there are<lb/>
84 lb. of coal in one bushel, this divisor 84, gives 1 lb.<lb/>
as equal to 1,488,000, or nearly oen million and a half<lb/>
of feet, which, as we have seen above, is just the re<lb break="no"/>sult of a man's toil for one day upon a tread-mill.—<lb/>
Thus, a pound of good coal is in
reality worth a day's<lb/>
wages. If, again, we estimate a lifetime of hard,<lb/>
muscular toil at twenty years, and portion three hun<lb break="no"/>dred working days to each year,—a full allowance,—<lb/>
we have for a man's total dynamic effort, six thousand<lb/>
days. But 6000 lb. constitute only three tons, so that <lb/>
we have arrived at the almost amusing fact, the cheer<lb break="no"/>ing truth, that every three tons of coal in the earth is<lb/>
the convertible equivalent of one man's life-long mus<lb break="no"/>cular activity.</p>
            <p>What a promise is here of the capacity of
civilized<lb/>
inventive man to find an ample substitute for the life-<lb break="yes"/>
wearing, brutalizing and mind-benumbing expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of nerve and animal power exacted now of the<lb/>
slaves of all complexions.
What a pledge has the all-<lb break="yes"/>
bountiful and good Creator here given us, that the<lb/>
common lot of mankind is not to be, as always in the <lb/>
past, a lot of physical labor, but in the long future,<lb/>
at least one of a far higher, happier mode of effort.<lb/>
When I behold a section or block from out of a coal<lb/>
seam, and reflect that each cubic yard is in weight<lb/>
somewhat more than a ton; and that a column of it a<lb/>
yard in base and only three yards tall has more work<lb/>
in it than a man, more mechanical energy than any<lb/>
force which willing effort, necessity, or the lash of the<lb/>
tyrant master, can exact from the human organiza<lb break="no"/>tion, I exult in the reverential thought of the super<lb break="no"/>abundant provision bequeathed to our race against<lb/>
the curse of over-physical toil in this marvellous con<lb break="no"/>densation of mechanical strength. Looking at the<lb/>
tall column of the material, thirty-seven feet high,<lb/>
representing a coal-bed in Nova Scotia, displayed in<lb/>
the recent great exhibition on London, I said to my<lb break="no"/>self, here is a black man, of the strength of some four<lb/>
of the stoutest dark-skinned men ever held in serf<lb break="no"/>dom, and see what a willing service, what a painless<lb/>
bondage it can be made to undergo. This, our inani<lb break="no"/>mate slave, can be compelled to work at any rate of<lb/>
gentleness or speed we choose. We can induce him <lb/>
to lengthen out his efforts for almost any term of <lb/>
years, or bid him convert himself into a herculean<lb/>
giant, concentrating the total force of four able-bodied<lb/>
men, spread over twenty years of life, and applying<lb/>
the whole of it in some titanic triumph against brute<lb/>
matter within a week or even a day.</p>
            <p>Here it may be worth our while to turn
from our<lb/>
giant man of all work, and
take the census of those<lb/>
populations of this sort which rest sleeping beneath<lb/>
the groun, but are ever ready, under the magic sum<lb break="no"/>mons of a little art, to muster at the surface in any<lb/>
strength and await our bidding. Every acre of a coal<lb/>
seam, only four feet in thickness, and yelding one<lb/>
yard depth of pure fuel, will produce, if fitly minded<lb/>
about 5000 tons—equivalent to the life-labor of more<lb/>
then 1600 strong men. Every square mile of such coal-<lb break="yes"/>
bed contains about 3,000,000 tones of fuel. and repre<lb break="no"/>sents one million of men labouring steadily through<lb/>
twenty years of their ripest vigour."</p>
            <p>Here is a view presented to us in which <lb/>
the mind becomes absolutely lost in the maze<lb/>
of fogures required to represent the value of our<lb/>
great coal fields, and when we take in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with them all our other resources we<lb/>
have a country to whose attainments in<lb/>
wealth and prosperity, there is no reasonable<lb/>
limit. It is not so in a country like Canada,<lb/>
largely agricultural, when its lands are settled<lb/>
and the farms established, the extent of its<lb/>
prosperity is nearly attained. It is not extent<lb/>
of territory that renders a country great or <lb/>
wealthy, it is not material size that goves to <lb/>
any object its value. The diamond that spar<lb break="no"/>kles on beauty's brown, though it may scarcely<lb/>
equal in size or rival in brilliancy the eye that<lb/>
beams beneath it, yet in the markets of the <lb/>
world it would purchase an Island or a Moun<lb break="no"/>tain of rock. And so is it with our little gem<lb/>
of a Province it may be less in territory<lb/>
than other countries, it may indeed be over<lb break="no"/>shadowed 
               by the gigantic and colossal pro<lb break="no"/><pb n="258" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1865-04-17_Page_258.jpg"/>

statesmanship.</p>


            <p>I have spoken of our prosperity—of the in<lb break="no"/>come from the various branches of industry—<lb/>
the extent of our fisheries, and the value
of<lb/>
our mines; and it may be claimed that one
of <lb/>
the advantages that will arise from this
Union<lb/>
will be the development of these
resources, by<lb/>
giving us extended trade and commerce. We <lb/>
have heard a great deal of the powers of
par<lb break="no"/>liament, of legislative enactments, but
there is<lb/>
one thing that is almost beyond the
control of<lb/>
such enactments—that is, the divergence of<lb/>
trade from its natural channels.  We have<lb/>
had in fish, coal, and those articles which<lb/>
are our chief products, free trade with
the <lb/>
other colonies, and what has been enlarged?<lb/>
If you turn to the imports of Canada—to<lb/>
the free goods—you will see the result.
Nova<lb/>
Scotia, which, from her natual position<lb/>
and resources, is especially prepared to
sup<lb break="no"/>ply upon very advantageous terms, gypsum, <lb/>
coal, fish, and stone,— to what extent
would <lb/>
you suppose Nova Scotia supplies Canda<lb/>
with these? I find the total import of coal<lb/>
into Canda is estimad at $936,239, and of<lb/>
this amount Great Britain supplies
$379,703,<lb/>
and the United States, to which we export<lb/>
largely, $548,846, leaving the total
amount im<lb break="no"/>ported from the Province of Nova Scotia
into<lb/>
Canada, where it goes as free as air, only<lb/>
$7,690. Again, take the article of gypsum.<lb/>
Even six times more of this article is
imported<lb/>
from the United States than from the
British<lb/>
American Colonies. Again, of fish, which we<lb/>
export so largely to the United States,
Canada<lb/>
only recieved from  the whole British
North <lb/>
American Colonies to the value of $226,573,<lb/>
while she gets from the United States,
$281,023.<lb/>
We export stone, in abundance, to the
United <lb/>
States, but not a dollar's worth to
Canada. I <lb/>
have enumerated these articles to show
that,<lb/>
having in them free trade among these colo<lb break="no"/>nies, we send but a small value of them to
the<lb/>
colonies with which it is proposed to
confede<lb break="no"/>rate us.</p>
            <p>It had been urged that as this is a
Maritime<lb/>
Colony, Confederation would open up a valu<lb break="no"/>able field of commerce to our shippin. It is
absurd to suppose that confederation would<lb/>
give us any advantages we do not now enjoy,<lb/>
or that our shipping interest can depend for<lb/>
employment upon a country whose waters are <lb/>
closed for five months of the year. Nearly<lb/>
the whole trade of Canada is supplied by the <lb/>
accidents of commerce; that is, when a vessel<lb/>
cannot get a charter she would like, and being <lb/>
perhaps in a coal port, she takes a cargo of coal<lb/>
to Canada, and returns with lumber to some<lb/>
other port where she finds more profitable em<lb break="no"/>ployment. And it is by accidents arising like<lb/>
this, in various ports, the whole wants of the<lb/>
trade of Canada are supplied. It is an entire<lb/>
fallacy to say that by opening the whole trade<lb/>
of these colonies, we should receive great ad<lb break="no"/>vantages in Nova Scotia. Confederation, in<lb break="no"/>stead of extending the commerce and deve<lb break="no"/>loping the natual products of this country,<lb/>
will rather cripple trade. I have already<lb/>
shown that Confederation must necessarily<lb/>
impose upon us a very heavy tariff and ex<lb break="no"/>ceedingly large burthens. The consequences<lb/>
of that is, to increase the coast of living and<lb/>
producing the articles of export, and when<lb/>
you increase the coast of living and of wages,<lb/>
you are unable to compete with other countries<lb/>
in the sale of your coal and fish, and other<lb/>
articles which Nova Scotia is especially calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to produce. It is claimed again that we<lb/>
shall get the Inetrcolonial Railway by Con<lb break="no"/>federation.</p>
            <p>The Provincial Secretary told us we got it on<lb/>
terms never dreamed of. I have looked on <lb/>
these terms and summarized them, just as the<lb/>
hon. member for South Clochester did the in<lb break="no"/>dications of war, and the conslusion I have<lb/>
come to is, that the Provincial Secretary was<lb/>
right in his expression. 1st. We surrender the<lb/>
entire control of the constitution of this country.<lb/>
2nd. We endanger the harmony existing <lb/>
amoung us as fellow-colonists by bringing our<lb/>
diverse interests into conflict. 3rd. We reduce <lb/>
our local expenditures for roads and bridges to a<lb/>
large amount, or supply that deficiency by direct<lb/>
taxation. 4th. We subject ourselves to the annoy<lb break="no"/>ance and tax of the stamp act. 5th. We surren<lb break="no"/>der to Canada the power to tax us to any extent<lb/>
that their extravagance may render necessary;<lb/>
and which I have shown you will be in the<lb/>
outset $782,560. 6th. We must pay our propor<lb break="no"/>tion of all expenses entered into by the general <lb/>
government. I have shown you some of the<lb/>
new expenses which are incident on the first<lb/>
formation of this government; but it is not to<lb/>
be supposed that the engagements entered <lb/>
into by the general government will rest here.<lb/>
We have been told that one of the conditions<lb/>
upon which the Canadians agreed to build the<lb/>
intercolonial railway was that they should<lb/>
have western extension and enlargement of<lb/>
their canals. You will understand that the<lb/>
Canadians find that their canals are not an<lb break="no"/>swering their anticipation. The returns of<lb/>
1864 show that there has been a large decrease<lb/>
in the earning of the Welland and St. Law<lb break="no"/>rence canals. In the Welland there is a de<lb break="no"/>crease of 12 3/4 per cent., and in the St. Lawrence<lb/>
canals 33 per cent. In the report of the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Public Work he says, to make<lb/>
them remunerative they must be enlarged to<lb/>
allow the passage of vessels 800 to 850 tons<lb/>
burthen; which will require an enormous ex<lb break="no"/>penditure, as they have now a depth of water <lb/>
of only about nine feet deep. Now, the en<lb break="no"/>largement of these canals, and the opening up<lb/>

            of the north-west, were the conditions in
con<lb break="no"/>nection with the construction of the
intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial railway. Mr. Brown in his speech gives<lb/>
the Canadians the strongest possible
assurance<lb/>
of this, he says:</p>

            <p>"But this question of immigration
naturally brings<lb/>
me to the subject of the great
Northwestern terri<lb break="no"/>tories. [Hear, hear.] The resolutions
before us recog<lb break="no"/>nize the immediate necessity of those vast
territories<lb/>
being brought within the Confederation and
opened<lb/>
up for settlement. But I am told that
while the Inter-<lb break="yes"/>
colonial Railroad has been made an
absolute condi<lb break="no"/>tion of the compact, the opening up of the
Great West<lb/>
and enlargement of our canals have been
left in doubt.<lb/>
Now, sir, nothing can be more unjust than
this. Let<lb/>
me read the resolutions:—</p>



            <p>"The General Government shall secure,
without de<lb break="no"/>lay, the completion of the Intercolonial
Railway from<lb/>
Riviere du Loup, through New Brunswick, to
Truro<lb/>
in Nova Scotia.</p>



            <p>"The Communications with the North-western
Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, and the improvements required for
the deve<lb break="no"/>lopment of the reade of the Great West
with the sea<lb break="no"/>board, are regarded by this Conference as
subjects of<lb/>
the highest importance to the Federal
Provinces, and<lb/>
shall be prosecuted at the earliest
possible period that<lb/>
the state of the finances will permit."</p>


            <p>The Confederation is, therefore, clearly
committed<lb/>
to the carrying out of both these
enterprises. . . . .<lb/>
But honourable gentlemen lay stress upon
the point<lb/>
that, while the one enterprise is to be
undertaken at<lb/>
once, the other is not to be commenced
until the state<lb/>
of the finance will permit. No doubt this
is correct,<lb/>
and the reason for it is simply this—the
money has<lb/>
already been found for the Intercolonial
Railway.<lb/>
They must be well aware that the late
Government<lb/>
(the Macdonald-Sitcotte Administration)
agreed to <lb/>
build the Intercolonial Railway, and
obtained from<lb/>
the Imperial Government a guarantee of the
deben<lb break="no"/>tures for building it—so that money is
ready at a very<lb/>
low rate of interest, whenever required.
We know<lb/>
where to find money for one enterprise at
a rate we<lb/>
are able to bear, and can thus go on with
a work which <lb/>
must be gone on with if this union is to
be consummated.<lb/>
but we don't know this of the other great
work—and <lb/>
we all felt that it would be exceedinly
indiscreet—I, <lb/>
myself, as the special advocate of opening
up the <lb/>
Great West and of the enlargement of our
canals, felt<lb/>
that I could not put my name to a document
which<lb/>
declared that all hazards, while our five
per cent.de<lb break="no"/>bentures were quoted at 75 or 80 per cent.
in the money<lb/>
markets—we would commence at once, without
an <lb/>
hour's delay, any great public work
whatever. [Hear, <lb/>
hear.] Honourable gentlemen opposite must
not ima<lb break="no"/>gine that they have to do with a set of
tricksters in<lb/>
the thirty-three gentlemen who composed
that Con<lb break="no"/>ference. What we have said in our
resolutions was<lb/>
deliberately adopted, in the honest sense
of the words<lb/>
employed, and not for purposes of
deception. Both<lb/>
works are to go on at the earliest
possible moment our<lb/>
finances will permit, and honourable
gentlemen will<lb/>
find the members of the Cabinet from Lower
Canada,<lb/>
as well as from Upper Canada, actuated by
the same<lb/>
hearty desire to have this whole scheme
carried out<lb/>
in its fair meaning.</p>

            <p>Stress may be laid on the term, "as <lb/>
soon as the finances will permit"; but we<lb/>
know the great anxiety on the part of
Canada<lb/>
to have this expensive work accomplished,<lb/>
and that as soon as they have the power in<lb/>
their hands to carry out their wishes they
will <lb/>
go on with the work.</p>

            <p>It has been claimed, also, on behalf of
this<lb/>
shceme, that it would add to the defence of<lb/>
these colonies. Perhaps there is no one
asser<lb break="no"/>tion which the advocates of confederation
have<lb/>
made that has gained them more supporters<lb/>
than this. There is something in it that
cap<lb break="no"/>tivates every man's mine and carried him<lb/>
almost away despite himself. It finds a
res<lb break="no"/>ponse in every heart that feels the
attachements<lb/>
of home. And it was wrong, it was cruel, on<lb/>
the part of the advocates to thus make an
ap<lb break="no"/>peal to one of the noblest sentiments that
find<lb/>
            <cb/>
               a home in the breast of man—that sentiment<lb/>
which bids us rise to defend the country in<lb/>
which God has placed us—to protect the<lb/>
homes we have secured by His blessing, and<lb/>
guard the altars we have erected to His wor<lb break="no"/>ship,—without having such facts as would <lb/>
sustain the hops excited by the assertions.</p>
            <p>What is the Provincial Secretary's argument?<lb/>
That Confederation will give us more men and <lb/>
money to affect this great object. That we shall<lb/>
have 4000,000, instead of 350,000 people to de<lb break="no"/>fend us. He does not, however, say that with an<lb/>
increase of men comes an increase of duty that<lb/>
they would have to perform. If it gavve us the<lb/>
four millions entirely for the defence of this<lb/>
province then his asserion would be sus<lb break="no"/>tained, but when every man that goes into Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation brings with him the particular spot which<lb/>
he feels most anxious to defend, in case of in<lb break="no"/>vasion, then Confederation does not give us more<lb/>
men or money. Besides it places the control of<lb/>
our defences under a poer that is situated 800<lb/>
miles away from us. We are told by the hon/<lb/>
member from South Colohester that the tempta<lb break="no"/>tion to invade this Province is greater than to in<lb break="no"/>vade any other—its value is consequence of its<lb/>
position and resources being greater. Admitting<lb/>
this to be the case, is it not unwise to give the con<lb break="no"/>trol of the natural defenses of this country—the<lb/>
men who are to defend their homes—to a power<lb/>
situated 800 miles away, and who will feel it more<lb/>
to their individual interest to call them away to<lb/>
protect Canada. It has been said that the fate of <lb/>
Canada is our own. That may be, but I regard the<lb/>
safety of Nova Scotia as more essential to the<lb/>
maintenance of our connection with the British<lb/>
Empire than is that of any other of the British <lb/>
Colonies. I answer, Nova Scotia is the keystone <lb/>
to the whole—when she falls, the whole follow.—<lb/>
Great changes have taken place of late years in<lb/>
the character of the navies of the world. Steam<lb/>
has taken the place of wind as the potive power<lb/>
rendering the ships more effective but more de<lb break="no"/>pendent upon their base of supply. We have<lb/>
here the power—the coal—which must be re<lb break="no"/>gularly supplied to the British fleet from our<lb/>
mines, in case of hostilities on this side the At<lb break="no"/>lantic. And if this base of supply should fall into <lb/>
the hands of an enemy, then the whole nave of<lb/>
England would be powerless for the protection of<lb/>
these Colonies, and must leave them to their fate.<lb/>
How essential, then, is it that local influences in<lb/>
Canada shall not have the power to call away our<lb/>
natural protectors to defend less important terri<lb break="no"/>tory.</p>
            <p>The Prov. Sec. says we are as unprotected and<lb/>
helpless as the crawling worm.</p>
            <p>I was amazed beyond measure, to hear such an<lb/>
expression fall from an hon. gentleman occupying<lb/>
a position which gives to his declarations an of<lb break="no"/>ficial character. Had I occupied his position,<lb/>
rather than have stood at the table of this House,<lb/>
declaring that a portion of the British Em<lb break="no"/>pire "are as unprotected as the crawling worm"<lb/>
I'd have crawled down under the table.</p>
            <p>A crawling worm are we? Well, what does he<lb/>
make of us under Confederation? I waited in<lb/>
anxiety expecting to see the "worm" swell and<lb/>

            "develope its proportions," and
eventually be<lb break="no"/>come a terrible dragon that would "gobble
up"<lb/>
the American Eagle, and still hunger for
more.—<lb/>
But, alas ! he only made the worm longer.
He<lb/>
only lengthened it out until it become a
tape<lb/>
worm. He run it through circumlocation
offices<lb/>
800 miles away until it became a worm of
that<lb/>
"red tape" species, which so nearly proved
the <lb/>
destruction of the Birtish army on the
outbreak<lb/>
of the Crimean War. Our main protection
lies in<lb/>
the power of Britain, but the evident
tendency of<lb/>
this Ottawa arrangement is separation from
Eng<lb break="no"/>land. Our minds naturally follow the
channels<lb/>
of authority up to the source, and when we
have<lb/>
reached that source, out ideas centre
about it, and<lb/>
it becomes the embodiement of our
nationality.—<lb/>
We have hitherto looked to England, and
have<lb/>
run up through the various channels to the
<lb/>
Crown, and there our affections have
centred ; <lb/>
but this Confederation comes in and
proposes a <lb/>
new order of things. It proposes that we
shall<lb/>
have local governments, and that the
source of our<lb/>
authority shall be at Ottawa. And when our<lb/>
thoughts and affections are turned toward
that,—<lb/>
provided the various and divers interests
of the<lb/>
several provinces, will enable us to live
in har<lb break="no"/>mony,—the effect will be that our
affections<lb/>
will cling round that government, and
shall be<lb/>
withdrawn from the Crown of England.
Suppose<lb/>
that five or six American states imagined that<lb/>
separately they were too small, and accordingly<lb/>
proposed to form a special Confederation under the<lb/>
General Government just as these gentlemen pro<lb break="no"/>pose with us to form a Government at Ottawa.</p>
            <p>Does not every man see that before ten
years<lb/>
had expired, the feeling of the people
would be<lb/>
around that smaller Confederation, and in
an<lb break="no"/>tagonism to the larger. And so would it be
in the <lb/>
event of Confederation, with the other B.
A. Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.—Therefore, I believe, instead of
diminish<lb break="no"/>ing it would only increase our danger, and
render<lb/>
us an easy prey to an invader. Suppose we
should<lb/>
become an independent nationality, we
would then,<lb/>
indeed, be helpless as the crawling worms,
and <lb/>
the American Eagle would soon make a "Diet
of<lb/>
Worms" that would have a different
interpreta<lb break="no"/>tation in American history from the "Diet
of<lb/>
Worms" in European history. Lord
Palmerston,<lb/>
referring to the subject, says :—</p>



            <p>"Sir, it is true that the only danger
which a<lb/>
smaller colonial State runs from a more
powerful and<lb/>
larger neighbour arises from quarrels that
may exist<lb/>
between the mother country and the foreign
State?<lb/>
I say that is a total fallacy  Suppose
these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces separated from this country—suppose
them<lb/>
erected into a monarchy, a republic, or
any other<lb/>
form of Government. Are there not motives
that<lb/>
might lead a stronger neighbour to pick a
quarrel<lb/>
with that smaller State with a view to its
annexa<lb break="no"/>tion? (Hear, hear.) Is there nothing like
terri<lb break="no"/>torial ambition prevading the policy of
great mili<lb break="no"/>tary States? The example of the world
should teach<lb/>
us that as far as the danger of invasion
and an<lb break="no"/>nexation is concerned, that danger would
be in<lb break="no"/>creased to Canada by a separation from
Great<lb/>
Britain, and when she is deprived of the
protection<lb/>
that the military power and resources of
this coun<lb break="no"/>try may afford. (Cheers.)</p>
            <p>The question of defence, in my view,
depends to a<lb/>
           large extent, upon the spirit of those who
are called<lb/>
upon to defend the country. If you elevate
the<lb/>
country and its institutions, the people
will be<lb/>
prepared to defend it with greater spirit,
We<lb/>
have seen in history the effect of
rendering a<lb/>
people dissatisfied with the country in
which they<lb/>
lived. One of the great grievances of the
people<lb/>
of Ireland, is that they have not had
since the<lb/>
Union with England, control of their own
affairs—<lb/>
that they have not sufficient
representation in the <lb/>
British Parliament, to give them their due
influ<lb break="no"/>ence ; and see what an exodus there is of
her<lb/>
people. The last census of the United
States re<lb break="no"/>turns 1,611,304, of the citizens of the
Union as<lb/>
born in Ireland, where the whole
population is <lb/>
only five and three quarter millions,
while the<lb/>
the same returns give only 431,692 persons
born<lb/>
in England, where the population is twenty
mil<lb break="no"/>lions.</p>
            <p>If then you desire to have the hearty
co-opera<lb break="no"/>tion of our people in the defence of this country,<lb/>
you should not deprive them of the control which<lb/>
they now exercise, over the constitution and insti<lb break="no"/>tutions of their country. Neither must you make<lb/>
them feel that they are pressed down by taxes.<lb/>
If you impose upon them burthens beyond what<lb/>
they consider just—and over which
they can exer<lb break="no"/>cise no control—then the spirit to defend their<lb/>
country vanishes. Lord Bacon, reminds us that <lb/>
the blessing given to Judah and Issachar are never<lb/>
found combined in the same individual, not in the<lb/>
same people. Judah was to have the spirit of the<lb/>
lion—to place his hand upon his enemy's neck.</p>


            <p>But Issachar was to bow himself to pay
tribute<lb/>
—to become like "the Ass crouching between
two<lb/>
burdens." And no matter how spirited a<lb/>
people are ; whenever these burdens are
placed<lb/>
upon them they will change. Did the hon.
Pro.<lb/>
Sec., suppose when he made this Quebec
bargain,<lb/>
that the men around these benches are the
Repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the lineal descendants of
Issachar.<lb/>
That we are such consummate asses, as to
bow<lb/>
down and allow him to fix and saddle upon
us<lb/>
forever the ass's burthen. This people have<lb/>
shown that they have a spirit to defend
their <lb/>
country and its interests. Little Nova
Scotia has<lb/>
given several names to history, and we
have erec<lb break="no"/>ted a monument to the memory of some of
those<lb/>
who have thus shown themselves worthy of a
noble<lb/>
ancestry. Every time I pass that monument I<lb/>
feel my step grow firmer and prouder with
the<lb/>
thought, that the spirit which influenced
these<lb/>
men, still lives in the bosoms of the
people of Nova<lb/>
Scotia. That it animates the stalwart
militia men<lb/>
of this Province, "whose arms were moulded
in<lb/>
their mothers wombs, to drive the invader
from<lb/>
our soil ;" but take away from these the
control<lb/>
of their representative institutions, and
impose<lb/>
upon them such burthens as I believe you
are<lb/>
going to place upon them by this
Confederation,<lb/>
and you drive out that spirit, and they
will be<lb break="no"/>come as useless for defence, as a
battalion of dried<lb/>
mummies from the catacombs of Egypt.</p>
            <p>The Provincial Secretary tells us that
Confede<lb break="no"/>ration will give us influence and position. He<lb/>
asks where was Nova Soctia, when the Reciprocity<lb/>
Treaty was passed. Was not Nova Scotia present<lb/>

in her Legislature at its ratification.
But I ask<lb/>
where will Nova Scotia be, when the whole
power is<lb/>
placed in the hands of Canadians, to
barter away<lb/>
her interests whenever it may suit them.
One of<lb/>
the conditions most prized by the American
peo<lb break="no"/>ple in effecting that treaty, is the right
to our <lb/>
fisheries. Now with Canada's anxiety for
the con<lb break="no"/>tinuance of that treaty, what regard will
she have<lb/>
for the particular interests of Nova
Scotia when,<lb/>
as I have already shown you, we shall be
power<lb break="no"/>less at Ottawa, so far as our
representation is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, Again he asks where was New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, when a slice was cut off her, and
given to<lb/>
Maine?  I reply she was just in the
position that <lb/>
Nova Scotia was, when a piece was taken
from<lb/>
her territory and handed over to New
Brunswick—<lb/>
in the hands of those who did not regard
her in<lb break="no"/>terests. There is, however, this difference—the<lb/>
"slice" we lost went to a sister colony,
which is<lb/>
some satisfcation, but not equal to what I
have, <lb/>
no doubt the Pro. Secy. felt, in getting
rid of a <lb/>
number of voters of the wrong political
stripe.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p>The hon. gentleman who wants to know who
is not<lb/>
humilated, when he finds that Canada is only men<lb break="no"/>tioned in the debates concerning these Provinces,<lb/>
in the British Parliament. I rather take it as a <lb/>
compliment, that Canada has alone been men<lb break="no"/>tioned. The Government of England have had<lb/>
no cause of complaint against Nova Scotia, on the<lb/>
ground of nnwillingness to make
preparation for<lb/>
her defence, but she had a reason for
dissatisfac<lb break="no"/>tion with Canada. We have also heard of the<lb/>
Grand Trunk Railway, and of the
transactions<lb/>
connected with it, which have given Canada
a<lb/>
reputation, I am glad to say, Nova Scotia
does<lb/>
not possess. Notoriety is not necessarily
fame.<lb/>
There may be a celebrity that does not
carry with<lb/>
it any weight of resepctability. The
Siamese<lb/>
Twins became celebrated—but it was for
their<lb/>
unnatural connexion ; and shall have a
chance<lb/>
of becoming celebrated, as being in our
geographi<lb break="no"/>cal position, a string of Siamese Twins.
When<lb/>
the Union with New Brunswick was discussed<lb/>
here last session, I made a calculation of
the pro<lb break="no"/>portionate size of the strips of land
connecting us<lb/>
with New Brunswick to the Provinces, as
com<lb break="no"/>pared with the proportion of the ligature
connec<lb break="no"/>ting Chang and Eng. to their whole size,
and<lb/>
found that our ligature is very mush
proportion<lb break="no"/>ately less. In their case you have two
men, per<lb break="no"/>fect in all their formation, that their
powers of free action<lb/>
and usefulness are destroyed. In this case
each<lb/>
province is a perfect geographical
formation of <lb/>
itself, having its own centre of interest,
its own<lb/>
heart within itself. If it were possible
to take the<lb/>
Siamese Twins, and reform them, and make
of <lb/>
the two one powerful man, the one heart
then,<lb/>
unfettered and freem he would be effective
to dis<lb break="no"/>charge the duties of life. And just so if
you<lb/>
could remould these Colonies by a
Confederation<lb/>
and bring them into compact shape, so that
there<lb/>
should be one common centre of interest—one<lb/>
heart from which the life blood sustaining
the<lb/>
whole should flow to the extremeties and
return, <lb/>
then would the Union commend itself to my
mind ;
               <cb/>
            and I should wish it "God speed." This is
an<lb/>
impossibility, and therefore we should be
content<lb/>
as are brothers who are not "Siamese Twins"<lb/>
each having and exercisign his
individuality ; but<lb/>
all united by the bonds of family
affection. Let<lb/>
us then be content to go on prospering as
we have,<lb/>
and at the same time cultivating the ties
of bro<lb break="no"/>therhood with the other Colonies, and
above all,<lb/>
let us not take a step that will tend to
sever our<lb/>
connection with England. My strong desire
is<lb/>
to see this connection continued, that
through out<lb/>
lives we may glory in the grandeur and
greatness<lb/>
of the British Empire, and leave behind us
those<lb/>
who shall inherit the same feelings of
loyal at<lb break="no"/>tachments to her Crown and Institutions,
that the<lb/>
same sentiments may bind together the
people of <lb/>
these colonies. Every heart beating in
unison—<lb/>
even as one great heart—when waked by the<lb/>
strains of "Rule Rrittania" and "God Save
the <lb/>
Queen."</p>

make any lengthened speech, but will merely<lb/>

before<lb/>

expres<lb break="no"/>sion to a few practical ideas in reference
to <lb/>
this great question, which have been
passing<lb/>
through my mind. In the first place, I may<lb/>
remark that ever since the commencement of<lb/>
the American Union, or rather ever since
the<lb/>
adoption of the present consitution, the
lead<lb break="no"/>ing minds connected with the Colonies have<lb/>
turned their attention to the subject of a
Colo<lb break="no"/>nial Union. It was not to be wondered at
that<lb/>
when they saw the great prosperity<lb/>
resulting from that Union under the
American<lb/>
constitution, they should deem similar
benefits<lb/>
might flow from the adoption of a similar<lb/>
course in British North America. Among the<lb/>
earliest who approached this subject was
Chief<lb/>
Justice Sewell, who was one of the
prominent<lb/>
men of Canada, and who wrote upon the ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Again and again the subject was
brought<lb/>
forward, but it was left to Lord Durham to<lb/>
give it greater prominence in his
celebrated<lb/>
report. That nobleman come to this
continent<lb/>
clothed with the highest powers, and on a
mis<lb break="no"/>sion of the greatest importance,—that of
quiet<lb break="no"/>ing, if possible, the disturbances of
Canada.<lb/>
He saw the isolated condition of these
Colonies,<lb/>
and contrasted them with the strength and
pow<lb break="no"/>er of the U. States, and he felt and
expressed<lb/>
the necessity of a Union. I have often
regret<lb break="no"/>ted that advantage had not been taken of
that<lb/>
opportunity to have consolidated the whole
of<lb/>
British America, not merely to unite Upper<lb/>
and Lower Canada. At that time the Colonies<lb/>
were in a different position from what they<lb/>
are now. Then we were subject to the fiat
of <lb/>
the Colonial Secretary, and an act of
Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment could easily have been obtained at the<lb/>
time Lord Durham returned to England, and<lb/>
would have been received as law by all. His<lb/>
Lordship, however, was too much imbued with<lb/>
Republican ideas, and I am not sure that he<lb/>
would have arranged his plan upon the <lb/>
monarchial principles, which, I am happy to<lb/>
say, pervades the scheme which was adopted<lb/>
at Quebec.</p>


            <p>From the time of Lord Durham down to the<lb/>
present, we have had in every colony, from<lb/>
time to time, statesmen who have brought
the<lb/>

               subject of union before the public, who have 
               <lb/>
               talked of and dreamed about it, who have 
               <lb/>
               desired it as one of the greatest boons, but 
               <lb/>
               who felt that such were the difficulties in the 
               <lb/>
               way no plan could be possibly agreed upon 
               <lb/>
               that would approach to a satisfactory adjust<lb break="no"/>ment. All thought it would sometime or other 
               <lb/>
               be accomplished, but none that the time for its 
               <lb/>
               discussion was at hand or that a solution of its 
               <lb/>
               difficulties was practicable. We hoped that a 
               <lb/>
               period would arrive when the leading minds 
               <lb/>
               of the different provinces might agree upon 
               <lb/>
               some feasible plan, but we hardly dared to ex<lb break="no"/>pect that it would be in our time. And yet 
               <lb/>
               now, strange to say, when the difficulties have 
               <lb/>
               been removed, when the leaders of the differ<lb break="no"/>ent parties in all the different colonies have 
               <lb/>
               united upon common ground, and the time has 
               <lb/>
               come for us to obtain that which we have so 
               <lb/>
               long desired, there are found those among us 
               <lb/>
               who are unwilling to accept it! 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
               That there would be doubts and hesitancies <lb/>
at first is what might be expected; but we did 
               <lb/>
               not think there would be a movement made to 
               <lb/>
               reject the whole scheme. The difficulty in 
               <lb/>
               such cases has always been with the minor 
               <lb/>
               states, and the hon. member for South Col<lb break="no"/>chester detailed to us the otherday some of 
               <lb/>
               the perplexities which occurred in the different 
               <lb/>
               States of the American Union before the con<lb break="no"/>stitution was finally accepted. Especially was 
               <lb/>
               it unpalatable to those who thought their posi<lb break="no"/>tion and influence would be sacrificed. And is 
               <lb/>
               not this the feeling which prevails with us at 
               <lb/>
               present? Are not small local jealousies at the 
               <lb/>
               bottom of most of the objections? The colony 
               <lb/>
               which is most hostile now is the small Island 
               <lb/>
               of Prince Edward. The State which most 
               <lb/>
               stoutly refused to accept the constitution then 
               <lb/>
               was little Rhode Island. But has Rhode Is<lb break="no"/>land ever had reason to regret her ultimate 
               <lb/>
               acceptance? No, she has had her rights preser<lb break="no"/>ved intact in the two branches of congress and 
               <lb/>
               has prospered together with her Sister States, 
               <lb/>
               and far more than she could have done, 
               <lb/>
               had she determinedly held out for isolation. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>

            
            
            <p>
               But what are the advantages which we ex<lb break="no"/>pect to derive from Union? I will give a short 
               <lb/>
               summary of them as they lie in my mind. 
               <lb/>
               They have been so often brought before the 
               <lb/>
               public, both in the press and on the platform, 
               <lb/>
               and recently by speakers in this house, that I 
               <lb/>
               feel I shall but go over ground which has been 
               <lb/>
               already fully occupied. And yet at the risk of 
               <lb/>
               wearying the patience of the house I will again 
               <lb/>
               refer to a few of them.  
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Union we truly believe is strength. We be<lb break="no"/>lieve in the old maxim as a truism." We have 
               <lb/>
               not forgotten the old fable of our boyhood, and 
               <lb/>
               yet in these latter days the old adage has been 
               <lb/>
               called in question, and isolation is lauded 
               <lb/>
               as practically of more value. It some to me to 
               <lb/>
               require no argument to prove that whatever 
               <lb/>
               power or force there may be in isolated frag<lb break="no"/>ments is greatly extended when those frag<lb break="no"/>ments are consolidated into one. And that 
               <lb/>
               power when exerted in self-defence is far more 
               <lb/>
               effectual under the direction of one central au<lb break="no"/>thority, than when exerted by different and of<lb break="no"/>ten conflicting influences. And this brings me 
               <lb/>
               to the next point. Union is defence. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               A few years ago this question would not 
               <lb/>
               probably have been of so much importance as 
               <lb/>
               it is now, indeed it would hardly have been 
               <lb/>
               thought of. At the time of the visit of the 
               <lb/>
               Prince of Wales, and when he passed so tri<lb break="no"/>umphantly through these Provinces, and the 
               <lb/>
               United States, what was the position of the 
               <lb/>
               neigboring Republic? It was one busy hive of 
               <lb/>
               industry; and the great object of its citizens 
               <lb/>
               was to labor to increase their wealth. Its 
               <lb/>
               military power was trifling. What is its posi<lb break="no"/>tion now? It has become one of the greatest 
               <lb/>
               military nations in the world, and that too 
               <lb/>
               upon our frontier. While we remain more 
               <lb/>
               isolated settlements, this great nation is in a 
               <lb/>
               position to successfully attack us. If we can 
               <lb/>
               do anything, then, to protect ourselves, surely 
               <lb/>
               we ought to lose no timein doing so. If Union 
               <lb/>
               is one of the best means towards warding off 
               <lb/>
               an adversary, as we maintain it is, then let us 
               <lb/>
               adopt it. Now, I am far from being an alarm<lb break="no"/>ist. I believe the American Government has 
               <lb/>
               had the most friendly feelings towards these 
               <lb/>
               Colonies. The late President, to whose untime<lb break="no"/>ly end we referred recently with such deep sym<lb break="no"/>pathy, was, I am convinced, sincerely desirous 
               <lb/>
               of preserving peace between England and 
               <lb/>
               America, and the Governments of the different 
               <lb/>
               Provinces have always had the most amicable 
               <lb/>
               relations with that of the United Sates during 
               <lb/>
               all the perplexities of the terrible civil war 
               <lb/>
               now existing. But I am not insensible to the 
               <lb/>
               fact that democratic governments are frequent<lb break="no"/>ly obliged to give up their own convictions 
               <lb/>
               and bow to the will of the people; and there<lb break="no"/>fore I look with deep interest to the sentiments 
               <lb/>
               expressed by the journals and leading minds 
               <lb/>
               among our neighbors, and I cannot disguise 
               <lb/>
               from myself that there has been far from a 
               <lb/>
               friendly feeling manifested towards England 
               <lb/>
               in quarters where it was least expected. I do 
               <lb/>
               not refer so much to the New York Herald, and 
               <lb/>
               papers of that stamp, as to the expressed opi<lb break="no"/>nions of men of standing and intelligence. 
               <lb/>
               The other dayI lighted upon a letter of Pro— 
               <lb/>
               fessor Parson's, Professor of Law at the Har<lb break="no"/>vard University, published a month or two 
               <lb/>
               since, that surprised me not a little, and serves 
               <lb/>
               to show the views entertained by some men, 
               <lb/>
               at least, in high position, in New England. 
               <lb/>
               From it I cull the following extract. He says: 
          
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               "I have not the slightest hesitation in expressing 
               <lb/>
               my Opinion that the conduct of England, relative to 
               <lb/>
               the Trent, was insolence carried to the last extreme; 
               <lb/>
               wasa. great insult to this country as well a great 
               <lb/>
               Wrong: and stained the name of England, in history, 
               <lb/>
               with disgrace. The thought is now in men's minds, 
               <lb/>
               that when our turn comes, we will imitate her exam<lb break="no"/>ple. That we will, so far as the different circumstan<lb break="no"/>ces permit, use her own words and her own methods, 
               <lb/>
               and with an equal peremptoriness and a similar threat 
               <lb/>
               of immediate war and a refusal ofdclay or negotiation, 
               <lb/>
               force her into immediate choice between compliance 
               <lb/>
               or war. And if we would follow her example, we 
               <lb/>
               must do just this; neither more or less. Most earnest<lb break="no"/>ly do I deprecate any such thought, any such act.— 
               <lb/>
But in my opinion the only way in which it can be 
               <lb/>
               prevente is to press upon our people the truth. For 
               <lb/>
               the lover of peace to forget the conduct of England or 
               <lb/>
               to defend it, is equally impossible. But our nee le 
               <lb/>
               may see that her conduct was not only so wrong id 
               <lb/>
               but so discreditable, that they may determine to avoi 
               <lb/>
               what they would be ashamed to imitate." 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               I have found this letter in "Littell's Living 
               <lb/>
               Age," of February last, but I was glad to per<lb break="no"/>ceive that the editor of that .eriodical did not 
               <lb/>
               concur in all its views, and hope that there 
               <lb/>
               may to a large number of the population 
               <lb/>
               agreeing with him, and that the danger antici<lb break="no"/>pated may never come. Still, with the publi<lb break="no"/>cation and circulation of such views, it is but 
               <lb/>
               right that we should remember that they bear 
               <lb/>
               uopn the question of defence in these colo<lb break="no"/>nies. We know the old adage, that in peace

            we  should prepare for war, and I believe
that<lb/>
one of the best preparations is that of uniting<lb/>
ourselves to meet any contingency. <lb/>
But it has been said, will union give us one<lb/>
soldier more? It may not; but it will place<lb/>
out military resources under one head, and<lb/>
the force of the whole union could be concen<lb break="no"/>trated and moved with a celerity and in bodies<lb/>
which could not take place if we remain isola<lb break="no"/>ted. It has been said that our men, in case of<lb/>
war, will be required in Canada to defend its<lb/>
exposed frontier. It seems to me, however, <lb/>
that the reverse would be the case, and I agree<lb/>
with the member for South Colchester, that in<lb/>
the contingency of war, the maritime colonies<lb/>
would most probably be the first point of<lb/>
attack. This was the case in the time of the<lb/>
old French war; it was not until Louisburg<lb/>
had fallen that the campaign against Canada<lb/>
had commenced, and this would most probably<lb/>
be the case again. I may refer, in connection<lb/>
with this subject, to the unanimous resolution<lb/>
of this house to place the entire militia of the <lb/>
province at the disposal of the province of<lb/>
New Brunswick at the period when the fron<lb break="no"/>tier of the latter was threatened by the State<lb/>
of Maine. Had there been an union of the <lb/>
colonies it would not have been necessary to <lb/>
await the action of the legislature, the central<lb/>
power would at once have detailed to the <lb/>
threatened point whatever number of men<lb/>
was required for defence.</p>
            <p>Again, Union in my mind means a closer<lb/>
connection with England. We see this from<lb/>
the tone of the publice journals, from the<lb/>
speeches in Parliament, and more particularly<lb/>
from the important despatch of Mr. Cardwell<lb/>
which has been so widely circulated. We<lb/>
could not please the British Government or<lb/>
people between, we could not more readily incduce<lb/>
them to assist us, as they promise to do, by the<lb/>
whole resources of the mother country, than<lb/>
by adopting the scheme of the union. But it<lb/>
has been asserted that we need not trouble<lb/>
ourselves about Canada for the power of Eng<lb break="no"/>land will always protect us in Nova Scotia.<lb/>
Well, suppose we admit this, would we be so<lb/>
pusillanimous as to act upon it? I hardly<lb/>
think any honorable gentleman or his consti<lb break="no"/>tuents would recommend the adoption of such<lb/>
a course. It appears to me that for the weal or for<lb/>
woe these colonies are and must be bound to<lb break="no"/>gether. Again, Union will bring with it large <lb/>
commercial advantages, by breaking down<lb/>
hostile tariffs and introducing free trade and<lb/>
manufactures, Hitherto we have been crippl<lb break="no"/>ed by a want of knowledge and commu<lb break="no"/>nication. If there is one object more than<lb/>
another which Nova Scotians have been long<lb/>
desirous of obtaining it has been this great<lb/>
object. The last scheme in reference to it was<lb/>
one which compelled this Province to pay<lb/>
more than many of us thought it ought to bear,<lb/>
but, nevertheless, the house adopted it, so great<lb/>
were the advantages expected to be realized<lb/>
by it. Now we are offered this railway on <lb/>
terms more advantageous than we had any<lb/>
reason to anticipate, and yet those who have <lb/>
heretofore been so anxious to accomplish so<lb/>
great an object now refuse to accept it, and <lb/>
cast away a boon of priceless value,—a con<lb break="no"/>duct which seems to me to border on infatua<lb break="no"/>tion. Anither result of union will be to afford<lb/>
a field for the energy and industry of our</p>


 
            <p>young men. We have long wanted such open<lb break="no"/>ings for enterprize, and the absence of them<lb/>
has driven away a large portion of the youth<lb/>
of the country. The member for North Col<lb break="no"/>chester spoke most glowingly of the resources<lb/>
and advantages of this Province. Why, I<lb/>
should ask him, have they not been able to in<lb break="no"/>duce the flower of our population to remain<lb/>
within our limits? I have heard it stated that <lb/>
there are no less than 30,000 Nova Scotians<lb/>
within or in the vicinity of the city of Boston.<lb/>
Upon what principles can we account for this?<lb/>
It is because we offer no adequate inducements<lb/>
for our young men to remain. The expa<lb break="no"/>triate themselves in order to enjoy the larger<lb/>
field and better chances of success offered in<lb/>
the United States than here. I often look <lb/>
around in my own city and ask myself how<lb/>
many of those who were educated with me<lb/>
are still to be found within its limits. Many<lb/>
are beneath the green sod; but many are<lb/>
still living, but not here,—they are far away,<lb/>
in the neighboring States and elsewherem push<lb break="no"/>ing their fortunes, and forever lost to us. I ask<lb/>
any person familiar with Halifax to look at the<lb/>
signs over the stores in any of the streets—in<lb/>
Granville street, for instance, and count how<lb/>
many of their occupants are natives of the <lb/>
City. The great majority of our business men<lb/>
are either from abroad or from the country. A<lb/>
short time since I was asked to look at the<lb/>
will of one of our staunch yeomen in the rural<lb/>
districts of this country. In it he had named<lb/>
his several children, and I was surprised to <lb/>
observe—and it is an excellent commentary<lb/>
upon the point—how few there were in Nova <lb/>
Scotia. One son was in California, one in Ne<lb break="no"/>vada, another in Kansas, and a fourth in<lb/>
Massachusetts. All the enterprising and ener<lb break="no"/>getic had carried their talents and industry to<lb/>
places where they could be better remunerated.<lb/>
We have devoted a portion of our public funds<lb/>
to the introduction of immigrants. I would<lb/>
rather, Mr. Speaker, bring back our Nova<lb/>
Scotia exiles than gather all the immigrants<lb/>
we could obtain from abroad, if we only had<lb/>
the inducements to offer them to remain.</p>
            <p>Again, if we had union, we should possess<lb/>
more of a national position than we do at pre<lb break="no"/>sent. Let any Nova Scotian cross the Atlantic<lb/>
and he will soon learn the estimation in which<lb/>
he is held as a Provincial. I recollect an in<lb break="no"/>stance which occurred to myself when travel<lb break="no"/>ling the Continent, and how keenly I felt<lb/>
the different position a Colonist held from that<lb/>
of an American citizen. Notwithstanding the<lb/>
remarks of the hon. member for North Col<lb break="no"/>chester, I am persuaded that our leading men,<lb/>
under the Union, will have their minds en<lb break="no"/>larged and take a higher position as statesmen<lb/>
than they can possibly do in the small and de<lb break="no"/>grading discussion which occupy too much of<lb/>
the time of each Provincial Legislature. Be<lb break="no"/>fore the American Revolution, there was not a<lb/>
single man in the old Colonies who at that<lb/>
time had acquired an European reputation but<lb/>
Franklin. Washington was only known as a <lb/>
Colonel of Militai, Adams was but a village<lb/>
attorney, and the same may be said of Jeffer<lb break="no"/>son, Madison, and other eminent men of the <lb/>
day. They occupied positions such as colonists<lb/>
occupy to-day. When, however, the war was<lb/>
over, and the United States assumed a national<lb/>
character, these men rose to their position, and<lb/>
took high rank in the estimation of the world.<lb/>

<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>solidation, 
               in British America, I am
convinced<lb/>
that the effects produced will not be less
ele<lb break="no"/>vating in our case than in that of the
neigh<lb break="no"/>boring Republic.</p>
            <p>I will now refer shortly to some remarks
up<lb break="no"/>on the disadvantages which we are told will<lb/>
result from the project. First—it is said
that<lb/>
our union means separation from England. I<lb/>
think I have already disposed of this, for
I<lb/>
need only repeat that te whole public mind<lb/>
in the mother country is in favor of the
plan,<lb/>
for the very reason that it will draw
parent<lb/>
and children closer together, to be united
by<lb/>
one common tie. The main objection,
however,<lb/>
which has been brought forward, is one of
a <lb/>
financial character. It is said we have
made a <lb/>
bad bargain—in the language of the hon.
mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Richmond (Mr. LeVesconte) the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary has sold his country to
Ca<lb break="no"/>nada! Well, my answer is, the sale is not
yet<lb/>
perfected for it has still to be ratified.
But is<lb/>
it so bad a bargain? The objections are
two-<lb break="yes"/>
fold—political and financial.
            </p>

            <p>They say we have not a fair represenation<lb/>
in the United Parliament. I ask, what has<lb/>
been conceded to us in the Legislative
Coun<lb break="no"/>cil? We shall have in that body, which I am<lb/>
happy to see is to be purely of a
monarchical<lb/>
character, and whose function will be high<lb/>
and important, greater weight than we were<lb/>
really entitled to. But it is said that
the real<lb/>
power of the Parliament will be in the
House<lb/>
of Assembly, and that there we will not be
ade<lb break="no"/>quately represented. We shall be
represented<lb/>
upon the true principle, that is,
according to <lb/>
our population, and I cannot see how such
an<lb/>
arrangement can be objected to, or what
could<lb/>
be considered more equitable. But the hon.<lb/>
member for North Colchestor would introduce<lb/>
a curious idea in connection with this. He<lb/>
would increade the representation in
propor<lb break="no"/>tion to the distance from the capital. I
think<lb/>
my hon. friend from the county of Cape
Breton<lb/>
would gladly accede to this, as it would
largely<lb/>
increase the influence of his favourite
island.—<lb/>
This idea was illustrated by a reference
to the<lb/>
distribution of the members of Parliament
in<lb/>
England, but the hon. member should have<lb/>
gone further; he should have told us what
re<lb break="no"/>presentation Scotland actually has, and
what <lb/>
she would be entitled to on his principle.
He<lb/>
would find his argument utterly fail him.<lb/>
            </p>
               
            <p>As regards the financial aspect of the bar<lb break="no"/>gain, the matter has been so fully discussed<lb/>
that I do not intend to enter into it further<lb/>
than to say that we have had nu<lb break="no"/>merous statements and calculations dur<lb break="no"/>ing the last few weeks, scarcely one of<lb/>
which agrees with another. The truth is,<lb/>
statements of figures are too often very delu<lb break="no"/>sive, and unless the premises are
scrutinized<lb/>
and found correct the conclusions are
worth<lb break="no"/>less. All that may be said is that though
we<lb/>
shall be required to give up the larger
part of<lb/>
our general revenues we receive a yearly
sub<lb break="no"/>vention sufficient with out local revenue
to<lb/>
provide for our local wants. As regards
the <lb/>
question of increase of tariff we have had
the<lb/>
same wide difference in computation. The<lb/>
hon. member for South Colchester puts it at<lb/>
such an insignificant figure as to make it
a<lb/>
subject of astonishment that any person
should<lb/>
dread its imposition. But even if we were
to<lb/>
take the increase at the largest sum
mentioned,<lb/>
that of a dollar per head, would not the
great<lb/>
benefits to be derived warrant us in
increasing 
<cb/>
               our
burdens even to that extent? But I am<lb/>
not afraid that there will be so great an in<lb break="no"/>crease, and am quite confident that increased<lb/>
prosperity will enable us to meet without diffi<lb break="no"/>culty whatever additional taxation may be<lb/>
required. To the city of Halifax union will be<lb/>
of inestimable advantage. Let any of our ci<lb break="no"/>tizens visit the busy wharves of Boston, or sail<lb/>
into the port of New York by the East River<lb/>
and see the long lines of shipping extending<lb/>
for miles on either hand as he approaches
the<lb/>
Hudson, and then return to Halifax, and how<lb/>
great is the contrast! Now, if we have union<lb/>
and the intercolonial railway my expectation<lb/>
is that so great a contrast will soon be lessened.<lb/>
We need not expect to attain to the eminence<lb/>
of their commercial emporium, but we may<lb/>
hope that the traveller visting us hereafter<lb/>
will find a harbor filled with shipping and busy<lb/>
with trade, and a city whose streets will be<lb/>
thronged with an active and prosperous popu<lb break="no"/>lation.</p>
            <p>I am afraid I have been trespassing upon
the <lb/>
patience of the house longer than I had in<lb break="no"/>tended, but I cannot conclude without making<lb/>
a few remarks upon the offensive display made<lb/>
by the hon. member for Richmond (Mr. Miller)<lb/>
the other evening in reference to myself. Now<lb/>
among the great advantages of the contem<lb break="no"/>plated Union, I consider not the least to be, <lb/>
that the tone of public men and public senti<lb break="no"/>ment will be far higher in consequence, and <lb/>
that the debates of the General Parliament<lb/>
will not be disgraced by such a wretched
exhi<lb break="no"/>bition of personalities as we were treated with<lb/>
on the occasion I refer to. That hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man took occasion to pass upon my pub<lb break="no"/>lic conduct in reference to the Union, and to<lb/>
assert that I had acted the mean part of con<lb break="no"/>cealing my sentiments until I had ascertained<lb/>
the feeling of the majority of my constituents.<lb/>
Now, in answer to this unfounded statement, I<lb/>
have merely to appeal to the hon. member for<lb/>
East Halifax (Mr. Annand), who is present,<lb/>
and who knows that hardly had the Delegates <lb/>
returned before I had publicly exhibited my<lb/>
feelings on the subject, and that he good-na<lb/>
turedly challenged me with doing so in the<lb/>
public streets. My sentiments were never con<lb break="no"/>cealed from my constituents. As to the very<lb/>
gentlemanly charge of skulking beneath the<lb/>
galleries when I ought to have been on the <lb/>
platform, my answer is, that it is simply with<lb break="no"/>out foundation. I was present on the platform<lb/>
at the first meeting in Temperance Hall, but<lb/>
from all the others I was absent owing to the<lb/>
inclemency of the weather and the delicate<lb/>
state of my health. I hardly know that it was<lb/>
even necessary to refer to these things, but I <lb/>
have done so because I felt it due to this house<lb/>
to give this public contradiction to the state<lb break="no"/>ments made. I know that my constituents do <lb/>
not require it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
As regards the other personalities which have<lb/>
fallen from the hon. gentleman, I can treat them<lb/>
as idle wind, and do not feel it necessary to<lb/>
take any notice of them. The position of every<lb/>
gentleman who enters this House is soon as<lb break="no"/>signed him by his brother members, who guage<lb/>
and test his qualifications before he has been<lb/>
with them many weeks. With whatever posi<lb break="no"/>tion they may assign me I am quite content, <lb/>
and sure I am I shall never eny that of one<lb/>
whose recent display has neither added credit<lb/>
nor dignity to this assembly. </p>

            <p> Speech
of Mr. Bourinot.</p>

               <p><persName ref="pers:BOUR5">Mr. BOURINOT</persName> :— As no one appears de<lb break="no"/>sirous this afternoon of commencing the de<lb break="no"/>bate I shall endeavour as briefly as
possible to<lb/>
state the opinions I entertain on the
subject<lb/>
under consideration. No doubt the question<lb/>
has been pretty well exhausted. Many able<lb/>
speeches have already been made both in and<lb/>
out of the house, and the press has gone
into<lb/>
the subject very fully; but I think it is
the<lb/>
duty of every member in this Legislature to<lb/>
state his views. It is the opinions
expressed<lb/>
in this house that will influence the
people the<lb/>
most. In accordance with the resolution
mov<lb break="no"/>ed by the Provincial Secretary last
winter, a<lb/>
delegation was appointed for the purpose<lb/>
of conferring with others from New
Brunswick<lb/>
and P. E. Island with the onject of uniting<lb/>
the Maritime Provinces. You are all aware
of<lb/>
the history of the delegation at P. E.
Island,<lb/>
and therefore it is unnecessary I should
refer<lb/>
to it. I cannot refrain, however, from
alluding<lb/>
to the composition of the delegation
itself.—<lb/>
First of all, four out of the five were
members<lb/>
of the Bar—the fifth being the Provincial
Se<lb break="no"/>cretary who, daresay, is a good a lawyer as<lb/>
the others. This fact, however, at the very<lb/>
outset produced distrust and no little
dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction throughout the country. It was
quite<lb/>
right and proper that the Provincial
Secretary<lb/>
should be a member of that delegation—his<lb/>
position and great abilities will not be
denied<lb/>
by any man in this country. The leader of
the<lb/>
opposition was also one of the number, and
it<lb/>
was but right that he should be, but what I<lb/>
complain of is, that the mercantile and
other<lb/>
interests were not represented in this
delega<lb break="no"/>tion. It is true that the Provincial
Secretary<lb/>
has in speeched at Temperance Hall and
else<lb break="no"/>where told you that several mercantile
gentle<lb break="no"/>men connected with the Legislature were
ask<lb break="no"/>ed to be members of the delegation—Hon. J.<lb/>
H. Anderson, Mr. Tobin, and Mr. Locke, but<lb/>
that for reasons given they were unable to
go.<lb/>
When the services of these gentlemen could<lb/>
not be obtained the selection fell upon
the hon.<lb/>
Mr. McCully, and the remaining members of<lb/>
the delegation were the Attorney General,<lb/>
and hon. Mr. Dickey from Cumberland. Now<lb/>
I must say it would have given far greater
sa<lb break="no"/>tisfaction if the government had looked
around<lb/>
these benches and selected gentlemen who<lb/>
could well have formed a part of that
delega<lb break="no"/>tion and represented the mercantile
interests<lb/>
of this country. And ley me ask why was it<lb/>
that in making the selection they should
have<lb/>
ignored the Island of Cape Breton
altogether?<lb/>
Were there no men to be found<lb/>
there who were capable of taking part in<lb/>
that delegation? And I can point out many<lb/>
around these benches, and one hon.
gentleman<lb/>
from the other branch of the Legislature
who<lb/>
could as well represent the mercantile
interest<lb/>
as those named. Look at little P. E.
Island,<lb/>
no greater in extent, certainly not to be <lb/>
compared with Cape Breton in resources; it<lb/>
was represented by no less than seven mem<lb break="no"/>bers in Canada. Look again at the fact that<lb/>
no less than three gentlemen were taken
from<lb/>
one country alone. That favored country of<lb/>
Cumberland sent the Provincial Secretary,<lb/>
Mr. Dickey, and Mr. McCully. Therefore it<lb/>
will be seen that in the selection of the
dele<lb break="no"/>gates the interests of the different
sections of<lb/>
the province were altogether disregarded;
and <lb/>
under the circumstances it is not strange
that<lb/>
<cb/>
at the very initiation of this question
dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction arose. I can assure you the
feeling was<lb/>
very widely extended in the section I
repre<lb break="no"/>sent, for Cape Breton, as in many other
cases,<lb/>
was entirely blotted out. And I was nearly<lb/>
foregetting to mention another fact in
connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the delegation at Charlottetown.—<lb/>
My hon. friend from Cumberland (Mr. McFar<lb break="no"/>lane) happened also to be present at the
time<lb/>
the delegation assembled—no doubt it was <lb/>
thought to be an act of wise foresight to
have<lb/>
him at hand in case some accident should
hap<lb break="no"/>pen to the other delegates from Cumberland.<lb/>
You all know what took place at Charlotte<lb break="no"/>town. Gentlemen from Canada joined the <lb/>
delegates from the Maritime Provinces and<lb/>
mysterious conferences ensued. A great deal<lb/>
of what took place there has not yet come
to<lb/>
light, but it will be known hereafter. When<lb/>
hereafter those private correspondence
come to<lb/>
light—as occurs so often in history—we
shall<lb/>
learn some facts which will give the world
a <lb/>
better idea than they have now of the
motives<lb/>
and reasons that influenced the delegates
in <lb/>
coming to the conclusion they did. These
gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen then left Charlottetown and came to<lb/>
Halifax, and when they had done so, I
receiv<lb break="no"/>ed a telegram inviting me to a banquet to
be<lb/>
given the Canadian delegates. Just imagine<lb/>
a telegram inviting me to come to a dinner<lb/>
party given at a place 300 miles distant
from<lb/>
were I resided. What took place at that fa<lb break="no"/>mous dinner patry? Any number of speeches<lb/>
were made. Union was descanted on at length<lb/>
and the Canadian delegates as well as the <lb/>
Provincial Government, no doubt, thought
that<lb/>
the public mind was quite decided on the
sub<lb break="no"/>ject and satisfied with the expression of
opin<lb break="no"/>ion on that occasion. Then they went on to<lb/>
Canada under the impression that the people<lb/>
of these provinces were quite ready to
accept<lb/>
the results of their conferenced. We all
know<lb/>
what took place in Canada. The reception<lb/>
given to our delegates was very flattering—a<lb/>
perfect ovation—and I am proud to say that<lb/>
some of the gentlemen that represneted this<lb/>
province did credit to themselves and Nova<lb/>
Scotia. Having finished the business of the<lb/>
delegation they returned to Nova Scotia
where<lb/>
they soon learned the state of the public
mind.<lb/>
The meetings at Temperance Hall gave them<lb/>
indications of the state of public opinion,<lb/>
even in a city which was likely to be
benefit-<lb break="yes"/>
ted, whatever might be the case with
respect<lb/>
to the rest of the province. In this city
which<lb/>
had so much at stake they had actually to
lis<lb break="no"/>ten to derisive cheers and hisses. Then a<lb/>
meeting was held at Windsor. In that town<lb/>
the Provincial Secretary endeavored to im<lb break="no"/>press on the minds of the people, that no
ap<lb break="no"/>peal on the constituencies was necessary.
He<lb/>
went into the hisory of the scheme at
length<lb/>
to show that it had been before the country<lb/>
for years, and that under such
circumstances it<lb/>
was unnecessary that the people should be<lb/>
consulted in reference to the subject. Now<lb/>
that the people should be told that they<lb/>
were to have nothing to do with de<lb break="no"/>ciding so important a question as changing<lb/>
the constitution of the country, but that
the<lb/>
house could deal with it irrepective of the<lb/>
wishes of those they represented, was some<lb break="no"/>thing most preposterous to propound in a<lb/>
country like this, enjoying the prilileges
of<lb/>
responsible government—where the people are<lb/>
the fountain of authority. The Prov. Sec'y<lb/>

<fw type="num">266</fw>
<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>
             must have known that the house was
elected <lb/>
under our existing constitution, and could not <lb/>
change it without consulting those that elected <lb/>
them. Yet the Provincial Secretary was <lb/>
quite ready to strike down all ex<lb break="no"/>isting rights and privileges enjoyed by the <lb/>
people, in order that he might march on to Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> But far and wide the spirit of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple asserted itself. Little by little a feeling <lb/>
arose which spread over the length and breadth <lb/>
of this province, and showed the government <lb/>
that they must pause in their rash career. In <lb/>
my own county, at first, much indifference was <lb/>
felt on the question ; but as
the discussion pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded, a strong feeling of dissatisfaction at <lb/>
the scheme exhibited itself among all classes <lb/>
of the peeple. Before passing away, however, <lb/>
from the meeting at Windsor, let
me say that <lb/>
the Prov. Secretary dwelt particularly on the <lb/>
report of Lord Durham, who ma be said to <lb/>
have been the first to have broug t this ques<lb break="no"/>tion before these provinces. That report is <lb/>
valuable, in consequence of its own intrinsic <lb/>
merit and the ability of its author; but we <lb/>
must all be aware that the mass of the people <lb/>
have never known anything about its contents, <lb/>
and could not, therefore, be at all affected by it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Now, turning to the scheme itself, we find
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> that it provides for a federal union of
these <lb/>
provinces. I have no hesitation in saying that if <lb/>
the conference had devised a
legislative union, it <lb/>
would have been preferable. Every
one knows <lb/>
what the local legislatures will
be under this <lb/>
scheme—very insrgnificant bodies.
Another <lb/>
portion of the scheme provides
that the Lieut. <lb/>
Governors shall be selected by the Governor- <lb break="yes"/>
General at Ottawa. What class of men shall <lb/>
we, then, have for our local governors? These <lb/>
very men who formed the
convention. But <lb/>
how would they be looked upon? The posi<lb break="no"/>tion of Lieutenant-Governor would become a <lb/>
mockery in the estimation of the public. I can <lb/>
understand the principle that induced the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish government to elevate Mr. Hincks
to a <lb/>
colonial governorship and should like to see <lb/>
it extended to Mr. Howe who has far higher <lb/>
claims than the former to such a position; but <lb/>
any one must see that the people would never <lb/>
approve of any public man being
made gover<lb break="no"/>nor in his own colony. It has never
yet been <lb/>
fully explained why we have been
given local<lb/>
legislatures in this scheme. It might
be satis<lb break="no"/>factory to the Lower Canadians,
but it would <lb/>
never do for these other provinces.  The muni<lb break="no"/>cipal system that is in full operation in Canada <lb/>
West, or the very system of
county sessions <lb/>
that exists here now, might
have done the<lb/>
work assigned to the local legislatures. If the<lb/>
Lower Canadians would not agree
to legislative <lb/>
union, an arrangement might have been made <lb/>
so as to give them the control of those matters<lb/>
in which they felt especial interest without in<lb break="no"/>terfering with the rest of the provinces. I am<lb/>
glad, however, that some gentlemen who form<lb break="no"/>ed part of the Conference had some respect for<lb/>
that section of Canada which has been so<lb/>
trampled upon by the Western Canadians for<lb/>
years past. It is known to many that Upper<lb/>
Canada has long been endeavoring to deprive<lb/>
Lower Canada of many of those institutions<lb/>
and rights which they value—the very princi<lb break="no"/>ple upon which the union was formed it has<lb/>
been attempted to destroy. Just in that way <lb/>
would the Upper Canadians in case of a Con<lb break="no"/>federation, endeavour to override the interests<lb/>
               <cb/>
               and rights of these maritime provinces.
As re<lb break="no"/>spects the question of taxation, it has been so<lb/>
ably handled by the hon. member of North<lb/>
Colchester that I shall not attempt to touch it,<lb/>
except to say it requires no lengthy calcula<lb break="no"/>tions to see that if this union were consum<lb break="no"/>mated our taxes would be largely in<lb break="no"/>creased, if for no other object that the<lb/>
defences of Canada, more especially the<lb/>
fortifications that have to be erected, and<lb/>
the gunboats that must be put on the lakes.<lb/>
The Canadians are now expected to defend the<lb/>
lakes by means of those iron clad monitors,<lb/>
and the expense of only a very few would be<lb/>
at least three or four millions of dollars. We<lb/>
have also heard that Hon. Mr. Geo. Brown,<lb/>
when he went back to his constituents at To<lb break="no"/>ronto, from the Convention, told them in ex<lb break="no"/>plicit terms that when this Confederation took<lb/>
place their canals would be enlarged, and that<lb/>
the North-West territory would be opened up.<lb/>
Millions of dollars would be expended for that<lb/>
purpose alone, and under these circumstances<lb/>
is there any man so blind as not to see the<lb/>
great burthens that will be necessary impos<lb break="no"/>ed upon us by Confederation. As respects the<lb/>
proportion of representation that Nova Scotia<lb/>
will ahve, let me say at once that no other<lb/>
principle would have been acceptable as a ba<lb break="no"/>sis except population ; but when you look at the<lb/>
small number Nova Scotia will have in pro<lb break="no"/>portion to the Canadas, cannot you see she will <lb/>
be treated just as Cape Breton has been for <lb/>
years past. I admit in all sincerity that a<lb/>
greater desire new exists in this Legislature<lb/>
to do jsutice to Cape Breton, than was the<lb/>
case some time ago. Whoever is familiar with<lb/>
the history of legislation in this province is<lb/>
aware that no member from Cape Bre<lb break="no"/>ton could for years raise his voice on<lb/>
behalf of that island without being met<lb/>
with sneers, if indeed he was heard at all.<lb/>
At first I was inclined to rather favour the<lb/>
scheme of Union for this reason ; I felt it was<lb/>
better to be an appendage to Canada that to<lb/>
Nova Scotia, as we might then obtain<lb/>
more justice than we have received in the past<lb/>
from Nova Scotia. However, as I said before, I <lb/>
can see evidence of a disposition to pay more<lb/>
consideration to the section whose interests I<lb/>
have especially at heart. Gentlemen must<lb/>
know this, that the moment the Union takes<lb/>
place out grants for roads and brdiges must be<lb/>
diminished, (for the revenue at the disposal<lb/>
of the local government will be altogether in<lb break="no"/>sufficient for local wants,) or else you must re<lb break="no"/>sort to that most unpalatable that the commercial<lb/>
interests of this province would be benefitted<lb/>
by Union has been scattered to the wind by<lb/>
gentlemen who have preceded me. Look at<lb/>
our trade returns, and you see that we send<lb/>
Canada nothing of those great products such<lb/>
as fish and coal, for which there is a free mar<lb break="no"/>ket at present in that country. What<lb/>
do we get from them except a few barrels<lb/>
of flour? If it is necessary to have a uni<lb break="no"/>form tariff and currency, there is nothing<lb/>
to prevent it being done without Confederation<lb/>
—that has been conclusively shown time and<lb/>
again since this question was discussed. Now<lb/>
let me say a few words in respect to the recep<lb break="no"/>tion of the scheme in England. We are all<lb/>
familiar with Mr. Cardwell's despatch—how<lb/>
heartily he approved of it. The Provincial<lb/>
Secretary told us that the English Government<lb/>
            
            <pb n="267" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1865-04-17_Page_267.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">267</fw>
<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>
            were in favor of it, and that therefore we<lb/>
should adopt it—that, if we did not, England<lb/>
would withdraw her protection from us by de<lb break="no"/>grees. But it must be remembered that Mr. <lb/>
Cardwell's impression was derived from the<lb/>
same source that prepared this grand scheme<lb/>
at Quebec. I have no doubt that these<lb/>
gentlemen impressed upon the Colonial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary's mind the moment the local legislatures<lb/>
met they would adopt the scheme. No doubt<lb/>
the opinion in England was, that the gentle<lb break="no"/>men who acted as delegates at the convention<lb/>
represented the public opinion of these Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces; but I repel that idea. They<lb/>
did not represent public sentiment on this<lb/>
question at all; the result, not only in New<lb/>
Brunswick, But in Nova Scotia and the other<lb/>
Provinces, has proved it. Now I wish to make<lb/>
a reference to some remarks that fell from the<lb/>
hon. member for Colchester (Mr. Archibald) at a<lb/>
meeting in Temperance Hall on his return<lb/>
from Quebec. Now if there is a gentleman<lb/>
whom I hold in personal esteem—whom I res<lb break="no"/>pect for his great abilities as a legislatir, it is<lb/>
that hon. member; but I always understood<lb/>
that these delegates met in good faith—that<lb/>
they had assembled with the determination to<lb/>
disclose everything affecting these Provinces<lb/>
—everything concerning their great resources<lb/>
and prospects, but they did not do so, and I <lb/>
shall prove it. The hon. member for Colches<lb break="no"/>ter said in his speech:</p>
            <p>"Look again at the great mineral
advantages we<lb/>
possess. With a country filled with coal, our posi<lb break="no"/>tion on the continent is such that we must necessari<lb break="no"/>ly become the suppliers of the whole Atlantic coast.<lb/>
If in the period from 1859 to 1864 we have doubled out<lb/>
coal trade, and the revenue has risen from $20,000 to<lb/>
$40,000, will it not double itself again in a few years,<lb/>
and enable us to provide from that fund alone, all<lb/>
that we require for education, and for the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of our roads and bridges, and our other local<lb/>
concerns? This does not include the revenue from <lb/>
our gold fields, and that has yielded this year $15,000<lb/>
above the coast of its collection. See if these advan<lb break="no"/>tages do not place us in a position superior to that of<lb/>
our neighbors. This statement of our
mineral re<lb break="no"/>sources is one that I would not like to have made in<lb/>
Canada ; it is too much like 'letting the cat out of the <lb/>
bag,' for although we thus obtain no unfair advan<lb break="no"/>tage, yet the superiority is one that might have been <lb/>
looked on with suspicion. Not only does this open<lb/>
up a view of increasing enterprise and prosperity, but<lb/>
it shews us one way to the position we so much desire<lb/>
to fill of becoming the carriers of the world."</p>
            <p>What now do you think of a delegate, that<lb/>
went to meet other delegates in good faith, and<lb/>
yet tell you that he suppressed
facts that they <lb/>
ought to have known? How becoming a posi<lb break="no"/>tion was that for a statesman to occupy? I<lb/>
must now refer to another speech on a recent<lb/>
occasion. Let me say at the outset that those<lb/>
who have read the debates of the Houses of<lb/>
Parliament are aware that there is a strong<lb/>
feeling in England in reference to these colo<lb break="no"/>nies. We have perhaps flattered ourselves<lb/>
with the idea that when the name of Nova <lb/>
Scotia was aspersed we had at least one man<lb/>
in the Commons to stand up for his native<lb/>
country; and how had that gentleman dischar<lb break="no"/>ged his duty? We know that an attempt has<lb/>
been made in the press to explain away the re<lb break="no"/>marks to which I am about to allude; but that<lb/>
explanation amounts to nothing. Judge Hali<lb break="no"/>burton delivered his speech at least more than<lb/>
a week before the last steamer left, and we<lb/>
know that whenever a gentleman has been<lb/>
misrepresented or misunderstood in the Impe<lb break="no"/>rial Parliament, it is usual for him to make ex<lb break="no"/><cb/>planations which will appear in due
course in<lb/>
the Times
or other public journals. But he did<lb/>
nothing of the kind. These remarks, asper<lb break="no"/>sing the loyalty of Nova Scotia, have gone<lb/>
abroad without any contradiction from his<lb/>
own hand. Hear what he says:</p>


            <p>"The people of Canada were, moreover, per<lb break="no"/>fectly loyal. and very much attached to
this<lb/>
country; indeed, he did not think that in
Ca<lb break="no"/>nada a disloyal man of any sect, or creed,
or<lb/>
color was to be found. New Brunswick and<lb/>
Nova Scotia, he was sorry to say, did not
de<lb break="no"/>serve the same praise in that respect, and
he<lb/>
hoped the Secretary for the Colonies would<lb/>
show that he was aware that such was the <lb/>
case."</p>


            <p>These are, indeed, worthy sentiments to
fall<lb/>
from a former member of this Legislature—from<lb/>
one who
is a pensioner of this Province. In ano<lb break="no"/>ther part of his speech he actually says
that he<lb/>
had lived for 60 years in Canada—so ashamed<lb/>
was he of Nova Scotia—and other parts of
the<lb/>
speech referred to are not more
complimentary.<lb/>
The Provincial Secretary told you in his<lb/>
lengthy speech on Confederation, that he
felt<lb/>
humiliated because Nova Scotia was not men<lb break="no"/>tioned at all in the great debate in
connection<lb/>
with these Provinces. Now, if you read the<lb/>
debate carefully, you will see that in the
spee<lb break="no"/>ches of Mr. Disraeli and other eminent
English<lb/>
statesmen, the British American Provinces<lb/>
are frequently mentioned, and the same
kind<lb break="no"/>ly feeling is expressed for all. We are
told<lb/>
that is we refuse to accept Confederation,
En<lb break="no"/>gland would withdraw her protection from
us,<lb/>
but read the debates of the House of
Commones,<lb/>
and you will see that this assertion is
baseless.<lb/>
The honor of England, we are told, is
concern<lb break="no"/>ed in the defence of these colonies. The
Pre<lb break="no"/>mier, Lord Palmerston, tells you:<lb/>
            </p>



            <p>"This is not a Canadian question, it is
not a<lb/>
local question : it is an Imperial
question. It is<lb/>
a question which affects that position and
cha<lb break="no"/>racter, the honor, the interests, and the
duties<lb/>
of this great country."</p>


            <p>With or without Confederation we shall ne<lb break="no"/>ver be left unprotected by the mother
country,<lb/>
should the enemy at any time touch our
shores.<lb/>
A great deal has been said about the
feelings<lb/>
that exist in the neighboring Republic. I
deny<lb/>
the truth of the statement that the
Americans<lb/>
are desirous of pouncing upon these
Provinces,<lb/>
and are only waiting a favorable
opportunity<lb/>
of doing so. Their object is simply to
cultivate<lb/>
a good understanding with these colonies.
Al<lb break="no"/>ready Americans are largely identified with<lb/>
us, and are interested, (more especially in<lb/>
my county, where they shall always receive
a<lb/>
cordial welcome,) in preserving peaceful
and<lb/>
commercial relations with us. Some refer<lb break="no"/>ence has also been made in the course of
this<lb/>
debate to the Times. Now I am not one of<lb/>
those who underrate the Times—it is the great<lb/>
exponent of public opinion in England—it
is a <lb/>
journal of immense talent and influence—se<lb break="no"/>cond to none in that respect in the world;
but<lb/>
it will be remembered, that there was
present<lb/>
at the banquet given to the delegates in
Que<lb break="no"/>bec, a Mr. Sala, a gentleman of ability—well<lb/>
known to the literary world—a friend of a
per<lb break="no"/>son who would like to be closely identified<lb/>
with our railway schemes. Mr. Sala, on that<lb/>
occasion, did not compliment the Times—he<lb/>
stated his reasons why that journal had
acquir<lb break="no"/>ed such an influence over the people, and
said<lb/>
that after all its opinions were not of
such<lb/>

<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>

            
               great value. For my own part, however, I do<lb/>
not underrate its influence; but it should be<lb/>
remembered that the Times got its inspiration<lb/>
from the same source as Mr. Cardwell—from<lb/>
the gentlemen who formed the Convention.—<lb/>
If the Times' writers had been living amongst<lb/>
us, or had means of knowing the tendency of<lb/>
public opinion in these provinces, its articles<lb/>
would have been very different. The views of <lb/>
Mr. Howe, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Young have<lb/>
been referred to in connection with this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Mr. Howe held certain opinions respect<lb break="no"/>ing representation in the Imperial Parliament,<lb/>
and has expressed various views at various<lb/>
times on the Union of the Provinces. But may<lb/>
not circumstances have very much changed<lb/>
since such views were expressed? I have my<lb break="no"/>self expressed opinions favorable to a Union.<lb/>
I have wished that the time would come when<lb/>
we might form a great nation. If a humber<lb/>
individual like myself saw reason to change<lb/>
his views, might not Mr. Howe and others do<lb/>
the same? Are gentlemen bound to entertain<lb/>
the same views always irrespective of circum<lb break="no"/>stances that may arise requiring a modification<lb/>
of change of these views. A great stress has<lb/>
been laid upon the nationality that these Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces would acquire ; instead of being insigni<lb break="no"/>ficant dependencies, they would form a nation<lb/>
that would be respected abroad. I believe that<lb/>
the formation of such a nation would lead to<lb/>
independence of England. Isolated as we are<lb/>
now, we could not form an independent state.<lb/>
Perhaps, however, some gentlement have long<lb break="no"/>ings to see such a result obtained.</p>
            <p>I have no desire to dwell further upon this<lb/>
subject, expect to say that I am quite unwilling<lb/>
to support the resolution on the table unless<lb/>
there is a guarantee given that no change will<lb/>
be effected without consulting the wishes of<lb/>
the people. The matter has now assumed a <lb/>
very different aspect to what it did when the<lb/>
resolution was introduced last session. We au<lb break="no"/>thorized these gentlemen to perform certain<lb/>
duties and they went beyond their authority,<lb/>
and their course has caused a great deal of dis<lb break="no"/>satisfaction. Under such circumstances I can<lb break="no"/>not authorize any set of men to suggest any<lb/>
change that will touch our constitution without<lb/>
an appeal to the people. With the people of<lb/>
this country must rest the decision as to a<lb/>
union of the Maritime Provinces. I believe, in <lb/>
all sincerity, that we are prospering sufficient<lb break="no"/>ly, and I cannot see how any change in our<lb/>
constitution is going to improve our present<lb/>
condition. I had intended referring to some<lb/>
other points which have been brought up in<lb/>
this debate, especially to the remarks of the<lb/>
Provincial Secretary as to the influence that <lb/>
the Cape Breton members exercise in this<lb/>
house; but as I shall perhaps have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of doing so, I shall not enter upon this <lb/>
subject at length at present. Let me say, how<lb break="no"/>ever, that such an influence does not exist, and <lb/>
the Provincial Secretary knows it well. No<lb/>
section of this Province exercises less influences<lb/>
than Cape Breton in provincial matters. If<lb/>
there is a public office to be filled up, Cape<lb/>
Breton is entirely ignored, and many of its<lb/>
adopted sons' claims, some of them very strong<lb/>
indeed, have been disregarded, whilst a few<lb/>
counties are especially favored. I have already<lb/>
referred to Cumberland in connection with the<lb/>
delegation. Perhaps the hon. Provincial Se<lb break="no"/>cretary can explain the especial claims of that<lb/>
county to consideration. Is all the ability and<lb/>
            
<cb/>
            
            
                           talent of the country in that county? Look<lb/>
again at the county of Annapolis; that county<lb/>
has given a judge to the bench—a gentleman<lb/>
who is an ornament to the position, all will ad<lb break="no"/>mit. We have also taken a deputy secretary<lb/>
from that county, a Sol. General, a commission<lb break="no"/>er of railways, and I believe, sire, that you, the <lb/>
chief Commoner of Nova Scotia, are also a na<lb break="no"/>tive of Annapolis,—besides the promise of a<lb/>
railway, and Bear River bridge grant. And<lb/>
yet despite all these favors heaped upon them,<lb/>
how ungrateful were the people last election.<lb/>
I think I can promise any government that<lb/>
would give us all these good things more sup<lb break="no"/>port from the island of Cape breton than this<lb/>
ungrateful county of Annapolis has given, for<lb/>
the Cape Bretonians are always grateful.<lb/>
However, I shall not dwell upon this question<lb/>
at present, for it is, perhaps, somewhat fo<lb break="no"/>reign to the real matter at issue. In conclusion,<lb/>
let me say that I regret having occupied so<lb/>
much time in adressing the house, and I must<lb/>
apologize for not having acquitted myself as<lb/>
well as was due to the house; but I feel strong<lb break="no"/>ly upon this question, and must repeat what I <lb/>
have already said—that no question involving<lb/>
a change in our constitution should be dealt<lb/>
with by this house, without the wishes of the<lb/>
people being first consulted.</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MCFA1">Hon. Mr. MCFARLANE</persName> said:—At this late<lb/>
period of the session I feel that it is absurd to<lb/>
attempt to engage the attention of the house<lb/>
with any langthy speech. Indeed, I do not think<lb/>
the subject we are now discussing is one which<lb/>
should have occupied so much time as it has<lb/>
already. It appears to me that on the present<lb/>
occasion we are attempting to jump before we<lb/>
get to the style. Gentlemen have spent some<lb/>
three or four days in delivering speeched which<lb/>
would be quite appropriate if we had the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of union before us for our final decision.<lb/>
This resolution says on the face of it that a<lb/>
union with Canada is at present impractica<lb break="no"/>ble, and simply proposes a delegation to confer<lb/>
with others from the other Provinces on a sub<lb break="no"/>ject of a union of the Maritime Colonies. yet<lb/>
gentlemen have gone at great length into the<lb/>
subject of the union of all the provinces. Had<lb/>
that question come legitimately before the le<lb break="no"/>gislature, then it would have been our duty to<lb/>
have solemnly investigated the matter and<lb/>
given it our most mature consideration. But<lb/>
the untoward event that lately took place in<lb/>
New Brunswick prevented us dealing with the<lb/>
question of the larger union. All efforts to<lb/>
press forward any measure under such cir<lb break="no"/>cumstancces would have been spent in vain. I<lb/>
have no hesitation in saying that all my feel<lb break="no"/>ings are strongly in favor of union. I am not<lb/>
afraid to say that the general welfare of these<lb/>
provinces in the future is closely connected<lb/>
with their confederation. I do not believe that <lb/>
any connection with Canada would be other<lb break="no"/>wise than beneficial to us. Western Canada<lb/>
would feel that her interests were bound up<lb/>
with ours,—whatever benefitted us would be<lb/>
of advantage to her—and we would feel the<lb/>
same way. We would form all a part of one<lb/>
whole, and whatever affected one portion<lb/>
would affect the other. How is it with our<lb break="no"/>selves? Nova Scotia is divided into a number<lb/>
of counties. I know little of Yarmouth, but <lb/>

here
and advocates some local matter, do I not<lb/>
feel that it is my duty to assist him if
his re<lb break="no"/>quest ought to be granted? This legislature<lb/>
does not hesitate a moment in answering his<lb/>
appeal. So it would be in the case of
confede<lb break="no"/>ration. Every man in the general parliament<lb/>
—whether from Canada or Nova Scotia—would<lb/>
feel an equal interets in the whole
confederacy.<lb/>
I cannot see what possible interest that
Cana<lb break="no"/>dians could have for crushing or injuring
us?<lb/>
Is it not obvious that it would be for
their<lb/>
interests much more that we should be a <lb/>
city of 100,000 instead of 30,000 people.
It<lb/>
is for the interest of Canada to build up
our<lb/>
great seaports on the Atlantic so that she
may<lb/>
have an outlet to the ocean when the St.
Law<lb break="no"/>rence is closed. Without these great
outlets<lb/>
of trade of St. John and Halifax, Canada<lb/>
would be placed in a position of great
difficulty<lb/>
in time of war with the great power on her<lb/>
frontier. My hon. friend from Cape Breton<lb/>
has alluded to my presence at
Charlottetown,<lb/>
when the delegrates were meeting there, but<lb/>
I do not imagine that fact had much
influence<lb/>
over confederation. He told you at the
outset<lb/>
that you were injuring the best interests
of the<lb/>
country, by going into confederation ; but
he<lb/>
went so far as to say at the close that
when<lb break="no"/>ever the people were prepared for union he
was<lb/>
ready to obey their wishes. Under these
cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances I do not think we can put him<lb/>
down as a most determined opponent of con<lb break="no"/>federation. I believe the time will come
when<lb/>
the people of this country will be ready
to ac<lb break="no"/>knowledge the necessity of confederation,
and<lb/>
adopt it. They will see the great benefits
that<lb/>
they must derive from breaking down these<lb/>
vezatious custom houses that now stand on<lb/>
your frontier, so many obstacles to the
growth<lb/>
of industry and wealth in these Provinces.<lb/>
Look at your different currencies. Go to
P. E,<lb/>
Island and you find your money actually has<lb/>
increased in value. Go, again, to New
Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and you find it decreased. Thus by<lb/>
every means in our power we create hosti<lb break="no"/>lity between these several provinces. Does
any<lb/>
person pretend to assert for an instant
that this<lb/>
is a state of things that should be
allowed to<lb/>
prevail for a single moment more than we
can<lb/>
help it? That these provinces belonging to
the<lb/>
same crown, and influenced by the same spi<lb break="no"/>rit of loyalty to the British Empire
should per<lb break="no"/>petuate all the incongruities that now
exist? I<lb/>
awaited with fear and trembling the
results of<lb/>
the Quebec Conference ; but, when I
consider<lb break="no"/>ed them carefully, I have no hesitation in
say<lb break="no"/>ing that the best interests of Nova Scotia
were<lb/>
carefully guarded. I was afraid that our
most<lb/>
valuable resources—our mines and minerals—<lb/>
might be yielded up by Confederation, and I<lb/>
was proud to find that our delegates had
wise<lb break="no"/>ly reserved to this country this valuable
source<lb/>
of revenue. I am convinced that these
resour<lb break="no"/>ces alone under Confederation would give us<lb/>
all the means necessary to carry on our
local<lb/>
affairs. We have only to look at the
results<lb/>
that have been obtained during the past
four or<lb/>
five years to gain some idea of what we may<lb/>
expect in the future from the financial
argument,<lb/>
I shall not say much, for it is
superfluous to do<lb/>
so. It is a matter of little consequence
whether<lb/>
we pay a few cents more a head, provided we<lb/>
get in return corresponding advantages.
Or, is<lb/>
it to be supposed that our burthens will
not be<lb/>
increased more largely than they are now in<lb/>
<cb/>

 the natural order of things, whether we
have<lb/>
Confederation or not? Suppose we have Con<lb break="no"/>federation, are we all to stand still? I
presume<lb/>
each of these colonies will continue to
prosper<lb/>
as they have for the past ten or fifteen
years—<lb/>
that the revenue of each will
correspondingly<lb/>
increase. And how will the large revenue at<lb/>
the disposal of the General Government be
ex<lb break="no"/>pended? I presume in accordance with the<lb/>
wants of the whole Confederacy—not with re<lb break="no"/>spect to the interests of any particular
colony.<lb/>
Whenever any great public works are
required<lb/>
in any part they will be gone on with.

millions of human beings. There you have a<lb/>
territory abounding in most valuable
resources.<lb/>
and which could afford means of subsistence<lb/>
to more people than can be found on this
Con<lb break="no"/>tinent. A good deal has been said about the<lb/>
Canadas combining for the purpose of
injuring<lb/>
the Maritime Provinces. Now any one ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with public affairs on this
Continent<lb/>
must know that there must long be
antagonism<lb/>
between the two sections into which Canada
is<lb/>
divided. That antagonism proceeds from
some<lb break="no"/>thing more than mere diversity of interests—it<lb/>
is one that is the strongest of all, that
of race.<lb/>
The population of Lower Canada is as loyal
as<lb/>
any in British America—being decidedly mo<lb break="no"/>narchical in its tendency, and well
satisfied<lb/>
with the advantages it receives from its
con<lb break="no"/>nection with the British Empire. That
French<lb/>
population has to a large extent the same
in<lb break="no"/>terests as we have, and we may be sure they<lb/>
would combine with the Maritime Provinces
in<lb/>
preference to the Upper Canadians. I feel,<lb/>
however, that it is unnecessary for me to
go<lb/>
into the subject of Union at length, for,
as I<lb/>
said at the outset, it is not actually
before us.<lb/>
I don't believe the time has arrived for
its full<lb/>
discussion in this House. Let me say, how<lb break="no"/>ever, that the friends of Confederation
have<lb/>
never had a wish to force it upon the
people—<lb/>
strongly convinced as they are that it is
con<lb break="no"/>nected with the best interests of the
country.<lb/>
Entertaining these views, I feel that it
is my<lb/>
duty to use all the means in my power to
con<lb break="no"/>vince those who are within the scope of my
in<lb break="no"/>fluence. I believe in all sincerity that
the<lb/>
time will soon come when the people will be<lb/>
found fully alive to the beneficial
results that<lb/>
will accure from this scheme. Let its
friends<lb/>
be patient, and use all the legitimate
means at<lb/>
their command to make their views known to<lb/>
the people. Can any one believe that<lb/>
this Province should continue to remain<lb/>
in the isolated condition it has been for<lb/>
fifty years? That we are now going on<lb/>
properously no one can doubt. Nova Scotia<lb/>
is certainly one of the most flourishing<lb/>
colonies of the British Empire, but
Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion will not endanger that prosperity. I
be<lb break="no"/>lieve, indeed, that confederation is
necessary<lb/>
in order to preserve the enjoyment of that<lb/>
peace and prosperity we now have. I have no<lb/>
hesitation in saying that when the war is
over<lb/>
in the States, I do not apprehend much
danger<lb/>
to ourselves; I believe that the people
will not<lb/>
be anxious for hostilities with a power
like<lb/>
England, and that they will not be willing
to<lb/>
add to the great burthens they have already<lb/>
created. But, at the same time, I believe

            will
adopt every means in their power to ex<lb break="no"/>tract all they can from these provinces,—by<lb/>
hostile tariffs and such means. Therefore
I <lb/>
feel that it is essential for these
provinces to<lb/>
make such arrangements as will make them<lb/>
independent, as far as possible, for the
States,<lb/>
and give them a market where they will not<lb/>
be met by hostile restrictions.<lb/>
Speech of Mr. Locke.</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:LOCK1">MR. LOCKE</persName> said :—As this question appears
to<lb/>
be entirely used up, I do not rise with
the hope of<lb/>
throwing any new light upon it, either
financi<lb break="no"/>ally—politically or otherwise, but having
presen<lb break="no"/>ted a number of petitions from my
constituents<lb/>
upon the subject, I feel that it is due to
them,<lb/>
as well as to myself, that I should offer
a few ob<lb break="no"/>servations, in explanation of the course I
intend <lb/>
to take.</p>

            <p>It will be in the recollection of the
House, that<lb/>
at the last sessions, a resolution was
passed, au<lb break="no"/>thorizing a conference to be held between
Dele<lb break="no"/>gates from this Province, and New
Brunswick,<lb/>
and Prince Edward Island, on the subject
of a <lb/>
Union of the Maritime Provinces. In
accordance<lb/>
with that resolution, the Delegates
proceeded to<lb/>
Charlottetown, and after deliberating for
a day—<lb/>
in an incredibly short space of time, they
came to<lb/>
the conclusion, that a Union of the Lower
Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces was impracticable, and they
admitted into<lb/>
the conference a number of gentleman from
Cana<lb break="no"/>da, who speedily indoctrinated them with
their<lb/>
views upon the question of the larger
Union of all<lb/>
the Provinces. The result was that our
Delegates<lb/>
returned to Halifax, and immediately
proceeded to<lb/>
Quebec. Now sir before going any further,
I <lb/>
should like to ask these gentlemen upon
what<lb/>
principle they received these Canadian
Delegates<lb/>
at all. They were only authorized to
confer upon<lb/>
the subject of a Union of the Lower
Provinces,<lb/>
and yet by some means or other, they
appear to <lb/>
have lost sight of that altogether, and to
have<lb/>
been led entirely by the opinions of the
gentlemen<lb/>
from Canada.</p>


            <p>Now sir, I do not intend to reflect upon
the con<lb break="no"/>duct of the Delegates. I have too much
respect for<lb/>
the honor and integrity of the public men
of this<lb/>
Country to impute to them interested
motives,<lb/>
and I have no doubt that in taking the
course<lb/>
they did, they acted in a way which they
believed<lb/>
was for the best interests of the
Province; we must<lb/>
suppose, taking a charitable view of the
case, they<lb/>
erred in judgment. I do not question their
consti<lb break="no"/>tutional right to proceed to Quebec, and
take part in<lb/>
the Conference which was there held—because
the<lb/>
members of a Government possess the power<lb/>
to deal as they think best, with the
interests of<lb/>
the country they are called upon to
govern, but<lb/>
when men possess power it is not always
advisa<lb break="no"/>ble to exercise it arbitrarily, and
therefore as a <lb/>
matter of policy, and in view of the
expressed<lb/>
feeling of this House, I think it would
have been<lb/>
better for the Government to have obtained
the<lb/>
sanction of the House, before they entered
upon the<lb/>
consideration of the larger question of
the Confede<lb break="no"/>ration of these North American Provinces.
They<lb/>
did not however think proper to do so, and
we<lb/>
must therefore deal with the question as
we find it.<lb/>
            </p>
<cb/>

            <p>The very first article of the Report of
the Que<lb break="no"/>bec Conference, recites as the groundwork, upon<lb/>
which a Union should take place, that it is advi<lb break="no"/>sable "provided it can be effected on principles<lb/>
just to the several provinces. Those concluding<lb/>
words contain the gist of the whole matter. I<lb/>
contend that the terms as arranged at the Con<lb break="no"/>ference are not "just to the several provinces"—<lb/>
more especially as regards Nova Scotia. I hold<lb/>
that in adopting the principle of representation<lb/>
by population, they have ignored other important<lb/>
interests of this Province, which are entitled to<lb/>
consideration. There are other matters to be<lb/>
considered besides mere blood and bones. There<lb/>
is the mining interest which contributes so largely<lb/>
to our provincial prosperity, there is the shipping<lb/>
interest, which as has been stated in this debate,<lb/>
is equal to one eighteenth of that possessed by<lb/>
the British Empire, and represents a capital of<lb/>
eight millions of dollars. Is that not an interest<lb/>
worth protecting and worthy of representation?<lb/>
Canada has nothing to compare with that. It is<lb/>
true that she has a large inland trade by means <lb/>
of her canals, but we cannot participate in the <lb/>
advantages to be derived from them. Then again<lb/>
there is a most important branch of industry, the<lb/>
fisheries, and in connection with that there is one<lb/>
part of the report which I cannot understand, and <lb/>
which I should like the hon. Prov. Sec. to ex<lb break="no"/>plain. I perceive that by a clause of the consti<lb break="no"/>tution, the general government are to have con<lb break="no"/>trol over the sea coast and inland fisheries, while<lb/>
by another clause the same power is given to the <lb/>
local government. The same thing occurs in re<lb break="no"/>ference to Agriculture and Emigration. Both<lb/>
Governments according to the terms agreed upon<lb/>
by the Delegates, are to have control over these<lb/>
subjects, and yet that can scarcely be possible. I <lb/>
can only  say that if the control of these impor<lb break="no"/>tant matters has been surrendered to the general<lb/>
Government, that our Delegates have shown but<lb/>
little regard for the best interests of the country.</p>
            <p>By this principle of representation by
popu<lb break="no"/>lation, a very unfair advantage is given to Cana<lb break="no"/>da. Everybody knows that Emigration to that<lb/>
country is increasing every year, and as the re<lb break="no"/>presentation is by this scheme to be adjusted every<lb/>
ten years upon the basis of population, it follows<lb/>
that she will possess an unfair advantage over<lb/>
the Maritime Provinces, which do not offer the<lb/>
same inducements to Emigrants that she does. I<lb/>
believe that at the close of the first period of ten<lb/>
years, Upper Canada will have increased her<lb/>
population ten per cent, while our increase will<lb/>
not amount to more than five. It will be seen<lb/>
therefore that in this respect, the terms agreed <lb/>
upon are not just or equitable to the several Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and it appears as if the Delegates from <lb/>
this Province had entirely lost sight of what is <lb/>
manifestly an undue advantage conceded to <lb/>
Canada.</p>
            <p>Then again on turning to the Report of the<lb/>
Delegates, I find that the general Government, is<lb/>
to have the control of trade and commerce, the<lb/>
imposition of excise and custom duties, and the<lb/>
control of railroads and canals. This latter clause<lb/>
is of the utmost importance to us. It is well<lb/>
known that the Canadians are anxious to extend<lb/>

            their
territory west, and to open up communica<lb break="no"/>tion with the great country lying in that direc<lb break="no"/>tion. And in order to do this, they will make use<lb/>
of the means placed under their control from this<lb/>
and the other provinces confederated with them.<lb/>
For it must be remembered that even if our Re<lb break="no"/>venue doubles under Confederation, it will be of<lb/>
no use to us, it will be all swallowed up by<lb/>
Canada, whose superior voice in the Parliament<lb/>
will always control the action of the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>The hon. Prov. Sec. the other night in
urging<lb/>
his views in favour of this scheme stated, that it<lb/>
had received the sanction of the Bishops, and the<lb/>
Clergy of the different denomination. Even so, I<lb/>
hold that is no argument to control the members<lb/>
of this House. They can entertain any opinions<lb/>
they please upon this or any other subject, and how<lb break="no"/>ever much I may respect them in matters peculi<lb break="no"/>arly within their province, I do not admit that <lb/>
in matters of finance and political economy, they<lb/>
should exercise much influence over the delibera<lb break="no"/>tions of the people's representatives. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Again he advanced as an additional
argument, <lb/>
that all the leading men of the Province had been<lb/>
in favor of Union. Now it is true that at dif<lb break="no"/>ferent times various prominent politicians have in<lb/>
their places in Parliament and elsewhere made<lb/>
grand speeched in favor of Union, but it was<lb/>
well understood at the time, that nothing was to<lb/>
come of it, they just wished to make a grand show, <lb/>
and had no idea of its being followed by any prac<lb break="no"/>tical results, so that even if grand speeched have<lb/>
been made upon the advantages of Union in the<lb/>
abstract, that has nothing to do with the merits<lb/>
of the scheme promulgated by the Quebec Dele<lb break="no"/>gates.</p>
            <p>The hon. Prov. Sec. also stated that the
most re<lb break="no"/>spectable portion of the Press are in favor of the<lb/>
measure. Now sir, I have made a list of those<lb/>
pro and con—not including the Religious press—<lb/>
and here they are. In the city we have:<lb/>

            <p>HON. PROV. SECY—No. You must strike off<lb/>
the last. It has recanted.</p>
            <p>Mr. LOCKE—We'll even so. Then in the coun<lb break="no"/>try we have:</p>
               <p>Against—<title level="j">Yarmouth
                  Herald</title>, <title level="j">Tribune</title>, <title level="j">Free <lb/>

Casket</title>, and the<lb/>
                  <title level="j">Pictou Standard</title> which may be
in favor. It has<lb/>
been said that there is no intention on the part of the<lb/>
Canadian delegates, now going home to use<lb/>
their influence with the British Cabinet to force<lb/>
this measure upon the Province. I will read to<lb/>
the House what Mr. Cartier said in the subject,<lb/>
when addressing the audience at the Temperance<lb/>
Hall:—</p>
            <p>"They knew that in Nova Scotia there was a
<lb/>
strong feeling in favor of the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. * * * * * He rejoiced to know<lb/>
that the heart of Nova Scotia as well the heart of <lb/>
the Canadas was warm for Confederation. The<lb/>
friends of the cause had no reason for desponden<lb break="no"/><cb/>cy, it would take but little time to
warm  the heart <lb/>
of New Brunswick, after the people of that
pro<lb break="no"/>vince had  understood and weighed the
important<lb/>
bearings of the question. The Canadian
delegates<lb/>
were the first to present at the
Conference at <lb/>
Charlottetown, to the Maritime Provinces,
the<lb/>
larger view of the greater Confederation ;
and he<lb/>
did not hesitate to declare that the basis
of union<lb/>
agreed upon at Quebec was the most just and<lb/>
equitable Union that under the
circumstances<lb/>
could be devised—ensuring alike the safety
and<lb/>
prosperity of all the Confederate
provinces ; and<lb/>
such success had attended the
deliberations of the<lb/>
Quebec convention as was unprecedented  In
all<lb/>
human affairs, we must expect checks and
dis<lb break="no"/>appointments—it could not always be smooth<lb/>
water—there must be shortcomings, and New<lb/>
Brunswick had merely delayed its
consummation—<lb/>
it must ultimately be carried out. On
hearing<lb/>
the fate of the measure in New Brunswick,
they<lb/>
in Canada deemed it advisable to bring to
a con<lb break="no"/>clusion the business of the Legislature,
and send a<lb/>
delegation to England to press
confederation upon <lb/>
the Imperial parliament, the defence
question and<lb/>
in connection therewith the Intercolonial
Railway.<lb/>
It had become a question of Imperial
policy and<lb/>
his co-delegates and himself were going to
Eng<lb break="no"/>land to urge the question of defence not
for<lb/>
Canada alone, but to all the British North<lb/>
American Provinces. On this question of de<lb break="no"/>fence all the Provinces must be united,
and in <lb/>
order to defend ourselves properly we must
be<lb/>
united under one government. The treasure
and<lb/>
resources of the Provinces separately
cannot be<lb/>
usefully and properly applied for defence,<lb/>
except united under one government, and
then<lb/>
all the strength of the Confederates
Provinces can<lb/>
be brought to bear upon the point when the
attack<lb/>
takes place. It is beyond doubt that the
Imperial<lb/>
Government consider the Federation of all
the<lb/>
Provinces absolutely necessary. The
resources<lb/>
of one Province alone would be too small
to resist<lb/>
attack, but when all are united very great
assis<lb break="no"/>tance can be given, and when that has
taken <lb/>
place there can be no difficulty. The
delegates<lb/>
are going to England to urge the
construction of<lb/>
the great Intercolonial Railway, as the
construc<lb break="no"/>tion of that work was absolutely necessary
for the <lb/>
defence of British North America. * * * * *<lb/>
This public demonstration was an authentic
and<lb/>
unmistakeable exhibition of strong
confederate<lb/>
feeling in the commercial city of the
province of<lb/>
Nova Scotia, and the people of England
would <lb/>
come to the conclusion that the citizens
of Hali<lb break="no"/>fax are favorable to the cause of
confederation."</p>
            <p>Mr. Galt also used this language:—"He could<lb/>
not refrain from expressing his emotions
on the oc<lb break="no"/>casion of so magnificent a reception—not
from<lb/>
personal considerations alone, but because
it was<lb/>
the unanimous expression of approval of a
policy<lb/>
that has an echo in the breast of the
people of <lb/>
Nova Scotia as well as that of Canada.
Fully<lb/>
sensible of the check which it has
received in New<lb/>
Brunswick, he did not believe that it was
perma<lb break="no"/>nent,—the great body of the people had not
time<lb/>
to weigh well the question ; and he could
not<lb/>
bring his mind to the belief that the New

<fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES</fw>wickers were less alive to the necessities of union, 
     <lb/>
     or less desirous of perpetrating connection with 
     <lb/>
     the mother country, than either Nova Scotia or 
     <lb/>
     Canada. It was impossible to shut our eyes to 
     <lb/>
     the events occurring in the neighboring States, 
     <lb/>
     and it is undeniable that unless we are united 
     <lb/>
     under the terms as agreed upon at Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     another union will be formed that will be found 
     <lb/>
     to be of an entirely different character, and under 
     <lb/>
     a different flag than that which we now recognize, 
     <lb/>
     and it becomes a question whether we prefer the 
     <lb/>
     good old flag we are now under to that of the 
     <lb/>
     United States. Firmly united under the bonds 
     <lb/>
     of the proposed Confederation, and backed by the 
     <lb/>
     support, influence and means of Great Britain, 
     <lb/>
     we can fear none; but alone, and undivided, we 
     <lb/>
     may fall victims at any moment. Apart from 
     <lb/>
     the great commercial advantages of the proposed 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, we rank still more highly—that 
     <lb/>
     which we believe is of still greater importance— 
     <lb/>
     that by delaying the Union we may risk and im<lb break="no"/>peril the connection between these Provinces and 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country. They have been told that 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia was opposed to Confederation, but 
     <lb/>
     this meeting and magnificent demonstration had  
     <lb/>
     given the lie to that assertion, and he hoped the 
     <lb/>
     time would not be remote when he would have 
     <lb/>
     the honor and privilege of addressing them not 
     <lb/>
     only as Nova Scotians, but as a united Confede<lb break="no"/>ration of British North America." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I think that after this that there can be very 
     <lb/>
     little doubt in the minds of any body, that these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen go home with the intention of forcing 
     <lb/>
     upon the British Government the necessity for the 
     <lb/>
     Union, being at once accomplished,— whether 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces are willing or not. I cannot 
     <lb/>
     allow a remark of the hon. Prov. Secy., made the 
     <lb/>
     other day in reference to the people of Yarmouth, 
     <lb/>
     to pass unnoticed. He said they were favorably   
     <lb/>
     disposed towards American Institutions, and in 
     <lb/>
     fact insinuated that, with some other counties, 
     <lb/>
     they were disloyal in their sentiments.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon PROV. SECY</persName>. - denied that he ever made. 
     <lb/>
     such an assertion.     
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LOCK1">Mr. LOCKE</persName>—I so understood it, and I believe 
     <lb/>
     the hon.  gentleman endeavored afterwards to ex<lb break="no"/>plain. Now, sir, I maintain that there is not a 
     <lb/>more loyal people on the face of the globe than the   
     <lb/>people of Nova Scotia.     
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Shelburne was founded by Loyalists - and they<lb/>could be outdone by none in their devotion to the<lb/>British flag. The man who insinuated anything<lb/>there about their loyalty would find it a pretty 
     <lb/>
    hard place to stand in- and I believe the very 
     <lb/>purity of their loyalty would deter them from 
     <lb/>entering into this Scheme, judging from the pre<lb break="no"/>vious history of Canada.      
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, a word as to the resolution<lb/>on the table of the House. I will just read the<lb/>preamble, and ask in what position would any<lb/>man be placed who voted for it? He thereby ad<lb break="no"/>mits that he is in favor of a Union of all the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces - and the only reason why he does not do<lb/>so now, is because "it is at present impracticable."<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I do not say that the Prov. Secy. in wording    
     <lb/>that resolution had any design to entrap gentle<lb break="no"/>men 
               into committing themselves upon this ques<lb break="no"/><cb/>tion, but I consider it to be the duty of every man 
     <lb/>opposed to Confederation to vote against it.<lb/>
     
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     That is the course I intend to take, and I would  
     <lb/>say to the Government, as Henry Clay said to<lb/>John Randolph, "go home to your Constituents,<lb/>who sent you here, and see whether they approve<lb/>of the course you have taken."<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It was useless attempting to make the Canadian    
     <lb/>Delegates of the British people believe that the<lb/>question of Confederation was received with any<lb/>favor in this country.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

    

            <p>
     It was virtually dead. Like the Church at   
     <lb/>
     Ephesus, it had a name to live for, and was yet 
     <lb/>
     dead. Let the resolution, then, remain a dead   
     <lb/>
    letter upon the table of the House, and let nothing 
     <lb/>more be said about it until the time shall arrive 
     <lb/>when the people of this country declare themselves 
     <lb/>in favor of a scheme which goes to alter the 
     <lb/>Constitution, under which they are now prosper<lb break="no"/>ing and living contentedly.

            <p>
     Remarks of Mr. Killam. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. KILLAM</persName> said—I shall not delay the 
     <lb/>
     house long with my expression of opinion on 
     <lb/>
     the subject under consideration. It has been 
     <lb/>
     given as an argument in favour of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, that leading men in this Legislature have 
     <lb/>
     been in favour of it, and have spoken often in 
     <lb/>
     respect to it. Now I have been a member of 
     <lb/>
     this house for many years,  and have heard. 
     <lb/>
     what remarks have been made, but I am not  
     <lb/>
     aware that any large number of members, or 
     <lb/>
     of the people, thought much about the subject.  
     <lb/>
     The Legislature took no interest in the ques-   
     <lb/>
     tion, and the people felt the same way. No  
     <lb/>
     one believed that anything practical would 
     <lb/>
     grow out of the discussion -the  whole 
     <lb/>
     thing was a mere pleasant theory in which 
     <lb/>
     some gentlemen liked to indulge when they 
     <lb/>
     had nothing  else to talk about.    
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p> A great deal of alarm exists all through the 
     <lb/>Province on this subject of Confederation. It   
     <lb/>appeared to be the opinion of every man you  
     <lb/>met that no good could come of it, and this 
     <lb/>feeling appeared to be the spontaneous feeling 
     <lb/>of the people, without any effort having been 
     <lb/>made by those who are called political leaders 
     <lb/>to excite it. As regards the resolution on the 
     <lb/>table, I will say that I can scarcely imagine 
     <lb/>how any person could be found within those 
     <lb/>walls to favor a Union of the Lower Provinces.  
     <lb/>There can be no advantage to us in mixing up 
     <lb/>our local interests with those of the   other   
     <lb/>Maritime Provinces. I have yet to hear any 
     <lb/>argument in favour of this smaller Union. 
     <lb/>Then where is the necessity for any further 
     <lb/>delegation on the subject, if no practical result 
     <lb/>is to follow.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> There has been a great deal   said about the 
     <lb/>advantages a union with Canada would confer   
     <lb/>upon us, but I think that the eflfect would be 
     <lb/>to restrict and hamper our commercial opera<lb break="no"/>tions.   Nova Scotia wants the whole world for   
     <lb/>a market - she wants free communications with<lb/>the great producing country, the United States,<lb/>which furnishes us with luxuries and neces<lb break="no"/>saries which we have not got. We want our car<lb break="no"/>rying trade, upon which we so largely depend,<lb/>to be unrestricted in its extent. All this is ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to our prosperity; but adopt this con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme, and we will hedge ourselves<lb/>
               <lb/>in as if it were, and shut ourselves out from the<lb/>markets that are now open to us. We were in<lb/>

     fact going to adopt the Japanese policy, who, 
     <lb/>
     for a thousand years, lived within themselves 
     <lb/>
     until civilization compelled them to open up 
     <lb/>
     their markets to the world. That is a policy I 
     <lb/>
     do not think is suited to Nova Scotia; and that 
     <lb/>
     is the reason I am so much against it.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If there is anything worth protecting in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, surely it is our shipping, and 
     <lb/>
     foreign commerce, and yet we would render 
     <lb/>
     this useless by going into Confederation. The 
     <lb/>
     very name of Nova Scotia is worth keeping— 
     <lb/>
     a country that owns one-eighth of the shipping 
     <lb/>
     of the British Empire is surely worthy of a 
     <lb/>
     name amongst the nations of the world. The 
     <lb/>
     shipping of Nova Scotia is to be found in every 
     <lb/>
     part of the world, and their sails whiten the 
     <lb/>
     seas in every portion of the globe. That im<lb break="no"/>portant interest represents in value no less 
     <lb/>
     than eight millions of dollars, and yet we are 
     <lb/>
     called to adopt a policy detrimental to so valu<lb break="no"/>able a branch of our provincial prosperity. The 
     <lb/>
     only true policy for a commercial country, is 
     <lb/>
     free and unrestricted trade. That is the policy 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain. The more trade is unfetter<lb break="no"/>ed, the more it will expand; and yet we are 
     <lb/>
     about to adopt a restrictive policy, and to shut 
     <lb/>
     ourselves out from the markets of the world. 
     <lb/>
     Canada, from her inland position, can never 
     <lb/>
     become a large manufacturing country—and 
     <lb/>
     she is a great agricultural country—she can 
     <lb/>
     supply us with all the whiskey we want, but 
     <lb/>
     we can do without that; and if we want it, the 
     <lb/>
     best way is to get it at the cheapest rate.  She 
     <lb/>
     can supply us with most of the eatables we 
     <lb/>
     want, and some of the wearing apparel, and 
     <lb/>
     can give employment to our labor; but the 
     <lb/>
     best way, in a new country, is to employ it 
     <lb/>
     within our own Province.  There is no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that the lumber trade of Canada gives employ<lb break="no"/>ment to our shipping, but they get no better 
     <lb/>
     price for it than anywhere else. They can go 
     <lb/>
     anywhere and get good prices; and as I said 
     <lb/>
     before, the carrying trade of  Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     extends over the world. I cannot see why 
     <lb/>
     Novascotians are not satisfied with the progress 
     <lb/>
     they are making- our manufacturing interest 
     <lb/>
     is advancing as rapidly as can be expected in 
     <lb/>
     a new country withouth any protection at all. 
     <lb/>
     Our public works—if the government manage 
     <lb/>
     them prudently and carefully, and do not en<lb break="no"/>ter upon them too rashly - will contribute to 
     <lb/>
     the general prosperity. In fact, every branch 
     <lb/>
     of industry is in a sound condition. Then 
     <lb/>
     why alter this state of things, and ruh blindly 
     <lb/>
     into a union with Canada?  The hon. Prov. 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, in his speech, complained of an 
     <lb/>
     article in theMorning Chronicle on the subject 
     <lb/>
     of the defence  of this country.  I cannot  say 
     <lb/>
     that the scheme there propounded  met my 
     <lb/>
     views, and I am not desirous that any English 
     <lb/>
     acts of parliament should be passed to inter<lb break="no"/>fere with our rights and liberties. What did 
     <lb/>
    the delegates propose to do? If their wishes 
     <lb/>had been carried   out, they  intended to go to 
     <lb/>England to tie up the people of these North 
     <lb/>American colonies, by an English act of par<lb break="no"/>liament, for all time to come, and to compel        
     <lb/>them to submit to the scheme.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. KILLAM</persName>- It is very strange if I am mis<lb break="no"/>taken. Was it not proposed that the leading<lb/>men should go to England?<lb/>

               <p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROV. SEC</persName>.- It was proposed that the<lb/>scheme propounded by the delegates should<lb/>be first submitted to the local legislatures<lb/>
            <cb/>
     and an address be passed asking the British 
     <lb/>
     parliament to confirm the action that had 
     <lb/>been taken.<lb/>
     
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. KILLAM</persName>—If it is not one of the articles 
     <lb/>
     of agreement it was generally understood that 
     <lb/>
     such was to be the case. It has been urged 
     <lb/>
     that the great Intercolonial Railway is going 
     <lb/>
     to make us a great country, that Halifax is go— 
     <lb/>
     ing to be the entrepôt of the whole continent. 
     <lb/>
     Now, sir, when I saw the grass growing on the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk of Canada, and reflected that for 
     <lb/>
     six months of the year there is no business 
     <lb/>
     doing upon it, I confess that I was not very 
     <lb/>
     sanguine as to the necessityof this work as a 
     <lb/>
     commercial undertaking. Nor would it be of 
     <lb/>
     any advantage in time of war—running as it 
     <lb/>
     would within ten or twelve miles of the United 
     <lb/>
     States territory, it would be easy for them to 
     <lb/>
     destroy it, and they might take Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     before we could hear of it except by way of the 
     <lb/>
     United States. It was useless then to talk 
     <lb/>
     about that being of any advantage to us either 
     <lb/>
     commercially or politically. If Canada wants 
     <lb/>
     it, let her have it—in the meantime let us go on 
     <lb/>
     'with our own public works. If the government 
     <lb/>
     can show a feasible plan to connect with the 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick border, and the state of finan— 
     <lb/>
     ces will admit of it, I shall not oppose it; al<lb break="no"/>though I should prefer that the Pictou road 
     <lb/>
     should be built first, as I think that will suf<lb break="no"/>ficiently tax our energies  and resources for 
     <lb/>
     some time to come.

            <p>TUESDAY, April 18th, 1865.  
     <lb/>
      MR. MCFARLANE from the Committee on Agri— 
     <lb/>
     culture reported. Some conversational debate took 
     <lb/>
     place on the subject of the importation of Stock. 
     <lb/>
     

     
            </p>
            <p> Mr. PARKER advocated the idea of having farms 
     <lb/>in different parts of the Province, for the raising 
     <lb/>of Stock. He also spoke of the want of a suitable 
     <lb/>Market House in Halifax for the convenience of 
     <lb/>Farmers.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The report was received and adopted.

            <p>THE CROWN LANDS IN CAPE BRETON        
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>  Mr. MCDONNEL referred to the question of the 
     <lb/>settlement of Crown Lands in Cape Breton which 
     <lb/>had been discussed in the early part of the session, 
     <lb/>and to the statement  then made by Hon. Prov. 
     <lb/>Sec., and the hon. leader of the Opposition, to the 
     <lb/>effect  that Cape Breton  had been more highly fa<lb break="no"/>vored than other parts of the Provinces as regards 
     <lb/>the terms upon which the payment of Crown 
     <lb/>Lands  was to be made—inasmuch as long  credit 
     <lb/>was given to purchasers in that Island, and the 
     <lb/>moneys amounting from  the sale of these lands, 
     <lb/>were reserved for the opening up of roads.    
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He was rather surprised at the assertion at the 
     <lb/>time, and he was induced to look into the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and ascertain how the facts really stood.-<lb break="yes"/>Upon referring to the law passed in 1859, for the<lb/>settlement of Crown Lands in Cape Breton, he<lb/>found it enacted that the money arising from the<lb/>sale of these lands, was in the discretion of the<lb/>Government to be appropriated to the opening up<lb/>of the roads in the Island of Cape Breton. In<lb/>order to follow the matter up, he asked the<lb/>leader of the Government to lay upon the table &amp;<lb/>return all of the moneys derived from this source<lb/>since the passage of the Act. From that return it<lb/>appeared that there had been paid into the Re
