     [...] ed by an act relating to the Baddeck church 
     <lb/>
     property some years ago. There was some<lb break="no"/>thing in the face of the matter so insulting to 
     <lb/>
     the intelligence of the House that he felt it 
     <lb/>
     hardly right to ask members to listen to any 
     <lb/>
     arguments. The language used in reference 
     <lb/>
     to the Inspector of schools was strong but it 
     <lb/>
     was entirely justified by that officer's conduct. 
     <lb/>
     A fear had been previously expressed that the 
     <lb/>
     Inspectors instead of attending to their duties 
     <lb/>
     would be made the tools of the government 
     <lb/>
     and the conduct of this Inspector afforded a 
     <lb/>
     complete indication of the remark. The man 
     <lb/>
     who should of all others endeavour to recon<lb break="no"/>cile angry feelings was stirring up strife. 
     <lb/>
     issuing warrants against the clergy and 
     <lb/>
     making himself the tool of the member for 
     <lb/>
     Victoria. While he, Mr. Archibald, and his 
     <lb/>
     friends were giving assistance to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment on the school bill, this officer whose acts 
     <lb/>
     were a stain upon the man who recommended 
     <lb/>
     him and the government who would continue 
     <lb/>
     him a day in office, was using every effort to 
     <lb/>
     destroy its good effect. The very petition 
     <lb/>
     written by him showed him to be destitute of 
     <lb/>
     acquaintance with the principles of an English 
     <lb/>
     education, it contained blunders in every part 
     <lb/>
     of it, and this was the man who had charge of 
     <lb/>
     the education of the County of Victoria. After 
     <lb/>
     being appointed a Justice of the Peace, this in<lb break="no"/>dividual had issued a warrant against twenty- 
     <lb/>
     five persons for going into a church and listen<lb break="no"/>ing to a minister, and had fined them from $10 
     <lb/>
     to $20 each, although the prosecutor swore that 
     <lb/>
     no breach of the peace had been committed. 
     <lb/>
     In the Act relating to the Union, a clause had 
     <lb/>
     been inserted providing that no congregation 
     <lb/>
     deciding to remain separate, within three 
     <lb/>
     months after the passage of the law, should be 
     <lb/>
     embraced in the union. He would be satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that the House should decide the matter on the 
     <lb/>
     speech of the member for Victoria, who ap<lb break="no"/>peared as the representative of a body that dis<lb break="no"/>owned him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>, said that the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature was in the habit of dealing fairly 
     <lb/>
     with the rights of every religious body. If the 
     <lb/>
     question was considered in the proper spirit, 
     <lb/>
     there need be no fear as to any injustice being 
     <lb/>
     done to any set of men. He regretted that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Colchester had not provided 
     <lb/>
     in the bill of 1862 for the security of private 
     <lb/>
     rights. He could tell that hon. gentleman from 
     <lb/>
     his own personal knowledge, that at the first 
     <lb/>
     circuit in Cape Breton after the act had passed, 
     <lb/>
     he was met by deputations of religious bodies 
     <lb/>
     asking what could be done to protect their 
     <lb/>
     property. By the time they got the requisite 
     <lb/>
     advice, they were unable to give the 30 days 
     <lb/>
     notice required by the act. The act operated 
     <lb/>
     before the people knew what to do. It was not 
     <lb/>
     right for the Legislature to hand over the 
     <lb/>
     private property of one person to another.— 
     <lb/>
     Justice should be done where a man had put 
     <lb/>
     his hand into his pocket and contributed to the 
     <lb/>
     erection of a church, manse, or other property, 
     <lb/>
     If a majority of the congregation retired to an<lb break="no"/>other church, he should be remunerated and 
     <lb/>
     protected as far as the property was concerned. 
     <lb/>He regretted that the matter had been brought 
     <lb/>up, but now that it was there it should be 
     <lb/>given a fair and equitable hearing to the 
     <lb/>claims of the petitioners. He held that the true 
     <lb/>principle was this:——that if a number of persons 
     <lb/>went over and joined another church, they 
     <lb/>
    
            <cb/>
           
     should not take away the property but leave 
     <lb/>it to those that remained,—who belonged to 
     <lb/>the Free Church. He believed that it was only 
     <lb/>the intention of of the promoters of the act of 
     <lb/>1862 to receive power to manage their own 
     <lb/>internal affairs, but not to legislate away the 
     <lb/>rights of others. One congregation—that of 
     <lb/>Mr. Gunn—had been excepted at the time from 
     <lb/>the provisions of the act. Here the principle 
     <lb/>was established that it was unconstitutional 
     <lb/>and unjust to legislate away the rights of the 
     <lb/>parties who might object to the union. If it 
     <lb/>was right in one case, it was equally right in 
     <lb/>all others—to reserve the rights of clergymen 
     <lb/>in other parts of the country. Some little al<lb break="no"/>lowance ought to be made for a person like the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Victoria, who had the proper<lb break="no"/>ty which he had helped to create legislated 
     <lb/>away. No person could accept such a state of 
     <lb/>things without remonstrance. He did not think, 
     <lb/>however, that the present bill could meet the 
     <lb/>difficulty, and he would therefore suggest that 
     <lb/>it be referred to a special committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName> said that the Free Church 
     <lb/>
     had united with another religious body with 
     <lb/>
     which it agreed in doctrine. It was to all in<lb break="no"/>tents and purposes the same church it was be<lb break="no"/>fore; it had the same right to the property it 
     <lb/>
     owned previously. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The discussion was adjourned.

     <persName ref="pers:SHAN2">Hon. Mr. SHANNON</persName> introduced an act to

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Dr. TUPPER</persName> then rose and said:—The house 
     <lb/>
     will recollect that, a few days ago, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Richmond put a question to the 
     <lb/>
     Government, in relation to a very important 
     <lb/>
     subject, and on that occasion I stated that the 
     <lb/>
     situation in which we stood in respect to the 
     <lb/>
     Union of the Colonies would preclude me from 
     <lb/>
     giving him an immediate reply, until I had an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of placing myself in communica<lb break="no"/>tion with my colleagues in the Government, 
     <lb/>
     and with the other gentlemen who had assisted 
     <lb/>
     in maturing the Quebec scheme. I stated, 
     <lb/>
     however, to the hon. member and to the house, 
     <lb/>
     that in view of the great importance of the 
     <lb/>
     subject,—of the events which were daily tran<lb break="no"/>spiring in connection with the question—I 
     <lb/>
     would take the earliest opportunity of giving, 
     <lb/>
     in my place, the policy which the government 
     <lb/>
     and the friends of the Quebec scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation in this Legislature are prepared to 
     <lb/>
     take in relation to the matter. In order to re<lb break="no"/>deem the pledge and bring the attention of this 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Assembly to the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     the gravest and most important question that 
     <lb/>
     has ever been submitted to it—after due deli<lb break="no"/>beration with my colleagues, and consultation 
     <lb/>
     with the gentlemen who were associated with 
     <lb/>
     us at the Quebec Conference—I rise for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of giving to the house and country the 
     <lb/>
     fullest information as to the policy which we 
     <lb/>are prepared to assume in relation to the sub<lb break="no"/>ject. I regret deeply that in approaching a 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">212</fw>
            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
            
               
     question of such gravity—which demands that 
     <lb/>
     the members of the house should rise to to the 
     <lb/>
     great emergency, and look with a single eye 
     <lb/>
     to the interests of the country; only to that 
     <lb/>course that is calculated to promote the 
     <lb/>advancement of our common country, and per<lb break="no"/>petuate the great privileges which, as British 
     <lb/>subjects, we enjoy; I regret, I say, Sir, in 
     <lb/>approaching a question of such deep import<lb break="no"/>ance, that the conduct of a portion of the press 
     <lb/>in this Province, controlled by a gentleman 
     <lb/>within this Legislature, occupying a high and 
     <lb/>responsible position, should make it my duty 
     <lb/>at the outset to notice, not the arguments-for 
     <lb/>that time has passed — but unfounded <choice><sic>cal<lb break="no"/>nmnies</sic><corr>calumnies</corr></choice> and misrepresentation. The time has 
     <lb/>passed when the opponents of a union of Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America can meet the friends of that 
     <lb/>great question on the platform, in the press, or 
     <lb/>on the floor of Parliament, and discuss it as 
     <lb/>becomes public men and statesmen, upon the 
     <lb/>principles and leading features of the scheme 
     <lb/>proposed. Instead of that, the opponents of 
     <lb/>union have resorted to appeals to the passions, 
     <lb/>--to such an amount of personal vituperation 
     <lb/>as never before I believe in the history of this 
     <lb/>country, was dragged into the consideration of 
     <lb/>a great public question upon anyoccasion. I 
     <lb/>should fail in what 1 owe to myself and to the 
     <lb/>great question with which I am at this mo<lb break="no"/>ment undertaking to deal, and in what I owe to 
     <lb/>this deliberative assembly, if I did not in my 
     <lb/>place in Parliament, notice at the very outset 
     <lb/>the position that the opponents of this ques<lb break="no"/>tion have assumed, and the strange liberties 
     <lb/>they have taken with this Legislature. I would

     <lb/>in the capacity of editor, publisher, and pro<lb break="no"/>prietor of a newspaper in this city. Is he to be

     I ask the house what must be the position of

     public men in this country who are called 
     <lb/>
     upon to deal with a question so vital to our 
     <lb/>
     interests as a union of British North America, 
     <lb/>
     when they are obliged to descend to such

     language as that? I need not remind the house 
     <lb/>
     when the Government was called upon to 
     <lb/>
     deal with the question, they invited the aid 
     <lb/>
     and co-operation of the leaders of the political 
     <lb/>
     party opposed to them; and that these gentle<lb break="no"/>men, thus called upon to share the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility in connection with a matter of such 
     <lb/>
     vital import, have acted from the first in entire 
     <lb/>
     unison with those who had asked their assist<lb break="no"/>ance. I do not mean to say that the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Government and the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposed to them, who were delegates to the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Conference, always saw eye to eye, 
     <lb/>
     I do not mean to say that we were not obliged 
     <lb/>
     on many occasions to arrive at a common re<lb break="no"/>sult by a compromise of our individual opin<lb break="no"/>ions; but in the measure as a whole, that was 
     <lb/>
     presented to the world, we were all heartily 
     <lb/>
     and thoroughly united. Then, I ask, what is 
     <lb/>
     the position of the organ of the party of which 
     <lb/>
     the hon. and learned member for Colchester, 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Archibald,) is the leader, when, in dealing

     conspirator, traitorously endeavoring to strike 
     <lb/>
     down the rights and liberties of his country.— 
     <lb/>
     A cause which requires an advocacy like that 
     <lb/>
     must indeed be in want of arguments on which

     "In the course of the Confederate Debate in the

            <p>
     I ask the house if the most spiritless member 
     <lb/>
     is prepared to allow a foul stigma like that 
     <lb/>
     to rest upon his character? I feel that all the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member has been doing is bringing down 
     <lb/>discredit and dishonour upon himself and the 
     <lb/>cause he thus upholds. I may have occasion 
     <lb/>to draw the attention of this house to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to how far these imputations of base, 
     <lb/>corrupt and dishonourable motives influenc<lb break="no"/>ing the members of this Legislature, have 
     <lb/>sprung from the belief in the mind of the hon. 
     <lb/>member that there are other gentlemen as 
     <lb/>open to such imputations as he himself may 
     <lb/>be. Now when a base and dishonourable mo<lb break="no"/>tive is imputed to a man of fair character, the 
     <lb/>party who attempts to put such a stigma upon 
     <lb/>him has a right to sustain it by showing it at 
     <lb/>there is some reason for the belief that it 
     <lb/>might possibly apply to the person in question. 
     <lb/>I have already said that these imputations are 
     <lb/>not levelled against the gov't party alone, 
     <lb/>but fall with the same weight upon gentle<lb break="no"/>men politically identified with the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber. It may be argued with reason that these 
     <lb/>imputations fall with far greater force upon 
     <lb/>the leader of the Opposition, with whom the 
     <lb/>hon. member has been long closely associated, 
     <lb/>and whose motives he may be supposed to 
     <lb/>know better than those with whom he has not 
     <lb/>been politically identified. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me call your attention to this charge of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     bribery. No one will deny the truth of the 
     <lb/>
     principle that it is only when you find a man 
     <lb/>
     lend himself to a dishonorable deed, that you 
     <lb/>
     have a foundation to impute a base motive. 
     <lb/>
     In what position are the promoters of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec scheme? Were we in the position 
     <lb/>
     of having denounced a Union of British North 
     <lb/>
     America, and then, without anything to 
     <lb/>
     change their attitude, having suddenly as<lb break="no"/>sumed a position entirely antagonistic and at 
     <lb/>
     variance with that which we had previously 
     <lb/>
     taken? If it were so, then the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     might have something on which to base a 
     <lb/>
     suspicion. Before the question was mooted 
     <lb/>
     in this Legislature I was called to address a 
     <lb/>
     meeting in the city of St. John, in the neigh<lb break="no"/>bouring Province, and chose for my subject 
     <lb/>
     the Union of British North America. From 
     <lb/>
     that day to this I have been found the con<lb break="no"/>sistent supporter of Union. When the late 
     <lb/>
     government brought down the question of 
     <lb/>
     Union I adhered to the principles on the plat<lb break="no"/>form and in the press, and gave them my cor<lb break="no"/>dial and enthusiastic support. So down to 
     <lb/>
     the present day I stand before the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country as a man who, in every position, 
     <lb/>
     has used every influence he possessed to pro<lb break="no"/>mote and carry forward that on which he 
     <lb/>
     believed the prosperity and security of the 
     <lb/>
     country depended. Can the hon. member find 
     <lb/>
     any foundation there for the imputation of 
     <lb/>
     base and corrupt motives? Again, if the pro<lb break="no"/>moters of Union are influenced by motives 
     <lb/>
     that are dishonourable to themselves and the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, in what position is Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     the Queen? When he sees the Queen, session 
     <lb/>
     after session, at the close and opening of Par<lb break="no"/>liament, coming down and urging in the most 
     <lb/>
     emphatic terms that the Royal lips can use, 
     <lb/>
     this question of Confederation upon the people 
     <lb/>
     of British North America, does he mean to 
     <lb/>
     say that she, too, is corrupted by base bribes? 
     <lb/>
     Coming down to Her Majesty's Ministers—to 
     <lb/>
     the men who stand before the world as exemp<lb break="no"/>lars of the most distinguished patriotism, the 
     <lb/>
     most profound statesmanship—are they too 
     <lb/>
     corrupted by base means when they declare 
     <lb/>
     that the advancement of British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica is to be secured by carrying through this 
     <lb/>
     great question of a Colonial Union? What 
     <lb/>
     does he think influences Lord Derby and the 
     <lb/>
     statesmen opposed to Her Majesty's Ministers 
     <lb/>
     who, on every occasion, have stood forward 
     <lb/>
     and strengthened the hands of the government 
     <lb/>
     of England in carrying forward this great 
     <lb/>question of Colonial Union? What has in<lb break="no"/>uenced the press and people, as well as the 
     <lb/>Lords and Commons of Great Britain, when, 
     <lb/>with a unanimity which has never been 
     <lb/>exhibited on any other public question, they 
     <lb/>stand forward as the avowed supporters and 
     <lb/>advocates of this great measure? Is it at a 
     <lb/>crisis like this—when day by day these patriotic 
     <lb/>influences that are calculated to operate upon 
     <lb/>men's minds do operate—that a member of 
     <lb/>this deliberative assembly should dare to 
     <lb/>dishonour this House by imputations of being 
     <lb/>influenced by base and unworthy motives? 
     <lb/>Go to Canada and you find in that great coun<lb break="no"/>try an overwhelming majority of both branches 
     <lb/>of the Legislature in favour of this great mea<lb break="no"/>sure; and you find Her Majesty's Representa<lb break="no"/>tive therein using his legitimate influence to

     at the events that are transpiring in this pro<lb break="no"/>vince no one can doubt the result. Then, I 
     <lb/>
     say, is it Canadian gold that is corrupting the 
     <lb/>
     Province and influencing it to assume an atti<lb break="no"/>tude so very different from what it assumed a 
     <lb/>
    year ago? Coming to our own Province what 
     <lb/>do I find? I am not going to speak of the 
     <lb/>Lieutenant Governor (Mr. Annand—hear, 
     <lb/>hear), but the Government knows that the 
     <lb/>"Hero of Kars," in his capacity of Comman<lb break="no"/>der-in-Chief of British North America, used 
     <lb/>all the ability and talent at his command, by 
     <lb/>public speeches and written communications, 
     <lb/>in favor of a union of British North America. 
     <lb/>As one of the most distinguished soldiers of 
     <lb/>the empire he felt that the salvation and se<lb break="no"/>curity of British North America depended 
     <lb/>upon the promised union being carried into 
     <lb/>effect. What has corrupted that high-minded 
     <lb/>soldier, statesmen and patriot? Is it Canadian 
     <lb/>
    
            <cb/>
           
     gold? If the features of the scheme are such 
     <lb/>
     as to bring to its advocacy a man so distin<lb break="no"/>guished, why is it that this deliberative Assem<lb break="no"/>bly is told that Canadian gold is the only 
     <lb/>
     means of inducing men to combine in carrying 
     <lb/>
     it forward? In what position is the brave and 
     <lb/>
     distinguished Admiral on this Station? He 
     <lb/>
     stood forth at the very inception of this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, as he stands to-day,—he, one of the 
     <lb/>
     most distinguished heroes that ever graced the 
     <lb/>
     navy of England—lending his voice and co<lb break="no"/>operation to the great scheme of a Union of 
     <lb/>
     British North America, as the means by which 
     <lb/>
     we are to be elevated into a position of infi<lb break="no"/>nitely greater importance than we can now 
     <lb/>
     enjoy,—as the only means of preserving these 
     <lb/>
     provinces to the Crown of England. What is 
     <lb/>
     it that has corrupted him? Need I remind 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen that the same position is occupied 
     <lb/>
     by that universal favorite in this country—the 
     <lb/>
     gallant Major-General Doyle. Does not the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member know that that distinguished 
     <lb/>
     gentleman as a soldier, as a servant of the 
     <lb/>
     Crown, as a man upon whom the responsibi<lb break="no"/>lity of our protection depends, has used all the 
     <lb/>
     influence he can exercise by argument and 
     <lb/>
     persuasion in favour of a Union of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Thus we find all those illustrious 
     <lb/>
     men standing shoulder to shoulder in this 
     <lb/>
     great question. Then there is the distinguish<lb break="no"/>ed prelate, His Grace the Archbishop, who 
     <lb/>
     has stood forward in this province, and by 
     <lb/>
     his voice and pen, urged upon the people the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of this scheme of Union as the great 
     <lb/>
     means by which the safety and prosperity of 
     <lb/>
     our country must be promoted. There is His 
     <lb/>
     Lordship the talented and astute Bishop of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia. His Lordship the Bishop of 
     <lb/>
     Arichat—the united clergy of all denomina<lb break="no"/>tions—Episcopalian, Catholic, Methodist, Pres<lb break="no"/>byterian, Baptist, men of all shades of politi<lb break="no"/>cal opinions standing in a solid phalanx, such 
     <lb/>
     as was never exhibited in this country before, 
     <lb/>
     in the face of the people of this province as the 
     <lb/>
     supporters of Confederation,and giving all the 
     <lb/>
     assistance of their talents and exertions as 
     <lb/>
     the only means by which our country may be 
     <lb/>
     elevated, and our connection with Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain preserved. Side by side you find all the 
     <lb/>
     able and distinguished judiciary of our coun<lb break="no"/>try united in sustaining this Union of British 
     <lb/>
     North America. What has corrupted the en<lb break="no"/>tire religious Press—the "Presbyterian Wit<lb break="no"/>ness," the "Wesleyan," the "<choice><sic>Christain</sic><corr>Christian</corr></choice>Mes<lb break="no"/>senger? Here you see these journals reflect<lb break="no"/>ing the views of the clergy of various denomi<lb break="no"/>nations combining to press forward this great 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Union; and yet you find the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member standing forward and declaring that 
     <lb/>
     men who only look to the welfare and security 
     <lb/>
     of their country are influenced by the base 
     <lb/>
     and contemptible motives which he has ven<lb break="no"/>tured to insinuate. I am hold to say that if 
     <lb/>
     up to the present hour there has been a sin<lb break="no"/>gle dollar of Canadian gold brought into the 
     <lb/>
     country in connection with this question I 
     <lb/>
     am ignorant of it; if there has been a states<lb break="no"/>man in the whole of Canada that would dare 
     <lb/>
     to approach a member of this Legislature or 
     <lb/>
     any one else in this country by means such as 
     <lb/>
     that, he has not insulted me by taking me in<lb break="no"/>to his confidence. Standing here as I do with 
     <lb/>the knowledge of that fact—of the dishonor<lb break="no"/>able character of this insinuation, I feel I 
     <lb/>could afford to let it pass by with the contempt 
     <lb/>

     that it deserves if it was not sent abroad into 
     <lb/>
     the remotest hamlets of this country for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of creating strife and rebellion among 
     <lb/>
     the unsophisticated and less uninformed of 
     <lb/>
     our people. I ask the hon. member if it was 
     <lb/>
     under the influence of base bribes a great num<lb break="no"/>ber of the citizens of Halifax, when the ques<lb break="no"/>tion had been fully discussed on the public 
     <lb/>
     platform by the ablest men on both sides that 
     <lb/>
     could be found, were induced to stand for<lb break="no"/>ward as the avowed supporters of Union? I do 
     <lb/>
     not mean to say that on a question of such 
     <lb/>
     deep import, involving such weighty <choice><sic>consid<lb break="no"/>derations</sic><corr>considerations</corr></choice>, there are not high-minded men who 
     <lb/>
     differ from us, but I have never insinuated— 
     <lb/>
     never have been compelled to resort to such a 
     <lb/>
     despicable position as to say that they were 
     <lb/>
     influenced by other than patriotic motives. 
     <lb/>
     Then at Truro, in the heart of our agricultural 
     <lb/>
     counties, a large body of intelligent men, con<lb break="no"/>vinced by the arguments in support of Union, 
     <lb/>
     have stood forward as its firm friends. So at 
     <lb/>
     Windsor, Kentville, Bridgetown, Annapolis, 
     <lb/>
     Parrsboro, Amherst, Pugwash, and other 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country you see men who had, in 
     <lb/>
     year's past, been diametrically opposed to 
     <lb/>
     each other on political matters, standing 
     <lb/>
     shoulder to shoulder and co-operating for the 
     <lb/>
     promotion of Colonial Union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I regret to have to allude to a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who is not in this building, and I shall deal 
     <lb/>
     with him with greater delicacy than if he 
     <lb/>
     were here; but my duty as a public man com<lb break="no"/>pels me to sink every consideration of false 
     <lb/>
     delicacy in dealing with this question, and 
     <lb/>
     place it before my fellow-countrymen free 
     <lb/>from all disguise. I believe that the time has 
     <lb/>come when man should speak to man plainly 
     <lb/>and unhesitatingly, and when men who have 
     <lb/>taken up the position that the opponents of 
     <lb/>Union have, should be exposed to the naked 
     <lb/>gaze of the people ot the Province. Need I 
     <lb/>tell the House that in the same paper which 
     <lb/>sends broadcast over the face of this country 
     <lb/>these unfounded calumnies, we see Mr. Howe 
     <lb/>over his own signature assisting the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber by his pen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I touch upon that part of the subject, 
     <lb/>
     let me first call attention to the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member, at the close of my observations 
     <lb/>
     on Thursday last, addressed a challenge to 
     <lb/>
     me to show that he was at all responsible for 
     <lb/>
     ever having committed himself in any shape 
     <lb/>
     whatever to the Union of B. N. America; 
     <lb/>
     and I am here now to accept that challenge 
     <lb/>
     and to prove from the journals of this Legis<lb break="no"/>ture that if there is a gentleman in this House 
     <lb/>
     exposed to suspicion—if we wanted an incon<lb break="no"/>sistent course of conduct on which to base an 
     <lb/>
     imputation—it is to be found in the career of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member himself, and of the gentle<lb break="no"/>man whose mouth-piece he is in this Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. This hon. member who now says that 
     <lb/>
     he has yet to hear the first argument in favour 
     <lb/>
     of Union, declared that "so many were the 
     <lb/>
     advantages of Union" that the time had ar<lb break="no"/>rived when it was necessary to deal with the 
     <lb/>
     question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Near the close of the session of 1861, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howe, then leader of the government of 
     <lb/>this Province, moved the following resolution, 
     <lb/>which passed unanimously:—

            <p>
     The hon. member does not require to say 
     <lb/>
     "hear, hear," to direct the attention of every 
     <lb/>
     intelligent gentleman in this house and coun<lb break="no"/>try to his shameful inconsistency. At a time 
     <lb/>
     when these gentlemen held the responsible 
     <lb/>
     position of Ministers of the Crown, we find the 
     <lb/>
     government of which he was a member bring<lb break="no"/>ing down to the house a resolution affirming 
     <lb/>
     in the most emphatic language that ever 
     <lb/>
     tongue can express the "many advantages of 
     <lb/>
     Union;" and in the face of that declaration 
     <lb/>
     you now see the hon member standing up and 
     <lb/>
     endeavoring to repudiate his former senti<lb break="no"/>ments so unequivocally expressed. The man 
     <lb/>
     who pledged his character as a statesman, as 
     <lb/>
     a man of integrity, to the statement that the 
     <lb/>
     great advantages accruing from a Union of 
     <lb/>
     British North America should be considered 
     <lb/>
     by all the Provinces, now ventures to 
     <lb/>
     come into the House and tell us that 
     <lb/>
     he has "yet to hear the first argu<lb break="no"/>ment in favour of that Union." I ask 
     <lb/>
     you if a public man, after an exhibition 
     <lb/>
     like that, is in a position to ask that the slight<lb break="no"/>est weight should be given to any declaration 
     <lb/>
     that he may make? He may throw his base 
     <lb/>
     insinuations into the face of this deliberative 
     <lb/>
     Assembly—he may degrade himself by at<lb break="no"/>tempting to degrade this Home, but it will 
     <lb/>
     avail nothing with every man who knows that 
     <lb/>
     the gentleman who brought here a great ques<lb break="no"/>tion of public policy, and pledged his public 
     <lb/>
     character to its support, now unblushingly de<lb break="no"/>clares that it was a farce, a delusion, and a de<lb break="no"/>ception, which he had been passing upon this 
     <lb/>
     deliberative Assembly. If I stood in such a 
     <lb/>
     position,I would forgive the hon. member if he 
     <lb/>
     attributed base and dishonorable motives as 
     <lb/>
     the reason why I had been influenced to adopt 
     <lb/>
     a course so untenable and so at variance with 
     <lb/>
     the public policy to which I stood pledged as a 
     <lb/>
     public man. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am going now to deal with another gentle<lb break="no"/>man, outside of these walls, who brought that 
     <lb/>
     resolution here and declared himself in 
     <lb/>
     the face of this country as the great expon<lb break="no"/>ent of Union. The action of the house upon 
     <lb/>
     the above resolution was followed up by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe addressing, in his capacity of Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, a circular to the Governments of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, New Brunswick, and P. E. Island, 
     <lb/>
     asking them to agree to a Conference for the

     purpose of discussing this important question 
     <lb/>
     of a Union of British North America. We 
     <lb/>
     come now to 1863, when the Hon. D'Arcy Mc<lb break="no"/>Gee visited this city to advocate this Union, 
     <lb/>
     I need not remind he house that a gentleman

     <lb/>
     one of the most distinguished statesmen of 
     <lb/>
     British North America. I speak of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     D'Arcy McGee, a gentleman who possesses 
     <lb/>
     the finest mind, the most wonderful eloquence, 
     <lb/>
     the most facile pen, and who has devoted all 
     <lb/>
     the powers of his mind, all the influence of his 
     <lb/>
     position, during the past ten years, to the work 
     <lb/>
     of uniting, consolidating, and strengthening 
     <lb/>
     the people and resources of British North 
     <lb/>
     America. Can the hon member designate in 
     <lb/>
     no other style the man whom her Majesty the 
     <lb/>
     Queen and her ministers have delighted to ho<lb break="no"/>nour who, whatever the indiscretions of his 
     <lb/>
     Youth mav have been, has devoted himself in 
     <lb/>British North America. to speak down and 
     <lb/>write down the antagonisms of race and of 
     <lb/>religion, and has contributed more than any 
     <lb/>other to unite the friends of British rule in 
     <lb/>these colonies. What was the language of 
     <lb/>Mr. Howe when this eminent statesman came 
     <lb/>among us in 1863? He visited this city year 
     <lb/>after year, and exercised his talents, as he has 
     <lb/>always done in Canada, for the elevation of 
     <lb/>our common country. He came on an invita<lb break="no"/>tion to Halifax and delivered an address in 
     <lb/>Temperance Hall on the union of British 
     <lb/>North America, and what was the opinion of 
     <lb/>Mr. Howe, as expressed on that occasion, of 
     <lb/>the man who came to this House and pledged 
     <lb/>his public reputation to the declaration that 
     <lb/>so great was the advantages of union that the 
     <lb/>Legislature ought to move in the matter for 
     <lb/>the purpose of bringing it to a happy consum<lb break="no"/>mation. Mr. Howe rose and seconded a vote 
     <lb/>of thanks to Mr. McGee in these words, as re<lb break="no"/>ported at the time:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

      <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     "Mr. Howe went on to remark that it would be in<lb break="no"/>justice to the lecturer to say more, further than he 
     <lb/>
     was with him in all he said He was for a Union of 
     <lb/>
     all the British North American Provinces, but he was 
     <lb/>
     for an intercolonial Railroad first. Then the road 
     <lb/>
     would bring about the Union. It would enable the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians to see our faces, to become familiar with 
     <lb/>
     us, and to see the number of 1000 ton-ships which we 
     <lb/>
     were building, which with our other wealth and re<lb break="no"/>sources, we are willing to throw into the one great 
     <lb/>
     stock. He thought a Union should not be delayed

     till we had drifted into difficulties. How short

     the St. Lawrence were in the hands of our enemies, 
     <lb/>
     we should be compelled to beg permission to tear 
     <lb/>
     down the British flag. What he wished for Nova

     Scotia was that she may be the frontage of a mighty 
     <lb/>
     Colony; upon which it may be truly said the sun 
     <lb/>
     never set. No man can look upon Halifax and its 
     <lb/>
     environs, its harbour, its citadel and say it was made

     for this Province alone."

     <lb/>
     reference to this great question of intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Union. Did the man who stood then, as he does now, 
     <lb/>
     at Mr. Howe's back, call the scheme of Union a snare 
     <lb/>
     and a delusion? No, he stood there to publish those 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of Mr Howe in his own paper, for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of proving that that gentleman was a far<lb break="no"/>seeing patriot, who recognized the position which 
     <lb/>
     British North America must occupy, and the mea<lb break="no"/>sures that were necessary to her security. But that 
     <lb/>
     is not all. ln 1864, subsequent to my having carried 
     <lb/>
     a resolution in this House in favor of a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     union of the Maritime Colonies, a visit was made to 
     <lb/>
     this Province bv a large deputation of Canadians, 
     <lb/>
     headed by Mr. McGee, upon the invitation of promi<lb break="no"/>nent merchants of this city, who came forward and 
     <lb/>
     contributed their means towards receiving their 
     <lb/>
     guests, and declaring a resolution that it was of 
     <lb/>
     the greatest commercial and political importance that 
     <lb/>
     there should be a closer union between Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and Canada. A splendid banquet was given on that 
     <lb/>
     occasion in the drill shed to our visitors, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe was present to declare that no change had 
     <lb/>
     taken place in his views since in Temperance Hall 
     <lb/>
     he stood forward and endorsed the opinions express<lb break="no"/>ed by Mr. McGee. It will be remembered, that pre<lb break="no"/>vious to this time the Government of Canada had 
     <lb/>
     re-organized on the basis of endeavoring to obtain a 
     <lb/>
     federal union of British North America; and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McGee was present as the exponent of that policy. 
     <lb/>
     I spoke on that occasion, and expressed the slight 
     <lb/>
     with which I had witnessed the political coalition in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and the hope it gave me that when Cartier 
     <lb/>
     and Brown were rowing in the same best to the tune 
     <lb/>
     of "Row Brothers, Row," the result would be a 
     <lb/>
     Union of British North America. It was known, at 
     <lb/>
     the same time, I may here say, for it had been an<lb break="no"/>nounced in Parliament that Canada was about to 
     <lb/>
     send a deputation to the Maritime Convention to be 
     <lb/>
     held at Charlottetown, for the purpose of ascertain<lb break="no"/>ing whether the larger Union could not be carried 
     <lb/>
     out. I shall now quote from the remarks that were 
     <lb/>
     made by Mr. Howe on the occasion in question, as 
     <lb/>
     given by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sun</hi> newspaper which is now engaged in 
     <lb/>
     aspersing the character of public men more consist<lb break="no"/>ent than themselves upon this question of Union. 
     <lb/>
     The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sun</hi> says:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <quote><p>
     "Hon. Mr. Howe was received with most hearty 
     <lb/>
     cheers. His speech was short and appropriate. He 
     <lb/>
     was no stranger among them. His voice had been 
     <lb/>
     heard in almost every town in the Provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British America, and would again if occasion re<lb break="no"/>quired it; and he was in hopes of yet seeing the dream 
     <lb/>
     of his boyhood realized —the Union of these Provin<lb break="no"/>ces in one great federation under the old flag of 
     <lb/>
     England, an event which he hoped was at no distant 
     <lb/>
     date. We are sorry that our space will not allow us 
     <lb/>
     to give this gentleman's remarks at greater length." 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Now what next? The government invited Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe as the exponent of a large portion of the pub<lb break="no"/>lic sentiment of this country to go upon the Delega<lb break="no"/>tion. He told me, as I have stated in his presence, 
     <lb/>
     that if there was any great work in which his ser<lb break="no"/>vices were required he was ready to give us his as<lb break="no"/>sistance: and accordingly we invited him, and his 
     <lb/>
     reply is on the journals of this House. That invita<lb break="no"/>tion remember, was tendered after he was aware of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian policy of extending the Union to all 
     <lb/>
     the Provinces—after he had endorsed that policy by 
     <lb/>
     saying he hoped Union would be secured. Deeply do 
     <lb/>
     I deplore that Mr. Howe was unable to attend on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion, for I believe that the difficulties and 
     <lb/>
     embarrassments that the friends of British American 
     <lb/>
     Union have had to encounter in dealing with this 
     <lb/>
     great question arose in a large measure from the fact 
     <lb/>
     that they were deprived at the Conference 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Howe's services. I am only repeating 
     <lb/>
     that which we hear from the warmest riends 
     <lb/>
     he has in this Province, that if he had attended 
     <lb/>
     at the Convention there would not be a man 
     <lb/>
     who would be more enthusiastic in pressing 
     <lb/>
     forward this great scheme than himself. 
     <lb/>
     However, he addressed me a letter in which he 
     <lb/>
     expressed his deep regret that he could not at<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="num">217</fw>
               
     tend, and said he would be back by the <choice><sic>mid<lb break="no"/>le</sic><corr>middle</corr></choice> of October prepared to assist us in carrying 
     <lb/>
     out any measure we agreed upon. Now you 
     <lb/>
     see the same man who thus bound himself to 
     <lb/>
     assist us in promoting anything that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the day and his own political   
     <lb/>
     friends might concur in, to-day in the "Morn<lb break="no"/>ing Chronicle" denouncing these gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     his own tried political associates, as traitors, 
     <lb/>
     and holding them up to the execration of their 
     <lb/>
     countrymen all over the province. If there 
     <lb/>
     was a spark of gratitude in his heart he should 
     <lb/>
     know that the men he is denouncing as con<lb break="no"/>spirators are those to whom he owed the posi<lb break="no"/>tion and all the advantages that he has enjoy<lb break="no"/>ed for the past ten years. They are the men 
     <lb/>
     who sustained him in this house, who sent him 
     <lb/>
     to England and enabled him to secure the Im<lb break="no"/>perial office which he lately held, and this is 
     <lb/>
     their reward! If I stood in the position that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howe stands in to-day on this great ques<lb break="no"/>tion of union, I would forgive the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for denouncing me as a traitor and a con<lb break="no"/>spirator, and feel hat he had reason to insinu<lb break="no"/>ate that I was influenced by the most base and 
     <lb/>
     unworthy motives. Having said this much, 
     <lb/>
     having read the hon member for East Halifax 
     <lb/>
     a lesson which he will probably never forget, 
     <lb/>
     I come now to the ques ion as it lies before 
     <lb/>
     the house. I ask whether we are in a position 
     <lb/>
     to deal with this question. It has be n denied 
     <lb/>
     that we are—it has been said that this is a 
     <lb/>
     change in the consitution of the country which 
     <lb/>
     must be ratified by the people at the polls, if 
     <lb/>
     it is to be constitutionally made. What, I 
     <lb/>
     ask, gave Nova Scotia her constitution? From 
     <lb/>
     what source does it come ? Looking at 
     <lb/>
     the quarter from which it comes do you find 
     <lb/>
     anything to lead us to suppose that there is 
     <lb/>
     anything unconstitutional in a Parliament 
     <lb/>
     dealing with a question of this character. You 
     <lb/>
     find her Majesty's ministers, the very sources 
     <lb/>
     from which our constitution was received, day 
     <lb/>
     by day urging, not that the Legislature shall be 
     <lb/>
     dissolved, and an appeal made to the people 
     <lb/>
     of this Province, but that the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the people here assembled, in virtue of the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional power they possess, should deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question. You find the very highest 
     <lb/>
     authority in reference to constitutional mat<lb break="no"/>ters, the British Government, committing it<lb break="no"/>self unhesitatingly to the only statesmanlike 
     <lb/>
     position, that the Parliament of the country, 
     <lb/>          
     the represen atives of the people, had the pow<lb break="no"/>er to deal wi h all such matters—that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of a country are assumed to be present in 
     <lb/>
     the persons of those whom they have elected 
     <lb/>
     to represent them. In that constitutional doc<lb break="no"/>trine or not? Is it sustained by British prac<lb break="no"/>tice which is our great exemplar, or opposed 
     <lb/>
     even to American practice, or to constitution<lb break="no"/>al usage in any part of the world where con<lb break="no"/>stitutional government exists. That the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of a country may not be changed by the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament? What do you see at this moment 
     <lb/>
     in England? When the present House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons was elected, the question of Reform 
     <lb/>
     was hardly mentioned at the Polls; the people 
     <lb/>
     had no opportunity of expressing their opi<lb break="no"/>nions on the subject; but now you see the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament thus elected, preparing to deal 
     <lb/>
     with its own constitution, by adding nearly 
     <lb/>
     500,000 electors to its list of voters. Members 
     <lb/>
     of Parliament have declared that the change 
     <lb/>
     is so fundamental that it will hand over the 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
     
     governing power to a different class; but no 
     <lb/>
     one has rendered himself ridiculous by declar<lb break="no"/>ing the Parliament was not competent to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question, and bring about this im<lb break="no"/>portant change in the constitution of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Is not Congress, at this moment, changing 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution of the United States in the 
     <lb/>
     most important respects? The time to ascertain 
     <lb/>
     whether a question is constitutional or not—to 
     <lb/>
     obtain a dispassionate opinion from the public 
     <lb/>
     mind in the country—is not when it is a subject 
     <lb/>
     of excitement and controversy. You must go 
     <lb/>
     back and study the pages of the history of our 
     <lb/>
     country to ascertain if you can find upon the 
     <lb/>
     record what are the real and deliberate utteran<lb break="no"/>ces of public men on both sides of politics. I 
     <lb/>am prepared to go back and turn up the page of 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia's history, and give to the house the 
     <lb/>statements of public men of all shades of politics, 
     <lb/>that will be clear and conclusive upon the sub<lb break="no"/>ject. The house will recollect that many years 
     <lb/>ago the Hon. Mr. Johnston, when sitting on the 
     <lb/>Opposition benches, proposed a resolution, pro 
     <lb/>viding for a Union of British North America. 
     <lb/>That resolution became the subject of calm and 
     <lb/>dispassionate discussion, as it should always ob<lb break="no"/>tain at the hands of the Legislature. Two of 
     <lb/>the ablest men who have ever figured in the af<lb break="no"/>fairs of the country were sitting on the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment side—I refer to Mr. Howe and Mr.
     <lb/>Young. These gentlemen discussed the question 
     <lb/>in all its aspects, and it was never questioned 
     <lb/>whether the Parliament had the power of dealing 
     <lb/>with the constitution, but, as I shall prove to 
     <lb/>you, the utterances of the ablest statesmen 
     <lb/>on both sides went to show that the power 
     <lb/>of the Legislature to change the constitution ol 
     <lb/>the Province was admittcd in the clearest and 
     <lb/>most conclusive manner:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     "Mr. Johnston said on this occasion:—"I do this, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that at the outset it may be seen to be my desire 
     <lb/>
     that the Imperial and Colonial Governments should 
     <lb/>
     be drawn to consider this great question and to mould 
     <lb/>
     it after full deliberation into some form fit to be 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">presented for the consideration of the several Legisla<lb break="no"/>tures</hi> and that I presume not at this stage of the en<lb break="no"/>quiry to offer any specific scheme of my own."

            <p>
     Mr. Johnston thus emphatically recorded his

     opinion as to the power of the Legislature to

     change the constitution.

     dancing before the eyes of some hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     still. Mr. Howe, however, in the course of his 
     <lb/>
     remarks, gave in his adhesion to some such plan 
     <lb/>
     as was devised at Quebec. He said:— 
     <lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     "By a Federal Union of the Colonies we should

     Mr. Young said: "It will be apparent, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, from these views, that while I am favorable to an

     So, at a time when the question was calmly 
     <lb/>
     debated, and when there was no excitement, you 
     <lb/>
     have these distinct utterances of all these able 
     <lb/>
     statesmen, both British and Colonial, that the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament of the country has power to change 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of the country, and that that is 
     <lb/>
     the proper mode of dealing with such a subject. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I say that I am in a position to state 
     <lb/>
     that the Legislature is justified in taking such 
     <lb/>
     action upon the vital and important question, as 
     <lb/>
     in their deliberative opinion is calculated to pro<lb break="no"/>mote the best interests of the Province and of 
     <lb/>
     British North America. It will thus be seen that 
     <lb/>
     the issue that has been raised by parties for purpo<lb break="no"/>ses of their own—who wish to overthrow the ex<lb break="no"/>isting administration and come into power them<lb break="no"/>selves, is swept away like chaff before the wind 
     <lb/>
     neither constitutional principle nor precedent 
     <lb/>
     being found to support their views. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After having sustained my position by argu<lb break="no"/>ments like these—after having brought the opi<lb break="no"/>nions of all these eminent public men to prove 
     <lb/>
     the proper and constitutional mode of dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the subject—after having shown that in 
     <lb/>
     the whole history of Great Britain and of the 
     <lb/>
     United States no parallel can be found for the 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people which has been proposed — 
     <lb/>
     I think the opponents of Union are not in a sit<lb break="no"/>uation to challenge the right of this house in the 
     <lb/>
     exercise of its legitimate functions to pursue 
     <lb/>
     such a course as the interest of our common 
     <lb/>
     country demands. They cannot find one exam<lb break="no"/>ple of a question like this being referred to the 
     <lb/>
     people at the polls, either in Great Britain or the 
     <lb/>
     United States,—there is one, but it is not one 
     <lb/>which they are likely to adduce for adoption by 
     <lb/>a British Assembly. It is the occasion on which 
     <lb/>the people of France were driven at the point of the 
     <lb/>bayonet to the polls, to sustain a perfect despot<lb break="no"/>ism in the country, to part with every vestige of 
     <lb/>liberty that freemen value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having already stated in detail the arguments 
     <lb/>
     in favor of Union which weigh upon my own 
     <lb/>
     mind, I feel l would be trespassing upon the 
     <lb/>
     House if I were, on the present occasion, to go at 
     <lb/>
     any length into a question which has been so ful<lb break="no"/>ly discussed. I feel that when I have drawn the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the House to the fact that, not only 
     <lb/>
     have gentlemen politically opposed to each other 
     <lb/>
     been brought to co operate on this question, but 
     <lb/>
     the greatest minds of the country who have ever 
     <lb/>
     taken a prominent share in public affairs are en<lb break="no"/>dorsing this action. It is unnecessary for me to 
     <lb/>
     weary the House with any lengthy observations. 
     <lb/>
     I am not surprised that Mr. Howe should have

            <fw type="running">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY</fw>
            <fw type="num">219</fw>
          
     brought forward this great question of Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Union. At a time when party conflict raged in 
     <lb/>
     this country as never before, in 1861, the opposi<lb break="no"/>on party in this House stated that they were pre<lb break="no"/>pared to sustain their oppnents in a measure 
     <lb/>
     that was calculated to advance the Union of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America. At that time the advocacy 
     <lb/>
     of that subject was popular to the last degree; nor 
     <lb/>
     was it till the last moment that men were found 
     <lb/>
     unpatriotic enough to ignore their own previous 
     <lb/>
     actions in order to antagonize a great national 
     <lb/>
     movement, in order to obtain an unfair advantage
     <lb/>
     over the Government of the day. Although by 
     <lb/>
     the dissemination of inflammatory productions, 
     <lb/>
     by conjuring up the frightful bugbear of taxation, 
     <lb/>
     a large body of the people have been brought to 
     <lb/>
     look upon the Quebec scheme with disfavor I am 
     <lb/>
     proud to know that the best minds of this country 
     <lb/>
     give their hearty sanction and are prepared to sus<lb break="no"/>tain this movement to unite British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica by every means in their power. Is it strange 
     <lb/>
     that such should be the case? What future can 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia have apart from a Union of British 
     <lb/>
     North America. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Look at the comparatively insignificant position 
     <lb/>
     we occupy and tell me, surrounded as we are by 
     <lb/>
     hostile tariffs, with a mere handful of population, 
     <lb/>
     what future can we look forward to unless it is 
     <lb/>
     in connection with <choice><sic>theconsolidation</sic><corr>the consolidation</corr></choice> of British 
     <lb/>
     North America under one government. Look<lb break="no"/>ing only at the commercial aspect of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion-at the expansion of our trade and our 
     <lb/>
     great facilities for manufactures, is it a matter 
     <lb/>
     for surprise that the most intelligent men in this 
     <lb/>
     country have combined, as they have never done 
     <lb/>
     on any other question? The geographical po<lb break="no"/>sition we occupy, can be of little service, and the 
     <lb/>
     great resources we possess are all comparatively 
     <lb/>
     useless and can never obtain full development 
     <lb/>
     except, as Mr. Howe has said, by making this 
     <lb/>
     province the Atlantic frontage for a mighty British 
     <lb/>
     American country. Let us turn our attention to 
     <lb/>
     the question of an Intercolonial Railway. Great 
     <lb/>
     as may be its commercial advantages, though it 
     <lb/>
     may make Nova Scotia the wharf of British 
     <lb/>
     North America, everybody knows that it has 
     <lb/>
     been stated time after time by Mr. Howe as lay<lb break="no"/>ing at the very foundation of the security and 
     <lb/>
     advancement of British America. He said 
     <lb/>
     he wanted the Intercolonial Railway because it 
     <lb/>
     would bring about Union. For twenty long 
     <lb/>
     years the ablest public men had combined all 
     <lb/>
     their talents and energies to bring about the con<lb break="no"/>struction of this great work but all their efforts 
     <lb/>
     have proved futile. The moment however the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Union is consummated, the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway becomes an accomplished fact.
            </p>
            
     <p>The delegates came back not only with the evi<lb break="no"/>dence that the general scheme gave that these 
     <lb/>
     Provinces would have all the legitimate influence 
     <lb/>
     that they were entitled to, but with the proof that 
     <lb/>
     the twenty millions of dollars required to build 
     <lb/>
     the Inter-colonial Railway were secured by Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Union. But the great commercial ad<lb break="no"/>vantages derived from Union have been so fully 
     <lb/>
     detailed on the platform and in the press in a 
     <lb/>
     manner that must carry conviction to every intel<lb break="no"/>ligent mind, that it is altogether superfluous for 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            
            <cb/>
           
            <p>
     me to dwell on this part of the subject. No man 
     <lb/>
     can look at the position of our country without 
     <lb/>
     recognizing at once that, surrounded, as we are, 
     <lb/>
     by hostile tariffs, our great facilities for manufac<lb break="no"/>tures must lie dormant. If, therefore, we wish to 
     <lb/>develope enterprize, and make this country a great 
     <lb/>bee hive of industry, we must, without delay, 
     <lb/>carry out this scheme of lnter-colonial Union. 
     <lb/>The Reciprocity Treaty has been swept away, 
     <lb/>and no intelligent man, whether opposed to the 
     <lb/>Quebec scheme or not, can fail to see that the 
     <lb/>basis on which our previous prosperity rested has 
     <lb/>been affected to a large extent and that there 
     <lb/>should be found some counterbalancing means 
     <lb/>by which our common interests may be promoted. 
     <lb/>Important, however, as these matters are, there is 
     <lb/>another question to which I have hardly referred, 
     <lb/>which lies at the foundation of the whole argu— 
     <lb/>ment. Whilst I am prepared to support this 
     <lb/>Union under the belief that our political and com<lb break="no"/>mercial prosperity is indissolubly bound up in the 
     <lb/>measure, I would say that I would accept it at 
     <lb/>some sacrifice for the purpose of adopting the 
     <lb/>only means by which I could hand down to my 
     <lb/>children the priceless boon of British connection. 
     <lb/>I must here again invite the attention of the House 
     <lb/>to the following observations of Mr Howe on 
     <lb/>this subject, and for which the hon. member is 
     <lb/>responsible, for he was a member of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment who brought them here. In a state paper 
     <lb/>in the Journals of 1862 Mr. Howe declared:

     it had ceased, even at this late hour he had thrown

     that as great numbers of the Fenians have been

     When asked if I thought the Fenians could

     <lb/>England, attributes his loss to the supineness 
     <lb/>or connivance of the British Government, and 
     <lb/>is a Fenian of the most irate description.

     <lb/>lies here. At this moment the Cabinet at 
     <lb/>Washington is involved in complications of no 
     <lb/>ordinary kind. The great Republican party 
     <lb/>and the President have been at issue, upon the 
     <lb/>reconstruction policy, for ten weeks, and one 
     <lb/>Branch has just passed a Bill over the veto by 
     <lb/>a two-thirds majority. Both parties are ap<lb break="no"/>pealing to the country for support. The Fen<lb break="no"/>ians are said to control a million of votes, and 
     <lb/>certainly make up a formidable portion of the 
     <lb/>Democratic party that supports the President. 
     <lb/>Those who cherish hard feeling against the 
     <lb/>Provinces and the British Government control 
     <lb/>a good many more. Out of these complica<lb break="no"/>tions no human being, at this moment, can tell 
     <lb/>what may or may not arise. In the mean<lb break="no"/>while a flying squadron has been ordered to 
     <lb/>the North Atlantic, and a formidable iron

     The House will remember that when the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Halifax wrested the paper of which 
     <lb/>
     he was the responsible editor from one of the Que<lb break="no"/>bec Delegates for the purpose of writing down 
     <lb/>
     this question of an Inter-colonial Union there ap<lb break="no"/>peared in its columns a series of letters entitled 
     <lb/>
     "The Botheration Scheme;' and it is now known 
     <lb/>
     that they were written by Mr. Howe-that has 
     <lb/>
     never been denied. What was the first position 
     <lb/>
     taken by Mr. Howe, the man who induced the 
     <lb/>
     House to declare that so many and so great were 
     <lb/>
     the manifold advantages of a Union of all these 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, that they should give the Government 
     <lb/>
     the power to deal with it? He come out as the 
     <lb/>
     avowed enemy of any union whatever, because it 
     <lb/>
     was going to destroy Responsible Government.   
     <lb/>
     You see the same thing stated in the communica<lb break="no"/>tion of this morning. If to unite British Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca under one Government and into one Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, is to destroy Responsible Government,
     <lb/>
     where was Responsible Government when the 
     <lb/>
     policy to which he had invited the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House adopted? Again, any Union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada was denounced because there were a mil<lb break="no"/>lion of Frenchmen in Canada. Were there any 
     <lb/>
     Frenchmen in Canada when that resolution offer<lb break="no"/>ed by Mr. Howe passed this House? Had there 
     <lb/>
     no rebellion in Canada when he persuaded the 
     <lb/>
     House to agree to that policy of Union? Having 
     <lb/>
     denounced all Union—having trampled under 
     <lb/>
     his feet all the principles of his previous life, 
     <lb/>
     what more? The next "Botheration" article 
     <lb/>
     treated us to an eulogium upon Republican 
     <lb/>
     institutions such as was hardly ever seen 
     <lb/>
     in a British paper. Mr Howe's language went 
     <lb/>
     to prove that the sooner the worthloss bauble of 
     <lb/>
     North American institutions is swept away and 
     <lb/>
     replaced by the priceless <choice><sic>g</sic><corr>gift</corr></choice> of Republican insti<lb break="no"/>tutions the better for us. I can forgive American 
     <lb/>
     statesmen holding such language those who owe 
     <lb/>
     their fealty to the institutions of that great Repub<lb break="no"/>lic; but I am not prepared to hear this language 
     <lb/>
     from the same man who on the platform in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, when a delegate from this Province to the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial government, denounced the Republican 
     <lb/>
     institutions of the United States and held them 
     <lb/>
     up to the scorn and contempt of every British 
     <lb/>
     subject. When his own country is to be consoli<lb break="no"/>

            <cb/>

     dated, when a great scheme necessary to the 
     <lb/>
     security of British America is proposed does he 
     <lb/>
     still hold the opinions which he uttered when in 
     <lb/>
     England as the result of 20 years study of Ameri<lb break="no"/>can institutions? Doe he show himself a man 
     <lb/>
     of public principle? No! He shows that he can 
     <lb/>
     change his opinions at pleasure, and propound 
     <lb/>
     whatever views will best suit his interests, and 
     <lb/>
     that he is inflenced by considerations that ought 
     <lb/>
     not to influence any public man, and may thus be 
     <lb/>
     induced to sustain one set of principles to-day, 
     <lb/>
     and asserts others dramatrically opposed to these 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     I believe what the hon gentleman says in what 
     <lb/>
     I have read of his letter is true. It is consistent 
     <lb/>
     with all the information that the government 
     <lb/>
     possesses. The information coming to us from 
     <lb/>
     hour to hour shows the existence and widespread 
     <lb/>
     ramifications of the Fenian organization. What 
     <lb/>
     ought to be the conduct of a patriot and a states<lb break="no"/>man in the face of a danger like that. I believe 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howe has not colored the matter too strongly 
     <lb/>
     that these parties are going to make an onslaught 
     <lb/>
     upon some portion of these provinces; and the 
     <lb/>
     men who will be responsible <choice><sic>far</sic><corr>for</corr></choice> all its terrors 
     <lb/>
     will be the men who are resisting Inter-colonial 
     <lb/>
     Union and indoctrinating our people with senti<lb break="no"/>ments that may shake their allegiance to the 
     <lb/>
     Crown. It is only last night the Lieut-Governor 
     <lb/>
     received a despatch that two hundred Fenians had 
     <lb/>
     arrived at Portland; and there is deep apprehen<lb break="no"/>sion that St John or Yarmouth may be the first 
     <lb/>
     object of attack. In the presence of a common 
     <lb/>
     danger like that, the duty of a patriot and states<lb break="no"/>man would be to sink all differences and combine 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of protecting the rights and liber<lb break="no"/>ties of British North America. Let the agis of 
     <lb/>
     British protection be withdrawn and what can 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia do in the face of such danger as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe depicts? Simply nothing. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Halifax told us that the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America are looking to British North America, 
     <lb/>
     feeling that if they only possessed these Provinces   
     <lb/>
     they would become the first Naval Power in the 
     <lb/>
     world and able to dictate their terms of all nations. 
     <lb/>
     That statement carries conviction with it to the 
     <lb/>
     mind of every man. I will now ask the House if I 
     <lb/>
     were corrupted by American gold, enamoured of 
     <lb/>
     American institutions, believing that the best thing 
     <lb/>
     that I could do would be to transfer this country 
     <lb/>
     to the United States of America what are the 
     <lb/>
     most effective measures that I could take? 
     <lb/>
     Would it not be to keep the Provinces dis<lb break="no"/>united and repel the protection of the mother<lb break="no"/>country, and then button-hole every man whom 
     <lb/>
     I could influence, and undermine his confi<lb break="no"/>dence in our institutions by whispering into 
     <lb/>
     his ear the insidious statement that Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     could not protect us? That the power of the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States was too gigantic-that Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     herself would fail to protect even the city of Hali<lb break="no"/>fax against such ships as were now possessed by 
     <lb/>
     the American Government? And when I had in<lb break="no"/>doctrinated the minds of my countrymen with 
     <lb/>
     that idea, I would tell them that the best plan is 
     <lb/>
     to reject the policy of the Imperial Government.   
     <lb/>
     We all know that the feeling of loyalty to one's

     country, the pride in its institutions, lies to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that their institutions are able to afford protection 
     <lb/>
     to life and property. Therefore the moment you 
     <lb/>
     have carried conviction to the minds of the people 
     <lb/>
     that Great Britain is unable to protect us, and 
     <lb/>
     that they stand in the presence of so gigantic a 
     <lb/>
     power that it has only to will to take them, then 
     <lb/>
     you undermine their loyalty. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Now we have Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe in that attitude;</hi> since his return, in the

     <lb/>
     the highest authorities of the land, you find him 
     <lb/>
     constantly holding forth the doctrine that Great

     even Great Britain at her back, all she could do 
     <lb/>
     would not prevent her being swept away when the 
     <lb/>
     American Government wished it. If I stood in a 
     <lb/>
     position like that, the hon. mem. for Halifax might 
     <lb/>
     be justified in making us an object of suspicion 
     <lb/>
     and throwing out his taunts and <choice><sic>inuendos</sic><corr>innuendos</corr></choice> about 
     <lb/>
     base bribes having influenced public men. Here 
     <lb/>
     you see the man who stood but yesterday on the 
     <lb/>
     very watch tower of the question of intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Union—having indoctrinated the people with the 
     <lb/>
     sentiment of Union—having held up Republican 
     <lb/>
     institutions to scorn and derision; now standing 
     <lb/>
     forth and throwing his whole power into the 
     <lb/>
     scale of Opposition to Intercolonial Union 
     <lb/>
     magnifying the power of the United States 
     <lb/>
     extravagantly. What more? You have at the 
     <lb/>
     same time that this most insidious poison is being 
     <lb/>
     instilled into the ear of every one in the com<lb break="no"/>munity, the leading opponents of Union unhesi<lb break="no"/>tatingly avowing preference for Annexation to 
     <lb/>
     the United States. (Cheers) I ask you to put 
     <lb/>
     these facts together and I will not require to ad<lb break="no"/>duce the treasonable utterances of Mr. Annand 
     <lb/>
     on the streets which have been taken back and 
     <lb/>
     apologized for on the floors of the House. I say 
     <lb/>
     then, under such circumstances, I cannot come 
     <lb/>
     to any other conclusion than that the time has 
     <lb/>
     come when every man whether public or private, 
     <lb/>
     who wishes to save the county and preserve the 
     <lb/>
     connection with the mother country, should 
     <lb/>
     speak out boldly and manfully, irrespective of 
     <lb/>
     any personal consideration. Holding the senti<lb break="no"/>ments I do - believing that the crisis has come 
     <lb/>
     when we must decide whether we shall be annex<lb break="no"/>ed to the United States or remain connected with 
     <lb/>
     the Parent state. I would be the blackest traitor 
     <lb/>
     that ever disgraced a country if I did not by every 
     <lb/>
     means in my power urge upon this Legislature 
     <lb/>
     to prove equal to the emergency and take that 
     <lb/>
     course which, in a few months will secure that 
     <lb/>
     consolidation of British North America and the 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Crown of Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     which I believe, which I know it is the sincere wish 
     <lb/>
     of the people to secure, and which can alone place 
     <lb/>
     these Provinces in a position that will at once 
     <lb/>
     give them dignity of position and ensure their 
     <lb/>
     safety. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having therefore, given the subject the most 
     <lb/>
     careful consideration, having submitted the pro<lb break="no"/>position of the hon member for Richmond to the 
     <lb/>
     Government and to the gentlemen who are opposed 
     <lb/>
     to us politically, but who are associated with us 
     <lb/>
     on this question, we have come to the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that it is our duty to the House and to the coun<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
        
     try to meet in all frankness the proposal that has 
     <lb/>
     been made. We feel that difficulties have arisen 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the Quebec scheme which 
     <lb/>
     require such an arrangement as been proposed, 
     <lb/>
     in order to remove the objections that exist. I 
     <lb/>
     can only say, in reference to this matter, that 
     <lb/>
     Canada has accepted the basis of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     scheme by a large majority, and that any altera<lb break="no"/>tion in the terms obtained from the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government must be even more favorable to the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces. I believe that the scheme 
     <lb/>
     provided ample security for the interests of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, but at the same time there are none of us 
     <lb/>
     who have been associated with it who would not 
     <lb/>
     be too glad to obtain any concession that may be 
     <lb/>
     still more favorable to the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     The Imperial Government and Parliament will 
     <lb/>
     have an opportunity of largely improving that 
     <lb/>
     scheme, and giving us an amount of consideration 
     <lb/>
     that otherwise we might not obtain. It must be 
     <lb/>
     remembered that let Canada, Nova Scotia, and 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick pass any scheme they please, that 
     <lb/>
     does not unite British North America. The only 
     <lb/>
     means by which we can be united is by an act of 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Parliament. The Government can 
     <lb/>
     only say what bill they will submit to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament; they cannot tell what will 
     <lb/>
     come out of that Parliament. This resolution, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, provides all the guarantees that can be 
     <lb/>
     had for a plan of Union being adopted by the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Parliament, advised, during the passage 
     <lb/>
     of the act, by able and intelligent representatives 
     <lb/>
     of all parties, while it is under consideration.

            <p>
     Mr. ARCHIBALD said:—After the very long 
     <lb/>
     and elaborate address to which we have listen<lb break="no"/>ed, it would not be good taste on my part to 
     <lb/>
     detain the House long, but I feel that occupy<lb break="no"/>ing the position which I have occupied on this 
     <lb/>
     subject, I could not sit silent on the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of such a resolution as that before the 
     <lb/>
     House. I regret greatly that in the discussion 
     <lb/>
     of this subject, it has been thought necessary 
     <lb/>
     by the Provincial Secretary to address the 
     <lb/>
     House in the impassioned tone and style of 
     <lb/>
     the speech to which we have just listened. I 
     <lb/>
     do not affect to be surprised at the course he 
     <lb/>
     has taken. Perhaps I could hardly have ex<lb break="no"/>pected him, under the circumstances, to take a 
     <lb/>
     different course; still I feel that if there ever 
     <lb/>
     was a question in which passion should be si<lb break="no"/>lent, which should be considered with calm<lb break="no"/>ness and deliberation, it is this. The question 
     <lb/>
     before us is the greatest that could be submit<lb break="no"/>ted to this country or this legislature, and 
     <lb/>
     requires that we should look at it soberly and 
     <lb/>
     thoughtfully, in the light of the events which 
     <lb/>
     are transpiring around us. The Pro. Sec. has 
     <lb/>
     referred to the action of Her Majesty's gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on the question of Reform, as afford<lb break="no"/>ing evidence that it is competent for us to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the question without necessarily refer<lb break="no"/>ing it to the people. He has alluded to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the effect of the proposition now be<lb break="no"/>fore the Imperial Parliament is to make an 
     <lb/>
     enormous transfer of power from the class 
     <lb/>
     that now enjoys it to a different class, and he

     has not been questioned there. The case in 
     <lb/>
     England is a strong case, but the precedent in 
     <lb/>
     our own Legislature is a stronger one. There 
     <lb/>
     the legislation proposed is in the line of ex<lb break="no"/>tending the power of the people. How was it 
     <lb/>
     here? The members of the last Parliament 
     <lb/>
     came here elected by the people under an al<lb break="no"/>most universal franchise. Yet without. any 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people we cut off one-fourth 
     <lb/>
     of the entire constituency of the country. 
     <lb/>
     Now whether it was right or not, is not the 
     <lb/>
     point. The question now is the power a Le<lb break="no"/>gislature possessed with reference to any

     change in the constitution. The moment the

     power is conceded in that case, it is conceded 
     <lb/>
     in this. If we can abridge the authority and 
     <lb/>
     power of those who elect us, we can deal in 
     <lb/>
     the same way with ourselves and with the 
     <lb/>
     power of the Legislature. I am free to admit 
     <lb/>
     that it is a power which should be exercised 
     <lb/>
     only in cases of emergency, and where prompt 
     <lb/>
     action is demanded. We have been told, and 
     <lb/>
     I am astonished to hear the statement, that 
     <lb/>
     we are proceeding to strike down the princi<lb break="no"/>ples of responsibility which have given free 
     <lb/>
     government to the people of this country.— 
     <lb/>
     Now, what is stamped on the very forefront of 
     <lb/>the Quebec scheme? That the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment shall be conducted on the principles 
     <lb/>of responsibility to the entire people, just as our 
     <lb/>own now is at this moment, so that the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of the Federal Government are precise<lb break="no"/>ly those which we possess in this country.— 
     <lb/>Our Legislature is left to be moulded as we 
     <lb/>choose; our local administration, unless we 
     <lb/>wish otherwise. will be the same as at present, 
     <lb/>so that every principle of responsibility to the 
     <lb/>people is retained as it is now. In the local 
     <lb/>administration the responsibility lies to this 
     <lb/>people,—in the general administration, to the 
     <lb/>people of the entire group. The old altars re<lb break="no"/>main—the worshippers have still the same 
     <lb/>faith; but in the metropolitan cathedral, or to 
     <lb/>borrow a figure from the Presbyterian church, 
     <lb/>in the National Assembly, will be those who 
     <lb/>have the care of all the churches. Therefore, 
     <lb/>while we leave intact the government of the 
     <lb/>country, all we do is to have these matters, 
     <lb/>which are of common and general concern, 
     <lb/>transferred to the General Legislature. We 
     <lb/>are told that the time for changing institutions 
     <lb/>is the time of peace and prosperity, that the 
     <lb/>only time for union is when we can calmly 
     <lb/>and deliberately consider all the arguments 
     <lb/>and objections. Such a doctrine falsifies the 
     <lb/>entire current of history. When was ever a 
     <lb/>union effected between i dependent commu<lb break="no"/>nities with jealousies and rivalries which in<lb break="no"/>dependence begets, except under the presence 
     <lb/>of the most cogent necessities? What gave 
     <lb/>birth to the union over our border? Was the 
     <lb/>proposition submitted to the different States 
     <lb/>in time of peace? Not so. The union, such as 
     <lb/>it was at first, was cemented only under the 
     <lb/>pressure of a war, with the mother country. 
     <lb/>If the people of the States had waited for union 
     <lb/>till that pressure had ceased to exist, they 
     <lb/>would have been destroyed <choice><sic>peace-meal</sic><corr>piecemeal</corr></choice>, and 
     <lb/>would have had no union at all. From 1774 
     <lb/>till the time of peace the government had been 
     <lb/>carried on under a Congress which arose at 
     <lb/>the promptings of necessity, and assumed a 
     <lb/>centralized power, but when peace came the 
     <lb/>centralization ended, the States pulled apart, 
     <lb/>prejudice and passion denuded them, and it 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <cb/>
 
            <p>
     was not until ruin stared them in the face that 
     <lb/>
     they were again forced to unite with closer 
     <lb/>
     bands and in a more solid union. The same 
     <lb/>
     has been the case with the other unions of the 
     <lb/>
     world. The merest tyro in history knows that 
     <lb/>
     the United Provinces of the Old World com<lb break="no"/>bined only under the iron heel of Spanish des<lb break="no"/>potism. It was the hostile legions of Alva 
     <lb/>
     that created a union which peace and prosperi<lb break="no"/>ty would never have produced. All the other 
     <lb/>
     unions of independent States, that have had 
     <lb/>
     any permanence, are those which have been 
     <lb/>
     cemented under the pressure of urgent neces<lb break="no"/>sities. The Prov. Sec. has referred to a letter 
     <lb/>
     which has recently appeared, and which will 
     <lb/>
     have great influence. I will not undertake to 
     <lb/>
     say that I consider the picture of our dangers 
     <lb/>
     from Fenian invasion rather overdrawn, but 
     <lb/>
     this I do say that if I were addres<lb break="no"/>sing this house, and desired to make the 
     <lb/>
     strongest appeal on behalf of Union, I 
     <lb/>
     would have rested it on the very premises 
     <lb/>
     which that letter contains. I should have 
     <lb/>
     drawn conclusions from it the very opposite 
     <lb/>
     of these of the very able and eloquent author. 
     <lb/>
     There are certain considerations connected 
     <lb/>
     with the dangers so powerfully descanted on 
     <lb/>
     in that letter, which should press upon us with 
     <lb/>
     great force. Our position is this: We stand 
     <lb/>
     alongside a country which has suddenly deve<lb break="no"/>loped itself into the greatest military power in 
     <lb/>
     the world. It contains large numbers of armed 
     <lb/>
     and trained men, at this moment hordes of 
     <lb/>
     them are threatening an inroad upon our ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. We have opposed to us not merely 
     <lb/>
     the irradicable hatred of British power which 
     <lb/>
     distinguishes the descendants of Ireland who 
     <lb/>
     have emigrated to the United States, and who 
     <lb/>
     compose the Fenian element, but we have 
     <lb/>
     that hatred sympathised in by the great body 
     <lb/>
     of the American people, and no man can tell 
     <lb/>
     at what moment our soil may be invaded. Let 
     <lb/>
     us, then, look at England, and see how she 
     <lb/>
     stands. England fought for seven years to 
     <lb/>
     subjugate the rebellious States, and yet with 
     <lb/>
     only three millions to fight with, she was 
     <lb/>
     obliged to retire unsuccessful. Now thirty 
     <lb/>
     millions of people occupy the place of the 
     <lb/>
     three. They have been baptized in the blood 
     <lb/>
     of civil war, and acquired the skill and the da<lb break="no"/>ring which experience alone can give. Then 
     <lb/>
     look at the responsibilities which England has 
     <lb/>
     now thrown upon her. The entire Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Empire at the Revolution consisted of the 
     <lb/>
     American and West India Islands. For five 
     <lb/>
     years after the peace of 1783 Australia, a con<lb break="no"/>tinent larger than the United States and now 
     <lb/>
     divided into six separate governments with 
     <lb/>
     the dimensions and revenues of principalities, 
     <lb/>
     remained undiscovered; New Zealand was 
     <lb/>
     unknown. The 140 millions of India were go<lb break="no"/>verned by native princes, with the exception 
     <lb/>
     of a few thousands who owned the sway of a 
     <lb/>
     commercial company; Canada East was in 
     <lb/>
     the power of the French, Western Canada 
     <lb/>
     was a wilderness. Now the myriads of India 
     <lb/>
     are direct subjects of the British crown, and 
     <lb/>
     on her Majesty's government devolve the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility of ruling this enormous popula<lb break="no"/>tion, itself fourfold greater than that of the 
     <lb/>
     United States. They have the care and pro<lb break="no"/>tection of the vast continent of Australia; 
     <lb/>
     they have still to defend the Islands of the 
     <lb/>
     West and of the East Indies. So long as she 
     <lb/>
     retains her ascendancy at sea she can protect 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
           
     these; but contemplating the whole Empire, 
     <lb/>
     including over thirty colonies, scattered over 
     <lb/>
     all parts of the world, consisting of every peo<lb break="no"/>ple and tongue, and situate in every climate, 
     <lb/>
     is it possible to conceive of a power but that 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain that could have so long dis<lb break="no"/>charged such immense responsibilities as the 
     <lb/>
     possession of this Empire throws upon 
     <lb/>
     her, and that too almost within the life time 
     <lb/>
     of a man, necessarily involves. See how dif<lb break="no"/>ferent from ours is the position of all these 
     <lb/>
     Colonies. Australia is at the antipodes, and 
     <lb/>
     is defended by its distance from a foe. India 
     <lb/>
     is separated from the only power that is likely 
     <lb/>
     to interfere with British rule by impassable 
     <lb/>
     mountains and trackless deserts, the islands 
     <lb/>
     of the Pacific and Australasia are protected 
     <lb/>
     by distance and their remote position; but 
     <lb/>
     here, all along the two thousand miles of con<lb break="no"/>terminous boundary between us and Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca, we have in our immediate presence 
     <lb/>
     the military power which makes British Ame<lb break="no"/>rica the weakest spot in the Empire. No Bri<lb break="no"/>tish statesman can fail to see that of all the
     <lb/>
     points at which the Imperial power can be 
     <lb/>
     assailed, this presents the elements which 
     <lb/>
     make a war most to be dreaded. Do we won<lb break="no"/>der, then, that despatch after despatch has 
     <lb/>
     been sent by the home authorities, requiring 
     <lb/>
     us to put ourselves in such a position that 
     <lb/>
     England, if called upon to defend us, can do 
     <lb/>
     so successfully. Is it any wonder that we find 
     <lb/>
     the Colonial Secretary, time after time, al<lb break="no"/>most imploring us, if we have any desire to 
     <lb/>
     retain our allegiance to the Crown, to put our<lb break="no"/>selves in such an attitude that the Crown 
     <lb/>
     can protect us? I feel that if there were 
     <lb/>
     no commercial advantages to be derived 
     <lb/>
     from striking down antagonistic barriers; if 
     <lb/>
     our material interests even were not promoted 
     <lb/>
     by Union, we could not gracefully resist the 
     <lb/>
     expression of such desire on the part of those 
     <lb/>
     to whom we are indebted for protection, and 
     <lb/>
     of whom we are even new imploring aid. For 
     <lb/>
     they say, "we are ready to place the whole 
     <lb/>
     resources of the Empire at your back, we will 
     <lb/>
     defend you as long as you desire to remain 
     <lb/>
     with us; but we claim it a right which our 
     <lb/>
     position gives us to offer you advice as to 
     <lb/>
     the attitude you shall assume, and in which, 
     <lb/>
     we think, you can best be defended." Even 
     <lb/>
     admitting that there were no commercial 
     <lb/>
     advantages in the proposed Union, admitting 
     <lb/>
     even that we did not agree that the British 
     <lb/>
     government were right in the belief that Union 
     <lb/>
     would aid our defence, is there a man in the 
     <lb/>
     country who could look a British statesman 
     <lb/>
     in the face and say "we will accept your pro<lb break="no"/>tection, but we decline your advice?" This 
     <lb/>
     argument alone, the deference which is due 
     <lb/>
     from our position as the protected and defend<lb break="no"/>ed, to those who protect and defend, I feel to 
     <lb/>
     be irresistible. I have never hesitated in this 
     <lb/>
     assembly from the first hour when the propo<lb break="no"/>sition for Colonial Union was mooted, from giv<lb break="no"/>ing it my support. Since it assumed a definite 
     <lb/>
     shape and I became a party to the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     scheme I have felt my conviction of the 
     <lb/>
     soundness of the principles upon which that 
     <lb/>
     scheme was based, strengthened by reason 
     <lb/>
     and reflection. I claim no right to dictate to 
     <lb/>
     others their course of action. The gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     with whom I have been associated, have a 
     <lb/>
     right, if they choose, to change their views, but 
     <lb/>
     I do not feel at liberty to do so while I retain 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     my <choice><sic>presest</sic><corr>present</corr></choice> conviction. I have put my hand 
     <lb/>
     to public documents which bind me in honor 
     <lb/>
     to the same course to which my convictions 
     <lb/>
     lead. As I have said my opinion of the Que<lb break="no"/>bec scheme is entirely unchanged. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that it guards our interests as far 
     <lb/>
     as we had a right to expect them to be 
     <lb/>
     guarded in an Intercolonial arrangement; but 
     <lb/>
     if larger concessions can be obtained, there is 
     <lb/>
     no member of this House or of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Convention, belonging to the lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     who would not willingly accept them. The 
     <lb/>
     resolution now before us leaves the question 
     <lb/>
     open only to a change in our favor—Canada is 
     <lb/>
     bound by her Legislature to go at all events 
     <lb/>
     as far as the Quebec scheme. The Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces alone are dissatisfied, and if any 
     <lb/>
     alterations are made, they must be in the line 
     <lb/>
     of concessions to them. If we can secure 
     <lb/>
     guarantees and privileges not embodied in that 
     <lb/>
     scheme, it will be in entire accord with the 
     <lb/>
     feelings of this House and those members of 
     <lb/>
     it that attended the Convention, and as the 
     <lb/>
     proposition now before us will secure us at 
     <lb/>
     least the benefit of that scheme, and possibly 
     <lb/>
     some others, I do not hesitate to give it my 
     <lb/>
     support, and have much pleasure in seconding 
     <lb/>
     the resolution.
