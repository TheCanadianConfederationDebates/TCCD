<!-- GL, 2018-06-13, Commented out below as it precedes Debate Day -->
 <!--<p>
     asked that a member should be allowed to retire 
     <lb/>
     from a committee, and not exercise his duties 
     <lb/>
     as a representative of the people; because he was 
     <lb/>
     connected with a public journal. Perhaps it 
     <lb/>
     would be inadvisable to agree to the hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber's request. The House might be curious to 
     <lb/>
     know whether he, as a member of the com— 
     <lb/>
     mittee in the discharge of his high parliamen<lb break="no"/>tary duties, would be able to sustain the course 
     <lb/>
     which his journal had taken. It would certain<lb break="no"/>ly place the hon. member in a very unpleasant 
     <lb/>
     position if he felt compelled, by a sense of pub— 
     <lb/>
     lic duty, after hearing all the circumstances of 
     <lb/>
     the case, to come to the conclusion that the 
     <lb/>
     paper of which he was the manager had asserted 
     <lb/>
     opinions which could not be borne out by the 
     <lb/>
     facts. He (Dr. T.) must certainly express his 
     <lb/>
     surprise that the hon. member had not felt the 
     <lb/>
     delicacy which he now laid claim to, elsewhere 
     <lb/>
     than in the house. It hardly seemed compati<lb break="no"/>ble with justice to attack the Medical Superin<lb break="no"/>tendent in the way he had been in the journal 
     <lb/>
     with which the hon. gentleman was connected. 
     <lb/>
     It ought to be remembered that it was quite 
     <lb/>
     possible for a public officer holding a highly 
     <lb/>
     responsible position not to be entirely exempt 
     <lb/>
     from blame—to be open to the imputation of 
     <lb/>
     not having exercised that strict superveillance 
     <lb/>
     over subordinates he might have done, and at 
     <lb/>
     the same time, for his general management, to 
     <lb/>
     be such as would prevent him from being treat<lb break="no"/>ed with any degree of severity. There were 
     <lb/>
     few parties called upon to discharge high pub<lb break="no"/>lic duties—whether in the government or other 
     <lb/>
    wise—who could say that their conduct had 
     <lb/>been always entirely blameless. As respects 
     <lb/>the Medical Superintendent, it would have been 
     <lb/>manifestly unfair, in view of all the circum<lb break="no"/>stances of the case—in view of the facts that he 
     <lb/>had held his position for many years to the 
     <lb/>satisfaction of several governments, that his 
     <lb/>general management had been approved of by 
     <lb/>a committee of medical gentlemen, who had 
     <lb/>investigated thoroughly the condition of the in- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>stitution—to dismiss him, and oblige him, with 
     <lb/>tarnished reputation, to return to a profession 
     <lb/>which he had given up when he took charge of 
     <lb/>the Asylum. All the government could justly 
     <lb/>do was to make such changes in the institution 
     <lb/>as would give the public an additional guarantee 
     <lb/>that it was conducted in the manner it ought 
     <lb/>to be. Under all the circumstances, he thought 
     <lb/>the hon. member ought to remain on the com-  
     <lb break="maybe"/>mitte, though if he refused to do so, of course 
     <lb/>the House would have to yield to his request.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROV SEC</persName>. moved the third reading of 
     <lb/>
     the bill in reference to duration of and represen<lb break="no"/>tation in the General Assembly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName> moved that four members be 
     <lb/>
     given to Halifax county, two to the city, and 
     <lb/>
     two to the county outside the city. Negatived. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName>  again moved that the bill be re<lb break="no"/>committed for the purpose of giving four mem— 
     <lb/>
     bers to the county of Halifax. He did so, be<lb break="no"/>cause during the debate the principle of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population had been recognized as 
     <lb/>
     the true one. In fact, it had been to a certain 
     <lb/>
     extent recognized in the case of Halifax and 
     <lb/>
     Pictou, but he did not think the bill went far 
     <lb/>
     enough. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SHAN2">Hon. Mr. SHANNON</persName> would be glad if the 
     <lb/>
     House would entertain the proposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROV SEC</persName>. said he did not look upon 
     <lb/>
     this motion as in the slightest degree affecting 
     <lb/>
     the principle of the bill, and the House was at 
     <lb/>
     liberty to pass or reject it. He would, however, 
     <lb/>
     vote against the resolution, for he felt that Hali<lb break="no"/>fax would have fully as much influence as she 
     <lb/>
     ought to have in the Legislature. Indeed. Hali<lb break="no"/>fax now had an amount of weight in the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature beyond that of any other part of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr BLANCHARD said that if the resolution 
     <lb/>
     passed then Halifax would have a representation 
     <lb/>
     equal to that of half of the Island of Cape Bre<lb break="no"/>ton.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr TOBIN said that he would vote for the re<lb break="no"/>solution in entire deference to the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for East Halifax. That hon. member had no 
     <lb/>
     doubt made the motion with the hope of placing 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of the city. If possible, in a 
     <lb/>
     wrong position, but he would find himself mis<lb break="no"/>taken. He (Mr. T.) would be very happy if 
     <lb/>
     the House would grant the additional represen<lb break="no"/>tation to Halifax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr PRYOR would also be happy to vote for 
     <lb/>
     the resolution, particularly as he appreciated the 
     <lb/>
     motives of the hon member who moved it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LOCK1">Mr. LOCKE</persName> said that he believed his hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, the member for East Halftax, would have 
     <lb/>
     to sit alone on his side of the House. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The bill to amend chap. 2 R. S. of Executive 
     <lb/>
     and Legislative Disabilities was next taken up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName> said that it was certainly note 
     <lb/>
     worthy that a different system was pursued in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and would probably also prevail in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick. It would be interesting for the 
     <lb/>
     House to know why a diflerent rule was follow<lb break="no"/>ed in this Province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROV SEC</persName>. said that the Act of Union 
     <lb/>
     which was now the law of the realm, having 
     <lb/>
     received Her Majesty's assent, left it in the 
     <lb/>
     power of the local Legislatures to form their 
     <lb/>
     own constitution. It was therefore the pri<lb break="no"/>vilege of this house to arrange that constitu<lb break="no"/>tion as it might deem most advisable for the 
     <lb/>
    public interests. When the Legislature of 
     <lb/>ew Brunswick met, no doubt the subject 
     <lb/>would be considered and arranged as might 
     <lb/>seem best to the Representatives of that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. He believed that the members of the 
     <lb/>local Legislature should be able to approach 
     <lb/>the discharge of their public duties entirely 
     <lb/>untrammelled by any duties irrespective of 
     <lb/>their local position. If a gentleman should sit 
     <lb/>in both the local Legislature and the general 
     <lb/>Parliament, the duties of one would probably 
     <lb/>come into conflict with those of the other. 
     <lb/>The great object should. be to have 
     <lb/>a representative go to the local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature or general Parliament with his Judg<lb break="no"/>ment unbiassed. Again, if there was a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the general Government sitting in the 
     <lb/>local Legislature, he would be placed in a. very 
     <lb/>embarrassing position; for he might be ques<lb break="no"/>tioned as to matters of public policy when se<lb break="no"/>parated from his colleagues, and without the 
     <lb/>means of communicating with them. Such 
     <lb/>considerations had induced the Government 
     <lb/>to bring forward the present bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPBELL</persName> gave it as his opinion that 
     <lb/>
     it was quite competent, under the terms of the 
     <lb/>
    bill, for any person, at the first election. ap<lb break="no"/>pearing as a candidate for both the local Leg<lb break="no"/>islature and general Parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Some discussion then took place as to the in<lb break="no"/>terpretation that might be put on the bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROV SECY</persName>. said that it was impossi<lb break="no"/>ble to prevent any person being nominated for<lb/>both houses.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName> said that a candidate would 
     <lb/>
     have to select the house he would sit in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:HENR1">Hon. ATTY. GEN</persName>. said that in England there 
     <lb/>
     was no law to prevent a person being nomi<lb break="no"/>nated and returned for half a dozen consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies, but he must make his election of one 
     <lb/>
     of them before he could take his seat, All 
     <lb/>
     that was intended was not to take away the 
     <lb/>
     right of the people to choose any person they 
     <lb/>
     might think proper. He had looked over the 
     <lb/>
    bill, and believed it to be as carefully drawn 
     <lb/>as it was possible under the circumstances. 
     <lb/>He appreciated the arguments of hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers, but he did not see any necessity for al<lb break="no"/>teration or addition of words. It was not ad<lb break="no"/>visable to make any conditions that would 
     <lb/>trammel the people or lead to difliculties here<lb break="no"/>after. It was proposed, for instance, to put in 
     <lb/>   
  

    
            <cb/>


     the words " with his consent;" but it might 
     <lb/>
     happen that a person might consent to his re<lb break="no"/>turn, and it would not be so easy to prove it. 
     <lb/>
     The best the house could do was to prevent 
     <lb/>
     any individual taking his seat both in the gen<lb break="no"/>eral Parliament and in the local Legislature. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName> said that no person ought 
     <lb/>
     to be in a position to choose between the 
     <lb/>
     seats.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LOCK1">Mr. LOCKE</persName> said that " with his consent " 
     <lb/>
     would not answer, for a person might be no<lb break="no"/>minated in his absence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The bill was left over until the next day, 
     <lb/>
     that the Attorney General might see whether 
     <lb/>
     any alteration in the bill was necessary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The bill in reference to the departmental

     bill to incorporate the Gas Consumers' Com<lb break="no"/>pany.

     <persName ref="pers:HENR1">Hon. ATTY. GEN</persName>. introduced an act to in<lb break="no"/>corporate the Windsor and Annapolis Rail<lb break="no"/>way Company. He explained that in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of the financial diflîcultles that pre<lb break="no"/>vailed in England last year the original con<lb break="no"/>tractors for the work were obliged to give up 
     <lb/>
     the contract. He was glad, however. to be 
     <lb/>
     able to say that the government had been 
     <lb/>
     able to enter on a new contract for the accom<lb break="no"/>plishment of the work. The name of Thomas

     Brassey would be sufficient guarantee that 
     <lb/>
     the work would be substantially and expediti<lb break="no"/>ously completed. He pointed out the great ad<lb break="no"/>vantages t at would result to the Province from 
     <lb/>
