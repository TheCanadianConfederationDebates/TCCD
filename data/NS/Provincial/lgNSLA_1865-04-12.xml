<!-- GL, 2017-04-20, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
            <!--<p> He wished to give the system a fair trial, and <lb/>
if it did not succeed, it could be altered. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. BLANCHARD under the circumstances <lb/>
withdrew his motion.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. LE VESCONTE
moved the clause which <lb/>
he had read on a previous day as to the rights <lb/>
of minorities—which was lost—31 to 8. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>For.—Miller,
Bill, LeVesconte, McDonnell, <lb/>
Tobin, McKinnon, Robichau, Caldwell—8. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Against.—John
Campbell, Pryor, Moore, D. <lb/>
Fraser, McFarlane, C. J. Campbell, Black<lb break="no"/>wood, Hamilton, Allison,
Laurence, Ray, Par<lb break="no"/>ker, McKay, Chipman, Kaulback, Hill, Long-
<lb break="yes"/>
ley, Donkin, Prov. Secy., Blanchard, S. Camp<lb break="no"/>bell, Annand, Balcom, Ross, Robertson, Shan- <lb break="maybe"/>
nan, Locke, Finl. Secy., Cowie, Archibald. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. STEWART
CAMPBELL moved that the <lb/>
bill be deferred to that day three months. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr.
LEVESCONTE, although opposed to the <lb/>
bill, should vote against this motion, as it <lb/>
would be ten times worse to go back to the <lb/>
bill now on the statute book. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. MILLER wished to remove a misappre<lb break="no"/>hension upon that subject. It did not at all <lb/>
follow, that if they rejected this bill they must <lb/>
fall back upon the old law. A measure might <lb/>
be framed in consonance with the wishes and <lb/>
feelings of the people. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
commented upon the bill of last session at <lb/>
some length, and argued that by amendments <lb/>
it had been stripped of a great many of its ob<lb break="no"/>noxious features, and was not at
all the bill <lb/>
as originally introduced. Therefore it was <lb/>
not right for the hon. gentleman to say, that <lb/>
the house had only the option of accepting this <lb/>
bill, or being driven back to the obnoxious <lb/>
bill of last session. The hon.
gentleman reca<lb break="no"/>pitulated the reasons why he should be com<lb break="no"/>pelled to vote against this bill
upon its third <lb/>
reading.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Hon.
ATTY. GENL. contended that the <lb/>
clauses relating to the city of Halifax, were <lb/>
totally inapplicable to thinly settled districts. <lb/>
The principle might be carried out in the more <lb/>
populous districts, where the different deno<lb break="no"/>minations had school houses of
their own. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman referred to
the fact that, <lb/>
in Nova Scotia, no distinction
was made be<lb break="no"/>tween any sect or creed, and he
hoped that <lb/>
none would ever seek for any preference. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> After some further
slight discussion, the <lb/>
question was taken upon Mr. Stewart
Camp<lb break="no"/>bell's motion—to defer the Bill
for 3 months— <lb/>
which was lost, 20 to 8. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>For.—Killam,
Heffernan, Parker, Ray, Hat<lb break="no"/>field, Miller, S. Campbell, Balcom—8. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Against.—D.
Fraser, Shannon, Atty. Genl.,
<lb/>
Donkin, Le Vesconte, Finl. Sec. Colin Camp<lb break="no"/>bell, Lawrence, J. Campbell, McKay,
Allison, <lb/>
Moore, Whitman, Kaulback, Longley, Prov. <lb/>
Secy., Hill, McKinnon, Tobin, Cowie—20. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. STEWART
CAMPBELL gave notice to re<lb break="no"/>scind. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Hon. Prov. SEC. expressed his
astonishment <lb/>
that after having had a call of the
house, he <lb/>
should persist in a notice to
rescind. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr.
STEWART CAMPBELL replied
that he <lb/>
did so because not half of the house was pre<lb break="no"/>sent. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Prov.
SECY. moved that the bill be <lb/>
read a third time and finally pass.
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Some discussion then ensued upon a
ques<lb break="no"/>tion of order, as to whether
that motion could <lb/>
be put—pending the notice to rescind. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Speaker took time to consider. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The house
adjourned until the next day at<lb/>
o'clock.<lb/>
            </p>

            <milestone type="unknown"/> -->


            <p rendition="simple:right">WEDNESDAY, Apri1 12. </p>


            <p>
The house met at 3 o'clock.  <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:LEVE1">Mr. LEVESCONTE</persName>, chairman of the commit<lb break="no"/>tee on
               fisheries, reported.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:TOBI2">Mr. TOBIN</persName> would like to know whether the <lb/>
committee had considered a subject which had <lb/>
been brought to their notice by petitions from <lb/>
Margaret's Bay, relative to the practice
of <lb/>
setting seines; and whether they had suggest<lb break="no"/>ed any remedy for the grievance complained of. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:LEVE1">Mr. LEVESCONTE</persName> said the committee had <lb/>
carefully considered the subject, but could not <lb/>
arrive at any definite conclusion.
They found <lb/>
it impossible to divise a law applicable to the <lb/>
whole Province.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SHAN2">Mr. SHANNON</persName> enquired if any action, had <lb/>
been taken as regards the trawl
fishery. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LEVE1">Mr. LEVESCONTE</persName> said that there was not <lb/>
sufficient information before the committee to <lb/>
warrant them to interfere.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TOBI2">Mr. TOBIN</persName> alluded to the want of attention- <lb break="yes"/>
this important branch of industry received
<lb/>
from the house. He saw a number of gentle<lb break="no"/>men around the benches who should take an <lb/>
interest in the subject; and yet here was a re<lb break="no"/>port brought in by a committee
after two <lb/>
months deliberation, and scarcely a remark
<lb/>
was elicited from them. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
alluded to the abolition of the
office of Fish <lb/>
Inspector, which he thought had rather depre<lb break="no"/>ciated the character of our fish in foreign
mar<lb break="no"/>kets. He thought that something might be <lb/>
done to improve the breed of fish. In France <lb/>
they imported spawn for this purpose, and he <lb/>
did not see why caplin could not be made to <lb/>
breed upon our shores, so as to improve the <lb/>
character of fish used for bait. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPBELL</persName> thought that the hon. <lb/>
member for Halifax instead of lecturing
the <lb/>
committee ought to have addressed his re<lb break="no"/>marks to another quarter. He should like to
<lb/>
know why the government ignored their
duties <lb/>
in connection with the preservation of
the fish<lb break="no"/>eries any more than in relation to agriculture <lb/>
or any other branch of industry.
He thought <lb/>
that there was a particular reason why the
<lb/>
remarks of Mr. Tobin upon the improvement <lb/>
of bait should have been made to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, for if there was a body
of gentlemen <lb/>
who understood the use of <hi rendition="simple:italic">bait</hi>, it was the <lb/>
Executive of Nova Scotia. (Laughter.) And <lb/>
as they had taken charge of all the schools
of <lb/>
the province, perhaps it would be just as well <lb/>
if they also assumed the
protection of <hi rendition="simple:italic">schools</hi> <lb/>
of fish. This subject of the trawl
fishery <lb/>
should engage the earnest attention
of the <lb/>
government, as if something was
not done <lb/>
very soon, the
valuable cod fishery of our
<lb/>
coast would be completely destroyed.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Hon.
PRO. SEC. said that no doubt this sub<lb break="no"/>ject was a most important one, and deserving <lb/>
the serious attention of the house and the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, but he thought that if hon. gentlemen <lb/>
who represented fishing interests instead of <lb/>
making it a subject of attack
upon the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the day would devote a little attention <lb/>
to the subject themselves, it would look
more <lb/>
like a desire to benefit that branch of provin<lb break="no"/>cial industry. He had sat there
eight years, and <lb/>
although the member
for Guysborough repre<lb break="no"/>sented a constituency largely engaged in
the <lb/>
fishing business, he never heard him open
his <lb/>
mouth to give advice upon the subject.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
He thought that if the constituencies of those <lb/>
fishing counties, instead of
selecting gentlemen <lb/>
of the legal profession as their representatives, <lb/>
           

            <pb n="222" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1865-04-12_Page_222.jpg"/>

would send those who took a more real
inter<lb break="no"/>est in their welfare, it would be better for <lb/>
them, and he could assure them, that they <lb/>
would find no indisposition on the part of the <lb/>
government to meet their views. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPBELL</persName> had no doubt that the <lb/>
Prov. Sec. was not pleased with his style of <lb/>
opposition—he would probably prefer having <lb/>
more loose fish about the house. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName> would suggest to the Chair<lb break="no"/>man of the Fishery Committee that instead of <lb/>
taking $150,000 to cut a hole at
this end of the <lb/>
Bras d'Or Lake, he should take the money, <lb/>
and stop up the other end and thus make it a <lb/>
valuable reservoir for the preservation of fish. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TOBI2">Mr. TOBIN</persName> said perhaps the trouble with <lb/>
the member for Guysborough was that he was <lb/>

been fishing with bare hooks. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LOCK1">Mr. LOCKE</persName>
said the subject had been so <lb/>
often discussed that it was not worth while to <lb/>
take up any more time. At the same time, it <lb/>
was not right to treat it in a <hi rendition="simple:italic">scaly</hi> way. He <lb/>
always felt that, while the subject of agricul<lb break="no"/>ture received a great deal of attention from <lb/>
the house, the fisheries, which were of as much <lb/>
importance, scarcely received any attention at <lb/>
all. As regards the trawl fisheries, the evil <lb/>
complained of existed more in reference to the <lb/>
deep sea than the shore fisheries, and it had <lb/>
been established that we had no control
over <lb/>
them. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:PRYO1">Mr. PRYOR</persName>
thought that if the government <lb/>
would give a grant for the improvement of the <lb/>
fisheries, no money could be better expended. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HENR1">Hon. ATTY.
GEN</persName>. asked whether the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of payment of supervisors of river fisher<lb break="no"/>ies had been considered by the committee. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROV. SEC</persName>. said that a bill had been
<lb/>
passed to carry out that idea,
and supervisors <lb/>
had been appointed, but he believed their du<lb break="no"/>ties commenced and ended with
drawing their <lb/>
salaries.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:PRYO1">Mr. PRYOR</persName> said the sessions of Halifax <lb/>

and had voted £50 to pay the
river wardens. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> After
some further remarks, the report was <lb/>
received and adopted. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The adjourned debate on the Union of the <lb/>

            </p>

<div type="section">
            <head rendition="simple:centre">UNION OF THE COLONIES.</head>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">Speech
of Mr. Archibald.</head>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName>,
in rising to second the re<lb break="no"/>solutions upon the table of the
house, said:— <lb/>
I feel that after the great length at which <lb/>
the hon. Pro. Sec'y has adverted to the scheme <lb/>
of Union propounded at the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, it will be out of place for
me to go very <lb/>
largely into detail, and I shall therefore content <lb/>
myself with calling the
attention of the house to <lb/>
some matters to which he did not refer at great <lb/>
length. That hon. gentleman, in
order to con<lb break="no"/>vince the house that he and
those who acted <lb/>
with him in the advocacy of this question of <lb/>
the Union of the Colonies, had ample authority <lb/>
for the course they pursued, had
referred to <lb/>
the public meetings held from
time to time, in <lb/>
this city, and to the recorded
opinions of the <lb/>
public men of this country delivered
at differ<lb break="no"/>ent times in favor of the project. He might <lb/>
have gone farther and stated
that, at no meet<lb break="no"/>ing of a public kind—at no public
gathering— <lb/>
and upon no occasion, when a public man ad<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>

dressed an audience in favor of Union,
had <lb/>
there ever been found a dissenting voice against <lb/>
it. If then this could be taken as any evidence <lb/>
of the state of the public mind, I think that the <lb/>
advocates of this measure had a right to as<lb break="no"/>sume that the feeling of the country was <lb/>
largely in favor of Union. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> But while the hon. Provincial Secretary
has <lb/>
alluded to the public opinion of this country, <lb/>
I will remind the house that
there is another <lb/>
public opinion on this subject, which cannot <lb/>
be ignored. A public opinion which must, and <lb/>
has a right to exercise a powerful effect
upon <lb/>
the decision of the question—I
allude to the <lb/>
public opinion of the statemen and people
of <lb/>
England. This opinion, too, hus undergone
a <lb/>
great change. It must not be forgotten that <lb/>
till the occurrence of recent events the circum<lb break="no"/>stances of the past have not been such as to in<lb break="no"/>duce British statesmen to look with much
<lb/>
favor upon any large or general Union of her <lb/>
colonies. The last union that took place, and <lb/>
to which the attention of British statesmen <lb/>
has naturally turned had the effect of wresting <lb/>
from her power thirteen of her most valuable <lb/>
colonies, which formed the brightest gem in <lb/>
the diadem of the British crown. 
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> We can easily understand then how they <lb/>
would be inclined at first to regard with doubt <lb/>
and disfavor any projected combination of all <lb/>
the British North American Colonies. It
was <lb/>
not to be wondered at then, that when this sub<lb break="no"/>ject has from time to time been brought to the <lb/>
notice of the Imperial authorities by colonial <lb/>
statesmen it received little encouragement. So <lb/>
late indeed as 1857 when delegates for this pro<lb break="no"/>vince pressed the subject upon the attention of <lb/>
Mr. Labouchere, the then colonial minister, it <lb/>
was quite clear that the
smaller union of the <lb/>
Maritime Colonies would have been preferred <lb/>
by the Imperial authorities to a union
of the <lb/>
whole. And it is very probable
that had the po<lb break="no"/>sition of affairs on this continent remained
the <lb/>
same as then, the feeling of
antagonism on the <lb/>
part of the mother country to a general union <lb/>
of the British North American
Colonies, would <lb/>
have been continued to the present time. But <lb/>
let me contrast for a moment the changed <lb/>
aspect of affairs, and it will
be readily seen <lb/>
why it is that such a revulsion
of feeling has <lb/>
taken place in the public mind—across
the wa<lb break="no"/>ter—upon this question. Four year
ago, when <lb/>
British statesmen looked to America, they saw <lb/>
thirty millions of people engaged in the arts of
<lb/>
peace—the cultivation of the soil, the construc<lb break="no"/>tion of railroads and
canals—the building of <lb/>
cities—the creation of
manufactories, and de<lb break="no"/>velopment of every branch of art and
indus<lb break="no"/>try. In fact the reign of materialism appear<lb break="no"/>ed to be firmly established, and the rule of the  <lb/>
" almighty dollar" supreme. British states<lb break="no"/>men then, in view of these circumstances, had <lb/>
a right to assume that in the absence of
any <lb/>
great and unexpected
convulsion among these <lb/>
people, they had no reason to
anticipate diffi<lb break="no"/>culties or complications with them. But now
<lb/>
how changed was the scene—that
great nation <lb/>
once devoted to the arts of peace,
had sudden<lb break="no"/>ly been turned from a nation of farmers, arti<lb break="no"/>sans, and merchants into a nation
of soldiers. <lb/>
That nation now had in the field the largest  <lb/>
armies the world ever saw, and had increased <lb/>
their naval strength more rapidly than any <lb/>
other nation in the world. And instead of the <lb/>
spirit of peace—the war spirit pervaded the<lb/>
whole country. <lb/>
            </p>

            <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES.</fw> <fw type="num">223</fw>



            <p> In view of this changed aspect of affairs, <lb/>
then, was it much to be wondered at that <lb/>
British statesmen should regard
these colonies <lb/>
with very different feelings from those which <lb/>
animated them at the period I referred to. <lb/>
There is another reason, too, why Great Britain <lb/>
should regard the British North American <lb/>
Colonies in a different light than when she <lb/>
lost the thirteen colonies in 1783. At that time <lb/>
they formed almost the whole of her colonial <lb/>
possessions. It was not until 5 years after the <lb/>
peace of 1783 that the first colonist set
his foot <lb/>
in Australia. Now we find in that country no <lb/>
less than six distinct governments, with the <lb/>
dimensions of European kingdoms, and with <lb/>
the revenues of principalities. New Zealand, <lb/>
was then untrodden by the foot of the white <lb/>
man. It is now a confederacy of colonies. <lb/>
The British possessions in South Africa have <lb/>
swollen from a port and a town to an enor<lb break="no"/>mous colony. The 150 millions of British India <lb/>
(formerly governed by native princes, or a <lb/>
commercial company,) are now under the direct <lb/>
rule of the Queen of England. At
that time <lb/>
Canada West was a wilderness, a
few trap<lb break="no"/>pers and fur traders being her
sole white po<lb break="no"/>pulation. Now we find scattered over the <lb/>
globe, over thirty colonies of the British <lb/>
Empire, all, more or less,
involving the <lb/>
Parent Country in responsibilities ; all <lb/>
draining, more or less, the national Exche<lb break="no"/>quer. Is it to be wondered at then, that <lb/>
in view of the altered
circumstances of the <lb/>
times, Englishmen should begin to think that <lb/>
the time had arrived when it was
the duty of <lb/>
the colonies to assume some responsibility and <lb/>
to relieve the mother country of, at all events, <lb/>
some portion of the burden of their defence. <lb/>
This feeling would be found to
pervade every <lb/>
debate that had taken place on the subject
in <lb/>
the British parliament. As long ago as 1858, <lb/>
when Mr. Gladstone was examined
before a <lb/>
committee of the House of
Commons, on the <lb/>
subject of the colonial defences, he declared <lb/>
that the time had come when the colonies, <lb/>
with the privileges of freemen which
were <lb/>
accorded to them, must be prepared to
bear a <lb/>
large share of the burdens and responsibilities <lb/>
of freemen. That declaration had
been repeat<lb break="no"/>ed over and over again in his
public speeches <lb/>
in and out of parliament, and
not only by Mr. <lb/>
Gladstone, but by public men of all
shades of <lb/>
politics, and by the press without
distinction. <lb/>
Not only
had this opinion been expressed, but <lb/>
it had to a large extent been acted upon, and <lb/>
at this moment the entire military expenditure <lb/>
af lndia has been thrown upon
her own re<lb break="no"/>sources, while the same policy was about
be<lb break="no"/>ing applied to New Zealand. Not only is this <lb/>
the case, but for several years despatch after <lb/>
despatch has been sent from the colonial office <lb/>
to Canada, informing her that the time had <lb/>
arrived for the colonies to wake up
to the <lb/>
necessity of relieving the
mother country <lb/>
from at least a part of the
burden of their <lb/>
defence. That while exercising the rights and <lb/>
privileges of freeman, they must also assume <lb/>
the responsibilities and duties which that <lb/>
position involved. I
think, therefore, that <lb/>
no one can question the fact
that the time  <lb/>
has arrived when a
change is about to take  <lb/>
place in the attitude of England
towards her <lb/>
colonies; and that, whatever we
may think of <lb/>
the matter, her statesmen had
arrived at the  <lb/>
conclusion, that it was necessary
we should <lb/>
share,
to some extent, the military
expendi<lb break="no"/>ture which our connexion with her
entails. <lb/>
            </p>


            <cb/>

            <p>I shall
refer, for a moment, to the observa<lb break="no"/>tions made in a recent debate
in the British <lb/>
parliament by a statesman of
the highest <lb/>
character, and who occupies a position entire<lb break="no"/>ly independent of the government of the day. <lb/>
Lord Derby, in alluding to the present position <lb/>
occupied by the colonies, said:<lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> I will ask hon. members to recall to themselves the <lb/>
state of North America when we met in this house <lb/>
four years ago. That portion of the world was then <lb/>
divided among what we may call three great Powers <lb/>—first, the United States of America; secondly, Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, and the settlements and dependencies belong<lb break="no"/>ing to our own Sovereign ; and,
thirdly, Mexico, a <lb/>
country which certainly did not possess much politi<lb break="no"/>cal power, but which in extent, resources, fertility of <lb/>
soil, and mineral wealth was almost unequaled in the <lb/>
world. In every one of these three divisions there <lb/>
have been immense changes. In the United States a <lb/>
civil war has raged for four years, and even if that <lb/>
war should termina e, as the hon. member for Brad<lb break="no"/>ford suggests, I cannot believe
that we shall see the <lb/>
same society and form of Government established, or <lb/>
even, if the form be the same, certainly the spirit will <lb/>
be altered, as existed before the civil war
commenced. <lb/>
(Hear.)<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> It is
quite clear. then, it is impossible to know what <lb/>
relations may exist between
the United States, this <lb/>
country, and Her Majesty's dependencies on the
other <lb/>
side of the Atlantic. Taking these large views, then, <lb/>
we ought to consider that—not to morrow or next <lb/>
year, but that we <hi rendition="simple:italic">are on the eve of event of very great <lb/>
importance.</hi>
            </p></quote>


            <p> In the opinion that we are on the eve of <lb/>
great changes on this continent Lord Derby
<lb/>
agrees with the
general sentiment of England. <lb/>
The very fact of large armies existing upon <lb/>
our borders, which to all appearances will
<lb/>
soon be thrown idle upon the
hands of the <lb/>
nation, is in itself
sufficient grounds to war<lb break="no"/>rant apprehension for the future.
For however <lb/>
peaceably, disposed the majority of the right <lb/>
thinking portion of the American people might <lb/>
be, everybody knew how difficult
it was, in a <lb/>
country where the democratic
element ruled, <lb/>
to control the impulses of the
masses. While, <lb/>
therefore, I trust that the
day is far distant <lb/>
when the present friendly relations between <lb/>
the two countries is disturbed,
it is impossible <lb/>
to ignore the fact that there are strong reasons <lb/>
for fearing that if the present
contest should <lb/>
be suddenly terminated, there would
be dan<lb break="no"/>ger of an interruption of the peaceful relations <lb/>
which now happily subsist. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> There are some indications at the present <lb/>
moment of the state of feeling which existed <lb/>
in the United States towards Great Britain <lb/>
which are pretty significant in their
character; <lb/>
and I shall read to the house an article from <lb/>
the New York <hi rendition="simple:italic">World</hi> in which they are sum<lb break="no"/>marized. The writer, after
commenting upon<lb/>
the anxious desire of Canada to preserve<lb/>
neutrality, says: <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> But this just and amicable disposition is met, on our <lb/>

            <p>1. The annoying
and expensive passport system, <lb/>

vessels of war." <lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p> The house will perceive that every one of
<lb/>
these acts has taken place since the commence<lb break="no"/>ment of the year. It is impossible, then, for <lb/>
anybody to avoid seeing that, however unjust <lb/>
and unfounded it may be, a feeling of hostility <lb/>
and irritation has grown up in the minds of <lb/>
the American people, and a desire exists, <lb/>
whenever the fitting opportunity comes, to <lb/>
revenge what they considered the humiliation <lb/>
of the Trent affair, to retaliate for the offences <lb/>
of the St. Alban raiders, and the depredations <lb/>
committed upon northern commerce by ships <lb/>
fitted out in English ports. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> This
it was that induced British statesmen <lb/>
to look with an anxious eye upon events that <lb/>
were transpiring around us, and which called <lb/>
forth this language from Lord
Derby : <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> "Of these two measures (referring to the <lb/>
repeal of the lake armaments and the recipro<lb break="no"/>city treaties) it is impossible not to say that <lb/>
they are adopted in a spirit of hostility to this <lb/>
country. [Hear, hear.] One of them throws open <lb/>
questions of the most delicate and difficult character. <lb/>
The American people have derived, as they do not <lb/>
deny, great commercial advantages from the recipro<lb break="no"/>city treaty, and its termination is advocated only on <lb/>
the avowed ground that Canada derives still greater <lb/>
advantages. One effect of the termination of that <lb/>
treaty would be, if I am not mistaken, that the whole <lb/>
of the complicated question of the fisheries, from the <lb/>
settlement of which the United States have derived <lb/>
incalculable advantage, would at once be thrown <lb/>
open. [Hear, hear.] I am old enough to remember <lb/>
what serious complications and difficult questions <lb/>
connected with the fisheries occasioned, and how <lb/>
near to the point of war, they led this country and the <lb/>
United States ; and now all these questions are grat<lb break="no"/>uiously, and apparently without the slightest reason, <lb/>
thrown open at the risk and danger of war—than <lb/>
which, nothing could be more deplorable—between <lb/>
this country and the United States. [Hear, hear.] <lb/>
It is not a little signigcant. too, that at the same time, <lb/>
when the abrogation of this commercial treaty lays <lb/>
open all these points of danger and difficulty, there <lb/>
is another step taken to abrogate another treaty. For <lb/>
a long period the lakes have served as the means of <lb/>
peaceful and profitable coirmerce between the two <lb/>
countries lying alongside each other ; but I can recol<lb break="no"/>lect a period in the late American war when there <lb/>
was a race of ship-building on the two sides
of the <lb/>
lakes, end when the party
obtaining the supremacy <lb/>
in that
matter gained the control of the lakes. [Hear,
<lb/>
hear."]<lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p> When Lord Derby used these expressions <lb/>
in reference to two of these measures
he did <lb/>
not allude to the resolution which is the fifth <lb/>
in the catalogue read, and which, in my opi<lb break="no"/>nion, exhibits a more determined feeling of <lb/>
hostilily than any of the
others. I allude to <lb/>
the notice to abolish the
extradition treaty. <lb/>
Could anything be more significant
of the ex<lb break="no"/>tent to which these feelings had
grown than <lb/>
the fact that a statesman like Sumner should, <lb/>
in his place in Congress, coolly contend that <lb/>
this treaty, the principle of which
is regarded <lb/>
by all countries with any pretensions to civili<lb break="no"/>zation as a necesssary safeguard
for the punish<lb break="no"/>ment of crime, and which is
founded upon the <lb/>
principles of common justice and humanity, <lb/>
should be terminated. This declares, in effect, <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
       

that a man who committed murder in Canada
<lb/>
and fled to the United States, or who com<lb break="no"/>mitted any similar crime there and fled <lb/>
here, should enjoy immunity from pun<lb break="no"/>ishment of his crime. Surely no stronger <lb/>
evidence than this was needed to show how <lb/>
far the feeling he had alluded to had gone in <lb/>
the United States. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> If then the fears to which I have alluded
<lb/>
should unhappily be realized, in what position <lb/>
I would ask would we be in? On
this point I <lb/>
shall call the attention of the house to the <lb/>
opinion of Mr. Cardwell, than whom no man <lb/>
is in a better position to judge, than whom no <lb/>
man has greater responsibilities, or would be <lb/>
more likely to weigh well the meaning of his <lb/>
words before he uttered them. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> He uses the following language : <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> "I cannot express the feelings of regret
with <lb/>
which I should view any controversy between the <lb/>

anything the world has ever seen."  <lb/>

            <p> This then is the opinion of a responsible

            </p>
            <p> Truly then if
those whose posit on and <lb/>
opportunities entitle them to be the best judges <lb/>
of the character of the war when it comes, en<lb break="no"/>tertain these views, it behoves us to make some <lb/>
preparation for so frightful a contingency whence <lb/>
it shall arise.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> What provision, I would ask, do

            <p> " The principle was becoming every day

            <p> What attitude then ought we to assume in <lb/>
reference to the new duties devolving on us. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Is it not natural for British statesmen
to look <lb/>
upon the Union of the Colonies, as a means
of <lb/>
defence? Do they not feel, have they not a right <lb/>
to feel, that the effect of
Union would be largely <lb/>
to improve the possibility of defence?<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> It is a favorite argument against it to say that <lb/>
by Union, we will obtain no more money,
no more <lb/>
men, and how is it possible then
for Union to im<lb break="no"/>prove our position ? It is
true we have no more <lb/>
means, no more men, but what
we have is con<lb break="no"/>centrated, there would be one heart, one soul, one <lb/>
purpose, one controlling power, extending over <lb/>
the whole Confederation, from Sarnia to Sydney.  <lb/>

            <p> Suppose this argument had been used at
the <lb/>
time of the American rebellion,
that instead of <lb/>
concentrating their forces, and their means, each  <lb/>

guished writer in the United States,
which are <lb/>
exceedingly apposite to the
subject under discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and which, with the permission of the House, <lb/>
I will read. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The writer is speaking of the necessity
of a <lb/>
concentrated power, where offence or defence is<lb/>
concerned and says : <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> " A Government authorized to declare war,
but <lb/>
relying on independent States for the means of <lb/>
prosecuting it—capable of
contracting debt and <lb/>
of pledging the public faith for the payment, but <lb/>
depending on thirteen distinct Sovereignties for <lb/>
the preservation of that faith, could only be res<lb break="no"/>cued from ignominy and contempt by finding those <lb/>
Sovereignties administered by men exempt frem <lb/>
the passions incident to human nature." <lb/>
            </p></quote>
 
            <p>I think that these observations made by the <lb/> writer in the serenity of the
                  closet, not under the <lb/> influence of the excitement of a partizan, are en<lb break="no"/>titled to great consideration and weight. <lb/>
               </p>
  
            <p>There is another point to which I wish to draw <lb/> the attention of the House, and
                  from which some <lb/> valuable hints may be had from the same source. <lb/> Many
                  persons have been frightened into ihe idea <lb/> that a union would be injurious
                  to the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of the Province. They will perceive that
                  <lb/> the same style of argument was used against the <lb/> adoption of clauses in
                  the Constitution of the <lb/> United States. <lb/>
               </p>



            <p> I read from
the same author : <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> " This feature of the Constitution gave
rise to <lb/>
most animated discussion, in which reason was <lb/>
employed to demonstrate the mischiefs of the sys<lb break="no"/>tem, and imagination to pourtray, them in all the <lb/>

invent. Looking back, indeed, to that period <lb/>
with the calmness with which we naturally review <lb/>
events and occurrences, which are now felt only as
<lb/>
matters of history, one is surprised at the puerility <lb/>
of some of the objections, the absurdity of others, <lb/>
and the overwrought coloring of almost all which <lb/>
were urged on this head against
the Constitution. <lb/>
That some of them had a just foundation need not  <lb/>
be denied or concealed, for the system was  <lb/>
human, and the result of compromise and con<lb break="no"/>ciliation in which something of the correctness of <lb/>

            <p>Now sir, I have said that British statesmen<lb/>
look upon Union, as the best mode of
providing<lb/>
for the defence of these Colonies, in time
of<lb/>
danger, and from the remarks of Lord Derby, it <lb/>
would be seen that he never contemplated
the <lb/>
possibility of its being rejected by the Colonies, 
 

            <cb/>

but rather looked upon it as a thing already pas<lb break="no"/>sed. But what says the press of England, that <lb/>

<hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, which every Englishman reads, and which
<lb/>
<choice><sic>howver</sic><corr>however</corr></choice> much it may be sneered at by some, <lb/>

            <p>It is clear that the moment the colonies <lb/>
manifest a disposition to separate from the par<lb break="no"/>ent state, that moment will the connection be <lb/>
severed. There will be no disposition on the part of <lb/>
England to force us to remain, while on the <lb/>
other hand, the greatest statesmen of the parent <lb/>
country have affirmed in unmistakable terms tnat <lb/>
if the Colonies wish to be loyal, the power of old <lb/>
England will be used to protect them from ag<lb break="no"/>gression, all they ask is to put ourselves in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to make our defence more easy. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> I have heard it stated over and over
again <lb/>
that England may forsake Canada and retain <lb/>
Nova Scotia. This I consider a perfect fallacy, <lb/>
and I defy anybody to produce proof in cor<lb break="no"/>roboration of such an idea, either from docu<lb break="no"/>ments emanating from any English statesman, <lb/>
or from any speech delivered by
any public <lb/>
man in Parliament. But even
supposing it <lb/>
were true, what position, I would ask,
would <lb/>
Nova Scotia be placed in? It
would not be <lb/>
the first time that she has been the battle <lb/>
ground of two great nations. When Canada <lb/>
and Cape Breton were French, and the rest of <lb/>
North America English, Nova
Scotia was the <lb/>
arena upon which the struggles
of these great <lb/>
powers in this contest too place—struggles <lb/>
which were continued till the extinction of <lb/>
French power in these Colonies.
Surely, no <lb/>
one would desire to see that state of things
re<lb break="no"/>enacted; and yet, if the idea of
the aban<lb break="no"/>donment of Canada were realized, we would <lb/>
be in even a worse position than we were in <lb/>
during the contest I have alluded to. But such <lb/>
an idea is absurd. The moment that the bond
<lb/>
of connection between Canada and
the Mother <lb/>
Country is severed, that moment we also cease <lb/>
to be a possession of the British Crown. <lb/>
Whether united with Canada by Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion or not, we are bound together by a common <lb/>
fate and a common interest, and we must
<lb/>
stand or fall together. There is one point <lb/>
that I intend to advert to for a moment, <lb/>
and that is to shew the reason why Great <lb/>
Britain has a right to dictate to us the method <lb/>
of our defence. No other such frontier as that <lb/>
which divides Canada from the United States  <lb/>
exists between two great countries. In
its <lb/>
length it is unlike any other,—and there is ano<lb break="no"/>ther peculiarity about it, that whilst the fron<lb break="no"/>tier of most other countries is defended by <lb/>
those who live behind it—in the
case of Cana<lb break="no"/>da alone part of the forces which
defend it has  <lb/>
to be brought from some three or four
thousand  <lb/>
miles away—while the great centres of popula<lb break="no"/>tion of the assailing force are at our doors.— <lb/>
Therefore, I think, if Great
Britain is obliged <lb/>
to defend a frontier so extensive as this, she <lb/>
has a right to give some advice,
and we have a <lb/>
right to listen to her advice as to the
course we <lb/>
ought to take, and the attitude we ought to <lb/>
adopt on the question of defence.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It has
been asserted by some that the tempta<lb break="no"/>tion to the United States to
take possession of<lb/>
Canada is greater than against
Nova Scotia.— <lb/>
I am rather inclined to think that
the tempta<lb break="no"/>tion is the other way. Let us
look for a moment <lb/>
at the character of the twocountries. There is <lb/>
no doubt that Canada in her agricultural re<lb break="no"/>sources, is a great country—that her
extent and <lb/>
value are enormous; but the
Western States <lb/>
are largely of the same
character. The prairies <lb/>
of Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, <lb/>
afford ample room for the settlement of the <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         
surplus population of the United States
for a <lb/>
long time to come, and Canada could give her <lb/>
nothing in this respect that she does not alrea<lb break="no"/>dy possess. <lb/>
            </p>



            <p> But, when we
turn to Nova Scotia, we find <lb/>
she possesses a source of
inexhaustible wealth <lb/>
not to be found along the whole seaboard of <lb/>
the United States. We find clustered
along the <lb/>
coast large centres of population,
engaged in <lb/>
arts and and manufactures, for whom warmth <lb/>
and light have to be provided, while the materi<lb break="no"/>al for warming and lighting them
has to be <lb/>
sought for abroad. We find this material <lb/>
supplied in in exhaustible quantities by a <lb/>
country just, at their doors, separated from <lb/>
them only by a political line.
We find <lb/>
their comfort and their commerce depend<lb break="no"/>ent largely upon this little colony, and if
<lb/>
their public men look at it as their pri<lb break="no"/>vate me look at it, (who have
already come <lb/>
down and peaceably acquired a large in<lb break="no"/>terest in our coal fields, with a shrewd eye to <lb/>
the future,) I think that so
far as temptations <lb/>
for conquest are concerned, the coal fields of <lb/>
Cape Breton are as likely to be coveted, as the <lb/>
fields and the plains of Canada. 
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> There is another matter too, which should
<lb/>
exercise some influence upon the public men <lb/>
of the United States—we happen to possess a <lb/>
population of some 20,000 men, engaged in the <lb/>
fisheries and navigation. To a
country desir<lb break="no"/>ous of extending her naval power what
great<lb break="no"/>er inducement could be held out than the pros<lb break="no"/>pect of adding 20,000 sailors to her navy? <lb/>
While, therefore, the
possession of that num<lb break="no"/>ber of men in time of peace when engaged in <lb/>
the prosecution of this valuable branch of in<lb break="no"/>dustry, is most important to any
country. Any <lb/>
one who knows how Northern commerce has
<lb/>
been swept off the sea by a few Southern ves<lb break="no"/>sels can understand how we should suffer if <lb/>
the dogs of war were let loose
upon the 8000<lb/>
vessels which constitute our marine, and upon
<lb/>
whose safety and earnings depends so much of  <lb/>
the benefit and prosperity of our people. When
<lb/>
the calamity of war does come we need not <lb/>
flatter ourselves either that it will not fall <lb/>
upon us, or that if it does fall on us,
that we <lb/>
shall be less sufferers than our neighbors.
The <lb/>
hon. Pro. Sec. had referred to another subject
<lb/>
which had always largely entered into the <lb/>
consideration of the question—the construction <lb/>
of the Intercolonial Railroad. I
appeal to <lb/>
those who have always attached great
impor<lb break="no"/>tance to the completion of that
work whether <lb/>
there ever was a time when its most sanguine <lb/>
advocates could have anticipated that it would <lb/>
be accomplished upon terms so advantageous
<lb/>
to the Province, as those
now within our reach. <lb/>
Surely if there should be any
weakness in the <lb/>
other arguments in favor of
Union, the pros<lb break="no"/>pect of the immediate realization
of this great <lb/>
enterprise is one which ought
to have great <lb/>
weight. The advantages that
Nova Scotia <lb/>
would derive from the completion of this work
<lb/>
have been so often dilated upon that I do
not <lb/>
consider it necessary to refer to them at
the <lb/>
present moment further than to say that <lb/>
with Nova Scotia, the great forefront <lb/>
of the continent, behind us, with Hali<lb break="no"/>fax, the great entrepot of the markets of <lb/>
the far West—with steamers running—not
<lb/>
fortnightly—but daily to Europe—with the
<lb/>
mail communication not only of our own colo<lb break="no"/>nies but of the United States passing over our  <lb/>
soil—with all the commercial and material <lb/>

prosperity that such a state of things
would <lb/>
produce, who can estimate the position we <lb/>
would occupy in a few years time should this <lb/>
Union be accomplished?  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Let
us look now at the United States before <lb/>
the commencement of this war, and see if the <lb/>
condition of affairs there does not
present a <lb/>
powerful argument for Union. A
population <lb/>
of three millions in 1773 grew into thirty mil<lb break="no"/>lions by 1860. They presented a spectacle of <lb/>
progress in wealth, in arts, in
civilization, in <lb/>
commercial prosperity, which
amazed the <lb/>
people of Europe. Now it may be
asked what <lb/>
produced the rapid and unprecedented
ad<lb break="no"/>vancement of this country? What produced <lb/>
such effects within the compass of a single <lb/>
life? It was, no doubt, owing to
various <lb/>
causes. Fertility of soil, variety of climate, <lb/>
the education of the masses of
the people, each <lb/>
and every one of these causes had its effect. <lb/>
But they had had the same soil, the same cli<lb break="no"/>mate, and the same means of
education for <lb/>
some 80 years before 1780, and yet the popula<lb break="no"/>tion had only reached three millions.
What, <lb/>
then, was the main cause of all
this? It was, <lb/>
that before 1780 they were divided, just as <lb/>
these Colonies are now. They had
separate <lb/>
governments, separate tariffs, with hostile <lb/>
armies of Customs officers on their borders,— <lb/>
they had separate currencies, and were divided <lb/>
by sectional differences just as
much as we are <lb/>
now. But the moment they were united under <lb/>
one government—the moment that
the armies <lb/>
of officials which hampered and restricted <lb/>
trade in every State were struck
off—the mo<lb break="no"/>ment that the system was adopted by which an <lb/>
article entering the Union at
one port could <lb/>
pass free to any other—from
that moment a <lb/>
stimulus was given to trade and commerce and <lb/>
manufactures which has had no parallel in
the <lb/>
world's history. Contrast this state
of things <lb/>
with the system pursued by the States
of <lb/>
Europe. There fifty different States have at <lb/>
least five and twenty separate tariffs,
and are <lb/>
obliged to maintain armies of Customs officials <lb/>
—embarrassing trade, and injuring the com<lb break="no"/>merce of the country.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> I am not prepared to say—it would be absurd <lb/> to suppose—that by a union with
                  Canada we <lb/> will arrive at the same commercial prosperity <lb/> as the United
                  States have attained, but I do <lb/> say that just as the union of those States
                  has <lb/> contributed to that result, so will our union <lb/> produce
                  corresponding advantages on a small<lb break="no"/>er scale. In connection with
                  the opposition <lb/> that this scheme has received, I would like to <lb/> call
                  attention to the fact that not only was the <lb/> same style of argument used by
                  the opponents <lb/> of the union of the American States, but the <lb/> objections
                  come from the same class. At the <lb/> close of the American war, when the
                  pressure <lb/> which had kept them together had nearly <lb/> ceased to operate,
                  the question of Union <lb/> by a more indissoluble and by a closer bond, <lb/> was
                  brought before the American people for <lb/> adoption or rejection, just as has
                  been done in <lb/> these Provinces—and it is rather singular that <lb/> in that
                  case as in this, the strongest objections <lb/> were made by the smallest
                  province. We find <lb/> that while the more populous States acquiesced <lb/> in
                  the propriety of Union, little Rhode Island,<lb/> with a population of 60,000,
                  took three years <lb/> before she would accept it,—just as Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island is now the strongest in opposition<lb/> to the present scheme. While
                  upon this sub<lb break="no"/>ject, let me say, in reference to the relative size <lb/>
                  <cb/> of these Provinces as compared with that of <lb/> the American Provinces,
                  before they went into <lb/> Union, that there was not one of the thirteen <lb/>
                  States as populous as Lower Canada now is— <lb/> that no two of them had a
                  population equal to <lb/> that of Upper Canada now—that two of them <lb/> had a
                  smaller population than Prince Edward <lb/> Island, the smallest of the British
                  Provinces, <lb/> has now. <lb/>
               </p>


            <p> Well, the union
ultimately took place, and <lb/>
what was the result? A degree
of prosperity <lb/>
which has astonished the whole civilized
world.<lb/>
And well do the people of the United States <lb/>
appreciate it. What is it that now stirs the <lb/>
heart of that great nation to its inmost
depths? <lb/>
Is it not their attachment to union?—their <lb/>
consciousness that upon union depends, to a <lb/>
large extent, their character, their prestige in <lb/>
the world, their national position? Is it not <lb/>
this which has plunged them into the most <lb/>
sanguinary war which history records? Is it, <lb/>
then, all a chimera they are fighting for? I do <lb/>
not suppose—I am not desirous of conveying <lb/>
the absurd idea, that all that union has done <lb/>
for them it will do for us; but what I do con<lb break="no"/>tend is, that it will largely improve our trade, <lb/>
our industry, our manufactures; that on a <lb/>
small scale, to be sure, but, to a large extent, <lb/>
it will develope
every resource we have, and <lb/>
improve our
prosperity.  <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> But it may be contended that the union I <lb/>
am arguing for is not the one which is con<lb break="no"/>templated by the resolution before the house. <lb/>
That is true; and yet it
is not the less true that <lb/>
every argument in favor of the larger
union <lb/>
is an argument in favor of the lesser. The <lb/>
advantages may not be so great,
but they are <lb/>
in the same line; and there is nobody who
<lb/>
argues for the larger union that does not feel <lb/>
that if that is impracticable, the lesser.union is <lb/>
a step in the right direction.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> They might shrink from undertaking both at <lb/> the same time—many might suppose
                  that it <lb/> would be too great a shock to our social frame <lb/> work, if at the
                  same moment we were to con<lb break="no"/>struct the Union of the Lower Provinces
                  by an<lb/> amalgamation of our Legislature, and erect a <lb/> central machinery at
                  the headquarters of the <lb/> Federation. There is, therefore, much to be <lb/>
                  said in favor of the smaller Union, when the <lb/> action of New Brunswick has
                  rendered the <lb/> discussion of the other question not a practical <lb/>
                  discussion. In the Lower Provinces at all <lb/> events there are no distinctions
                  of race, of <lb/> creed, of commercial or territorial interest to <lb/> separate
                  us—united, we should have a broader <lb/> field a larger revenue, a less
                  proportionate <lb/> burden in the maintenance of civil govern<lb break="no"/>ment.
                  If the time should come when we enter <lb/> into Confederation, the Maritime
                  Colonies, <lb/> united, will form a more solid phalanx in the <lb/> United
                  Legislature—would be governed by a <lb/> more united sentiment—would wield
                     power<lb break="no"/>ful influence. Therefore, whether this Union <lb/> should
                  end with the Lower Colonies or should <lb/> expand to Confederation, it will be
                  alike use<lb break="no"/>ful to us—and I have great pleasure, therefore, <lb/> in
                  seconding the resolution introduced by the <lb/> Provincial Secretary.<lb/>

 to consider with others from New

Union of the Maritime Provinces. That dele<lb break="no"/>gation was appointed, and a conference took <lb/>
place at Charlottetown, and somehow or other <lb/>
the gentlemen who went thither were spirited <lb/>
away to Canada. Now, I hold that these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen had no authority from this house to <lb/>
proceed to Canada to deliberate upon any <lb/>
other scheme than that contained in the reso<lb break="no"/>lution laid upon the table last session by the <lb/>
Provincial Secretary. We may be
told they <lb/>
were invited by the Governor-General, and <lb/>
that permission was accorded them by the <lb/>
home authorities. But what did they do in <lb/>
P. E. Island? Any one taking up the papers <lb/>
laid upon the table of the house, will see that <lb/>
the question of the Union of the Maritime <lb/>
Provinces was scarcely taken into considera<lb break="no"/>tion at all. And I have it upon the best <lb/>
authority—from one of the delegates them<lb break="no"/>selves—from a speech delivered at
Toronto by <lb/>
Mr. McCully—that the question of Union was <lb/>
not even approached in a spirit to assure suc<lb break="no"/>cess. That gentleman said: <lb/>

            </head>

            <p> Let me turn your attention, for a few mo<lb break="no"/>ments, to another view of this question.
Those <lb/>
gentlemen have come here with a resolution, <lb/>
re-affirming the desirability of a Union of the <lb/>
Maritime Provinces. They held a Conference <lb/>
at Quebec—entered into certain arrangements <lb/>
there—adopted the larger scheme. I admit at <lb/>
once they were at liberty to confer on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, but I deny their right on behalf of the <lb/>
people to adopt any scheme compromising this <lb/>
country. What had we at the commencement <lb/>
of the session? We are all familiar with the <lb/>
agitation that took place immediately after <lb/>
these gentlemen returned from Canada—with <lb/>
the public meetings that came off in Halifax <lb/>
and in several of the rural districts. We all <lb/>
know the language that was put in the mouth <lb/>
of His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, <lb/>
when he opened the present session. Was not <lb/>
one-third of his speech devoted to the particu<lb break="no"/>lar topic of Union? The gentlemen who now <lb/>
surround him put into his mouth a pledge that <lb/>
the matter would be brought to the notice of <lb/>
the house at the present session. Why is it <lb/>
not here? Did not these gentlemen promise <lb/>
to bring this question of a
Confederation of the <lb/>
whole of the Provinces before us. It is unne<lb break="no"/>cessary that I should read from the speech of <lb/>
the Lieutenant Governor, because we are all <lb/>
familiar with it. But let me give an extract <lb/>
from a speech of the Attorney General of <lb/>
Upper Canada (Hon. J. A. M'Donald,) who <lb/>
made use of these words in introducing this <lb/>
subject of Confederation to the notice of the <lb/>
people of Canada. <lb/>
            </p>
 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> " <hi rendition="simple:italic">Every one</hi> of these governments (the governments <lb/>

            <cb/>

            <p> Could there be language more explicit
than <lb/>
that? Why, then, is not that scheme here? <lb/>
Hon. E. Tache, President of the Legislative <lb/>
Council and Premier of Canada, also said after <lb/>
the result of the elections in New Brunswick <lb/>
was known: <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> " Notwithstanding the expression of
opinion given <lb/>
at the hustings in one of the provinces concerned, the <lb/>

to see their fellow delegates

            <p> Here again we have it from the lips of
the <lb/>
venerable Premier of Canada that
these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen were pledged to submit the question to <lb/>
this house—that even in New Brunswick the <lb/>
Executive, formed since the elections, were <lb/>
bound to submit it to the people of that coun<lb break="no"/>try. And have we not from the mouth of the <lb/>
Provincial Secretary himself a distinct pledge <lb/>
that the measure would have been submitted <lb/>
here. Let me here draw your attention to a <lb/>
report of his speech delivered at Truro, in <lb/>
which he pledged himself to submit this mat<lb break="no"/>ter to the people if the house, and if they did <lb/>
not agree to it, that he would not remain a <lb/>
single hour a minister of the crown, without <lb/>
an appeal to the people. Let me read from <lb/>
the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Colonist</hi>:<lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> " Upon the subject of dissolution the
Provincial <lb/>
Secretary declared that the duty of the government <lb/>
was too plain to admit of any doubt or dispute. They <lb/>

            <p> In the face of these declarations, I ask <lb/>
how it is that these gentlemen dared
to <lb/>
come down and present any other scheme <lb/>
than that which, through the Lieutenant <lb/>
Governor, by the leaders in both branches <lb/>
of the Legislature in Canada, and the solemn <lb/>
pledge of the Provincial Secretary himself <lb/>
they promised to submit to this house and <lb/>
this people. How does the matter stand? <lb/>
In virtue of the pledge made by the respective <lb/>
governments,—even after the result
of the <lb/>
elections in New Brunswick was made known <lb/>
—the government of Canada brought the ques<lb break="no"/>tion up, and passed it in their Legislature by <lb/>
large majorities. In the little province of P. <lb/>
E. Island, where confederation has but few <lb/>
friends, the government, with a manliness that <lb/>
did them credit, brought down the scheme <lb/>
and were defeated upon it. What more? In <lb/>
New Brunswick, the gallant Premier, leading <lb/>
the government, went to the hustings and fell<lb/>
under the force of public opinion. And it is <lb/>
only in Nova Scotia that the administration, <lb/>
ignoring their functions as a
government, <lb/>
shrank from the responsibilities
of the posi<lb break="no"/>tion, and violated their solemn pledges and <lb/>
recorded engagements.  <lb/>

let me
say a few words to my honorable <lb/>
friend, the learned member for Colchester—
<lb/>
generally termed the leader of the opposition. <lb/>
Certainly not the leader of the opposition on <lb/>
this question. And sometimes we put the <lb/>
query to ourselves, whether he should be re<lb break="no"/>cognized as the leader of the
opposition at all? <lb/>
I do not say this offensively,
but I feel that <lb/>
that hon. gentleman, on a question of such <lb/>
large importance as this, has ill
discharged his <lb/>
duty to the gentlemen with whom he has long <lb/>
been associated, when he ignored the functions <lb/>
of the party that introduced responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment into this country, and ventured
to <lb/>
agree in Canada to adopt a scheme without <lb/>
reference to the people—contrary, as I believe, <lb/>
to the principles under which our government <lb/>
is formed. That hon. gentleman stated no <lb/>
opinion had been expressed against Union. <lb/>
But it must not be supposed in
this case that <lb/>
silence gives consent. If the question of im<lb break="no"/>mediate union with Canada had been submitted <lb/>
to the house last winter, I believe it would not <lb/>
have been entertained at all. The sentiment <lb/>
of this country has not come up to union with <lb/>
Canada. It is true we have had delegates from <lb/>
time to time, and eminent leadin men have <lb/>
proceeded to Canada and England authorized <lb/>
to discuss the question in connexion with other <lb/>
matters, but you never had any measure sub<lb break="no"/>mitted. You never had the question of <hi rendition="simple:italic">federal</hi> <lb/>
union. Union in any form never was brought <lb/>
up in a practical shape. But,
says the learned <lb/>
gentleman, the public opinion of England, <lb/>
previous to 1857, was opposed to a union of <lb/>
these colonies. So it was. There was a party <lb/>
in England at that time who thought if these <lb/>
colonies were united they would become pow<lb break="no"/>erful and antagonistic to the mother country. <lb/>
I admit a different feeling has come over the <lb/>
British people in that respect. But let us look <lb/>
at the motive. England is governed largely by <lb/>
the mercantile interests; and
the men of the <lb/>
Manchester school, looking at the enormous <lb/>
taxes imposed by Canada upon British manu<lb break="no"/>factures and that in 1862 a proposition to grant <lb/>
a considerable sum of money towards the <lb/>
maintenance of the militia was thrown out, <lb/>
naturally look favorably upon a confederation <lb/>
or any scheme which, in their opinion, would <lb/>
not only have the effect of reducing the duties <lb/>
upon manufactures, but of throwing the bur<lb break="no"/>then
of the defence of the provinces
upon <lb/>
themselves. Such is the belief of the British <lb/>
people. Will they believe it now when the <lb/>
views of all parties are better known? When <lb/>
the perceive that the duties cannot be reduced <lb/>
under confederation? When they
hear that <lb/>
the conference only proposed to
give $1,000,000 <lb/>
for defences? Will they believe it when they <lb/>
learn that, even in Canada, there
is a large <lb/>
party—including, it is said, even some of the <lb/>
members of the government themselves—who
<lb/>
are not much disposed to keep up the connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the imperial
government unless they <lb/>
guarantee a war loan. We have been told <lb/>
about allegiance and loyalty, but what do we <lb/>
find in the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, the organ
of the hon. <lb/>
George Brown, a personal friend of my own. <lb/>
In his correspondence from Quebec, we are <lb/>
told that there is a large party in Canada in <lb/>
favor of annexation—a sentiment
which has <lb/>
been repeated in the editorial columns of the <lb/>
same journal. And the
apprehension was wide <lb/>
spread, that unless the imperial government <lb/>
bleed freely, they will look for more intimate 
           

            <cb/>

relations with the neighboring States. That <lb/>
is said to be the feeling of a large party in <lb/>
Canada. <lb/>

WHAT THEY SAY IN ENGLAND. 
            </head>




            <p> We have been referred to opinions
expressed <lb/>
in England. Lord Derby, we are told, expres<lb break="no"/>sed a strong opinion on the Reciprocity
Treaty, <lb/>
and alarm in consequence of the notice that <lb/>
was given of its repeal; but when we have a <lb/>
government in England, we do not look to the <lb/>
opposition for the sentiments of the people of <lb/>
that country. We look to the government
as <lb/>
the gentlemen representing public opinion.— <lb/>
Lord Derby's observations, I may say, how<lb break="no"/>ever, with regard to these colonies, were of the <lb/>
most friendly character—he was ready to de<lb break="no"/>fend these provinces at all hazards, and he <lb/>
blamed the government for their want of fore<lb break="no"/>sight; but I do not take his opinions as those <lb/>
of the people of England. Let me refer you to
<lb/>
an authority equally as eminent as
Mr. Foster, <lb/>
Right Hon. Mr. Fitzgerald, a distinguished <lb/>
member of the House of Commons who said : <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> " I differ widely from the hon. member

of the two coun<lb break="no"/>tries on the lakes was conceived,
by the American go<lb break="no"/>vernment in a spirit of hostility to England, and that <lb/>
the termination of the

spirit of hostility to this country.</hi> I have never held <lb/>
such language, nor do I think it is justified. As to <lb/>
the limitation of the naval force on the lakes, the Am<lb break="no"/>erican government are perfectly justified in proposing <lb/>
it. What are the circumstances under which notice <lb/>
to terminate the convention is good? By a party
of <lb/>
sympathiers making a descent from
Canada, an Am<lb break="no"/>erican vessel was seized on one of the great lakes, it <lb/>
was only by accident that a second vessel was not sei<lb break="no"/>zed ; and the object might have
been carried out for <lb/>
the liberation of a large number
of Confederate pris<lb break="no"/>oners on Johnson's island. Under such circumstan<lb break="no"/>ces, seeing that there was nearly 2000 prisoners there <lb/>
—that an attack had been made on American proper<lb break="no"/>ty in American waters, I think the American govern-
<lb break="yes"/>
were justified in having recourse
to this measure." <lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p> There is the justification, and I consider it <lb/>
ample. Suppose the position of
affairs were re<lb break="no"/>versed, and that we were American
citizens, <lb/>
and vessels were to be fitted out from the ports <lb/>
of our enemy—would we not resent it, and it
<lb/>
there was a treaty in existence
which prevent<lb break="no"/>ed us arming boats on the lakes, would
we not <lb/>
give notice immediately of our intention to <lb/>
bring it to a termination. I
shall now produce <lb/>
a much higher authority—no one else than Mr. <lb/>
Cardwell himself, the
Secretary of State for the <lb/>
Colonies. The Provincial Secretary, on a pre<lb break="no"/>vious evening, spoke in the tone of
the alarm<lb break="no"/>ist, as did also this afternoon,
my hon. friend <lb/>
from Colchester—held out the bug bear of the <lb/>
notices given for the
termination of the Reci<lb break="no"/>procity Treaty—for the abrogation
of the treaty <lb/>
in reference to gunboats on the lakes, and
for <lb/>
bringing the labours of the Fishery Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner to an end. All these
facts were mentioned <lb/>
with the usual great emphasis of that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man as illustrations of the
spirit of hostility that <lb/>
influences the United States in respect to these <lb/>
provinces. Now I do not think that
gentleman, <lb/>
as a Minister of
the Crown in this country, was <lb/>
warranted in indulging in
that strain. My <lb/>
hon. friend from Colchester who

            <head rendition="simple:centre"> DEFENCE.
<lb/>
            </head>

            <p> My hon. friend from Colchester referred
to- <lb break="yes"/>
the question of defence. He said, "See the <lb/>
advantage that we will in that respect derive <lb/>
from Union. You will have a concentration of <lb/>
men and money." I contend that Confederation <lb/>
will give you no more money, no
more men, <lb/>
and as to concentration you have now just as <lb/>
much as you would have then. We are told in <lb/>
the language of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> that under Confe<lb break="no"/>deration we would be all under one military <lb/>
command. Let me ask, Who commands the <lb/>
torces in British America now? Is it not Gen. <lb/>
Williams at Montreal or Quebec? It is true <lb/>
that the Militia may not be marched
out of the <lb/>
Province in the event of war, and I admit that <lb/>
it is our duty in the case of
hostilities to assist <lb/>
our brethren in Canada and New
Brunswick, <lb/>
but under the
existing state of our law you can<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/> 
        
 not move a single regiment of
militia across the  <lb/>
frontier. But does it require
Confederation to <lb/>
do that? Cannot you, by a simple
act of the <lb/>
Legislature, give the Governor the
power to  <lb/>
march out as many militiamen as
you choose? <lb/>
So, really isolated as we are said to be, the Com<lb break="no"/>mander-in-chief, at any moment, by agreement
<lb/>
made between the several Provinces, can have <lb/>
the militia marched to the assistance of our fel<lb break="no"/>low countrymen, and they in turn can be <lb/>
brought to us in the time of peril. Then we are <lb/>
told that British statesmen look forward to Con<lb break="no"/>federation as a means of defence. Had they <lb/>
been told, as we were three months ago, that this
<lb/>
Confederation was only going to give a million <lb/>
of dollars, what would the people of England <lb/>
have said ? What did they say in the debate <lb/>
to which I have referred ? The report of Col. <lb/>
Jervois was read, and it was suggested that Ca<lb break="no"/>nada would contribute, not for defence alone,
<lb/>
but for fortifications, the enormous sum of
<lb/>
$6,000,000. A million has been granted by <lb/>
Canada during the late session
towards fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions, not to be expended until the delegation <lb/>
learn whether they can obtain from England <lb/>
the guarantee for the war loan they wish.
Du<lb break="no"/>ring the late session a million
and a half—the <lb/>
half million for frontier defences—was given by <lb/>
Canada alone—or half a million more than we <lb/>
were told the entire
Confederation would give. <lb/>
The gentleman who went to Canada, among <lb/>
other startling things, agreed to do this—to
bind, <lb/>
as far as they could, these several provinces to <lb/>
contribute their share towards
any sum of mo <lb/>
ney that Canada might raise or borrow towards <lb/>
the defences of the country.
That was denied <lb/>
by the delegates at one of the public meetings, <lb/>
but I hold in my hand an extract from a speech <lb/>
delivered since that time by
Hon. J . A. Macdo<lb break="no"/>nald,

<p> 
     <lb/>Then we are told if Canada was given up, 
     <lb/>could we be retained—that _ when Canada falls, 
     <lb/>we share the same fate. I ask the plain ques<lb break="no"/>tion, Would Confederation save us? Would 
     <lb/>any union of the people of these Provinces- 
     <lb break="yes"/>would any union of our means, unaided by the 
     <lb/>British Government, save us in the event of the 
     <lb/>Americans being determined to invade our coun<lb break="no"/>try and possess it? I say no ; but what is the 
     <lb/>idea implied but not expressed by these gentle<lb break="no"/>men? The idea implied is this: the Home 
     <lb/>Government will not assist you unless you con<lb break="no"/>federate. Now I challenge both of these hon. 
     <lb/>men to shew me a single passage from a 
     <lb/>despatch or a speech from a Minister of the 
     <lb/>Crown that will warrant them in using such 
     <lb/>language on behalf of the Home Government. 
     <lb/>I contend that if Canada was given up tomor<lb break="no"/>row or fell by force of arms, this Province would 
     <lb/>still be retained. I believe that England feels, 
     <lb/>and has felt for along time, that Canada is the 
     <lb/>weak point on this side of the Atlantic, and that  
     <lb/>it is the opinion of many British statesmen that if 
     <lb/>Canada were separated from England tomorrow 
     <lb/>it would be a great gain to the mother country, 
     <lb/>and imperil her far less. But there are inter<lb break="no"/>ests peculiar to Nova Scotia—and in some res<lb break="no"/>pects to New Brunswick also, which must influ<lb break="no"/>ence England to   keep them in her possession. 
     <lb/>When these provinces are gone, what hope can 
     <lb/>England have of retaining her possessions in 
     <lb/>the West Indies? Does any gentleman sup<lb break="no"/>pose that England, whose greatness is   made up 
     <lb/>to a large extent-by colonies scattered in different 
     <lb/>ent parts of the globe, is going to part with 
     <lb/>these sources of her power and prestige?   With 
     <lb/>our inexhaustible coal fields and unrivalled har<lb break="no"/>bors in the possession of an enemy, it must be <lb/> only a question of time when the West India 
     <lb/>Islands would suffer the same fate. But I have 
     <lb/>no belief that the Americans have any design 
     <lb/>either upon Canada or the maritime colonies. 
     <lb/>I think that at a time not very far back, when 
     <lb/>this harbor was the resort of blockaders—when 
     <lb/>raids were made from Canada  across the fron<lb break="no"/>tier—when there was much excitement in con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the fact that Canada was filled with Southern sympathisers, _  
     <lb/>and the impression was rife that that Province had not done 
     <lb/>justice in respect to the raiders,—that then a 
     <lb/>feeling of hostility existed which is fast passing away. The Canadian Government 
     <lb/>have made ample reparation, and by their recent. 
     <lb/>conduct have succeeded in establishing a better 
     <lb/>feeling on both sides of the border. There will be 
     <lb/>no disposition, I think, when, this war is brought 
     <lb/>to a close, to invade these provinces; In the 
     <lb/>first place, the American government have al<lb break="no"/>ready accumulated a debt of, £500,000,000 ster<lb break="no"/>ling charged with an extravagant rate of inter<lb break="no"/>est, that involves an enormous taxation.  Their 
     <lb/>resources  have been taxed to the utmost, and 
     <lb/>the time has come when they require peace.   
     <lb/>After, all, what would they gain by these provin<lb break="no"/>ces. Supposethey became possessed of Canada 
    

            <cb/>
        

     to-morrow, what would they have? a disaffected 
     <lb/>
     people on their hands, who at any time should 
     <lb/>
     renewal of hostilities with the South arise, 
     <lb/>
     would combine with them and cause them to 
     <lb/>
     lose their recently acquired possessions.

     FREE TRADE AND CURRENCY. 
     <lb/>
            </head>

            <p>
     Then the hon. gentleman has referred to Canada 
     <lb/>
     as being our true back country. I have never 
     <lb/>
     thought so. What is Canada to us ? Examine
     <lb/>
     the Trade Returns. We are told that under Con<lb break="no"/>federation trade would grow up to an enormous 
     <lb/>
     extent. I doubt it. But first let me say that our 
     <lb/>
     proper back country is New Brunswick, especially 
     <lb/>
     that part of it through which Mr. Flemming has   
     <lb/>
     been exploring for the Inter-colonial Railway.   
     <lb/>
     Although I know that her debt per head is larger 
     <lb/>
     than ours, and her tariff— is higher, still, looking 
     <lb/>
     at the future, a connection with New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     would probably be attended with advantageous 
     <lb/>
     results. The hon. member has turned attention 
     <lb/>
     to the United States, and shown how much they 
     <lb/>
     have gained in late years. How much has Canada 
     <lb/>
     grown since Responsible Government was granted? 
     <lb/>
     Is it not a common remark, even with Americans, 
     <lb/>
     that Canada has increased more rapidly than any 
     <lb/>
     State of the Union? And see how we have grown 
     <lb/>
     ourselves, under self-government. We are told 
     <lb/>
     that American prosperity is the result of free 
     <lb/>
     trade. I admit at once that free intercourse 
     <lb/>
     amongst the different States has been immensely 
     <lb/>
     conducive to the advancement of that remarkable 
     <lb/>
     people; but there are other causes that have 
     <lb/>
     tended to make her a great country. First of all, 
     <lb/>
     there is a great diversity of climate and produc<lb break="no"/>tion. In the south they produce cotton, tobacco, 
     <lb/>
     rice and sugar, and in the North they have manu<lb break="no"/>factures; wheat and commerce; and, in addition 
     <lb/>
     to all this, there is free trade between thirty mil<lb break="no"/>lions of people. Suppose you had a Union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada to-morrow, have you all these elements of 
     <lb/>
     wealth? This question of free trade with Canada 
     <lb/>
     can be settled without a political Union; it is a 
     <lb/>
     delusion to say otherwise. You might, have had 
     <lb/>
     free trade years ago; it was offered to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia, as it was to those of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. It has been refused by' both Provinces, for   
     <lb/>
     very obvious reasons. In view of the building of   
     <lb/>
     the Inter-colonial Railway, it was thought it would   
     <lb/>
     largely affect their revenues. Manufactures are 
     <lb/>
     much more deveIoped in Canada than either in 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick or Nova Scotia; and under these 
     <lb/>
     circumstances,   it was   thought that a large amount 
     <lb/>
     of manufactures would flow into these Provinces,   
     <lb/>
     and thereby largely affect our revenue. Therefore 
     <lb/>
     it was wisely concluded that, until the  Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway was obtained, we would postpone 
     <lb/>
     the consideration of the question of free trade.   
     <lb/>
     To those gentlemen who are urging a political 
     <lb/>
     Union, for defence and free trade, for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of assimilating our currency and our postal ar<lb break="no"/>rangements, I say that all these things can be 
     <lb/>
     obtained without Confederation.   They know that 
     <lb/>
     canadian statesmen to-morrow would be only, too 
     <lb/>
     happy to meet you on that platform, and give you   
     <lb/>
     a free exchangeof manufuctures. The question of   
     <lb/>
     currency might be, adjusted by the   Financial

noon; and, in reference to defence, the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tures of the several Provinces could pass laws 
     <lb/>
     similar to each other's, under which the militia 
     <lb/>
     of each might be called out at any time, without 
     <lb/>
     a political Union. We are told of one heart, and 
     <lb/>
     one soul, and one mind, in respect to the defence 
     <lb/>
     of the Provinces. Now I hold that the British 
     <lb/>
     Government, as long as this Province remains a 
     <lb/>
     dependency, is the party to be charged with our 
     <lb/>
     defences; and I would draw out of our treasury a 
     <lb/>
     sum of money to be given by each Province every 
     <lb/>
     year, under an Imperial act, if you please, with 
     <lb/>
     the consent of our own Legislature, notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing the strong language which the hon. Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary made use of in respect to this matter on 
     <lb/>
     a previous evening. I would hand over this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of defence to the Imperial Government who 
     <lb/>
     possess the material of war, combined with the 
     <lb/>
     skill and science required in naval and military 
     <lb/>
     operations. Now you grant considerable sums for 
     <lb/>
     the militia, but how are they expended? Do they 
     <lb/>
     do a large amount of good? Would not any 
     <lb/>
     money you would give be expended much more 
     <lb/>
     satisfactorily by officers under the control of the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial authorities? Let each Province con<lb break="no"/>tribute liberally, according to its ability—and, so 
     <lb/>
     far, I have yet to learn that there has been any 
     <lb/>
     complaint made in regard to the sum of money 
     <lb/>
     contributed by this Province towards its militia 
     <lb/>
     and defences.

     <lb/>
            </head>
   
            <p>
     The hon. Provincial Secretary defended his 
     <lb/>
     action in reference to the Union question on the 
     <lb/>
     ground of the opinions held in this House, and 
     <lb/>
     elaborated from time to time by Mr. Howe, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Young and Mr. Johnston, and also by a lecture 
     <lb/>
     delivered at Temperance Hall by Mr. McGee, 
     <lb/>
     which was most enthusiastically received, and on 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion of which a vote of thanks was 
     <lb/>
     moved by two of the gentlemen I have just named, 
     <lb/>
     to the lecturer. I would remind the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary that no action was ever taken practically 
     <lb/>
     upon this question. We have been told that a 
     <lb/>
     resolution was passed in the session of 1861. I 
     <lb/>
     was one of the delegates in 1862, and although 
     <lb/>
     the question of Union was supposed to be before 
     <lb/>
     us, the subjects that were really considered were 
     <lb/>
     Free Trade and the Inter-colonial Railway. I 
     <lb/>
     may state frankly that there was no formal dis<lb break="no"/>cussion at that convention on the question of 
     <lb/>
     Union. It was looked upon as a matter in the 
     <lb/>
     distance, to be consummated after an Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway and Free Trade had been 
     <lb/>
     enjoyed for years by the separate Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Then, I say, the hon. gentleman had 
     <lb/>
     no right to assume from anything that occurred 
     <lb/>
     there, that the people of this country, were in 
     <lb/>
     favour of Union, particularly such an one, as has 
     <lb/>
     been propounded for our acceptance. The city of 
     <lb/>
     Halifax is not the Province of Nova Scotia, and 
     <lb/>
     the expression of opinion that we hear there— 
     <lb/>
     which will be heard to-morrow night—is not that 
     <lb/>
     of the people. It can only be gathered by the 
     <lb/>
     votes of the several counties, and whenever the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity is given for the people to speak out 
     <lb/>
     on the question, they will do so, in a manner that 
     <lb/>
     will not be agreeable to the feelings of those 
    

            <cb/>
         

     gentlemen, who have attempted to strike down 
     <lb/>
     our liberties, and change our constitution. Then 
     <lb/>
     we have been told Mr. Cardwell, the Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, is in favour of this scheme. Of course 
     <lb/>
     he is—as well as the people of England. The 
     <lb/>
     Colonies have been a heavy burden upon them, 
     <lb/>
     and any scheme that holds out a prospect of relief 
     <lb/>
     from taxation, is naturally acceptable to them. 
     <lb/>
     Now there are five British North American colo<lb break="no"/>nies, with which the Colonial Secretary must keep 
     <lb/>
     up a correspondence; and a Union of these would 
     <lb/>
    doubtless largely decrease the labors of the office 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But we are told that the 83 gentlemen, who 
     <lb/>went to Quebec, were unanimously in favour of 
     <lb/>the scheme. They may have been very unani<lb break="no"/>mous there, but, somehow or other, some of them 
     <lb/>changed their minds very quickly, when they re<lb break="no"/>turned to their respective homes, and were brought 
     <lb/>face to face with their constituents. We are t old 
     <lb/>too that the Press of England are in favour of the 
     <lb/>scheme. I respect much more the public opinion 
     <lb/>of our own country. We are the parties who are 
     <lb/>to be affected for weal or for woe by any change 
     <lb/>in our condition. How has New Brunswick 
     <lb/>acted? How is it that three-fourths of the recent<lb break="no"/>ly elected representatives of the people in that 
     <lb/>Province have been returned to oppose the Union 
     <lb/>with Canada?

     this principle is right, that he sits here with only

                  was delivered by <lb/>Mr. Seton, one of the Commissioners for arranging <lb/>that

                  <lb/>given to Scotland in proportion to her numbers, <lb/>was justified on the

                  Scotia, and 47 as many <lb/>as all the Maritime Provinces were entitled to,
                  <lb/>in a House of 194. It must be recollected, how<lb break="no"/>ever, that
                  under Confederation you have separate <lb/>interests if you retain separate
                  Provinces, and <lb/>whilst this is the case, you must expect difficul<lb break="no"/>ties to arise. <lb/>

            <p>
     A difficulty applicable to this Confederation 
     <lb/>
     that might arise, was suggested not very long 
     <lb/>
     ago in one of the most celebrated organs of opinion 
     <lb/>
     in England. It was supposed to arise between 
     <lb/>
     the local Governor, appointed by the central 
     <lb/>
     Government at Ottawa, and his House or Assem<lb break="no"/>bly in Newfoundland. The matter is referred up 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa, and as it is supposed to be a question that 
     <lb/>
     all the Maritime Provinces are interested in their 
     <lb/>
     representatives combine and sustain Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. Parties are close in the Central Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and the result is, that with the aid of the 
     <lb/>
     47 representatives of the Lower Provinces, the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">local</hi>, and supposed to be subordinate Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     triumphs over the <hi rendition="simple:italic">central</hi> Parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The matter is then finally referred to the 
     <lb/>
     Colonial Secetary, who if he interferes is sure to 
     <lb/>
     offend one or other party, a conflict of authority 
     <lb/>
     follows, the issue of which it is not improbable 
     <lb/>
     would be the destruction of the entire Confeder<lb break="no"/>acy. If the Confederation was formed to-morrow, 
     <lb/>
     I don't believe it would last 10 years. It has not 
     <lb/>
     the elements of strength. At one extremity you 
     <lb/>
    have Vancouver's Island and British Columbia, 
     <lb/>and at the other, Nova Scotia and <choice><sic>New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wich</sic><corr>New Brunswick</corr></choice>—inhabited by people of the Anglo-Saxon 
     <lb/>race with their, indomitable spirit. Then between 
     <lb/>these, in the very heart of the Confederacy, we 
     <lb/>find the French population, cherishing opinions 
     <lb/>adverse to those of the Anglo-Saxon, and it is out 
     <lb/>of such discordant materials as these that you 
     <lb/>propose to found a powerful and united Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion.

     THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. 
    </head>

            <p>Now, a few words with respect to the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council, which, we are told, is to be composed 
     <lb/>of three divisions. Upper Canada has 24, Lower 
     <lb/>Canada 24, and the Maritime Provinces 24, or 
     <lb/>72 in all. It has been said that it was a great 
     <lb/>concession to give us 24. What the Maritime 
     <lb/>Provinces require in the central Parliament is 
     <lb/>protection, and how are they going to get it, when 
     <lb/>they have but 24 Representatives to 48 Canadians in 
     <lb/>the Legislative Council. Suppose the Reciprocity 
     <lb/>Treaty were repealed, although I don't believe it 
     <lb/>will be actually repealed, but that it will be con<lb break="no"/>tinued with some modification ; but supposing it 
     <lb/>is, might not the Confederate Parliament impose 
     <lb/>a duty upon American flour, would it not be for 
     <lb/>the interests of both sections of Canada to impose 
     <lb/>that duty, and is it not probable it would be 
     <lb/>done? Then, I ask, who will have to pay that 
     <lb/>duty. Every person knows that nine-tenths of 
     <lb/>the flour consumed here, comes from the United 
     <lb/>States. In such an event, as I have stated, it 
     <lb/>would come from Canada under this boasted sys<lb break="no"/>tem of free trade. Then every consumer of flour 
     <lb/>in the <choice><sic>Maratime</sic><corr>Maritime</corr></choice> Provinces would he called upon 
     <lb/>to pay an extra price upon that indispensable ar<lb break="no"/>ticle of food. With a Canadian majority of 147 
     <lb/>in the Lower House, and a majority of 48 to 24 
     <lb/>in the Upper Branch, what could we do but sub<lb break="no"/>mit or rebel?  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> If we are to have protection in the Legislative 
     <lb/>Council, the only way we can get it, is to imitate 
     <lb/>the example of the United States. Under their sys<lb break="no"/>tem, the smallest State has the same number of 
     <lb/>Representatives in the Senate as the largest. Little 
     <lb/> Rhode Island has as many voices as the Empire State 
     <lb/>New York. But suppose in the event of Union, 
     <lb/> Canada had 12, and each of the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the same number of members—Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island as many as Canada, then, if any 
     <lb/>injustice was attempted to be done to these Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in the Lower House, their Representatives 
     <lb/>in the Legislative Council, by combining together, 
     <lb/>could prevent it.

     INTERCOLONIAL RAILWAY. 
   </head>
   
            <p>
     The hon. Prov. Secretary has referred to the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway, and I must admit that 
     <lb/>
     has always been the strong card in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of the Confederate party. Every person is 
     <lb/>
     desirous of getting that railroad, although I am 
     <lb/>
     not one of those who believe that the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railroad, as a commercial speculation, 
     <lb/>
     is a very desirable undertaking. I think, how<lb break="no"/>ever, looking upon it in the light of a great 
     <lb/>
     highway—as a connecting link between the 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, and for purposes of defence, that 
     <lb/>
     its construction is really necessary. Such is 
     <lb/>
     the view of hon. George Brown, and I refer 
     <lb/>
     you on this point to his speech delivered in 
     <lb/>
     the House of Assembly at Quebec. But, says 
     <lb/>
     the Provincial Secretary, we have secured its 
     <lb/>
     construction at only one-tenth of its cost, in<lb break="no"/>stead of the 3 1/2-12ths, which we would have to 
     <lb/>
     pay under the former arrangement. One rea<lb break="no"/>son why I have a strong feeling against this 
     <lb/>
     Union with Canada is, because I have no faith 
     <lb/>
     in Canadian statesmen. I remember the way 
     <lb/>
     we were treated with respect to the Interco<lb break="no"/>lonial Railway—how the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment agreed to the scheme, and put it in the 
     <lb/>
     form of a treaty engagement—how they went 
     <lb/>
     to England and. violated the promises they 
     <lb/>
     made to the delegates from the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—how they attempted to persuade the 
     <lb/>
     British government to look upon their share in 
     <lb/>
     the cost of the Intercolonial Railway as a con<lb break="no"/>tribution towards local defences. Mr. Glad<lb break="no"/>stone made every effort he could to meet their 
     <lb/>
     views in reference to the sinking fund—promi<lb break="no"/>sing to invest the amount, if they wished it, in 
     <lb/>
     their own securities ; but even then they refused 
     <lb/>
     to ratify the solemn agreement which had been 
     <lb/>
     made between the Provinces in 1862. We are 
     <lb/>
     told that this Railroad is to be procured only 
     <lb/>
     under Confederation. But let it be remember<lb break="no"/>ed that that work is far more necessary to 
     <lb/>
     Canada than to ourselves. We have lived 
     <lb/>
     and prospered without it, and we can continue 
     <lb/>
     to do so; but its construction is to Canada a 
     <lb/>
     necessity. Some of their most eminent men 
     <lb/>
     have said, they must have the Intercolomal 
     <lb/>
     Railway at any cost—they must either have 
     <lb/>
     a Federal Union or annexation to the States. 
     <lb/>
     Are they obliged to have annexation with the 
     <lb/>
     United States? Cannot they now enter into 
     <lb/>
     commercial relations with us? Cannot all of 
     <lb/>
     the advantages they desire be obtained with<lb break="no"/>out the political union into which it is attempt<lb break="no"/>ed to drag us What was said by some of the 
     <lb/>
     most eminent statesmen of Canada on this 
     <lb/>
     subiect in the debate on Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. Cartier, Attorney General, East, said :— 
     <lb/>He had stated before audiences in the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces that, as far as territory, population, and wealth

     <lb/>of Canada, extensive communication with Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain at all seasons was absolutely necessary.

     The hon. Provincial Secretary has referred 
     <lb/>
     to the local governments, and declared that 
   

            <cb/>
          

     they will not be insignificant in character— 
     <lb/>
     that the Houses will still be a place where men 
     <lb/>
     of as great ability will aspire as those who sat 
     <lb/>
     here in former times. At that time there was 
     <lb/>
     only one place of political preferment that 
     <lb/>
     those gentlemen could aspire to, that was this 
     <lb/>
     House. Now there will be two—one at Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, where the salaries will be large, and the 
     <lb/>
     government liberal to a degree unknown in 
     <lb/>
     this country. I would like to hear the Provin<lb break="no"/>cial Secretary tell us what kind of local go<lb break="no"/>vernment we are to have—is there to be one 
     <lb/>
     House or two?—and if only one Chamber how

     many members are to sit there? Are we to have

     importance to the people of this country in

     connection with this subject—they are inter<lb break="no"/>esting to those gentlemen who do not expect 
     <lb/>
     to go to Ottawa, but aspire to come here again.

     They wish to learn whether this body is to be 
     <lb/>
     only a little more important than a Court of

     The hon. Provincial Secretary referred to 
     <lb/>
     the large majority by which this scheme has 
     <lb/>
     been adopted in Canada. That country under<lb break="no"/>stands her own interests too well not to re<lb break="no"/>ceive the scheme favorably. She knows that we 
     <lb/>
     have a surplus revenue, that we are a largely 
     <lb/>
     consuming people, and would be a valuable 
     <lb/>
     acquisition as contributors to the central trea<lb break="no"/>sury. I am not going into the financial argu<lb break="no"/>ment, I will leave that in the hands of a friend 
     <lb/>
     perhaps more familiar with the subject than 
     <lb/>
     myself, but 1 cannot refrain from quoting one 
     <lb/>
     or two authorities on the subject of taxation. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Galt, in that celebrated speech of his, 
     <lb/>
     which has so often been referred to, says: 
     <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     " In the case of the Lower Provinces, the average

     2 1/2 millions dollars, <hi rendition="simple:italic">under a higher tariff like that of

            <p>
     Now mark you, our taxation is to be in<lb break="no"/>crease from two and a half millions to three. 
     <lb/>
     Our advalorem duties are ten per cent. New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick has an average tariff fifteen and 
     <lb/>
     a half per cent.: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is proposed by Mr. Galt to reduce the 
     <lb/>
     advalorem duties from 20 to 15, but my firm 
     <lb/>
     belief is that they will have to be advanced 
     <lb/>
     to 25, or resort had to direct taxation in order 
     <lb/>
     to enable them to meet the increased expendi<lb break="no"/>ture that confederation will bring. He says 
     <lb/>
     the maritime provinces, under confederation 
     <lb/>
     will have to contribute half a million more 
     <lb/>
     than now. New Brunswick  is nearly as 
     <lb/>
     heavily taxed already as Canada, and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island being  a small colony, we 
     <lb/>
     would have to bear the larger proportion or 
     <lb/>
     the half million. On this subject the Toronto 
     <lb/>
     Globe, government organ, not very long ago

     to the position we occupy as a free people.

     We all remember the struggle that took place

     in this country to obtain departmental and

     responsible government; it was the work of 
     <lb/>
     years. The complaint then was that our

     you could not make a single appointment or

                  it is proposed to hand over to <lb/> a body of gentlemen sitting at Ottawa, where
                  <lb/> you will have 19 out of 194 members. You <lb/> have at this moment 75 ports
                  of entry and <lb/> clearance. If I remember aright, they have <lb/> but 84 in all

                  of <lb/> this department, to afford every possible conve<lb break="no"/>nience to
                  the people of the country ; so that <lb/> whenever an application is made for a

                  has been the extension <lb/> of the system, that while 20 years ago there <lb/>
                  were but 15 ports of entry and clearance in the <lb/> Province, there are now five
                  times that num<lb break="no"/>ber. Suppose, now, that you were confede<lb break="no"/>rated, and the attention of the Finance Minis<lb break="no"/>ter at
                  Ottawa was drawn to the fact that this <lb/> little Province had 75 ports of
                  entry, and some <lb/> of them collecting no revenue at all ; and sup<lb break="no"/>pose that an application was made by the <lb/> people of some one of the
                  counties that an<lb break="no"/>other be added to the number, what would <lb/> be
                  the answer? They would be told, " Your <lb/> Province has already more than she is

                  yet we hardly have a greater number <lb/> than you have ; and we believe your

                  suppose a vacancy <lb/> took place here to-morrow, who would fill it <lb/> up?
                  Some one at Ottawa who had the ear of <lb/> the Government—a Nova Scotian,
                  perhaps, if <lb/> any of them were supporting the Administra<lb break="no"/>tion,
                  and if not, some Canadian, who knows <lb/> nothing of your country or its people.
                  And so <lb/> with dismissals. Now you can arraign the <lb/> Government here,
                  create a public agitation on <lb/> the subject, and so affect public opinion as to
                  <lb/> disturb their tenure of office. <lb/>

     There is no country in the world that pos<lb break="no"/>sesses more postal accommodation than Nova

     <lb/>971,688 miles of annual travel. Canada at the

     <lb/>15,327 miles mail route, and 6,110,000 annual

     until they are one-fourth as numerous as those

     one-sixth. It is clear, then, that the advantage

     met with a sharp rebuff—told that they had

     more than their share already, some of which

     revenue together and you have $390,427 as the 
     <lb/>
     total revenue of NovaScotia if we were to be 
     <lb/>
     Confederated. Let us now look at the appro<lb break="no"/>priations. The gross sum proposed to be ex<lb break="no"/>pended this year is $1,395,871. I deduct from 
     <lb/>
     that amount all those departments and services 
     <lb/>
     that would be chargeable upon the general go<lb break="no"/>vernment in the event of Confedcration,-the 
     <lb/>
     civil list, revenue department, post office, light<lb break="no"/>house, public debt, defence, railway, and a few 
     <lb/>
     other matters. amounting in all to $731,565. De<lb break="no"/>duct this from the gross amount of appropria<lb break="no"/>tions, and you have left $664,306. The subsidy 
     <lb/>
     and local revenue amount to $390,427. Deduct 
     <lb/>
     the two sums which you would have this 
     <lb/>
     year under Confederation from the amount 
     <lb/>
     you have appropriated for strictly local pur<lb break="no"/>poses, and you would hand over to Canada 
     <lb/>
     $273,879. Then there is to be a supplemental 
     <lb/>
     estimate,—a grant for Colchester has been 
     <lb/>
     omitted, additional grants to the colleges have 
     <lb/>
     to be provided for, and other sums, I hear, are 
     <lb/>
     to be expended. In addition to these the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ad<lb break="no"/>vances</hi> made during the recess must be taken 
     <lb/>
     into account, about $15,000. Altogether <hi rendition="simple:italic">three 
     <lb/>
     hundred thousand dollars</hi> loss the first year un<lb break="no"/>der Confederatibn—handed over to the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     Parliament—taken away from the local im<lb break="no"/>provements of our country, to be spent in 
     <lb/>
     meeting the "necessities of Canada."

            <p> You have been told that the subsidy from the <lb/> Central Government, with the
                  local revenue <lb/> which you are allowed to retain, will be suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to meet the annual requirements of the <lb/> country. To accurately
                  determine this point, <lb/> we should be in possession of the views of the <lb/>
                  Delegates as to the composition of the local <lb/> Government, the number of
                  members who <lb/> are to sit in the Legislature, and the cost; <lb/> the number,
                  functions, and salaries of the <lb/> chief officers of the Government, - because
                  <lb/> without this information it is impossible to <lb/> know the amount
                  applicable to the local <lb/> improvements of the country. And as we <lb/> cannot
                  get the required information from the <lb/> Government, who here, as in Canada,
                  are <lb/> singularly reticent on the subject, I have <lb/> ventured to sketch a
                  programme, for the bene<lb break="no"/>fit of gentlemen opposite, which I hold in
                  my <lb/> hand, and will place in the hands of the <lb/> ter for publication: <lb/>

            <p>
     I have assumed that under the local Go<lb break="no"/>vernment which it is proposed to give us, the 
     <lb/>
     office of Financial Secretary will not be requi<lb break="no"/>red, and that the Provincial Secretary, with 
     <lb/>
     the aid of an additional clerk, may discharge 
     <lb/>
     the duties of both offices, at a cost of $4050, in<lb break="no"/>stead of $5600, which we pay now. The Recei<lb break="no"/>ver General's office to be reduced from $4600, to 
     <lb/>
     $3100. I presume that we are to have an At<lb break="no"/>torney General, and as he will not be of such 
     <lb/>
     large proportions as the gentleman who tills 
     <lb/>
     the office at present, I may venture to cut him 
     <lb/>
     down from $2000 to $1600; the Solicitor General 
     <lb/>
     I would dispense with altogether. The Crown 
     <lb/>
    Land Office, to be efficient, must cost as much 
     <lb/>under Confederation as now. The charge for 
     <lb/>Staff of the Board of Works, I reduce from 
     <lb/>$4400 to $3000, and I have deducted $30,000 this 
     <lb/>year for construction at the Lunatic Àsylum. 
     <lb/>Navigation Securities I have out down from 
     <lb/>$49,040 to $19,040, omitting the grant of $30,000 
     <lb/>to St. Peter's Canal. Packets and ferries from 
     <lb/>$11,451 to $4,451, deducting the sea-going stea<lb break="no"/>mers. The grants for our roads and bridges I 
     <lb/>leave as at present; for although the sums gi<lb break="no"/>ven last year and this year were large 
     <lb/>and have led the people to believe that they 
     <lb/>will be continued, yet I think that the necessi<lb break="no"/>ties of some of the counties, my own for in<lb break="no"/>stance, require even more than has hitherto been 
     <lb/>given them. Would the members for Lunen<lb break="no"/>burg, or Pictou, or Queens, be content to give 
     <lb/>up their special grants in view of the benefits of 
     <lb/>Confederation? I think they would not, al<lb break="no"/>though the Provincial Secretary might, be<lb break="no"/>cause it would probably bring larger  advanta<lb break="no"/>ges to him of another kind than to almost any 
     <lb/>one else. And if  our public works are to be 
     <lb/>extended, as I should like to see them carried 
     <lb/>on, I think it is quite clear that we cannot ex<lb break="no"/>pect to be able to appropriate so large a sum 
     <lb/>for the road and bridge service in future. I 
     <lb/>have put down the legislative expenses at 
     <lb/>$20,000, instead of $48,000, which they cost last 
     <lb/>year, and the sum total of the calculation, after 
     <lb/>reducing our expenditure to the lowest possi<lb break="no"/>ble figure consistent with  the public service,</p>

                       <p>Now, I put it to gentlemen opposite-can you 
     <lb/>reduce any of these expenditures? Will they 
     <lb/>not all be required? And, as the country con<lb break="no"/>tinues to grow, will not  the wants of the coun<lb break="no"/>try grow with it? And if to this amount you 
     <lb/>add increased taxation under a Canadian tariff, 
     <lb/>say 50 per cent., which will also be ahsorbed by 
     <lb/>the Central Government, you will have some 
     <lb/>idea of the sacrifices we are called upon to 
     <lb/>make.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I  may be told that the grants  for roads and 
     <lb/>
    bridges are extravagant, but who made them 
     <lb/>so? You have raised the amount now to the 
     <lb/>enormous sum of $262,000.  If the system is

     wrong the government who have educated the 
     <lb/>
     people up to it—who have taught them that, in 
     <lb/>
     order to carry certain objects, the will receive 
     <lb/>
     such large sums are alone to blame. I con<lb break="no"/>sider, however, all the money is required for the 
     <lb/>
     roads and bridges. You will see by the figures 
     <lb/>
     I have given that the sum required for the roads 
     <lb/>
     and bridges would nearly swallow up the sub<lb break="no"/>sidy. Can you reduce the grants for educa<lb break="no"/>tion, to the hospital for the insane, for relief, 
     <lb/>
     the penitentiary, and other services? You 
     <lb/>
     know you cannot without emperilling the pub<lb break="no"/>lic service. Therefore the inevitable result is, 
     <lb/>
     as Mr. Galt has told you, in his speech, if the 
     <lb/>
     local revenues are not sufiicient, you <hi rendition="simple:italic">must re<lb break="no"/>sort to direct taxation</hi>. There is no doubt what<lb break="no"/>ever that this must be the case if this 
     <lb/>
     scheme is carried out. When I feel that the 
     <lb/>
     institutions of our country are to be swept 
     <lb/>
     away, and that the control of our resources 
     <lb/>
     is to be handed over to a people with whom 
     <lb/>
     we have no sympathy, am I not right in 
     <lb/>
     asking this House to pause? What chance 
     <lb/>
     would there be, in such an event, of our 
     <lb/>
     being able to push forward those public im<lb break="no"/>provements that are now being carried on? 
     <lb/>
     All our <hi rendition="simple:italic">surplus</hi> revenue, as I have said, will go 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa; and I ask gentlemen who look for<lb break="no"/>ward to the time when railway communication 
     <lb/>
     will extend from Pictou to Antigonishe, to 
     <lb/>
     Guysboro, aye, even through the Island of 
     <lb/>
     Cape Breton, and again westward to Annapo<lb break="no"/>lis and Digby and Yarmouth, what chance 
     <lb/>
     will there be of having their anticipations real<lb break="no"/>ized? Only those who are to be elevated from 
     <lb/>
     this country to Ottawa can be satisfied with a 
     <lb/>
     state of things so disastrous to the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia.

     Mr PRYOR introduced a bill relating to

            <p>
     The following bills were read a third time:— 
     <lb/>
     To provide for the salary of the Governor's 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Mr. MILLER said that he wished to call the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the house to a subject of conside<lb break="no"/>rable importance at the present moment; and 
     <lb/>
     he regretted that in doing so he had not the 
     <lb/>
     advantage of the presence of the members of 
     <lb/>
     government, who ought to be in their places 
     <lb/>
     attending to the business of the country. He 
     <lb/>
     need not remind the house that one of the most 
     <lb/>
     momentous questions that ever agitated the 
     <lb/>
     public mind was then under discussion—the 
     <lb/>
     question of the union of the British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rican Colonies. He thought that in view of 
     <lb/>
     the aspect that question had lately assumed- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     in view of the unmistakeable evidences of pub<lb break="no"/>lic opinion which had recently been given— 
     <lb/>
     there was but little room to doubt that nine- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     teen-tenths of the people of Nova Scotia were 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the scheme propounded by the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian delegates. He believed that it must be 
     <lb/>
     admitted on all sides that almost the only spot 
     <lb/>
     in Nova Scotia where the subject received any 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     favor, was the city of Halifax; and he was 
     <lb/>
     sorry to be obliged to say that some of the citi<lb break="no"/>zens of Halifax had acted in a manner insolent 
     <lb/>
     and overbearing to the rest of the inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     of the province. (Laughter from the members 
     <lb/>
     for Halifax.) The hon. gentlemen laugh, but 
     <lb/>
     he (Mr. M.) would tell them that this was too 
     <lb/>
     grave a matter to he laughed at. He would 
     <lb/>
     tell them in the face of the house and the coun<lb break="no"/>try that the people of Nova Scotia were not to 
     <lb/>
     be laughed at either by the citizens of Halifax 
     <lb/>
     or their representatives in that house. He 
     <lb/>
     trusted that beforethis discussion was finished 
     <lb/>
     they would be given to understand that there 
     <lb/>
     were other people in the province, whose views 
     <lb/>
     were entitled to respect, besides those who re<lb break="no"/>sided within the limits of the metropolis.— 
     <lb/>
     That morning , upon taking up the organ of the 
     <lb/>
     government he found a notice of a public de<lb break="no"/>monstration that was to take place that even<lb break="no"/>ing in honor of the Canadian delegates, who 
     <lb/>
     were expected to arrive in the steamer, on their 
     <lb/>
     way to England to advocate the scheme of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec conference. Notwithstanding. as he 
     <lb/>
     had said, that it was well known to those ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with public sentiment in this province 
     <lb/>
     t at nineteen-twentieths of the whole popula— 
     <lb/>
     tion were opposed to the scheme, he could not 
     <lb/>
     help looking on this demonstration as an at<lb break="no"/>tempt to misrepresent the state of feeling that 
     <lb/>
     existed in the minds of a great majority of our 
     <lb/>
     people—to mislead the delegates and the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of England touching our views of this great 
     <lb/>
     question, and to exasperate and insult the in<lb break="no"/>telligence of this country. Perhaps, however, 
     <lb/>
     he would not have felt it his duty to have call<lb break="no"/>ed the attention of the house to the subject but 
     <lb/>
     for a circumstance connected with the demon<lb break="no"/>stration, which was deserving of public notice. 
     <lb/>
     Be perceived a place assigned in the pro- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     gramme to the Volunteer Artillery, and the 
     <lb/>
     other volunteer companies. Now, he would 
     <lb/>
     ask, was it right or proper that the Volunteer 
     <lb/>
     force of this province, which had ever been kept 
     <lb/>
     aloof from party or political influences, should 
     <lb/>
     be asked to take part in a demonstration which 
     <lb/>
     was not only political in its character, but hos<lb break="no"/>tile to the feelings of a vast majority of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country. He had no objections 
     <lb/>
     to the citizens of Halifax as citizens indulging 
     <lb/>
     in any demonstration they pleased, provided 
     <lb/>
     it would not misrepresent the whole province, 
     <lb/>
     but he thought that gentlemen on both sides 
     <lb/>
     would agree with him that this attempt to 
     <lb/>
     draw the Volunteer organization into the mat<lb break="no"/>ter, was, to say the least of it, unwise and in— 
     <lb/>
     judicious in the extreme. It was well known 
     <lb/>
     that these gentlemen who were going across 
     <lb/>
     the water were going with no feelings of appro— 
     <lb/>
     val of the conduct of the people of the Mari— 
     <lb/>
     time Provinces. For aught that was known
