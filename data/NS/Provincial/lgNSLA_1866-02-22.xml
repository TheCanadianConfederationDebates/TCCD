 OF THE<lb/>
 HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY OF NOVA SCOTIA.<lb/>
 1866.</head>
 </div>
 
 <div type="section"> 
 <head rendition="simple:right">THURSDAY, Feb. 22.</head>
 
 <p>
 Shortly before 2 o'clock p. m. the SPEAKER 
 <lb/>
 took the chair of the house, and after a few 
 <lb/>
 minutes the Gentleman Usher of the Black 
 <lb/>
 Rod conveyed the command of His Excellency 
 <lb/>
 for the attendance of the House in the Council 
 <lb/>
 Chamber. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 The House of Assembly having attended in 
 <lb/>
 obedience to His Excellency's command, His 
 <lb/>
 Excellency opened the Session with the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing Speech:— 
 <lb/>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. President, and Honorable Gentlemen of the 
 <lb/>
 Legislative Council:</hi> 
 <lb/>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of 
 <lb/>
 
 Assembly:</hi>
 </p>

 <p>
 1. It affords me unfeigned satisfaction, in 
 <lb/>
 meeting, for the first time, the Legislature of 
 <lb/>
 this my native Province, to be able to congra<lb break="no"/>tulate you upon a condition of prosperity never 
 <lb/>
 before equalled in the history of the Colony. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 2. While we have enjoyed the blessings of 
 <lb/>
 peace and immunity from pestilence, the labors 
 <lb/>
 of the Husbandman and the Fisherman have 
 <lb/>
 been crowned with success: and the sale of 
 <lb/>
 Crown Lands, the development of our Coal and 
 <lb/>
 Gold Mines, the receipts from our Railways, 
 <lb/>
 and the Trade and Revenue of our Provmce, 
 <lb/>
 are greatly in excess of any preceding year. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 3. A soldier myself, and intimately connect<lb break="no"/>ed with the organization of the Volunteer 
 <lb/>
 movement both in Great Britain and in this 
 <lb/>
 Province, you can well understand the deep 
 <lb/>
 gratification it has afforded me to find the 
 <lb/>
 spirited manner in which my countrymen have 
 <lb/>
 responded, by the organization of a Militia 
 <lb/>
 Force so efficient, to the call to prepare for any 
 <lb/>
 emergency which may at any time demand 
 <lb/>
 stout hearts and trained arms for the defence 
 <lb/>
 of the inestimable privileges we enjoy as sub<lb break="no"/>jects of the Crown of Britain. 
 <lb/>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of 
 <lb/>
 Assembly.</hi> 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 

 <p>
 4. The Public Accounts will shortly be 
 <lb/>
 placed before you. The Estimates for the 
 <lb/>
 year will be prepared with as much regard to 
 <lb/>
 

 
 <cb/>
 
 economy as due consideration for the interests 
 <lb/>
 of the country will permit. 
 <lb/>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. President, and Honorable Gentlemen of the 
 <lb/>
 Legislative Council:</hi> 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of 
 <lb/>
 Assembly:</hi> 
 <lb/>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 5. You will learn with regret that, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the united efforts of the British North 
 <lb/>
 American Colonies, the Government of the 
 <lb/>
 United States have adhered to their determina<lb break="no"/>tion to abrogate the arrangements for Recipro<lb break="no"/>cal Trade which have for the past eleven years 
 <lb/>
 contributed so largely to the harmony and 
 <lb/>
 commercial prosperity of both the neighboring 
 <lb/>
 Republic and these Colonies; but I am san<lb break="no"/>guine that by mutual aid and co-operation 
 <lb/>
 among the Provinces, and under the fostering 
 <lb/>
 care of the Mother Country, the trade of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America may be so directed into 
 <lb/>
 new channels, and our valuable fisheries so 
 <lb/>
 protected, as to meet the emergency thus 
 <lb/>
 forced upon us and avoid any material com<lb break="no"/>mercial inconvenience. The correspondence 
 <lb/>
 upon this subject will be submitted to you. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 6. You will be gratified to be informed that 
 <lb/>
 the efforts to represent the products of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince at the Dublin Exhibition resulted very 
 <lb/>
 favorably—a large number of medals having 
 <lb/>
 been awarded to our exhibitors; and from the 
 <lb/>
 necessity which now exists to make known as 
 <lb/>
 widely as possible the great natural resources 
 <lb/>
 of these Provinces, you will, I doubt not. make 
 <lb/>
 suitable provision for the due representation 
 <lb/>
 of Nova Scotia at the great International Exhi<lb break="no"/>bition to take place in Paris in 1867. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 7. Contracts, based upon the legislation of 
 <lb/>
 last Session, have been entered into during the 
 <lb/>
 recess of Parliament for the extension of the 
 <lb/>
 Railways from Truro to the border of New 
 <lb/>
 Brunswick, and from Windsor to Annapolis. 
 <lb/>
 These documents, and the papers connected 
 <lb/>
 therewith, will be laid before you at an early 
 <lb/>day.<lb/>
 </p>

 

 <p>
 8. In accordance with instructions received 
 <lb/>
 from Her Majesty's Government, circulars 
 <lb/>
 were transmitted to the persons in charge of all 
 <lb/>
 <pb n="2" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1866-02-22_Page_002.jpg"/>
 <fw type="num">2</fw>
 <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
 
 the Prisons in the Province, making enquiries 
 <lb/>
 as to their condition. These documents, with 
 <lb/>
 the answers to the enquiries made, will be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted for your consideration; and I will be 
 <lb/>
 glad if some means should be devised for the 
 <lb/>
 due inspection of all places of imprisonment, in 
 <lb/>order to promote an improvement in the system 
 <lb/>and uniformity of discipline. 
 <lb/>
 </p>
 
 

 <p>
 9. Your attention will also be invited to the 
 <lb/>
 important question of Immigration, in the hope 
 <lb/>
 that a larger number of those seeking a new 
 <lb/>
 home may be made acquainted with the great 
 <lb/>
 advantages which are here offered to industry, 
 <lb/>
 capital, or skill. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 10. I confidently hope that, deeply impressed 
 <lb/>
 with the gratitude due to a beneficent Provi<lb break="no"/>dence for the blessings so liberally bestowed 
 <lb/>
 during the past year, your united deliberations 
 <lb/>
 will result in promoting the continued pros<lb break="no"/>perity of this highly favored land.

 <head rendition="simple:centre">ANSWER TO THE ADDRESS MOVED.</head> 
 
 

 <p>
 <persName ref="pers:HAMI1">Dr. HAMILTON</persName> said—I rise, Mr. Speaker, for 
 <lb/>
 the purpose of moving the answer to the 
 <lb/>
 speech with which his Excellency the Lieut. 
 <lb/>
 Governor was pleased to open the third session 
 <lb/>
 of the twenty-fourth Parliament of Nova
 <lb/>
 Scotia. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 Every Novascotian, and especially the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House, must feel gratified that 
 <lb/>
 Her Majesty has thought proper to select and 
 <lb/>
 appoint as her representative in this colony, 
 <lb/>one of Nova Scotia's sons, whose talents and 
 <lb/>bravery have won him so distinguished a 
 <lb/>name in the British Empire, not only as the 
 <lb/>heroic defender of Kars, but in other import<lb break="no"/>ant positions. As our Governor, we must feel 
 <lb/>confident that in the exercise of his great 
 <lb/>abilities and practical knowledge, Nova Scotia 
 <lb/>has been placed under the most favorable 
 <lb/>circumstances at this time. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 

 <p>
 It must be gratifying, too, for His Excellency 
 <lb/>
 to meet the Legislature of this his native 
 <lb/>
 Province under such favorable circumstances, 
 <lb/>
 for I believe never before, in the history of 
 <lb/>
 Nova Scotia, was every branch of productive 
 <lb/>
 industry in so healthy and flourishing a 
 <lb/>
 condition as at present. 
 <lb/>
 </p>
 <cb/>
 <p>
 The returns from the various sources of 
 <lb/>
 revenue, which have been made public, enable 
 <lb/>
 the Government to meet the House with no 
 <lb/>
 demands against the treasury, but, on the 
 <lb/>
 contrary, with a large surplus. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 If there is one thing more than another 
 <lb/>
 which should inspire confidence in a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the management of the public affairs, 
 <lb/>
 it is the fact that the productive industry and 
 <lb/>
 the various sources of wealth are steadily on 
 <lb/>
 the increase. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 A full treasury not only enables the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to meet all the existing and necessary 
 <lb/>
 appropriations, but it does more—it enables 
 <lb/>
 them to make provisions for the extension of 
 <lb/>
 the public works and other improvements 
 <lb/>
 which from time to time are required by the 
 <lb/>people. 
 <lb/>
 </p>
 
 

 <p>
 Now, I do not feel disposed, in making these 
 <lb/>
 statements and exhibiting the figures which 
 <lb/>
 will follow, to attribute all the increase in the 
 <lb/>
 trade, commerce, navigation, agricultural pro<lb break="no"/>duce, fisheries, mines and minerals, &amp;c., to the 
 <lb/>
 management of the gentlemen who compose 
 <lb/>
 the present government, but this much I may 
 <lb/>
 say, that just in so far as the people have con<lb break="no"/>fidence in the integrity, practical ability and 
 <lb/>
 good intentions ot' those gentlemen. so far do 
 <lb/>
 people feel security in entering into the 
 <lb/>
 prosecution of those various sources of industry 
 <lb/>
 and trade, which result in the enjoyment not 
 <lb/>
 only of all the luxuries of life, but in the in<lb break="no"/>crease and extension of the productive sources 
 <lb/>
 of wealth. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 I believe in every department from which re<lb break="no"/>turns are collected, the increase over previous 
 <lb/>
 years is remarkable, and as far as the produc<lb break="no"/>tive resources of our Province are concerned, 
 <lb/>
 viz., the fisheries, agriculture, mines, minerals, 
 <lb/>
 and other departments they are all equally in 
 <lb/>
 a healthy and flourishing condition. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 A few facts and comparisons might not be 
 <lb/>
 amiss, and while I do not feel disposed to make 
 <lb/>
 any invidious comparison with former govern<lb break="no"/>ments under different parties, I must be per<lb break="no"/>mitted to refer to a few figures to illustrate 
 <lb/>
 the progress which has been made and first let. 
 <lb/>
 us take the exports of Nova Scotia— 
 <lb/>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In 1860, under the management of our prede<lb break="no"/>cessors,</p>
 
<table>
<row><cell>the whole exports amounted to</cell><cell rendition="simple:right">$6,619,534</cell></row> 
<row><cell>While, in 1865, they were no less than</cell> <cell rendition="simple:right"><hi rendition="simple:underline">8,830,633</hi></cell></row> 
<row><cell>Being an increase of no less than</cell> <cell rendition="simple:right">$2,211,099</cell></row> 
 </table>
 
 <p>
 If there can be any doubt about the state of 
 <lb/>
 our country in this respect, a reference to her 
 <lb/>
 exports will prove her prosperity, and the great 
 <lb/>
 increase for the last six years shows pretty 
 <lb/>
 plainly that Nova Scotia is progressing in her 
 <lb/>
 productive capabilities most rapidly, and we 
 <lb/>
 must certainly hope it may long continue. I 
 <lb/>
 might mention that during the years 1861-62-63; 
 <lb/>
 the exports of the Province fell off no less than 
 <lb/>
 $1,242,169. so that the increase has been most 
 <lb/>
 rapid. amounting, since 1862, to no less a sum 
 <lb/>
 than $3,153,672. 
 <lb/>
 </p>

 <p>
 These very large exports and imports pro<lb break="no"/>duce a trade from which a large revenue is col<lb break="no"/>lected, and as far as the Government and the re<lb break="no"/>presentatives of the people are concerned, noth<lb break="no"/>ing is more gratifying than to have a large sur<lb break="no"/>plus revenue to return to the people in the 
 <lb/>
 shape of grants for roads and bridges, schools 
 <lb/>
 and navigation securities, and which also en [...]
