<!--<p>
     fact going to adopt the Japanese policy, who, 
     <lb/>
     for a thousand years, lived within themselves 
     <lb/>
     until civilization compelled them to open up 
     <lb/>
     their markets to the world. That is a policy I 
     <lb/>
     do not think is suited to Nova Scotia; and that 
     <lb/>
     is the reason I am so much against it.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If there is anything worth protecting in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, surely it is our shipping, and 
     <lb/>
     foreign commerce, and yet we would render 
     <lb/>
     this useless by going into Confederation. The 
     <lb/>
     very name of Nova Scotia is worth keeping— 
     <lb/>
     a country that owns one-eighth of the shipping 
     <lb/>
     of the British Empire is surely worthy of a 
     <lb/>
     name amongst the nations of the world. The 
     <lb/>
     shipping of Nova Scotia is to be found in every 
     <lb/>
     part of the world, and their sails whiten the 
     <lb/>
     seas in every portion of the globe. That im<lb break="no"/>portant interest represents in value no less 
     <lb/>
     than eight millions of dollars, and yet we are 
     <lb/>
     called to adopt a policy detrimental to so valu<lb break="no"/>able a branch of our provincial prosperity. The 
     <lb/>
     only true policy for a commercial country, is 
     <lb/>
     free and unrestricted trade. That is the policy 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain. The more trade is unfetter<lb break="no"/>ed, the more it will expand; and yet we are 
     <lb/>
     about to adopt a restrictive policy, and to shut 
     <lb/>
     ourselves out from the markets of the world. 
     <lb/>
     Canada, from her inland position, can never 
     <lb/>
     become a large manufacturing country—and 
     <lb/>
     she is a great agricultural country—she can 
     <lb/>
     supply us with all the whiskey we want, but 
     <lb/>
     we can do without that; and if we want it, the 
     <lb/>
     best way is to get it at the cheapest rate.  She 
     <lb/>
     can supply us with most of the eatables we 
     <lb/>
     want, and some of the wearing apparel, and 
     <lb/>
     can give employment to our labor; but the 
     <lb/>
     best way, in a new country, is to employ it 
     <lb/>
     within our own Province.  There is no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that the lumber trade of Canada gives employ<lb break="no"/>ment to our shipping, but they get no better 
     <lb/>
     price for it than anywhere else. They can go 
     <lb/>
     anywhere and get good prices; and as I said 
     <lb/>
     before, the carrying trade of  Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     extends over the world. I cannot see why 
     <lb/>
     Novascotians are not satisfied with the progress 
     <lb/>
     they are making- our manufacturing interest 
     <lb/>
     is advancing as rapidly as can be expected in 
     <lb/>
     a new country withouth any protection at all. 
     <lb/>
     Our public works—if the government manage 
     <lb/>
     them prudently and carefully, and do not en<lb break="no"/>ter upon them too rashly - will contribute to 
     <lb/>
     the general prosperity. In fact, every branch 
     <lb/>
     of industry is in a sound condition. Then 
     <lb/>
     why alter this state of things, and ruh blindly 
     <lb/>
     into a union with Canada?  The hon. Prov. 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, in his speech, complained of an 
     <lb/>
     article in theMorning Chronicle on the subject 
     <lb/>
     of the defence  of this country.  I cannot  say 
     <lb/>
     that the scheme there propounded  met my 
     <lb/>
     views, and I am not desirous that any English 
     <lb/>
     acts of parliament should be passed to inter<lb break="no"/>fere with our rights and liberties. What did 
     <lb/>
    the delegates propose to do? If their wishes 
     <lb/>had been carried   out, they  intended to go to 
     <lb/>England to tie up the people of these North 
     <lb/>American colonies, by an English act of par<lb break="no"/>liament, for all time to come, and to compel        
     <lb/>them to submit to the scheme.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. PROV. SEC.- No such thing was ever      
     <lb/>proposed.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. KILLAM- It is very strange if I am mis<lb break="no"/>taken. Was it not proposed that the leading<lb/>men should go to England?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. PROV. SEC.- It was proposed that the<lb/>scheme propounded by the delegates should<lb/>be first submitted to the local legislatures<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     and an address be passed asking the British 
     <lb/>
     parliament to confirm the action that had 
     <lb/>been taken.<lb/>
     
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. KILLAM—If it is not one of the articles 
     <lb/>
     of agreement it was generally understood that 
     <lb/>
     such was to be the case. It has been urged 
     <lb/>
     that the great Intercolonial Railway is going 
     <lb/>
     to make us a great country, that Halifax is go— 
     <lb/>
     ing to be the entrepôt of the whole continent. 
     <lb/>
     Now, sir, when I saw the grass growing on the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk of Canada, and reflected that for 
     <lb/>
     six months of the year there is no business 
     <lb/>
     doing upon it, I confess that I was not very 
     <lb/>
     sanguine as to the necessityof this work as a 
     <lb/>
     commercial undertaking. Nor would it be of 
     <lb/>
     any advantage in time of war—running as it 
     <lb/>
     would within ten or twelve miles of the United 
     <lb/>
     States territory, it would be easy for them to 
     <lb/>
     destroy it, and they might take Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     before we could hear of it except by way of the 
     <lb/>
     United States. It was useless then to talk 
     <lb/>
     about that being of any advantage to us either 
     <lb/>
     commercially or politically. If Canada wants 
     <lb/>
     it, let her have it—in the meantime let us go on 
     <lb/>
     'with our own public works. If the government 
     <lb/>
     can show a feasible plan to connect with the 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick border, and the state of finan— 
     <lb/>
     ces will admit of it, I shall not oppose it; al<lb break="no"/>though I should prefer that the Pictou road 
     <lb/>
     should be built first, as I think that will suf<lb break="no"/>ficiently tax our energies  and resources for 
     <lb/>
     some time to come .

      <persName ref="pers:MCFA1">MR. MCFARLANE</persName> from the Committee on Agri<lb break="no"/>culture reported. Some conversational debate took 
     <lb/>
     place on the subject of the importation of Stock. 
     <lb/>
     </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:PARK1">MR. PARKER</persName> advocated the idea of having farms 
     <lb/>in different parts of the Province, for the raising 
     <lb/>of Stock. He also spoke of the want of a suitable 
     <lb/>Market House in Halifax for the convenience of 
     <lb/>Farmers.<lb/>

     <lb/>
            </head>

            <p>  <persName ref="pers:MCDO6">Mr. MCDONNEL</persName> referred to the question of the 
     <lb/>settlement of Crown Lands in Cape Breton which 
     <lb/>had been discussed in the early part of the session, 
     <lb/>and to the statement  then made by Hon. Prov. 
     <lb/>Sec., and the hon. leader of the Opposition, to the 
     <lb/>effect  that Cape Breton  had been more highly fa<lb break="no"/>vored than other parts of the Provinces as regards 
     <lb/>the terms upon which the payment of Crown 
     <lb/>Lands  was to be made—inasmuch as long  credit 
     <lb/>was given to purchasers in that Island, and the 
     <lb/>moneys amounting from  the sale of these lands, 
     <lb/>were reserved for the opening up of roads.    
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He was rather surprised at the assertion at the 
     <lb/>time, and he was induced to look into the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and ascertain how the facts really stood.- <lb/> Upon referring to the law passed in 1859, for the<lb/>settlement of Crown Lands in Cape Breton, he<lb/>found it enacted that the money arising from the<lb/>sale of these lands, was in the discretion of the<lb/>Government to be appropriated to the opening up<lb/>of the roads in the Island of Cape Breton. In<lb/>order to follow the matter up, he asked the<lb/>leader of the Government to lay upon the table &amp;<lb/>return all of the moneys derived from this source<lb/>since the passage of the Act. From that return it<lb/>appeared that there had been paid into the Re<lb break="no"/>

ceiver General's office $9,467 from the County of <lb/>
Cape Breton, arising from the sale of Crown <lb/>
Lands, while the sum contributed by that county <lb/>
to the revenue of the Province, including amount <lb/>
of outstanding lands, amounts to
$37,164, from <lb/>
Inverness $27,138, Richmond $16,476, Victoria <lb/>
$23,606. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> And yet, would it be believed, that
altho' it is <lb/>
five or six years since the law
was put upon the<lb/>
Statute Book, there had not been a single cent of <lb/>
the money appropriated either by
this or any <lb/>
previous Government for the purpose pointed out <lb/>
in the Act. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> He had asked the Government for an
advance of <lb/>
$8,000 which was absolutely
required for the roads <lb/>
of the county he represented (lnverness) and <lb/>
altho' there had been actually paid into the Re<lb break="no"/>ceiver General's Office, from
that County since <lb/>
the passing of the Act, the sum of $10,153,
which <lb/>
after deducting therefrom the
cost of all surveys <lb/>
made in the County since the Act, leaves a bal<lb break="no"/>ance at this day of $6,049 in
the Treasury, yet <lb/>
the Government have refused to give a single cent <lb/>
for the purpose recommended in the Act.  He <lb/>
thought the House would agree with him that this <lb/>
was not right.  The Act referred
to was passed by <lb/>
this Legislature—and that for
the purpose re<lb break="no"/>ferred to.  He could not suppose that it was in— <lb/>
tended that it should remain a nullity upon the <lb/>
Statute Book, and therefore desired to have it en<lb break="no"/>forced. The hon. gentleman said he had risen <lb/>
for the purpose of contradicting the statements <lb/>
made in the early part of this Session by <lb/>
the hon. Prov. Secy. and the hon. leader of the <lb/>
Opposition now sent broadcast by the hon gentle<lb break="no"/>men over the Province, that Cape Breton enjoyed <lb/>
all moneys coming from its Crown Lands, which <lb/>
last assertion was not supported to the extent <lb/>
of one cent.  He also asked the Prov. Sec. what <lb/>
the reasons of the Government were for not car<lb break="no"/>rying out the provisions of the law, and whether <lb/>
the Govt. intended in the future, as in the past, to <lb/>
treat the law as a nullity. <lb/>
            </p>
   <p>Hon PROV. SEC. was not sorry that this
matter <lb/>
had been brought to the notice of the House.  He <lb/>
did not think that any reply was
needed from him, <lb/>
as the clause of the Act to which the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man had alluded, sufficiently answered every <lb/>
statement he had made.  <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> He (the Prov. Sec.) was afraid that the re<lb break="no"/>mark he had made in debate, in a somewhat <lb/>
jocular manner—that it was in the power of the <lb/>
members for Cape Breton—by combining together, <lb/>
to deal a fatal blow at the Government, had had <lb/>
an unhappy effect.  From the remarks that had <lb/>
fallen on the previous evening from a gentleman <lb/>
who had usually ranked himself as a supporter
of <lb/>
the Government, and from the style of observa<lb break="no"/>tions just made, he was
inclined to think that <lb/>
there was a disposition on the
part of some of the <lb/>
members for that Island to assume an attitude of <lb/>
dictation to the Government.  Now, he wished it <lb/>
to be understood at the outset, that important
as <lb/>
he considered it to be for the
Country, that the<lb/>
present Government should
continue to occupy the <lb/>
Treasury benches, and that the
Province<lb/>
should enjoy for some time to come, the advanta<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
   ges of so excellent a Government, yet he
had no <lb/>
hesitation in saying, that he would rather resign <lb/>
the position he held, and retire into the cold <lb/>
shades of opposition, than yield to unfair dictation <lb/>
from any combination of gentlemen. As regards <lb/>
the complaint of the member from Inverness, he <lb/>
had only to turn to the Estimates to prove that <lb/>
no other part of the Province had received so <lb/>
much consideration as the Island of Cape Breton, <lb/>
and at no time had the members for that section <lb/>
less cause to complain than the present. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Ever since he had the honor of a seat in
that <lb/>
House, he had done his utmost to assist the mem<lb break="no"/>bers for Cape Breton, in their attempts to obtain <lb/>
for that Island that consideration which its im<lb break="no"/>portance deserved, and now after the Government
<lb/>
had shown a disposition, which no previous Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had ever done, to deal liberally. with its <lb/>
wants, he would ask whether this was time, or the <lb/>
occasion, for any gentlemen from Cape Breton, <lb/>
least of all, for any one pretending to be a sup<lb break="no"/>porter of the Government, to assume an attitude <lb/>
of defiance and dictation. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The hon. Prov. Sec. here referred to the large <lb/>
provision made in the estimates for the various <lb/>
public services in Cape Breton,
and to the pledge <lb/>
of the Government, that they would undertake <lb/>
the construction of the wharf at
Port Hood, and <lb/>
asked whether in view of all this, it was fair for <lb/>
any member from that county, to complain of not <lb/>
having received proper
consideration at the hands <lb/>
of the Government. As regards the facts of this <lb/>
case, he would say that the hon gentleman him<lb break="no"/>self, was one of those who assisted in breaking up <lb/>
the system by which these monies were to be paid <lb/>
into the Treasury, and which had the effect of <lb/>
throwing the whole thing into confusion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCDO6">Mr. MCDONNELL</persName>—That
was done before I came <lb/>
into the House. <lb/>
            </p>
   <p> <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">HON. PROV. SEC</persName>,—was under the impression <lb/>
that he was a party to the arrangement, at all <lb/>
events the law of 1859 was altered so, as to  pro<lb break="no"/>duce great confusion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The hon. gentleman here read the act, and
said <lb/>
it was the intention of the Government, to com<lb break="no"/>ply with its spirit and letter.  They intended as <lb/>
they had already informed the members for Cape <lb/>
Breton, to obtain reports from the Crown Land <lb/>
Surveyors, as to the localities
most requiring aid, <lb/>
so as to carry out the provisions of the law in <lb/>
such a way, as would be best for
the interests of <lb/>
the whole Province, as well as for the advantage <lb/>
of the Island.  The hon gentleman concluded by <lb/>
regretting that he should be called upon to de<lb break="no"/>nounce in the terms he had done this unfair at<lb break="no"/>tempt to prejudice the government in the eyes of <lb/>
the people of Cape Breton.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOUR5">MR. BOURBINOT</persName>, as far as he was
concerned, <lb/>
denied the existence of any combination on the <lb/>
part of the members for Cape Breton, and he was <lb/>
not aware that this matter was
coming up.  He<lb/>
must do the Government the credit to say, that<lb/>
they had done more justice to
Cape Breton than <lb/>
any previous one, altho he was not, prepared to<lb/>
admit that she had ever yet
received her just <lb/>
rights.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:BLAN2">MR. BLANCHARD</persName> was pleased to hear the as<lb break="no"/>surance of the leader of the Government, that<lb/>

          these monies were to be applied for the
purposes <lb/>
contemplated in the act. He
thought that there <lb/>
was no doubt that the object of the law was to <lb/>
apply these monies to the opening up of roads <lb/>
through the Crown Lands, the discretion left with <lb/>
the Government was as to the time and manner <lb/>
in which they should be applied.
He was there<lb break="no"/>fore quite satisfied with the statements
made by <lb/>
the Prov. Sec , and he thought that what he pro<lb break="no"/>mised, was all that the members for Cape Breton <lb/>
had a right to ask. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The object of the members for Inverness
in <lb/>
making the application they did, was not to sup<lb break="no"/>plement the road grant but to
apply the money <lb/>
to open up roads through Crown Lands, which<lb/>
was the legitimate purpose
contemplated by the <lb/>
act. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> The hon. gentlemen explained the object
of <lb/>
making the alteration in the law,
alluded to by <lb/>
the hon Pro. Sec. It was held
out as an induce<lb break="no"/>ment to settlers to take up Crown Lands, that <lb/>
they would be able to pay for them by their ear<lb break="no"/>nings from the expenditure of the public monies, <lb/>
in the opening up of new roads ; but when the <lb/>
three years specified as to the
time for payment <lb/>
had rolled round, it was found that they were <lb/>
unable to pay, and the time had
to be extended. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> As regards the amount of justice that
Cape <lb/>
Breton had received in the distribution
of the public <lb/>
monies, while he was prepared to acknowledge <lb/>
that the Government had dealt as liberally with <lb/>
her as with the rest of the Provinces, he could <lb/>
not admit that she was under very great obliga<lb break="no"/>tions. According to population she had just re— <lb/>
ceived what she was entitled to, one-fifth of the <lb/>
whole grant. This however was a distinct ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and depended altogether
upon the rights <lb/>
which the law gave them, and he
was satisfied by <lb/>
the assurance, that the Government intended to <lb/>
carry out the provisions of the
statute. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <persName ref="pers:MCDO4">HON. FIN'L. SEC</persName>. said that this was not a <lb/>
question of justice to Cape
Breton, and the hon. <lb/>
Prov. Sec had done perfectly right, in rebuking <lb/>
the hon member for Inverness, 
(Mr. McD.)  for <lb/>
placing it upon that ground.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> He
thought that hon gentleman had no reason <lb/>
to complain of the way in which
Cape Breton had <lb/>
been treated, either in the distribution of the road <lb/>
grant, or in any other branch of
the public ser<lb break="no"/>vices. While some counties had their road grants <lb/>
decreased, almost every county in that Island
had <lb/>
theirs increased. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> He would go further then the hon. Pro. Sec. <lb/>
had, and say that if the Government had acceded to <lb/>
the demand of the member for
Inverness, and <lb/>
supplemented his new road grant,
as he wanted <lb/>
them to do, they would have acted contrary to <lb/>
law.  He thought that he ought to be satisfied <lb/>
with the assurance that had been given, that the <lb/>
Government intended to carry out the policy of <lb/>
the law, as soon as they had received
the neces—<lb/>
sary information from the Crown
Land Surveyor. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCDO6">MR. S MCDONNELL</persName> was glad that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment had at length announced
the policy they <lb/>
intended to pursue in this matter.
The hon. Pro.<lb/>
Sec. had thought proper to intimate, that in<lb/>
making
his remarks he was actuated by covert <lb/>
          motives. <lb/>
            </p>


<cb/>

            <p> He (Mr. McD.) did not think the course
that <lb/>
hon. gentleman had thought proper to pursue in <lb/>
reference to this matter was conducive to strength<lb break="no"/>en the relations that subsisted
between them, <lb/>
as to add to the decorum which
should prevail in <lb/>
that House.  He had stood in his
place, in the per<lb break="no"/>formance of a duty he owed his constituents, he <lb/>
had no private interests to serve, but he was sim<lb break="no"/>ply demanding the rights which the law gave<lb/>
them. He most emphatically denied that Cape
<lb/>
Breton had received more than her
just share of<lb/>
the public moneys, or that he had demanded any<lb break="no"/>thing more than the Government were bound to <lb/>
         give. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP1">MR. C  J.  CAMPBELL</persName> denied that there was <lb/>
any combination on the part of the members for <lb/>
Cape Breton. He considered it unfair for any <lb/>
one to attempt to get up a feeling against
that <lb/>
section of the Province. He pointed out the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the act of 1859, and contended that it <lb/>
had not been carried out as originally intended. <lb/>
He alluded to the Crown Lands' office, and con<lb break="no"/>sidered that more energy should be infused into <lb/>
the working of that department. He pointed out <lb/>
one or two cases within his own knowledge of the <lb/>
way the business of the peuple
was impeded in <lb/>
that office. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> The

            </head>


   <p> <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">HON. PROV. SECY</persName> then moved the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion for Railway Extension,
which he had <lb/>
laid on the table some days previously. In <lb/>
doing so, he stated that he did not intend oc<lb break="no"/>cupying the attention of the house with any
<lb/>
lengthy remarks, for the simple reason that the <lb/>
policy that this resolution propounded,
and the <lb/>
expenditure it involved, had been fully discus<lb break="no"/>sed, and had received the sanction of a large <lb/>
majority of the Legistlature. He would not <lb/>
open the useless discussion whether the pre<lb break="no"/>sent mode of construction
railroads was the<lb/>
best. Suffice it to say, that the Legislature
had <lb/>
decided, after a great deal of discussion, to <lb/>
construet Provincial Railways
by Provincial <lb/>
funds. When that policy was propounded by <lb/>
the house, it was in connection with a certain <lb/>
scheme of railway extension — that certain <lb/>
lines of communication should be carried out <lb/>
under that policy, and the act
originally placed <lb/>
on the statute book, and under which the first
<lb/>
mile of railway was put under contract,
provi<lb break="no"/>ded for the extension of our railway system to <lb/>
the borders of New Brunswick, to the Gulf of <lb/>St. Lawrence, to the
Granville Beach on<lb/>
the Bay of Fundy. The house would see that<lb/>
the object was obviously to give to all the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in the different sections of the Province, as <lb/>
fully as was possible, the advantages of rail<lb break="no"/>way communication.  The cost of railway con<lb break="no"/>struction, however, in this Province proved
to<lb/>
be worth so much more than was
anticipated<lb/>
at the time the act was placed on the statute-<lb break="yes"/>
book, that it was found impossible to go on <lb/>
with the policy as originally
laid down. At the <lb/>
last session, however, the house decided to go<lb/>
on to Pictou, and tap the Guld of St. Lawrence.<lb/>
The Government, in bringing forward the act<lb/>
for the construction of that railway, felt it was<lb/>
their duty to the outlying sections of the coun<lb break="no"/>try to lay down a policy which, without bur<lb break="no"/>thening the Provincial funds, would,
at the<lb/>
same time, give the facilities of railway com<lb break="no"/>

munication to the large, and populous,
and fer<lb break="no"/>tile counties of the west as originally contem<lb break="no"/>plated when the railway system was inaugu<lb break="no"/>rated.  He need hardly say that the house had <lb/>
been always ready to adopt any means by <lb/>
which the Province might have a
railway com<lb break="no"/>munication with the neighboring Provinces <lb/>
and States.  Accordingly, the Government <lb/>
last session brought forward a proposition <lb/>
which they thought would accomplish, without <lb/>
burthening our means, the two-fold object of <lb/>
extending our road to the borders
of New <lb/>
Brunswick and to the county of Annapolis in <lb/>
the west.  The resolution
authorized the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment to enter into contracts with compa<lb break="no"/>nies prepared to connect us with the railway <lb/>
system of New Brunswick, at a cost not to ex<lb break="no"/>ceed 4 per cent. for twenty years, on a capital <lb/>
of £10,000 a mile.  At the same time they <lb/>
offered 4 per cent. on a capital of £6,000
a <lb/>
mile for the extension to Annapolis.  The <lb/>
surveys that had been made of these lines <lb/>
had proved, they believed, that the reso<lb break="no"/>lution offered most ample
compensation to <lb/>
any companies that might undertake the <lb/>
work.  Under the authority of
that resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, the Government placed
themselves in <lb/>
communication with parties who they had <lb/>
reason to believe would be disposed to carry <lb/>
out their policy, and the result of this corres<lb break="no"/>pondence has been to show that the provision
<lb/>
offered was not quite sufficient. 
The difference <lb/>
in the terms, however, was so slight, as to war<lb break="no"/>rant the house to carry out the policy which <lb/>
received their sanction at the
last session.- <lb/>
            </p>
         

            <p>He went on to explain that the terms on <lb/>
which the offer of the
International Contract <lb/>
company was founded, involved but a slight
<lb/>
addition to the terms sanctioned last year, be<lb break="no"/>ing the cost of dredging the river Avon, which <lb/>
was estimated at £40,000, and the provision of <lb/>
£100,000 of subscription for the
line to New <lb/>
Brunswick.  He believed that the affirmation <lb/>
of the resolution would entirely do away with <lb/>
the objections of the city of
Halifax to taking <lb/>
the stock to this extent, but assuming that this <lb/>
sum had to be borrowed, it would only be an <lb/>
increase of two per cent., the offer
of last year <lb/>
being to the extent of four per
cent.  As to the <lb/>
route of the railway nothing could be now de<lb break="no"/>finitely said, and that matter would have to be <lb/>
decided by the government upon a careful ex<lb break="no"/>amination.  He said that the
debt of Nova <lb/>
Scotia was fixed by the delegates who repre<lb break="no"/>sented the government at the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence at eight millions in
consideration of the <lb/>
resolution of last year in
connection with rail<lb break="no"/>ways.  That increase to eight
millions would <lb/>
have given the means to complete the Pictou <lb/>
and Western line, leaving the Intercolonial <lb/>
road te be dealt with by the government, but <lb/>
assuming that the colonies were to remain as <lb/>
at present the burthen entailed for the exten<lb break="no"/>sion would not be more than
£28,000 for the <lb/>
trunk line, and £23,000 for
the western line, in<lb break="no"/>cluding the cost of bridging the
Avon, or about <lb/>
£50,000 per annum.  He thought
there could <lb/>
be no doubt that the proposed extension would<lb/>
give us such an increase of trade and revenue<lb/>
as would compensate for the expenditure
in<lb break="no"/>volved.  He expressed surprise at the opinion
<lb/>
enunciated on a former day to the
effect that <lb/>
railway construction should be
undertaken
by <lb/>
the government, by Mr. Killam,
who had long <lb/>
been laboriously maintaining the doctrine that <lb/>
such
construction
should be left to foreign capi<lb break="no"/>
       
            <cb/>
         

 talists and companies.  He was glad to find
<lb/>
that that gentleman's confidence in the govern<lb break="no"/>ment was so extended.  He thought, however, <lb/>
under existing circumstances, it was not advis<lb break="no"/>able to prevent these capitalists who were de<lb break="no"/>sirous of constructing our railways coming <lb/>
in and expending their capital.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. KILLAM</persName> said that it had always been <lb/>
his desire whenever the question
of railway <lb/>
extension was before the Legislature
to ex<lb break="no"/>press such opinions as he thought favorable to <lb/>
the prosperity of the Province.  When the con<lb break="no"/>struction was commenced he thought it wise <lb/>
that the matter should be left to companies, but <lb/>
the other policy having been adopted he <lb/>
thought it would be well for the government to <lb/>
continue it in respect to the main Trunk line. <lb/>
It was estimated that the existing line would <lb/>
pay one per cent. above its working expenses, <lb/>
and there was every reason for supposing that <lb/>
the extended line would be still more profita<lb break="no"/>ble, while difficulties would be caused by hav<lb break="no"/>ing the railway under two distinct manage<lb break="no"/>ments.  If the lines were expected to pay four <lb/>
per cent. which the Province had offered would <lb/>
it not be well for the government to undertake <lb/>
their construction and realize whatever profit <lb/>
was to be made?  He feared that by accepting <lb/>
the proposal the province would at the same <lb/>
time lose all the advantages that would arise <lb/>
from the increased prosperity of the country. <lb/>
            </p>
   <p> <persName ref="pers:HENR1">Hon. ATTORNEY GEN</persName>. explained that the
go<lb break="no"/>vernment were to have the power at any time <lb/>
to take possession of the railway by arbitra<lb break="no"/>tion in the usual form. If we were to hand <lb/>
over the lines without giving
any control to <lb/>
the government or legislature, then there might <lb/>
be something in the argument of the hon. <lb/>
member for Yarmouth.  He believed that the <lb/>
time had arrived when we should deal with <lb/>
this question.  New Brunswick was prepared <lb/>
to build to our borders, and there was this gap <lb/>
between Truro and Moncton which should be <lb/>
built at once.  Connection with
the railway <lb/>
system of this continent was, as all would ad<lb break="no"/>mit, most desirable, as it would promote the
<lb/>
best interests of this province.  If the govern<lb break="no"/>ment could build the line directly out of the <lb/>
provincial funds, it would be a
matter deserv<lb break="no"/>ing of serious consideration,
but under existing <lb/>
circumstances he was of opinion that it was <lb/>
the wisest policy for us to accept the best terms <lb/>
that were offered us by companies who were <lb/>
ready to invest their capital in the country.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName>
alluded to the great im<lb break="no"/>portance of the subject under consideration,
<lb/>
and then went on to say that when the matter <lb/>
was before the house last year, he had the mis<lb break="no"/>fortune to be absent, and therefore had had no <lb/>
opportunity of offering any
remarks upon it.—— <lb/>
Under these circumstances, he had listened to
<lb/>
the observations of the Pro. Sec. that day
<lb/>
with no little anxiety, for he was desirous of <lb/>
knowing upon what grounds he asked the house <lb/>
to consent to the very grave proposition which <lb/>
was contained in the resolution now before it. <lb/>
That hon. gentleman should have
shown how <lb/>
the railways were to be constructed
without <lb/>
crippling the resources of the country.   He felt <lb/>
exceedingly disappointed that the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man had not adopted the course which he <lb/>
should have taken as a Colonial
minister, ask<lb break="no"/>ing the house to incur such heavy liabilities.— <lb/>
Now there was no one in the house who had <lb/>
been a greater advocate of railways than him<lb break="no"/>self—or was more committed to their extension <lb/>
            

            <pb n="277" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1865-04-18_Page_277.jpg"/>
           <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES.</fw> <fw type="num">277</fw>
            
          
 within the limits of the Province. On some <lb/>
occasions he had even gone ahead of the Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration for the time being.
In 1857 a re<lb break="no"/>solution was moved in the house for the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Pictou Railway. On that oc<lb break="no"/>casion he had warmly advocated that scheme, <lb/>
being then as now in opposition. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the day, acting under the belief of <lb/>
what they considered most
judicious under ex<lb break="no"/>isting circumstances, refused to accept the re<lb break="no"/>solution; and, after the calm consideration <lb/>
which a few years had enabled him to give to <lb/>
the subject, he had no hesitation in acknowled<lb break="no"/>ging that he thought they discharged their duty <lb/>
to the country on that occasion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> When last year an attempt to repeal the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway act was made
by the go<lb break="no"/>vernment he had not hesitated to express in <lb/>
the most emphatic terms his
views in favor of<lb/>
communication between the
Provinces, and his <lb/>
preference of that great scheme to even the <lb/>
Pictou railway which was at the last session <lb/>
under discussion. He would refer to his lan<lb break="no"/>guage on that occasion to show how warm <lb/>
he had expressed himself on the subject. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> " It appears," he had then said,
"according <lb/>
to the opinions of the present
government of <lb/>
this province that the terms
agreed to were too <lb/>
burdensome for Nova Scotia. 
The
Canadian <lb/>
ministry have also taken the ground that the <lb/>
burthen imposed upon them is too great. With <lb/>
these opinions prevailing at the Nova Scotia <lb/>
end and at the Canadian end, it
is obvious that <lb/>
even if the act remained in force, the prospect <lb/>
of an intercolonial line is
adjourned to an in<lb break="no"/>definite period in the future. Therefore I feel <lb/>
that we can approach the subject
of a Pictou <lb/>
railway in a very different spirit
from what <lb/>
we could have done if there
were any hopes <lb/>
from the legislature in reference to the interco<lb break="no"/>lonial scheme. I have no hesitation in saying <lb/>
that in dealing with this
important question I<lb/>
would not be doing justice to myself if I did <lb/>
unequivocally state what policy I would pur<lb break="no"/>sue if the intercolonial project were feasible. <lb/>
I <hi rendition="simple:italic">consider the branch to Pictou is of sectional in<lb break="no"/>terest</hi> compared with the former scheme. It <lb/>
would be a priceless boon to Nova Scotia, jut<lb break="no"/>ting out as she does 500 miles
on the path to <lb/>
Europe, if we could have
consummated an un<lb break="no"/>dertaking which must. have made her the <lb/>
wharf on which the traflic of two continents <lb/>
would concentrate." </p>
            <p> And
again, "I must fully confess in conclu<lb break="no"/>sion that it has been with <hi rendition="simple:italic">no little hesitation that <lb/>
I have given up so desirable a project as the Inter- <lb break="yes"/>
colonial railway scheme</hi>.  I have always looked
<lb/>
at it as the precursor of <hi rendition="simple:italic">that union</hi>
which has <lb/>
so long been the hope of every intelligent man <lb/>
who wishes to see the arena of
politics in this <lb/>
province enlarged and ennobled.. I fear
very <lb/>
much that the actions of the government
on the <lb/>
present occasion has done very much to post<lb break="no"/>pone the great intercolonial question. I fear <lb/>
we are giving away the chances of ever effect<lb break="no"/>ing that great work, but on the gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite rests the entire responsibility."</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>It would be seen,
therefore, that while he <lb/>
did not hesitate to express the most unqualified <lb/>
preference for the construction
of the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Road, he had not attempted to dis<lb break="no"/>guise from himself or the house that
the neces<lb break="no"/>sary effect of embarking in that scheme was in <lb/>
his opinion to postpone to an indefinite
period <lb/>
the construction of the Intercolonial Railway <lb/>
on any
scheme which was then open to us,
or <lb/>
could be opened to our unassisted
resources. </p>

<cb/>
 
            <p> But not only was he interested in this
rail<lb break="no"/>way as a public man, and from Provincial con<lb break="no"/>siderations, but he was a representative of a <lb/>
county through which that road
must pass.—<lb/>
Again, he was interested in a valuable mineral <lb/>
property in that county, which would be exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly benefited by the completion of this en<lb break="no"/>terprize, provided the route selected should be <lb/>
the one indicated in the proposals of the com<lb break="no"/>pany and on the table of the house.  Therefore <lb/>
it would be seen that not only his interests as a <lb/>
public man and as a representative of the <lb/>
county, but also his personal and private inte<lb break="no"/>rests were at stake in this
matter.  Therefore, <lb/>
if he did not give his assent to
the present reso<lb break="no"/>lution, it could not be said that he was acting <lb/>
from personal or selfish motives.  He thought, <lb/>
too, he could appeal to the
house to bear their <lb/>
testimony, that during this and last session he <lb/>
had not exhibited any spirit towards
the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment that would subject him
to the impu<lb break="no"/>tation of factious opposition to any measure, <lb/>
but had a right to be considered as acting from <lb/>
a desire to discharge what he believed to be <lb/>
his duty to the people of this country. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> He regretted that he had not all the
docu<lb break="no"/>ments at hand which would enable him to <lb/>
give that full information in respect to the <lb/>
state of our finances which he was desirous of <lb/>
giving.  At the last session of the house a re<lb break="no"/>solution was adopted, by which it was deter<lb break="no"/>mined that the financial year should end on
<lb/>
the 30th September instead of on the 31st Decr., <lb/>
so it was impossible to get the means of compa<lb break="no"/>rison between 1864 and 1865.  A large portion <lb/>
of the liabilities which were chargable on the <lb/>
year did not fall due till its end.  He had, at <lb/>
an early period of the session, asked for the re<lb break="no"/>quisite information; but the Financial
Secreta<lb break="no"/>ry had not yet been able to hand him the docu<lb break="no"/>ments which were necessary to
make the ac<lb break="no"/>curate comparison he wished; no
doubt, in the <lb/>
hurry of the session it was difficult
for the offi<lb break="no"/>cials to give all the information desirable.-<lb/>
However, looking at the accounts as laid on <lb/>
the table, he found that on the 30th September, <lb/>
1864, the balance in the hands
of the Receiver-<lb break="yes"/>
General was $225,156 - a large amount, no one <lb/>
will deny, to be in the treasury.  The posses<lb break="no"/>sion of this balance was nothing, if at the
time <lb/>
it was in the treasury we owed
the amount, or <lb/>
a larger amount than these monies would ena<lb break="no"/>ble us to pay.</p>
            <p>Now it appeared by the statement submit<lb break="no"/>ted that at the very
time when this sum ap<lb break="no"/>peared to our credit we owed $276,000 for va<lb break="no"/>rious services, so with this sum
to pay, and <lb/>
only $225,156 on hand to pay it with, we could <lb/>
not be considered as having necessarily
a large <lb/>
amount at our disposal.  We had, it was true, <lb/>
in the shape of assets coming 
in, a considera<lb break="no"/>ble additional
sum, but as far as he could ga<lb break="no"/>ther from the accounts there appeared to have
<lb/>
been borrowed from the Savings Bank $42,000, <lb/>
and from Treasury notes $40,000,  making<lb/>
$82,000, which had gone to swell
the receipts, <lb/>
and which, though actually borrowed money, <lb/>
had been treated by the
Government as so<lb/>
much revenue,  and added to the balance at <lb/>
their disposal. <lb/>
            </p>



            <p> He had been desirous or ascertaining our fi<lb break="no"/>ancial condition on the 31st Dec. last and <lb/>
therefore had asked for the amount of the re<lb break="no"/>venue till that date.  He
anticipated that there <lb/>
must be a
falling off.  It was impossible
to con<lb break="no"/>template the condition of things
in the United

               States at this moment, and the effect that this 
               <lb/>
               would necessarily have on our commerce- 
               <lb/>
               it was impossible to view the panic which 
               <lb/>
               was beginning to show itself in every branch 
               <lb/>
               of business, and the necessarily diminished im<lb break="no"/>portations of the incoming year, not to feel 
               <lb/>
               that this would begin to show itself in the last 
               <lb/>
               quarter of the year, and he had asked to see 
               <lb/>
               the returns in the conviction that his anticipa<lb break="no"/>tions will be realized. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               By the returns the revenue of the year from 
               <lb/>
               customs and excise amounted to $999,000.  The 
               <lb/>
               revenue of the December quarter was $306,491. 
               <lb/>
               For the June quarter of 1862 it was $300,000. 
               <lb/>
               So that in the last quarter of the year the in<lb break="no"/>crease over the corresponding quarter of the 
               <lb/>
               year before was only $3000.  Compare that 
               <lb/>
               with the 9 months preceding.  The revenue of 
               <lb/>
               that part of 1863 was $564,938, for 1864 it was 
               <lb/>
               $692,818.  So that the increase in the past nine 
               <lb/>
               months of 1864 was $127,360, or at the rate of 23 
               <lb/>
               per cent., while the increase of the last quarter 
               <lb/>
               was only $3000, or 2 per cent.  It was quite 
               <lb/>
               clear, therefore, that the prosperity of the early 
               <lb/>
               part of the year had not been kept up.  That a 
               <lb/>
               sudden and serious change had taken place, 
               <lb/>
               which was an omen of the condition of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent year, and might be largely relied on as in<lb break="no"/>dicating what we might expect, and the pros<lb break="no"/>perity of the first nine months continued to 
               <lb/>
               the end of the year in the same proportion, 
               <lb/>
               we should have had an addition to the 
               <lb/>
               revenue of the quarter over what we actu<lb break="no"/>ally received, of $63,000.—Now in 1863 we 
               <lb/>
               contributed one third of our entire revenue 
               <lb/>
               in the last quarter of the year.—This is 
               <lb/>
               pretty much the fact every year, and there<lb break="no"/>fore assuming that the trade of the whole 
               <lb/>
               year were to fall off at the same rate, we 
               <lb/>
               should have less by $109,000 than if our prospe<lb break="no"/>rity had continued uniformly as it begun in 
               <lb/>1863. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               This is a very serious statement of matters, 
               <lb/>
               and well claims our attention.  I have asked 
               <lb/>
               for the returns of the first quarter of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent year, with a view to continue the compari<lb break="no"/>son.  I have not yet received them, nor does it 
               <lb/>
               much matter.  The importations of the first 
               <lb/>
               quarter of any year are largely the result of ac<lb break="no"/>cident.—They might be more or less in any par<lb break="no"/>ticular year without largely affecting the re<lb break="no"/>turns of the year, inasmuch as they form al<lb break="no"/>together but a small part of our importations. 
               <lb/>
               The main business of the year is conducted in 
               <lb/>
               the Spring and Fall quarters. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Now what are the last terms referred to?  I 
               <lb/>
               have spoken of the panic in the United States 
               <lb/>
               —that panic will be felt here.  It will lead to 
               <lb/>
               the interruption of our trade with the States. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p>
               Then there is a great depression in prices im<lb break="no"/>pending.  The opening of the cotton ports of the 
               <lb/>
U. States will bring down the prices of cotton 
               <lb/>
               fabrics and diminish immensely the price of 
               <lb/>
               cotton goods imported to this market.  This 
               <lb/>
               will react on the price of woolen goods, and 
               <lb/>
               between the two your <hi rendition="simple:italic">advalorem</hi> duties will 
               <lb/>
               fall.  Then agricultural produce is going down 
               <lb/>
               in price.  A friend of mine bought, the other 
               <lb/>
               day, for the Cape Breton market a ton of but<lb break="no"/>ter for 12 1/2 cents a lb.  This came from the U. 
               <lb/>
               States, where not long ago we were sending 
               <lb/>
               our butter and getting three times the price for 
               <lb/>
               it.  Other articles of produce will fall, if not 
               <lb/>
               to the same extent.  The immense market 
               <lb/>
               made by the fleet of blockade runners sailing 
               <lb/>
               from Halifax is at an end. <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
<cb/>
            
         
            
            <p>
               The ability to buy, which the farmer derives 
               <lb/>
               from a large and ready market for his goods, 
               <lb/>
               has passed away, and our merchants will anti<lb break="no"/>cipate the change, and regulate their importa<lb break="no"/>tions accordingly.  Then shipping and ship<lb break="no"/>building are both declining; freights are low, 
               <lb/>
               and the inducements to build are not great this 
               <lb/>
               year. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p>
               Contemporaneously with all this, the market 
               <lb/>
               was largely supplied with goods not intended 
               <lb/>
               for it.  The cargoes shipped from England to 
               <lb/>
               the Southern States, and which recent events 
               <lb/>
               had prevented from going there, were thrown 
               <lb/>
               suddenly upon this market, and had to be sold 
               <lb/>
               for whatever they would fetch.  They of course 
               <lb/>
               would be entered low, and thus would afifect 
               <lb/>
               the advalorem duties, and diminish the usual 
               <lb/>
               importations.  Now, could any person of ordi<lb break="no"/>nary foresight shut his eyes to this concurrence 
               <lb/>
               of events.  Was it possible to anticipate that 
               <lb/>
               the revenue could be maintained; and if it fell, 
               <lb/>
               in what condition would we be found?  Sup<lb break="no"/>pose we were to enter on this year as we did 
               <lb/>
               the year which followed 1854, would we be far 
               <lb/>
               astray?  1854 was a year of plethoric revenue; 
               <lb/>
               but it was followed by several successive 
               <lb/>
               years of declining trade and falling income. 
               <lb/>
               It would not be unreasonable to expect that 
               <lb/>
               the receipts from customs and excise in 1865 
               <lb/>
               would not much exceed $800,000.  The revenue 
               <lb/>
               after 1854 did not for many years reach the 
               <lb/>
               figures of that year.  Whether we collected 
               <lb/>
               more than that in the ensuing year or not, he 
               <lb/>
               was quite sure that we would not be justified 
               <lb/>
               in making our calculations on a larger scale 
               <lb/>
               for several years to come; and if that was 
               <lb/>
               true, we should be unable to meet the appro<lb break="no"/>priations we have made this year by an enor<lb break="no"/>mous sum.  But these appropriations, large as 
               <lb/>
               they were, made no provisions for our new lia<lb break="no"/>bilities.  Now, let us see what these are: First, 
               <lb/>
               there is the Pictou railway.  This was estimated 
               <lb/>
               at first to cost us $1,600,000.  It was supposed 
               <lb/>
               to be forty miles, at £10,000.  The government 
               <lb/>
               pass the bill before the road is created.  It is 
               <lb/>
               then measured; and forthwith ten miles or one- 
               <lb break="yes"/>
               fourth of the whole is added to the length and 
               <lb/>
               cost.  Then Mr. Fleming surveys the ground 
               <lb/>
               more accurately, and finds it will cost 2 1/2 mil<lb break="no"/>lion of dollars to build it, and somewhat more 
               <lb/>
               to build and equip it.  He is told, however, 
               <lb/>
               that he must reduce his figures, and he does so, 
               <lb/>
               and now tells us we may have a road for two 
               <lb/>
               millions.  Anybody, however, who knew how 
               <lb/>
               immensely expenditures exceed estimates, 
               <lb/>
               must be satisfied that if we get off for two and 
               <lb/>
               a half million of dollars we should be fortunate 
               <lb/>
               indeed.  Now, as the contracts are to be com<lb break="no"/>pleted in 1866, we are fully assured that one<lb/>
half the work will be done, and one half the 
               <lb/>
               cost incurred in 1865.  If so, we shall need to 
               <lb/>
               sell debentures to supply what means we 
               <lb/>
               require. Already we have had them in the 
               <lb/>
               market for several months, and we have sold 
               <lb/>
               £21,800 stg. or $109,000.  Suppose we have to 
               <lb/>
               make up the amount we shall require for the 
               <lb/>
               year 1865, we shall need still to sell over 
               <lb/>
               $1,000,000 in debentures during the present 
               <lb/>
               year.  How is this to be done? Our debentures 
               <lb/>
               are now selling at 92 to 95 per cent.  At par 
               <lb/>
               they are worth, with the interest to date, £101 
               <lb/>
               10s.  So that on every debenture we sell, we 
               <lb/>
               lose from £9 10s, to £6 10s.  Take the medium 
               <lb/>
               and there is a loss of 8 per cent., which, on 
               <lb/>
               $1,000,000 alone, would be a loss of $80,000, 
               <lb/>
               and would add that sum to the cost of the

 railway. Can anybody hope, in the uncer<lb break="no"/>tainties of the future, that we can
sell at par <lb/>
what we require this year? <lb/>
            </p>


            <p>But not only are our sales affected by
the<lb/>
uncertainties
of the future; they must be large<lb break="no"/>ly affected by the certainties of the liabilities <lb/>
we are heaping on ourselves. We
have be<lb break="no"/>fore us a Bill to construct the St. Peter's Ca<lb break="no"/>nal. This is variously estimated. Mr. Perley, <lb/>
who is the best Engineer out of the half-a-do<lb break="no"/>zen who have reported on it, put the cost at <lb/>
$170,000. We have appropriated, this year, <lb/>
bonds at $30,000, which will leave a sum of <lb/>
$140,000 to be provided for-assuming you <lb/>
could place any reliance on the estimate for a <lb/>
Canal. But as a rule, nothing can be more <lb/>
fallacious than such an estimate. A Railway
<lb/>
may be estimated. Any work on
the surface <lb/>
of the ground may be computed, but there is <lb/>
something in the nature of canal
operations <lb/>
which renders such computations unreliable. <lb/>
The Shubenacadie Canal was estimated
at <lb/>
$250,000. It cost $500,000, and was then scarce<lb break="no"/>ly begun. It was subsequently made a pre<lb break="no"/>sent of to gentlemen who were deluded with <lb/>
the idea that it could be finished for $40,000—by
<lb/>
the amount of estimate by a competent Engi<lb break="no"/>neer. They  accepted the fatal gift,
and spent <lb/>
$200,000 to find the work still
incomplete, and <lb/>
with all this money spent on it, it would be <lb/>
difficult to find any other body
of gentlemen <lb/>
who would be willing to accept the thing as a <lb/>
gift. </p>
            <p>The
Welland Canal was begun by a sub<lb break="no"/>scription of stock to the extent of $150,000.
<lb/>
Before it ended the enormous sum of $6,629,000
<lb/>
was spent in its construction.  I do not contend <lb/>
that the cases are paralel ; there were circum<lb break="no"/>stances in each case to render
the works much <lb/>
more formidable that anything that is com<lb break="no"/>pleted at St. Peter's ; but I refer to these in<lb break="no"/>stances, to shew the whole unreliability of <lb/>
canal estimates ; and I undertake to tell the <lb/>
house that nobody need expect to come out of <lb/>
this scheme under $200,000. But
the govern<lb break="no"/>ment are determined to commit the house
to <lb/>
it ; and if so, we may as well look the expense <lb/>
steadily in the face, and
prepare for it.  Let <lb/>
us then assume we have to raise the amount, <lb/>
how can it be done?  By debentures alone ; <lb/>
and this will throw into the
market well on to <lb/>
$200,000 more of debentures. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Next we find an additional liability to be as<lb break="no"/>sumed for Mabou or Port Hood wharf.  What <lb/>
this may be we, on this side of
the house, <lb/>
have as yet no means of
knowing.  Indeed but <lb/>
for the sudden revelation which
flashed upon <lb/>
us the other day, when one of the
hon. and <lb/>
learned members for Inverness
complained <lb/>
that it was not in the estimate,
and express<lb break="no"/>ed his fear that the promise privately made <lb/>
would not be redeemed, we should have
been <lb/>
ignorant, that any such expenditure was in<lb break="no"/>tended.  But now that the hon. gentleman
has <lb/>
had the private promise, publicly acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged, we may prepare for
another expendi<lb/>
ture in that quarter.  That it will be of no <lb/>
trifling magnitude, is clear ; but with
the ob<lb break="no"/>scurity that surrounds it, we cannot under<lb break="no"/>take to say what is its extent or
merit.</p>
      
            <p>Next
in order comes the scheme for
aid to <lb/>
the railway to the borders af New Brunswick. <lb/>
The proposition is that we shall
give 4 per cent. <lb/>
or
£10,000 a mile for twenty
years. This is <lb/>
equivalent to an annuity for 20 years of $120,<lb break="no"/>000; and the proposition as made to us-the
            
<cb/>   
        

    proposition as this house, if it passes
this <lb/>
resolution assents to it, is that either party is <lb/>
to have the option of capitalizing
this annuity ; <lb/>
and that, too, taking both propositions together,
<lb/>
not on the terms of paying in debentures what <lb/>
the annuity is worth, but paying a principal
<lb/>
sum which shall yield an interest equal to the <lb/>
amount of the annuity ; leaving it
to the com<lb break="no"/>pany to be formed, to pay off the principal sum <lb/>
out of a sinking fund to be instituted by them <lb/>
for that purpose.  It is quite true that the go<lb break="no"/>vernment declared they do not intend to allow <lb/>
the capitalization to be made on that footing ; <lb/>
it is quite true that they have said they will <lb/>
not even give the contractors
the option of ca<lb break="no"/>pitalizing at all ; and further, that they will <lb/>
not capitalize under par value ; but when they <lb/>
make these statements, they are not accepting <lb/>
the proposition ; and yet,
while they do not ac<lb break="no"/>cept it and declare they will not accept it, they ask <lb/>
us to pass a resolution to empower them to do <lb/>
that which they say they have no intention to do. <lb/>
But whether they capitalize, or not, they are <lb/>
to take stock to the extent of $400,000, 
for <lb/>
which they must issue debentures, and these <lb/>
debentures must be put in the market.  If <lb/>
they are sold, of course they will affect the <lb/>
saleable value of the debentures for the Pic<lb break="no"/>tou road ; and whether they are sold or not, <lb/>
the very fact that this amount of debentures <lb/>
is to be thrown into the market—or
is liable to <lb/>
be thrown into it-will reduce the value of the <lb/>
other bonds.  If this proposition
stood alone, <lb/>
it would be difficult to bear the burden of it ; <lb/>
but when it is accompanied by another propo<lb break="no"/>sition, equally burdensome, it is impossible
to <lb/>
contemplate the position without
fear and ap<lb break="no"/>prehension.  Indeed, it would seem that
the<lb/>
twin scheme is looked upon with even
more <lb/>
favor than the New Brunswick proposition. <lb/>
On the 23rd November, Mr. Levesey's propo<lb break="no"/>sition was before the government. 
It had been <lb/>
before them for weeks ; yet the government do <lb/>
nothing.  Connexion with New Brunswick and <lb/>
the United States may be secured by accepting <lb/>
the offer ; but it is not accepted,-and from <lb/>
that day to this no sign is made, no council is <lb/>
held, no minute passed either
accepting or <lb/>
rejecting the proposition.  It is quite other<lb break="no"/>wise with the Annapolis scheme. 
A constitu<lb break="no"/>ency is vacant—a member has to
be secured- <lb/>
and forthwith a council is convened,
and a<lb/>
minute passed, and the government
pledged- <lb/>
and the house controlled, so far as that pledge <lb/>
controls them-to build the
Annapolis road. </p>

            <p>
New let us see what this involves-4 per <lb/>
cent on £6000 a mile, or 80 miles, is equal to <lb/>
$76,800 a year, and there is the same option as <lb/>
to capitalization.  And as in
the North so in <lb/>
the West an aditional liability is to be in<lb break="no"/>curred.  The Avon is to be bridged, and the <lb/>
Government are to bear the cost.  This we <lb/>
have no estimate for, but the Provincial Se<lb break="no"/>cretary put it at $160,000.  I don't pretend to <lb/>
be an Engineer, but judging
from the width of <lb/>
the river, the character of its approaches, the <lb/>
nature of the foundation, nobody need be <lb/>
astonished if it should cost much beyond $200,<lb break="no"/>000.  And for this sum
debentures must issue,<lb/>
and
these again will act upon the debentures<lb/>
for Pictou and affect
their value in the mar<lb break="no"/>ket, and increase the cost of the Pictou Road. <lb/>
Now
let me group all this together: </p>

            <p> So that for these liabilities, when
completed, <lb/>
we shall have to provide a Revenue of nearly <lb/>
$400,000 a year.  But this is not
all.  We bor<lb break="no"/>row money, which we ought not to have bor<lb break="no"/>rowed, to erect a building in
Halifax which <lb/>
is to cost us £30,000.  We borrow, to be sure, <lb/>
from the Savings' Bank, and to pay only 4 <lb/>
per cent, but this will entail some $5,000
addi<lb break="no"/>tional for interest.  So that if
this added to the <lb/>
other sums, we may fairly put our whole bur<lb break="no"/>then at $400,000 a year, and
this to be paid all <lb/>
by new taxation.  True, the Prov. Sec'y says <lb/>
that we may count an additional revenue from <lb/>
the Railroads as reducing the charge.  But we <lb/>
are already counting $50,000. 
The Finl. Sec'y <lb/>
has taken credit for that amount this year. <lb/>
In 1863, the whole yield was $22,000
or there<lb break="no"/>abouts.  In 1864, very little more, and it is be<lb break="no"/>yond reasonable probability that will yield <lb/>
$50,000 in 1865.  But if, when
the roads are <lb/>
completed, there is a larger yield, it will arise <lb/>
from a larger traffic, and just
in proportion
to <lb/>
the traffic will be the wear and tear, and the <lb/>
time is at hand when necessarily
the perma<lb break="no"/>nent way will require to be renewed, and all <lb/>
that we can obtain, and more, will
be required <lb/>
for that service when it has to be done. </p>
            <p> Now, Mr.
Speaker, I believe I have not over<lb break="no"/>drawn the picture. 
It is not very wise to <lb/>
present the state of our public
finances in a <lb/>
gloomy aspect.  I have great faith in the char<lb break="no"/>acter of our resources; I think that with fair <lb/>
play, we can cope with a large burden; I be<lb break="no"/>lieve, too, that if depression come, we may <lb/>
feel it severely for a while, but
in time we <lb/>
shall rally again. But if the prospects of the <lb/>
incoming year are such as I have
described <lb/>
them—if we have no reason to hope that
our <lb/>
revenue will meet the amount already voted <lb/>
away, and if the necessity of preserving the <lb/>
public faith intact is a 
paramount consi<lb break="no"/>deration—if we are committed to
the, Pictou<lb/>
contracts, and must find the means to
pay at <lb/>
whatever cost,—I have seriously
to ask this <lb/>
House whether they ought not to
pause before <lb/>
committing the country to those
enormous ad<lb break="no"/>ditional responsibilities.  Three
years ago the <lb/>
country was disturbed from one
end to the <lb/>
other, lest taxes should be
imposed to meet a <lb/>
temporary deficiency, the interest of which <lb/>
would only be about $8,000 a year.  And yet<lb/>
the gentlemen who raised that cry, and who <lb/>
made the people believe it, are not only enor<lb break="no"/>mously increasing the ordinary
expenditure,<lb/>
but adding a debt which must be provided
<lb/>
by new taxes, to the incredible amount
of <lb/>
nearly $400,000 a year.  He
asked the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to give themselves a year to
breathe,<lb/>
and see what the prospects were.  In all
pro<lb break="no"/>bability nothing could be done for one
year, <lb/>
even if they passed the resolution.  New
<lb/>
Brunswick was hardly in a condition to
incur<lb/>
additional liability, and if it were, he
had rea<lb break="no"/>son to believe that the favorite project
there <lb/>
would be western extension.  The people<lb/>
of that Province were deeply interested <lb/>
in connecting their railway system with that<lb/>
of the United States, and were not
perhaps so 

            <cb/>
          
 anxious to
extend that connection east of
their<lb/>
own metropolis.  At all events there was good<lb/>
authority for believing that a
gentleman exer<lb break="no"/>cising much influence in the present
Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of New Brunswick, without whose
aid it <lb/>
could hardly exist, stood pledged to support <lb/>
no Government work.  If this was so, New<lb/>
Brunswick, clearly, could do nothing more,<lb/>
and any hopes of connection between her rail <lb/>
road and our border might be
given up for <lb/>
the present.  If then to press
this resolution <lb/>
could do no good, if the only effect of
pressing <lb/>
it would be to do mischief by operating upon <lb/>
our Pictou loan, and depressing
it, he ask-<lb/>
asked the government whether as
men of or<lb break="no"/>dinary prudence, it was not their duty to ac<lb break="no"/>cept the suggestions that were offered from <lb/>
this side of the house, and not needlessly im<lb break="no"/>peril the public credit or embarrass our fi<lb break="no"/>nances?</p>
            <p> He felt that as a member of the
opposition he <lb/>
had no particular responsibility in this
matter.<lb/>
It was the duty of the government to be satis<lb break="no"/>fied of its ability to cope with the enterprises it <lb/>
originated; but, as a public man,
owing a pub<lb break="no"/>lic duty to his constituents and the province, <lb/>
he had raised his warning voice, and felt that, <lb/>
whether it was listened to or not,
he had done <lb/>
his duty ; and he wished and hoped the
<lb/>
government would receive his suggestions <lb/>
in the spirit in which they were offered.</p>
            <p> One word more and he would not detain the
<lb/>
house further.  Many gentlemen had appeared <lb/>
to be in great dread of confederation from the <lb/>
increased taxes that might be
imposed.  Whe<lb break="no"/>ther confederation would or would not result<lb/>
in that, he would not stay now to ask; but he<lb/>
was curious to see whether these
gentlemen, <lb/>
who were frightened at imaginary
taxation, <lb/>
were willing to subject themselves to a real<lb/>
taxation exceeding the wildest flights which <lb/>
the opponents of union had
ventured to as<lb break="no"/>sume as the result of confederation.  If we <lb/>
were willing to bear these taxes—if we were <lb/>
willing to rush
into them when no necessity <lb/>
pressed us,—then he could not but feel, and he <lb/>
did not say it offensively, that the dread of<lb/>
taxation was mere hypocrisy, and those who <lb/>
used that argument would show their insin— <lb/>
cerity by voting for this resolution. <lb/>
            </p>

   <p> <persName ref="pers:MCDO4">Hon. FINANCIAL SECRETARY</persName> replied: I<lb/>
cannot pretend to have so long a familarity <lb/>
with public accounts as the hon. leader of the<lb/>
Opposition, nor to possess the financial
ability <lb/>
of that hon. gentleman; but I think I shall be<lb/>
able to show that the premises on which
he<lb/>
founded his statements—statements which,
if<lb/>
true, would justly create serious uneasiness in<lb/>
this county—are entirely baseless.   I have no <lb/>
hesitation in saying, that the facts and figures<lb/>
in the possession of the hon. member
(which<lb/>
were as full as it was possible to
procure for<lb/>
him) were sufficient to convince him that his <lb/>
statement was entirely fallacious.   He started<lb/>
with the assertion that in the preparation of<lb/>
the estimate which I laid on the table
there<lb/>
was the large sum of $82,000 placed to
our<lb/>
credit which did not belong to it.   He
was good <lb/>
enough to insinuate, if he did not
assert, that I <lb/>
was so incompetent to discharge my duty as to <lb/>
allow the sums borrowed from the Savings<lb/>
Bank, and the amount of Provincial Notes<lb/>
issued by the Receiver General,
to go with the <lb/>
general account without giving credit in
the<lb/>
estimate.  Now if the hon. member had taken<lb/>
the trouble to look at the paper in his hand, he<lb/>
        
            <pb n="281" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1865-04-18_Page_281.jpg"/>
       <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES.</fw> <fw type="num">281</fw>

would have found that he is entirely inaccu<lb break="no"/>rate. By the Receiver General's account, it<lb/>
appears that the sum of $40,000 was
issued in <lb/>
Treasury notes, and an amount of $42,000
was <lb/>
borrowed from the Savings' Bank. The Trea<lb break="no"/>sury notes were issued on the authority of the <lb/>
House, in connection with the new Provincial<lb/>
Building, and $42,000 was
borrowed towards <lb/>
the construction of the Pictou Railway. The <lb/>
sum of $148,000, which I show is
the balance in <lb/>
the general treasury for my disposal, is
totally<lb/>
independent of the $32,000 in
question. In the <lb/>
Receiver General's account there is paid for <lb/>
the Pictou Railway $21,000, and the
balance is <lb/>
brought up as outstanding liability against the <lb/>
Province, as a glance at schedule B of the esti<lb break="no"/>mates will show. Then there is the sum of <lb/>
$40,000 of treasury notes. By an Act passed in <lb/>
1863, the Government were authorised to issue <lb/>
Province notes not to exceed $40,000, and to <lb/>
take from the Savings' Bank a sum not to <lb/>
exceed $60,000 for the purchase
of the lot <lb/>
known as Hare's lot, and the erection there— <lb/>
on of the public building now in
course of <lb/>
canstruction.</p>
            <p> In accordance with this authority, the
lot <lb/>
was purchased, the building contracted for, <lb/>
and up to the 30th Sept. last the account of <lb/>
that building with the Province
stood as fol<lb break="no"/>lows:— <lb/>

<p>
being the amount brought up as a liability <lb/>
against the Province, as the hon. gentleman <lb/>
woukd have seen at a glance had
he taken the <lb/>
trouble to consult the papers
which have been <lb/>
under his hands for weeks—before
attempting <lb/>
to prejudice the government by
statements <lb/>
entirely without foundation and
greatly calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to mislead those not
having the ready ac<lb break="no"/>cess to the public accounts which the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman can command. The hon. member then <lb/>
proceeded to question the soundness of the esi<lb/>
timate for the present year,
and compared <lb/>
the receipts of the past two quarters with those <lb/>
of last year. The house will
recollect that the <lb/>
actual custom's receipts were
$999,000. Now I <lb/>
have before me the contingency of a revulsion <lb/>
of trade—the
probability
that in view of <lb/>
events transpiring in the United
States there <lb/>
might be a serious reduction in the revenue re<lb break="no"/>ceived from our imports. Therefore I estimate <lb/>
$79,000 less than was actually received last <lb/>
year. There is nothing that I can see in the <lb/>
circumstances of the country—apart from
any <lb/>
great convulsion of trade that nothing
at times <lb/>
can prevent—to warrant us in corning
to the <lb/>
conclusion that the year is
not to be a pros<lb break="no"/>perous one in a commercial and financial <lb/>
point of view. We see in the island of <lb/>
Cape Breton which is making such rapid <lb/>
progress in all the elements of prosperity, <lb/>
immense sums of money are being ex<lb break="no"/>pended for the development of its resources<lb/>
and the construction of the Railway. Under <lb/>
such circumstances the people in that section <lb/>
must be better able than heretofore to buy<lb/>
largely of dutiable goods. We have the assu<lb break="no"/>rance that capitalists are ready to expand an <lb/>
       
<cb/>

enormous sum of money in proportion to
our
<lb/>
population in the extension of our lines of<lb/>
railway. Again, the Province is going on with <lb/>
the construction of the Pictou
line. According <lb/>
to the hon. member we are this year to ex<lb break="no"/>pend a million and a half of dollars among<lb/>
our people in connection with this work. All<lb/>
these facts show that there will
be a  large <lb/>
amount of money in circulation, and as the <lb/>
people will buy in proportion to their ability <lb/>
to pay, the consumption of dutiable articles<lb/>
must largely increase with the
increased circu<lb break="no"/>lation of money. Therefore,
apart from the ge<lb break="no"/>neral favorable condition of the country,
I<lb/>
think under all the
circumstances, no man is <lb/>
justified in saying, that for this year at all <lb/>
events the ordinary receipts from our ordinary<lb/>
sources of <choice><sic>revenne</sic><corr>revenue</corr></choice> are to be largely reduced. <lb/>
I am not, however, obliged to deal in mere ge<lb break="no"/>neralities on this point.  I have, on a
previous
<lb/>
occasion, shown that in the first quarter of this <lb/>
year we had received over $100,000
in excess<lb/>
of the same quarter last
year; now we have <lb/>
another quarter gone by, the one
ending in <lb/>
March.  The revenue for that quarter is <lb/>
$129,000, or an increase of over $20,000
on the <lb/>
same quarter of last year.  I can also
state to <lb/>
the house that I had the
assurance of gentle<lb break="no"/>men who can best speak as to the prospects<lb/>
of our revenue for the present
quarter, that <lb/>
they are most favorable, and that, in fact, <lb/>
               <choice><sic>thore</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> will be an increase in the receipts over
<lb/>
the same quarter of 1864.  Under these circum<lb break="no"/>stances I don't think the hon.
gentleman was <lb/>
justified in drawing the alarming pictures he<lb/>
has of the state of our affairs. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The hon. member went further, and charged<lb/>
the Government with recklessness in spending <lb/>
large sums of money.  He complained that he<lb/>had not the liabilities to the end of the year at<lb/>
hand,—that it was impossible
for him to get at<lb/>
the exact condition of our financial affairs,<lb/>
and thereupon assumed that the expenditures <lb/>
were largely in excess of the receipts.  My<lb/>
hon. friend from Richmond, when Financial
<lb/>
Secretary, estimated largely in
excess of the <lb/>
actual expenditure, and the paper which I <lb/>
hold in my hand shows that on the 30th Sept. <lb/>
the Receiver General had paid on the estimate<lb/>
of my hon. friend an amount very much less
<lb/>
than the estimate.<lb/>
Supposing
the total expenditures to be as<lb/>
stated, yet the hon. member will find that the <lb/>
financial condition of the country is sound, and
<lb/>
that there is no reason whatever why the coun<lb break="no"/>try should be in the slightest degree alarmed <lb/>
as to its ability to meet the obligations  it has <lb/>
incurred.  The hon. member attempted to cause <lb/>
alarm respecting the sale of our debentures.
<lb/>
Every man who has the interest of
his country<lb/>
at heart must deprecate the attempt to preju<lb break="no"/>dice the public mind in
connection with the po<lb break="no"/>sition which our debentures occupy in the mar<lb break="no"/>ket.  I have reason to know that the discus<lb break="no"/>sions which have taken place in another branch <lb/>
of the Legislature have
already deterred men <lb/>
from investing in these bonds to the extent <lb/>
they intended.  Before an hon. gentleman en<lb break="no"/>deavored to create mistrust and prejudice on<lb/>
the public mind in this respect, he should have <lb/>
at least grounds for so doing, and I for one<lb/>
cannot see that he has any.  He is altogether <lb/>
in error in estimating the expenditure on the  <lb/>
railway to be one and a half millions during <lb/>
the present season.  I have reason to believe <lb/>
that theexpenditure will be between 700 and<lb/>

$800,000, and that there will not be any
serious <lb/>
dificulty in obtaining the money required.  <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> The hon. gentleman next stated that the <lb/>
adoption of the resolutions on the table would <lb/>
impose upon the country an additional bur<lb break="no"/>den of $400,000 per annum for Railway in<lb break="no"/>terest; and on giving us his assumption that <lb/>
$800,000 will hereafter be the
highest amount <lb/>
on which we can calculate as revenue re<lb break="no"/>ceipts, he concludes that we shall not be in a <lb/>
position to meet the increased demands upon <lb/>
our revenues.  Now, sir, I assume that our <lb/>
revenue for at least a few years to come, will <lb/>
not be materially less than at present; and I <lb/>
found the estimate upon the increasing
trade <lb/>
of the country, which I have before endeavor<lb break="no"/>ed to show the house, must inevitably be the <lb/>
result of the large expenditures
now being and <lb/>
likely hereafter to be made on
our public works <lb/>
and in the development of the mineral wealth <lb/>
of the country.  The hon. gentleman has alto<lb break="no"/>gether ignored this view of the question, and <lb/>
also the not only probable but inevitable in<lb break="no"/>rease in our casual and territorial revenue. <lb/>
We must also consider the very large increase <lb/>
which must take place in the earnings of ourpre<lb break="no"/>sent railways on the completion of the contem<lb break="no"/>plated extensions, east, north and west.  Now it <lb/>
must be evident to the house that every coal <lb/>
mine opened not only represents the capital <lb/>
invested in its development, but gives annu<lb break="no"/>ally an additional revenue in
proportion to the <lb/>
extent of its shipments—just as every addi<lb break="no"/>tional mile of railway built in connection with <lb/>
existing lines will throw a large additional <lb/>
traflic on the government work.  The receipts <lb/>
on our roads are even now largely
increasing, <lb/>
as every month's return shows—and
I shall be <lb/>
much mistaken if the receipts this year will <lb/>
not amount to $200,000 as against $168,000
last <lb/>
year I assume, therefore, that I may safely <lb/>
ask the country to base the revenue for a few <lb/>
years to come on the estimated revenue for the <lb/>
present year—and on that
assumption it will <lb/>
not be difficult to show that even without re<lb break="no"/>sorting to the expedient of raising our
present <lb/>
tariff the additional burdens could be met, and <lb/>
all the substantial interests of the country <lb/>
subserved.  Indeed, was I inclined
to rely <lb/>
upon such authority alone, I need
only quote <lb/>
the speech of his friend the hon. member for <lb/>
East Halifax, who, in a speech
delivered in <lb/>
Temperance Hall, when his object was not to <lb/>
depreciate the resources of his
country, proved <lb/>
to a demonstration—if his figures be accepted  <lb/>
as of any value—that the country
could safely <lb/>
undertake the work contemplated by this reso<lb break="no"/>lution without seriously entrenching upon the <lb/>
other essential services of the country.   The <lb/>
hon. gentleman has even stated the liability <lb/>
which the adoption of these
resolutions will <lb/>
entail—the amount being $312,000 with the in<lb break="no"/>terest on the cost of
construction of the Avon <lb/>
bridge.  This estimate will give
the following <lb/>
result:— </p>

            <p> Leaving a balance of only $96,528 to be made <lb/>
up from the increased receipts upon our rail<lb break="no"/>ways and on the revenue derived from our <lb/>
coal and gold mines—or if necessary by a <lb/>
small addition to our tariff, which would not <lb/>
be felt by the people, and which they would <lb/>
willingly grant on advantages to be derived. <lb/>
It was never contemplated by any one party in <lb/>
this house that our public works could be large<lb break="no"/>ly extended without somewhat increasing
our <lb/>
tariff, at present the lowest in America; but it <lb/>
is not necessary that I should
now enter on <lb/>
that subject.  One word now, sir, as to the <lb/>
propriety of a gentleman occupying
the posi<lb break="no"/>tion admittedly occupied by the hon. and learn<lb break="no"/>ed gentleman from Colchester, as a financier, <lb/>
for any purpose attempting against the facts <lb/>
of the case to depreciate the
financial position <lb/>
and character of the country at
a time when <lb/>
it is the duty of every man to further
and sus<lb break="no"/>tain its credit.  That hon. gentleman's position <lb/>
and talents give even false and erroneous views <lb/>
and assertions when propounded by him, a <lb/>
weight and consideration which would not <lb/>
otherwise attach to them, and he will be held <lb/>
responsible by the country for allowing his <lb/>
eagerness to embarrass the government to be<lb break="no"/>tray him into the hasty and inconsiderate state<lb break="no"/>ment of facts either utterly baseless
or found<lb break="no"/>ed on mere speculation, but which may, not,<lb break="no"/>withstanding, coming from such authority have <lb/>
a tendency to injure the public credit.  His
<lb/>
calculations to-day, sir, are somewhat on a <lb/>
par with those by which in
1859 he prov<lb break="no"/>ed so conclusively that the Pictou Rail<lb break="no"/>way could be built at a cost to the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of  £6000 a year, and, I am sorry to<lb/>
say, are not a bit more reliable than that<lb/>
celebrated financial statement.  I have thus <lb/>
shown that the hon. gentleman's attempt<lb/>
to impugn the correctness of  the estimates on<lb/>
the table have utterly failed.  I have attempt<lb break="no"/>ed, and I think with success, to show that the<lb/>
large expenditure of this Government for the
<lb/>
present year is founded upon well-considered <lb/>
and safe calculations of our resources,
and that <lb/>
Mr. Archibald's attempt to
play the alarmist is <lb/>
due rather to his desire to embarrass or injure <lb/>
the Government than to any fear of finan<lb break="no"/>cial embarrassment on the part of the men who <lb/>
did not hesitate to embrace the Quebec scheme <lb/>
of 1862 for the construction of
the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway</p>
            <p>I can only say, for my own part, if it was at<lb/>

all apparent that the construction of
these rail<lb break="no"/>ways was to impose burthens we could not <lb/>
bear, I would hesitate before adopting the reso<lb break="no"/>lution.  No man in this country, however, can <lb/>
deny that, if we are able to obtain the connec<lb break="no"/>tion with St. John, and with the railway sys<lb break="no"/>tem of the continent, we shall gain vast com<lb break="no"/>mercial advantages.  The increase in trade will <lb/>
soon counterbalance any additional burthens <lb/>
that we may impose upon ourselves.  Rail<lb break="no"/>ways make trade wherever they pass, and no <lb/>
one can doubt that a road to the
fertile coun<lb break="no"/>ties of King's and Annapolis would be not <lb/>
only a great boon to the people of the west, <lb/>
but create an ultimately remunerative traflic. <lb/>
In due time a trade would accumulate that <lb/>
would repay handsomely the Province for the <lb/>
expenditure it might incur. <lb/>

<!-- GL, 2017-06-20, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->


           <!-- <p> Thursday,
April 20.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. TOBIN
said that for the last few years so <lb/>
much had been said upon the question of Rail<lb break="no"/>roads, it was impossible to bring forward <lb/>
anything new on the subject.  There were <lb/>
a great many things in the speech of the hon. <lb/>
leader of the opposition, to which he would have <lb/>
liked to refer ; but as he perceived that he was <lb/>
not in his place, he should refrain from doing so. <lb/>
If the present position of this country were con<lb break="no"/>trasted with the condition of affairs
a few years <lb/>
ago, it would be found that from some cause or <lb/>
other, whether from the construction of railroads <lb/>
or the spirit of commercial enterprize, or the <lb/>
gradual expansion of trade, the Revenue had <lb/>
swelled to an extent beyond the expectation of the <lb/>
most sanguine.  He had taken the trouble a year <lb/>
ago, when it was proposed to
extend the railroad <lb/>
to Pictou, to look into the question, and to con<lb break="no"/>trast the state of our Revenue then with what it <lb/>
was before the railway system
was inaugurated, <lb/>
and what did he find ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> (The hon. gentleman here said that he had<lb/>
mislaid the memorandum of figures he had prepared ; <lb/>
but speaking from memory) the
Revenue, which <lb/>
in 1851 amounted to £102, 632, had swelled in <lb/>
10 years (1861) to over £281,000,
and this year <lb/>
the Financial Secretary estimates it at over <lb/>
$1,300,000.  So it will be seen
that since the <lb/>
construction of railroads has been commenced, <lb/>
that the trade of the country has increased—labor <lb/>
has been multiplied,—and the expenditure of the <lb/>
Province has been kept within its income.  He<lb/>
had prepared a few calculations as to the amount<lb/>
of liability annually imposed upon this country <lb/>
by the construction of these public works, and <lb/>
first as to the two links already completed to <lb/>
Truro and Windsor.  Some hon gentlemen wish<lb break="no"/>ed to leave these where they were ; but that he <lb/>
never could assent to.  He believed that they <lb/>
never could be made properly remunerative until <lb/>
they tapped the waters of the St.
Lawrence on the <lb/>
one hand, and the Bay of Fundy on the other. </p>
            <p> In approaching this subject, he wished to
do <lb/>
so in a spirit of fairness and candor.  He did not<lb/>
wish to state the liability we would be called upon<lb/>
to assume at a dollar less than it really would
be. <lb/>
For many years we have spent
large sums of the<lb/>
public monies in constructing mud roads.  This <lb/>
session, over $250.000 has been
voted for that <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>   



            <p/>

            <p> 283 <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> purpose.  And yet it is argued by some,
that <lb/>
altho' the Province can afford to do that, she <lb/>
cannot undertake the construction of the e public <lb/>
works, which will add so much to the wealth and <lb/>
material prosperity of the country. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> To return, however, to the subject of liability—- <lb break="yes"/>
he found that the Province had issued debentures <lb/>
to the extent of a million of
pounds for the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the lines to Windsor and Truro—this <lb/>
involved an annual liability of £60,000 for in- <lb break="maybe"/>
terest.  No difficulty had ever
been experienced <lb/>
in paying that interest—the
Province had always <lb/>
been prepared when called upon to meet all de<lb break="no"/>mands, and certainly she was in a better condi<lb break="no"/>tion now, than when railway construction was <lb/>
commenced.  Then again, we have, after some <lb/>
delay, undertaken the construction of the line to <lb/>
Pictou—the propriety of that extension has al<lb break="no"/>ways been admitted, and it was only a question <lb/>
of time as to when the finances of the country <lb/>
would admit of its being undertaken.  The esti<lb break="no"/>mated cost of that work is £500,000, which will <lb/>
impose an annual liability of £30, 000.  That <lb/>
liability, however, will not fall upon us imme<lb break="no"/>diately ; but will be extended over three years, as <lb/>
the work goes on—and as the business of the <lb/>
country would also go on increasing, there is no <lb/>
doubt, that there would be no trouble in meeting <lb/>
these obligations.  The
Government now propose <lb/>
to subsidize any company to construct the line to <lb/>
the borders of New Brunswick—which is esti<lb break="no"/>mated to cost £400,000, when
capitalized, involv<lb break="no"/>ing an annual charge on the Revenues of the <lb/>
Province of £24,000 a year. It is also proposed <lb/>
to extend the line to Annapolis.  Last year, a<lb/>
resolution was passed by the House, offering any <lb/>
company that would undertake to construct the <lb/>
line, a subvention of 4 per cent. on £6,000 per <lb/>
mile.  It appears, after a lapse of'a year, that no <lb/>
company is willing to undertake the work, unless <lb/>
the Government will build the bridge over the <lb/>
Avon—that bridge is estimated to
cost £40,000. <lb/>
The cost of the Annapolis road, at £6,000 per <lb/>
mile, will amount to £50,000—if that is capital<lb break="no"/>ized at the same rate of four per cent—it will give <lb/>
£20,400 annual interest to be paid by the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. <lb/>
            </p>





            <p> Then again, take the cost of bridging the
Avon— <lb/>
the hon. leader of the Opposition undertook to ques<lb break="no"/>tion the accuracy of the estimate—but
the only <lb/>means of judging, was from the report of the En<lb break="no"/>gineer, and he did not think that the Government <lb/>
had any motive or desire to conceal from the coun<lb break="no"/>try the real cost of the work—the
interest at six <lb/>
per cent upon the cost—as
estimated by the Engi<lb break="no"/>neer, will be £2,400 a. year. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> It appears that Mr. Leversey on behalf
of the In—<lb/>
ternational Contract Company, has
offered to con<lb break="no"/>struct
the road to the borders of New Brunswick, <lb/>
provided the Government, or the City of Halifax,<lb/>
take stock to the amount of £100,000.  The
Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, probably looking at all points of the po<lb break="no"/>litical horizon, have come to the conclusion
that<lb/>
they can manage to get the city to assume that <lb/>
amount of stock.  He (Mr. T.) was not going to<lb/>
discuss that question just then—but he thought it <lb/>
would be wise before they
passed any law to make <lb/>
            </p>
