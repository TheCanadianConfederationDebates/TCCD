<!-- GL, 2018-05-29, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

<!--  <p>
     stitutions by our own judgment. and not by the 
     <lb/>
     direction of the neighboring Republic. One 
     <lb/>
     of the members for Yarmoutb admitted that 
     <lb/>
     nine-tenths of the people of that county are in 
     <lb/>
     favour of annexation,—these are opinions which 
     <lb/>
     no loyalist can endorse. Another gentleman 
     <lb/>
     taking a prominent stand in this discussion has 
     <lb/>
     made remarks concerning our Lieut Governor 
     <lb/>
     which I cannot endorse. I have received some 
     <lb/>
     letters from my constituents, asking me to sup<lb break="no"/>port the resolution, and I have received none 
     <lb/>
     to the contrary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. KILLAM</persName> replied that his colleague, Mr 
     <lb/>
     Townsend, had merely intimated that a majo<lb break="no"/>rity of the people of Yarmoulh preferred an<lb break="no"/>nexation to Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. LOCKE said that in the session of 1862 
     <lb/>
     the Atty. General applied the phrase "dumb 
     <lb/>
     logs" to gentlemen whom he opposed,—that 
     <lb/>
     expression could be very appropriately applied 
     <lb/>
     to gentlemen on the government side, who al<lb break="no"/>lowed the speeches of gentlemen opposed to 
     <lb/>
     the resolution to pass unanswered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. ATTY GEN said that the gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     whom that phrase was applied in 1862, bore it 
     <lb/>
     pretty easily, and he presumed that his friends 
     <lb/>
     could do the same on this occasion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question was then taken upon Mr S. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell's amendment, which was negatived, 
     <lb/>
     eighteen voting for it and thirty-one against it 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For the amendment—Messrs. Killam, Hebb, 
     <lb/>
     Hatfield, Balcom, Townsend, Lawrence, Moore, 
     <lb/>
     Robertson. Locke, S. Campbell, Blanchard, 
     <lb/>
     McLelan, Ross, King, Ray, Brown, Coffin and 
     <lb/>
     Annand 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Against :—Messrs. Bill, Hill, C. J. Campbell, 
     <lb/>
     Shannon, D Fraser, Allison, Jno Campbell, 
     <lb/>
     Whitman, Pryor, Longley, Parker, Heffernan.

     Smith and Archibald. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The resolution passed 31 to 19, Mr. J, Fraser 
     <lb/>
     voting with the minority. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The House adjourned.

            <p>
     The house met at 3 o'clock. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COFF1">Mr. COFFIN</persName> reported from the committee on 
     <lb/>
     Land Damages.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROV. SEC</persName>. laid on the table the Re<lb break="no"/>port of the President and Directors of the Hor<lb break="no"/>ticultural Society. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCFA1">Hon. Mr. MCFARLANE</persName> introduced a bill to 
     <lb/>
     enable School District No. 34, Cumberland to 
     <lb/>
     sell an old house and lot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The House then went into committee and 
     <lb/>
     passed the following bills: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To legalize Assessment Rolls in the county 
     <lb/>
     of Kings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To legalize Assessment Rolls in the county 
     <lb/>
     of Digby. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To amend the Act incorporating the Govern<lb break="no"/>ors of King's College, Windsor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Bill relative to Assessment in the county of 
     <lb/>
     Yarmouth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To authorize the sale of a school house at 
     <lb/>
     Lower Stewiacke. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     An act for the better security of the Crown 
     <lb/>
     in Nova Scotla against seditious and treason<lb break="no"/>able practices and acts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the bill to amend chap. 45 of County 
     <lb/>
     Assessment some desultory discussion ensued. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName> explained that at present 
     <lb/>
     assessment is based upon real and personal 
     <lb/>
     property. A man who possesses a large 
     <lb/>
     amount of income, and little or no real estate, 
     <lb/>
     is not taxed in proportion to his wealth. The 
     <lb/>
     object of the bill is to make his income liable, 
     <lb/>
     and thereby relieve the poorer classes to a 
     <lb/>
     large extent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. STEWART CAMPBELL</persName> said that this was 
     <lb/>
     an attempt to impose upon the Province at 
     <lb/>
     large an income tax, at best a most inquisito<lb break="no"/>rial tax. He moved that the bill be deferred. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. ALLISON</persName> thought that the bill was very 
     <lb/>
     much required; a farmer was now heavily 
     <lb/>
     taxed, whilst his neighbour, a much richer one 
     <lb/>
     who lent money, had little or no taxes to pay 
     <lb/>
     comparatively. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAN2">Mr. BLANCHARD</persName> said that the present bill 
     <lb/>
     only meant to establish the principle in exist<lb break="no"/>ence in the city. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COFF1">Mr. COFFIN</persName> and Mr. TOWNSEND hoped that 
     <lb/>
     the bill would not pass, as it might operate in<lb break="no"/>juriously. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PARK1">Mr. PARKER</persName> supported the bill, as it would 
     <lb/>
     favour the poor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BILL1">Mr. BILL</persName> said that there was no question as 
     <lb/>
     to the correctness of the principle of the bill, 
     <lb/>
     but how would it work in the country where 
     <lb/>
     the credit system so largely prevails? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COWI2">Mr. COWIE</persName> said that the difficulty was to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain the actual income a man might have. 
     <lb/>
     He could understand how the bill might work 
     <lb/>
     in reference to a man who lends money out at 
     <lb/>
     interest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAN2">Mr. BLANCHARD</persName> said that the bill was not 
     <lb/>
     of an inquisitorial character; if a man was not 
     <lb/>
     taxed fairly he had his remedy by making an 
     <lb/>
     affidavit of the fact. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr DONKIN believed that any gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who reflected on the subject would see the 
     <lb/>
     propriety of the hill before the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BILL1">Hon. ATTY. GENL</persName>. was in favour of the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of the hill; but suggested whether a more 
     <lb/>
     simple machinery could not be found than 
     <lb/>
     what was in the hill. He believed that a fair 
     <lb/>
     system of taxation, something like what was 
     <lb/>
     proposed in the bill, would relieve the indus<lb break="no"/>trial classes largely from taxation. He was 
     <lb/>
     afraid the present measure went too far. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PRO. SEC</persName>. was of opinion that the bill 
     <lb/>
     was a good one; the effect would be to relieve 
     <lb/>
     the poorer classes.    
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS10">Mr. ROSS</persName> pointed out defects in the existing 
     <lb/>
     assessment law; there should be a general 
     <lb/>
     assessor appointed in every county by the 
     <lb/>
     sessions.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. KILLAM</persName> doubted the advisability of the 
     <lb/>
     measure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAMI1">Dr. HAMILTON</persName> was glad to see such a law 
     <lb/>
     introduced. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">The Committee</persName> rose and reported progress. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
