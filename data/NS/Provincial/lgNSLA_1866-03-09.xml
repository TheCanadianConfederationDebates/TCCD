               <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon PROV. SEC</persName>.—By command of His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency I beg leave to lay on the table of the 
     <lb/>
     House copies of correspondence relating to 
     <lb/>
     the Union of the Colonies. The House is aware 
     <lb/>
     that both branches of the Legislature at the 
     <lb/>
     last Session passed a resolution in favor of re<lb break="no"/>opening negociations for the Union of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces. When that resolution was 
     <lb/>
     under discussion I stated that we had not only 
     <lb/>
     no reason to suppose that Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island would he prepared to co-operate with 
     <lb/>
     the other Colonies in this matter, but we had 
     <lb/>
     every reason to anticipate that she would de<lb break="no"/>cline to re-open negociations. At the same 
     <lb/>
     time it was thought desirable that an effort 
     <lb/>
     should be made to ascertain whether Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick could not be 
     <lb/>
     brought under the government by a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union. The government and the legislature 
     <lb/>
     had initiated the policy of a Legislative Union 
     <lb/>
               of the Maritime Provinces at the previous ses<lb break="no"/>sion, and owing to circumstances detailed last 
     <lb/>
     year the negociation arising from their action 
     <lb/>
     had been postponed, and the greater question 
     <lb/>
     of a union of all British North America was 
     <lb/>
     brought under consideration. When, however, 
     <lb/>
     an immediate union of that kind was found im<lb break="no"/>practicable from the fact that the people of 
     <lb/>
    New Brunswick had returned a majority in 
     <lb/>the new House opposed to the scheme, the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment felt it their duty to revert to their 
     <lb/>former policy, and in discussing that resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, I stated that so far from a legislative 
     <lb/>union of this and the adjoining Province in the 
     <lb/>slightest degree impeding the larger union, we 
     <lb/>regarded it as likely to promote that union 
     <lb/>and as being indispensable to the latter. Upon 
     <lb/>this subject have always entertained very 
     <lb/>strong opinions, and have always felt there 
     <lb/>were a great many reasons why it was desira<lb break="no"/>ble that the Governments of the three Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces should be carried on in a united   
     <lb/>form in case they agreed to enter into the pro<lb break="no"/>posed Confederacy. The resolution to which 
     <lb/>I have referred met with the unanimous appro<lb break="no"/>val of the House. I do not mean to say that 
     <lb/>there were not individual gentlemen who did 
     <lb/>not concur in the policy proposed, but the reso<lb break="no"/>
               
            <cb/>
     
     lution must be accepted as the unanimous ex<lb break="no"/>pression of the opinion of the Legislature. The 
     <lb/>
     attention of the Government of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick was invited to the action thus taken, and 
     <lb/>
     corresponding action was adopted by the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of that Province. Subsequently a dele<lb break="no"/>gation to England took place from the Govern<lb break="no"/>ments of the two Provinces, and although the 
     <lb/>
     two Governments differed widely in their opin<lb break="no"/>ions upon the larger questiou they were com<lb break="no"/>pletely in accord as to the desirability of a 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Union of New Brunswick and No<lb break="no"/>va Scotia, and the views which the delegates 
     <lb/>
     for New Brunswick expressed upon this mat<lb break="no"/>ter entirely corresponded with our own. I am 
     <lb/>
     aware that these gentlemen urged all the rea<lb break="no"/>sons in their power on the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to induce their concurrence in the policy 
     <lb/>
     adopted. I have stated in detail the results of 
     <lb/>
     that delegation and the reception it met at the 
     <lb/>
     hands of Her Majesty's Government, and I am 
     <lb/>
     frank to say that after the fullest and most un<lb break="no"/>reserved communication on the question we 
     <lb/>
     were given to understand that while no antipa<lb break="no"/>thy existed to the Legislative Union proposed, 
     <lb/>
     that Government having so fully committed 
     <lb/>
     themselves to the scheme of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     were unwilling to revert to any policy which 
     <lb/>
     would seem to indicate that their opinions had 
     <lb/>
     undergone a change or modification and under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances they were not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     give authority to revert to the question of a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union, except that question were 
     <lb/>
     taken up and passed upon as auxiliary to, and 
     <lb/>
     intended to promote, the larger union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While we were quite at liberty to urge our 
     <lb/>
     opinions in favor of a union of the martime pro<lb break="no"/>vinces as being conductive to that object, we 
     <lb/>
     were not prepared, and the Government of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick were by no means prepared, 
     <lb/>
     to adopt the policy with that view, for, as is 
     <lb/>
     well known they were specially charged to op<lb break="no"/>pose confederation upon the basis of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
    scheme. While the delegates, used every 
     <lb/>means to induce her Majesty's Government to 
     <lb/>concur with reference to the union of the lower 
     <lb/>colonies, that Government refused their assent 
     <lb/>upon the grounds stated. The correspondence 
     <lb/>contains copies of despatches in reference to 
     <lb/>the adoption of confederation, which the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government continue to urge on all the 
     <lb/>colonies by every argument in their power, and 
     <lb/>by the use of that influence which they consider 
     <lb/>themselves entitled to exercise, from the rela 
     <lb/>tive postion of the countries in a question 
     <lb/>which they regard as vitally affecting the pros<lb break="no"/>perity of British North America. It also con<lb break="no"/>tains despatches setting forth their reasons for 
     <lb/>declining to assent to the re-opening of the 
     <lb/>proposed negociations.
