     [...]these; but contemplating the whole Empire, 
     <lb/>
     including over thirty colonies, scattered over 
     <lb/>
     all parts of the world, consisting of every peo<lb break="no"/>ple and tongue, and situate in every climate, 
     <lb/>
     is it possible to conceive of a power but that 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain that could have so long dis<lb break="no"/>charged such immense responsibilities as the 
     <lb/>
     possession of this Empire throws upon 
     <lb/>
     her, and that too almost within the life time 
     <lb/>
     of a man, necessarily involves. See how dif<lb break="no"/>ferent from ours is the position of all these 
     <lb/>
     Colonies. Australia is at the antipodes, and 
     <lb/>
     is defended by its distance from a foe. India 
     <lb/>
     is separated from the only power that is likely 
     <lb/>
     to interfere with British rule by impassable 
     <lb/>
     mountains and trackless deserts, the islands 
     <lb/>
     of the Pacific and Australasia are protected 
     <lb/>
     by distance and their remote position; but 
     <lb/>
     here, all along the two thousand miles of con<lb break="no"/>terminous boundary between us and Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca, we have in our immediate presence 
     <lb/>
     the military power which makes British Ame<lb break="no"/>rica the weakest spot in the Empire. No Bri<lb break="no"/>tish statesman can fail to see that of all the
     <lb/>
     points at which the Imperial power can be 
     <lb/>
     assailed, this presents the elements which 
     <lb/>
     make a war most to be dreaded. Do we won<lb break="no"/>der, then, that despatch after despatch has 
     <lb/>
     been sent by the home authorities, requiring 
     <lb/>
     us to put ourselves in such a position that 
     <lb/>
     England, if called upon to defend us, can do 
     <lb/>
     so successfully. Is it any wonder that we find 
     <lb/>
     the Colonial Secretary, time after time, al<lb break="no"/>most imploring us, if we have any desire to 
     <lb/>
     retain our allegiance to the Crown, to put our<lb break="no"/>selves in such an attitude that the Crown 
     <lb/>
     can protect us? I feel that if there were 
     <lb/>
     no commercial advantages to be derived 
     <lb/>
     from striking down antagonistic barriers; if 
     <lb/>
     our material interests even were not promoted 
     <lb/>
     by Union, we could not gracefully resist the 
     <lb/>
     expression of such desire on the part of those 
     <lb/>
     to whom we are indebted for protection, and 
     <lb/>
     of whom we are even new imploring aid. For 
     <lb/>
     they say, "we are ready to place the whole 
     <lb/>
     resources of the Empire at your back, we will 
     <lb/>
     defend you as long as you desire to remain 
     <lb/>
     with us; but we claim it a right which our 
     <lb/>
     position gives us to offer you advice as to 
     <lb/>
     the attitude you shall assume, and in which, 
     <lb/>
     we think, you can best be defended." Even 
     <lb/>
     admitting that there were no commercial 
     <lb/>
     advantages in the proposed Union, admitting 
     <lb/>
     even that we did not agree that the British 
     <lb/>
     government were right in the belief that Union 
     <lb/>
     would aid our defence, is there a man in the 
     <lb/>
     country who could look a British statesman 
     <lb/>
     in the face and say "we will accept your pro<lb break="no"/>tection, but we decline your advice?" This 
     <lb/>
     argument alone, the deference which is due 
     <lb/>
     from our position as the protected and defend<lb break="no"/>ed, to those who protect and defend, I feel to 
     <lb/>
     be irresistible. I have never hesitated in this 
     <lb/>
     assembly from the first hour when the propo<lb break="no"/>sition for Colonial Union was mooted, from giv<lb break="no"/>ing it my support. Since it assumed a definite 
     <lb/>
     shape and I became a party to the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     scheme I have felt my conviction of the 
     <lb/>
     soundness of the principles upon which that 
     <lb/>
     scheme was based, strengthened by reason 
     <lb/>
     and reflection. I claim no right to dictate to 
     <lb/>
     others their course of action. The gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     with whom I have been associated, have a 
     <lb/>
     right, if they choose, to change their views, but 
     <lb/>
     I do not feel at liberty to do so while I retain 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     my <choice><sic>presest</sic><corr>present</corr></choice> conviction. I have put my hand 
     <lb/>
     to public documents which bind me in honor 
     <lb/>
     to the same course to which my convictions 
     <lb/>
     lead. As I have said my opinion of the Que<lb break="no"/>bec scheme is entirely unchanged. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that it guards our interests as far 
     <lb/>
     as we had a right to expect them to be 
     <lb/>
     guarded in an Intercolonial arrangement; but 
     <lb/>
     if larger concessions can be obtained, there is 
     <lb/>
     no member of this House or of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Convention, belonging to the lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     who would not willingly accept them. The 
     <lb/>
     resolution now before us leaves the question 
     <lb/>
     open only to a change in our favor—Canada is 
     <lb/>
     bound by her Legislature to go at all events 
     <lb/>
     as far as the Quebec scheme. The Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces alone are dissatisfied, and if any 
     <lb/>
     alterations are made, they must be in the line 
     <lb/>
     of concessions to them. If we can secure 
     <lb/>
     guarantees and privileges not embodied in that 
     <lb/>
     scheme, it will be in entire accord with the 
     <lb/>
     feelings of this House and those members of 
     <lb/>
     it that attended the Convention, and as the 
     <lb/>
     proposition now before us will secure us at 
     <lb/>
     least the benefit of that scheme, and possibly 
     <lb/>
     some others, I do not hesitate to give it my 
     <lb/>
     support, and have much pleasure in seconding 
     <lb/>
     the resolution.

     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">HON. PRO. SECRETARY</persName>, in reply to a remark 
     <lb/>
     from Mr Annand, said that the passage of 
     <lb/>
     the resolution would enable a scheme of union 
     <lb/>
     to be given effect to by the Imperial Parliament 
     <lb/>
     but that one of the conditions would be that the 
     <lb/>
     existing Legislatures would not be interfered 
     <lb/>
     with, and would continue to sit for the term of 
     <lb/>
     their election.

     The House went into Committee and passed

     <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCIHBALD</persName> reported up a bill relative to 
     <lb/>
     assessment; he stated that the object of the bill 
     <lb/>
     is to subject to assessment those persons who 
     <lb/>
     have large incomes and yet have no visible pro<lb break="no"/>perty to be taxed.

            <p>
     Mr Coffin and Mr Locke objected to the bill as 
     <lb/>
     it might operate hardly on poor working men, 
     <lb/>
     fishermen or others with only limited incomes; 
     <lb/>
     but Mr. Archibald said that they might be pro<lb break="no"/>tected by a clause when the bill came up on

     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Hon. PROV. SEC</persName> reported up from the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee on Education. The report among other 
     <lb/>
     things recommended that assistance be granted 
     <lb/>
     to Dr. Forrester in the publication of a work on 
     <lb/>
     Education that would be found invaluable to 
     <lb/>
     teachers and others. It stated that during the 
     <lb/>
     present session 31 petitions had been presented 
     <lb/>
     in favor of, and 5 against assessment for the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     Report which referred to the Halifax Grammar

     School; the effect would be, he said, to transfer 
     <lb/>
     property properly belonging to the whole body 
     <lb/>
     of the citizens to a private body. He sustained 
     <lb/>
     the grant to Dr. Forrester as most judicious.

            <p>
