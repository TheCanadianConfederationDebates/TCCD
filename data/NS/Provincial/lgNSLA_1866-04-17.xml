     efforts of those who would lead us into annexa<lb break="no"/>tion, will be effectually foiled by the loyal people. 
     <lb/>
     As far as I am concerned, all my interests are 
     <lb/>
     bound up with those of this Province—when she 
     <lb/>
     is prosperous then I feel satisfied. I am sprung 
     <lb/>
     from the early pioneers who helped to build up 
     <lb/>
     the prosperity of this country, and all I desire is 
     <lb/>
     to see it progress. I feel I would be recreant in 
     <lb/>
     my duty to those who have preceded me, as well 
     <lb/>
     as to those who may follow me and hear my name 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     scheme which the best minds of Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     and British America have declared is indispens<lb break="no"/>able to the continuance ot our prosperity, and our 
     <lb/>
     connection with the fatherland. On the 24th 
     <lb/>
     June, '65, the British Government told us through 
     <lb/>
     the Colonial Secretary : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " You will at the same time express the strong 
     <lb/>
     and deliberate opinion of Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that it is an object much to be desired that 
     <lb/>
     all the British North American Colonies should 
     <lb/>
     agree to unite in one Government. In the terri<lb break="no"/>torial extent of Canada, and in the Maritime and 
     <lb/>
     Commercial enterprise of the Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty's Government see the elements of 
     <lb/>
     power, which only require to be combined in 
     <lb/>
     order to secure for these Provinces, which shall 
     <lb/>
     possess them all, a place among the most con<lb break="no"/>siderable communities of the world In the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of loyalty to the British Crown of attachment 
     <lb/>
     to British connexion, and of love for British Insti<lb break="no"/>tutions, by which all these Provinces are animated 
     <lb/>
     alike, Her Majesty's Government recognize the 
     <lb/>
     bond by which all may be combined under one Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. Such an union seems to Her Majes<lb break="no"/>ty's Government to recommend itself to the 
     <lb/>
     Provinces on many grounds of moral and material 
     <lb/>
     advantages—as giving a well-founded prospect 
     <lb/>
     of improved administration and increased pros<lb break="no"/>perity 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " But there is one consideration which Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government feel it more especially 
     <lb/>
     their duty to press upon the Legislature of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. Looking to the determination which this 
     <lb/>
     country has ever exhibited in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     defence of the Colonies as a matter of Imperial 
     <lb/>
     concern, the Colonies must recognize a right and 
     <lb/>
     even acknowledge an obligation incumbent on 
     <lb/>
     the Home Government to urge with earnestness 
     <lb/>
     and just authority the measures which they con<lb break="no"/>sider most expedient on the part of the Colonists 
     <lb/>
     with a view to their own defence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " Nor can it be doubtful that the Provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British North America are incapable, when sepa<lb break="no"/>rate and divided from each other of making those 
     <lb/>
     just and efficient preparations for national de<lb break="no"/>fence which would be easily undertaken by a 
     <lb/>
     Province uniting in itself all the population and 
     <lb/>
     all the resources of the whole." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Here you find the British Government implor<lb break="no"/>ing us if we are animated by a sincere spirit of 
     <lb/>
     loyalty, by a desire to remain connected with 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, to unite without delay. Can any 
     <lb/>
     one read these words unmoved? Let me trust 
     <lb/>
     that the people will respond to the demand made 
     <lb/>
     upon them by those who have the best right to 
     <lb/>
     proffer their advice, and hasten the time when we 
     <lb/>
     shall be united in one grand Confederation, "with 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     one flag above our heads, one sentiment in our

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPBELL</persName> said:—I quite concur with 
     <lb/>
     those gentlemen who have attributed to this 
     <lb/>
     subject a magnitude and importance second 
     <lb/>
     to none that has ever been discussed in this 
     <lb/>
     House. Notwithstanding that there has been 
     <lb/>
     a good deal of excitement brought into this 
     <lb/>
     debate, and something more than excitement, 
     <lb/>
     a good deal of temper, it shall be my endeavor 
     <lb/>
     so to moderate my tone and language that not 
     <lb/>
     only shall these be in keeping with Parliament<lb break="no"/>ary decorum, but the remarks which I have to 
     <lb/>
     offer shall be otherwise entitled to the calm 
     <lb/>
     and sober consideration and reflection of the 
     <lb/>
     members around these benches. In short I 
     <lb/>
     shall not, in addressing this Assembly, ex<lb break="no"/>hibit any other demeanor or style of inter<lb break="no"/>course than that which I practice everywhere. 
     <lb/>
     On looking at the past I find satisfaction and 
     <lb/>
     comfort in the reflection that my bearing in 
     <lb/>
     the debates that have taken place here has 
     <lb/>
     been such as to enable me to meet gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on all sides in pleasant relations, and I hope 
     <lb/>
     that in the future nothing will transpire to 
     <lb/>
     alter the character in those relations. On this 
     <lb/>
     subject, sir, I cannot but express regret that 
     <lb/>
     those from whom a better example should 
     <lb/>
     have proceeded should not have preserved 
     <lb/>
     something like moderation and decorum. 
     <lb/>
     Those who are in opposition are always most 
     <lb/>
     likely to be excited, but those in charge of a 
     <lb/>
     great measure such as this, especially the 
     <lb/>
     members ot'the government of the country, 
     <lb/>
     should ever feel it incumbent upon them 
     <lb/>
     so to guard themselves in this respect that 
     <lb/>
     no one here or elsewhere can possibly offer 
     <lb/>
     an objection to the course they have pursued. 
     <lb/>
     And, sir, I feel in observing on this portion of 
     <lb/>
     the discussion, that I have reason to charge 
     <lb/>
     the Provincial Secretary with having import<lb break="no"/>ed into this debate matters which should ne<lb break="no"/>ver have been brought here. He has alluded 
     <lb/>
     to the press—that is a branch of our constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, if I may so term it, that ought not to be 
     <lb/>
     so frequently and so prominently referred to 
     <lb/>
     here. We know that on all sides and on all 
     <lb/>
     subjects political characters are apt to speak 
     <lb/>
     and write strongly and to go to those extremes 
     <lb/>
     which cannot be justified in or out of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. But in my view, it was unjust in him 
     <lb/>
     to attribute licentiousness to one portion of 
     <lb/>
     the press rather than to others, for on all sides 
     <lb/>
     we find observations, criminations, and recri<lb break="no"/>minations, which render both liable to censure. 
     <lb/>
     The less that is said in this place about the 
     <lb/>
     press the better, and with this remark I shall 
     <lb/>
     dismiss all further allusions to that branch of 
     <lb/>
     the subject. But the Provincial Secretary was 
     <lb/>
     not content with references to the press, he in<lb break="no"/>troduced into the debate other authorities and 
     <lb/>
     influences that should not have been referred 
     <lb/>
     to here. Least of all should he have brought 
     <lb/>
     here the name of that illustrious lady, the

     Queen of these realms, one whom, by virtue 
     <lb/>
     of her position no less than by the virtues that 
     <lb/>
     surround her throne, every British subject is 
     <lb/>
     bound at all times to venerate. That Sove<lb break="no"/>reign not only commands the respect of every 
     <lb/>
     subject of her Crown—her virtues are not 
     <lb/>
     alone the theme of every British lip and the 
     <lb/>
     pride of every British heart, but surrounding 
     <lb/>
     nations attest her worth and admire her exam<lb break="no"/>ple. But it is a gross breach of parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     decorum to mention that name here. Disloy<lb break="no"/>alty has been charged upon those who 
     <lb/>
     stand in opposition to the present proposition; 
     <lb/>
     as one I repel it with indignation. It is not in 
     <lb/>
     my nature, as it is not in my name, to harbour 
     <lb/>
     for an instant a disloyal sentiment. I can 
     <lb/>
     proudly appeal to the history of our country 
     <lb/>
     and ask if any who have borne the name 
     <lb/>
     which I have the honour to bear, could ever 
     <lb/>
     be supposed to be tainted with that vile 
     <lb/>
     trait? Sir, as a British subject, entitled to 
     <lb/>
     the free exercise of an undoubted right, I 
     <lb/>
     intend to deal with this question, and if, 
     <lb/>
     in doing so, any aspersion touching my loy<lb break="no"/>alty to my Sovereign be cast upon me, I 
     <lb/>
     shall hurl it back with utter contempt and tho<lb break="no"/>rough indignation upon its author. Sir, I regret, 
     <lb/>
     deeply that Her Majesty's name has been 
     <lb/>
     brought into this discussion; I do not regard 
     <lb/>
     it as of so much consequence that Her Minis<lb break="no"/>ters have been mentioned, because it is at all 
     <lb/>
     times the privilege and indeed the duty of 
     <lb/>
     every subject to criticise their acts. We have 
     <lb/>
     been told too that the Queen's representative 
     <lb/>
     in this country was in favor of the present 
     <lb/>
     measure;—sir, I attach the same importance 
     <lb/>
     and distinction to the representative of the 
     <lb/>
     crown as to the crown itself; it is Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     speaking by her properly authorized agent, 
     <lb/>
     and the rules which apply to the exclusion of 
     <lb/>
     the Queen's name from debates in Parliament 
     <lb/>
     should apply equally to the exclusion of the 
     <lb/>
     Lieut. Governor's name. We have been also 
     <lb/>
     told that the General in command and other 
     <lb/>
     distinguished individuals, civil, religious and 
     <lb/>
     military, are combined in favor of the measure. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, notwithstanding all this potential 
     <lb/>
     phalanx that is arrayed in its favor I feel that I 
     <lb/>
     am a free man, I claim the rights and attributes 
     <lb/>
     of a free man, speaking in the presence of a 
     <lb/>
     British free Assembly, I have the right to 
     <lb/>
     criticise the judgment they have formed 
     <lb/>
     and an equal right to give expression 
     <lb/>
     to my own. Therefore when this list 
     <lb/>
     of authorities is paraded before us I can<lb break="no"/>not but feel that it is an empty parade— 
     <lb/>
     it is worth nothing in my estimation—it does not 
     <lb/>
     weigh a tittle in the scale. I feel, sir, and I 
     <lb/>
     claim the right to express the sentiment, that 
     <lb/>
     those individuals, eminent though they be, are 
     <lb/>
     not more capable of forming an opinion upon 
     <lb/>
     this subject than myself, and I might add that 
     <lb/>
     my judgment is formed under the influence of 
     <lb/>
     a responsibility which does not attach to them. 
     <lb/>
     in saying this I mean no disrespect to any of 
     <lb/>
     them, and I feel well assured that none of 
     <lb/>
     them would charge me with any design of dis<lb break="no"/>respect. I therefore think that the allusions 
     <lb/>
     to which I have referred were unjust and re<lb break="no"/>prehensible attempts to influence this Assem<lb break="no"/>bly. What is the measure that we are now 
     <lb/>
     called upon to sanction? Twist it or turn it 
     <lb/>
     as you please, it is no less than a decided 
     <lb/>
     change in our constitution; and how has the 
     <lb/>
     scheme effecting that change been brought 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     here? Have the people of this country at any 
     <lb/>
     time suggested the expediency of the proposal 
     <lb/>
     to the government or to the legislature? No 
     <lb/>
     sir. This house was elected entirely independ<lb break="no"/>ent of that question—it was not before the peo<lb break="no"/>ple when we were elected. Had the case been 
     <lb/>
     otherwise we should not perhaps have seen 
     <lb/>
     the faces of some gentlemen who are sitting 
     <lb/>
     here to-day. It seems, however, that a good 
     <lb/>
     many years ago the question of a Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of the British North American Colonies 
     <lb/>
     was propounded in this house:—I would ask 
     <lb/>
     those who were present at that time whether 
     <lb/>
     it was intended to be a practical measure—a 
     <lb/>
     proposition to result in anything, or was it a 
     <lb/>
     more theoretical declaration of the abstract ad<lb break="no"/>vantages of union? No one can presume to 
     <lb/>
     say that it was anything more than the latter. 
     <lb/>
     Again, some years ago this house, by a pretty 
     <lb/>
     large majority, declared it expedient that a de<lb break="no"/>legation should proceed to England to confer 
     <lb/>
     with delegates from the neighbouring Provin<lb break="no"/>ces to ascertain whether it was not desirable 
     <lb/>
     and practicable to effect a union between the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces of British North America. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, that was a very different idea from 
     <lb/>
     that now pressed upon our attention. What 
     <lb/>
     is the condition of these Maritime Provinces? 
     <lb/>
     Their people are situated in connection with 
     <lb/>
     each other—are possessed of the same inter<lb break="no"/>ests, have the same common sympathies, resi<lb break="no"/>ding on each other's borders, and having daily 
     <lb/>
     intercourse with each other. Is that the cha<lb break="no"/>racter of the people with whom this scheme is 
     <lb/>
     to force us to unite? Why, as we know, there 
     <lb/>
     is a wilderness between the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     and Canada, we have no sympathies or inter<lb break="no"/>ests in common with the people of that coun<lb break="no"/>try. They are as much strangers to us as the 
     <lb/>
     people of West Indies. Surely those gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who talk so vociferously about disloyalty can 
     <lb/>
     have no sympathy with the people of a Colony 
     <lb/>
     in which disloyalty has been so rife as it has 
     <lb/>
     been in Canada. This House proposed a dele<lb break="no"/>gation for a union with a people with whom, 
     <lb/>
     as I have said, we had many interests in com<lb break="no"/>mon, and who, if the union were consummated, 
     <lb/>
     would form with us one homogeneous whole. 
     <lb/>
     What then happened? For some reason or other 
     <lb/>
     those charged with the authority to perform 
     <lb/>
     this duty which I have mentioned felt them<lb break="no"/>selves at liberty to disregard the authority of 
     <lb/>
     this House. They went to Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island and there they found another body of 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen from Canada,—instead of turning 
     <lb/>
     back as they should have done, and asking 
     <lb/>
     this Legislature to concent to a conference with 
     <lb/>
     delegates from that country they ignored our 
     <lb/>
     feelings and authority and went straight into 
     <lb/>
     the arms of the Canadains delegates. That 
     <lb/>
     was the first step and it was a fatal step—a 
     <lb/>
     step subversive of the powers of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, and injuries to the feelings and interests 
     <lb/>
     of the people of this country. That was the 
     <lb/>
     step which has caused so much agitation, so 
     <lb/>
     many heartburnings, if not worse, throughout 
     <lb/>
     this country. Had they come back here and 
     <lb/>
     told the people of this Province that they failed 
     <lb/>
     in their original mission, and that no Union of 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces could be effected, they 
     <lb/>
     would at least have afforded the people an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of saying how far they ware disposed 
     <lb/>
     to go into the large a question ;they did not do 
     <lb/>
     this, but they took upon themselves the whole 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of concoccting the scheme called 
     <lb/>

     Quebec scheme. Many gentlemen have hith<lb break="no"/>erto spoken of the scheme then arranged, but 
     <lb/>
     I have been surprised that long as it has been 
     <lb/>
     before scarcely one syllable has been utterd in 
     <lb/>
     this debate in referance to it. It has been 
     <lb/>
     praised abroad as a great and magnificent 
     <lb/>
     scheme, but what is its position now? "But 
     <lb/>
     yesterday it might have stood against the world, 
     <lb/>
     now none so poor to do it reverence," and it is 
     <lb/>
     here, or not here just as men may choose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We have heard something about the petitions 
     <lb/>
     presented to this house against Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     we have yet heard nothing of petitions in its 
     <lb/>
     favor. And now we are asked to deliberately 
     <lb/>
     ignore the expressed sentiments of this people : 
     <lb/>
     we are told that these petitions are to be disre<lb break="no"/>garded, and that no notice is to be taken of the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the electors. We are reminded of the 
     <lb/>
     action of the British Parliament in dealing with 
     <lb/>
     the Reform question, and we are told that that 
     <lb/>
     measure involved an important change in the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the country and no one ever con<lb break="no"/>tended that Parliament was incompotent to deal 
     <lb/>
     with it without reference to the people; but, 
     <lb/>
     will any one tell me that the questson was not 
     <lb/>
     before the people of Great Britain before the 
     <lb/>
     last General Election? That is the answer 
     <lb/>
     which I give to those who assert that this legis<lb break="no"/>lature has the right to deal with an irrevocable 
     <lb/>
     change in the Constitution, and refer to the ac<lb break="no"/>tion of the British Parliament in justification of 
     <lb/>
     the step. The subject of Reform was, as I have 
     <lb/>
     stated, before the people of England previously 
     <lb/>
     to the General Election held there, and if it had 
     <lb/>
     not been for the influence of one of the greatest 
     <lb/>
     statesmen that England ever saw, that question 
     <lb/>
     would have had more beariug on the results of 
     <lb/>
     that election than it had ; gentlemen, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     must not refer to that as any example for deny<lb break="no"/>ing to the people of this country the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of passing on the present measure. lt has in 
     <lb/>
     deed been pretended that the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country are in favor of this important step, but I 
     <lb/>
     ask gentlemen around these seats it they can say 
     <lb/>
     so consistently with the honest and deliberate 
     <lb/>
     sentiments ot their minds, unoperated upon by 
     <lb/>
     any pressure? Is there a majority here who 
     <lb/>
     will say that the majority of the people are in 
     <lb/>
     favor of the Quebec scheme ? No sir, I will not 
     <lb/>
     be content with that, I will ask is there a majo<lb break="no"/>rity of the people in favor of any union? I de<lb break="no"/>ny it, and I have some means of fortifying the 
     <lb/>
     assertion. In the course of the last two years 
     <lb/>
     since the question has been agitated in the 
     <lb/>
     country, there have been no less than three 
     <lb/>
     appeals to the constituencies of this 
     <lb/>
     Province, and they are not by any means the 
     <lb/>
     most inconsiderable of our constituencies. There 
     <lb/>
     is the county of Annapolis which for many 
     <lb/>
     years elected to a seat within these walls a gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who, without reference to politics, I 
     <lb/>
     would say was one of the first men in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, and the fact of their returning that gentle<lb break="no"/>man proves the electors of that county to be 
     <lb/>
     among the most intelligent constituencies of the 
     <lb/>
     Province. Since this question has been agita<lb break="no"/>ted that constituency has spoken, and how? 
     <lb/>
     By an immense majority it returned the present 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     member, Mr. Ray. Another constituency, one 
     <lb/>
     of the most populous and thriving in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, that of Lunenburg, was opened. Shall I 
     <lb/>
     be told that the question was not before the 
     <lb/>
     people of Lunenburg ? I heard one of the <choice><sic>rep<lb break="no"/>sesentatives</sic><corr>representatives</corr></choice> of that connty, Mr. Kaulback, say 
     <lb/>
     to yesterday, but I have in my possession tes<lb break="no"/>timony that will confirm me in the statement 
     <lb/>
     that that constituency pronounced on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion when by a very large majority they elected 
     <lb/>
     the present member, Mr. Hebb. I go then to 
     <lb/>
     the township of Yarmouth, and the gentle<lb break="no"/>men who represent that constituency need not 
     <lb/>
     be ashamed of it—for if there be a portion of 
     <lb/>
     the province in which active industry and en<lb break="no"/>terprise prevail, it is the township of Yarmouth 
     <lb/>
     Her ships are on every sea. Look abroad at all 
     <lb/>
     quarters of the globe, and you see Yarmouth 
     <lb/>
     ships and Yarmouth men. When I am told, 
     <lb/>
     then, that the opinions of this constituency are 
     <lb/>
     to be disregarded, or that their views upon this 
     <lb/>
     measure were not expressed, I feel that I must 
     <lb/>
     turn a deaf ear to such statements, because they 
     <lb/>
     are abundantly contradicted by the facts and 
     <lb/>
     circumstances. But some gentlemen argue that 
     <lb/>
     on this question, of all questions, the people 
     <lb/>
     should not be appealed to, because the people 
     <lb/>
     would decide on other issues and not on this. 
     <lb/>
     From whom does this statement come ? Does 
     <lb/>
     it not come from those who ought to use lan<lb break="no"/>guage more respectful,—language precisely the 
     <lb/>
     reverse—from the administration which the 
     <lb/>
     breath of the people has created ? It comes 
     <lb/>
     faom gentlemen who hold their offices by virtue 
     <lb/>
     of the popular voice, and yet the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>
     this country are to be told that they are incapa 
     <lb/>
     ble of pronouncing a judgment on this parti<lb break="no"/>cular question; that other subjects would be 
     <lb/>
     introduced, and that no decision could be ob<lb break="no"/>tained upon this particular subject. Have the 
     <lb/>
     peeple lost all discernment and discrimination 
     <lb/>
     that this, the most important question that ever 
     <lb/>
     agitated the public mind, is one upon which no 
     <lb/>
     reliable opinion could be formed and expressed. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, I think very differently of the people; I 
     <lb/>
     believe they would appreciate the magnitude of 
     <lb/>
     the proposition. and while they would be dis<lb break="no"/>posed to condemn much of the public conduct 
     <lb/>
     of the administration, their intelligent discern<lb break="no"/>ment would lead them to sink all other consi<lb break="no"/>derations and all other questions of policy, in 
     <lb/>
     order that upon this they might pronounce the 
     <lb/>
     decisions of their minds and hearts. It will be 
     <lb/>
     perceived that I am for submitting this ques<lb break="no"/>tion to the people. Sir, I hold that in a matter 
     <lb/>
     which concerns their interests for all time to 
     <lb/>
     come, it is our duty to them. But taking the 
     <lb/>
     argument of the other side, and supposing that 
     <lb/>
     the people are not as intelligent as I assert they 
     <lb/>
     are, there is another mode of testing their opi<lb break="no"/>nions. and that is by submitting to them the 
     <lb/>
     question of Confederation, pure and simple. 
     <lb/>
     We are told that this is not a British practice— 
     <lb/>
     that there is no precedent for this ; but I reply 
     <lb/>
     that we have on our statute book a precedent 
     <lb/>
     established by a gentleman long before the pub<lb break="no"/>lic eye, and now holding an important public 
     <lb/>
     position, I refer to the Judge in Equity. The 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="running">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY</fw>
            <fw type="num">261</fw>
            
     provisions of the Municipal Corporation Bill 
     <lb/>
     required that it should be submitted for every 
     <lb/>
     man to vote upon, favorably or otherwise, and I 
     <lb/>
     therefore maintain that we have an illustrious 
     <lb/>
     precedent for the course that we suggest. But 
     <lb/>
     if there were no precedent, I might properly in<lb break="no"/>troduce here what was improperly introduced 
     <lb/>
     the other day by the Att. General, a reference 
     <lb/>
     to the law of necessity—I would say, here is a 
     <lb/>
     case the like of which has never occurred, and for 
     <lb/>
     which there can be no precedent,—here is an 
     <lb/>
     unparalleled case, and therefore we are justified in 
     <lb/>
     establishing a precedent We can find no pre<lb break="no"/>cedent for the attempt to subvert and destroy 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of the country, and hence I 
     <lb/>
     think that in this special emergency we are not 
     <lb/>
     merely at liberty but are abundantly and impe<lb break="no"/>ratively called upon to take that course which 
     <lb/>
     will best meet the necessities of the case and 
     <lb/>
     promote the interests of the people. It lies not 
     <lb/>
     upon us who oppose this measure, but upon 
     <lb/>
     those who insist on its passage, to prove the 
     <lb/>
     necessity uncalled for by the people for taking 
     <lb/>
     away the institutions of the country. Sir, I 
     <lb/>
     was astonished when I was told yesterday that 
     <lb/>
     in addition to all the arguments that could be 
     <lb/>
     adduced in favor of Confederation the circum<lb break="no"/>stance that all the lawyers and trained politicians 
     <lb/>
     were in favor of it should be a reason for the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of the scheme without any appeal to 
     <lb/>
     them. Sir, I protest against such a doctrine, and 
     <lb/>
     the people will protest against it, and I fancy 
     <lb/>
     I can hear them say—" It is all very well for 
     <lb/>
     the lawyers and trained politicians to be in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of the measure, they are those who are to 
     <lb/>
     be most largely benefitted by the change—these 
     <lb/>
     are the men who are to be the ' upper ten.'" 
     <lb/>
     That is something like the language that they 
     <lb/>
     will use, not will it be inappropriate. But, sir, 
     <lb/>
     it is not for lawyers or for trained politicians 
     <lb/>
     that we are to act in this place. This is the 
     <lb/>
     people's house ; their interests must be the pol<lb break="no"/>ar-star of every man's action here, and this mea<lb break="no"/>sure is to affect those interests for weal or for 
     <lb/>
     woe for ever. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:MCDO6">Mr. S. McDONNEL</persName>:—I am glad we have

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPBELL</persName> continued. After the 
     <lb/>
     course which the hon and learned member has 
     <lb/>
     taken, nothing he can say will at all affect my 
     <lb/>
     sensibilities, and I think his remarks will pass 
     <lb/>
     with little notice at the hands af every one else. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, while he has suggested to my mind 
     <lb/>
     this observation upon the course which he has 
     <lb/>
     pursued, I will not suffer myself to be hurried 
     <lb/>
     into a charge against any member 
     <lb/>
     of being a traitor. I shall pursue the course 
     <lb/>
     which my conscience suggests, and leave it to 
     <lb/>
     others to settle their own course before the 
     <lb/>
     same tribunal. I hope the verdict may give 
     <lb/>
     the same satisfaction as that which I am now expe<lb break="no"/>riencing. I have referred to the necessity for 
     <lb/>
     an appeal to the people, and if I stood alone, I 
     <lb/>
     would insist on the propriety and the justice of 
     <lb/>
     that cause, But, sir, we have been told that be<lb break="no"/>cause Fenianism is rampant, and because the 
     <lb/>
     Reciprocity Treaty has been abrogated, we 
     <lb/>
     should go into Confederation. Before the Re<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
       ciprocity Treaty existed we were not confederat<lb break="no"/>ed, and l have too much faith in the industry and 
     <lb/>
     enterprise of our people to imagine that the re<lb break="no"/>peal of that treaty will materially impede our 
     <lb/>
     progress. As regards Fenianism, I am at a 
     <lb/>
     loss to see the connection between that subject 
     <lb/>
     and this. If New Brunswick be threatened, does 
     <lb/>
     any one feel it to be necessary to confederate for 
     <lb/>
     greater security ? In view of that state of 
     <lb/>
     things, I ask myself—Does the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment intend to retain these Provinces or not ? 
     <lb/>
     If they do, New Brunswick is safe—Confederation 
     <lb/>
     will not make it safer. If the United States de<lb break="no"/>sired to have possession of British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca, and Great Britain be unwilling to defend 
     <lb/>
     us, is Confederation going to save us ? We 
     <lb/>
     have heard the story about defences. Well, I 
     <lb/>
     am but a young soldier, but I cannot understand 
     <lb/>
     how on that branch of the subject any argument 
     <lb/>
     can be founded. British North America is now 
     <lb/>
     a portion of the British Empire, the people of 
     <lb/>
     these colonies owe fealty and allegiance to the 
     <lb/>
     British Crown, and while that allegiance is given 
     <lb/>
     and that fealty paid, a corresponding duty rests 
     <lb/>
     upon the British Government to afford protec<lb break="no"/>tion to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island, on the same ground as that on 
     <lb/>
     which they protect Kent, Surrey, or Middlesex, 
     <lb/>
     or any other county of the British Isles. Sir, I 
     <lb/>
     assert that Great Britain is not only bound but 
     <lb/>
     is disposed to maintain her authority in these 
     <lb/>
     countries, and to afford us protection as British 
     <lb/>
     subjects. As a Nova Scotian and as a British 
     <lb/>
     subject dwelling upon British soil, I shall be pre<lb break="no"/>pared at all times to sanction any means of co<lb break="no"/>operation with the British government to main<lb break="no"/>tain in these colonies the integrity of the British 
     <lb/>
     Empire. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been said, and truly said, that Confede<lb break="no"/>ration will not give us a man or a pound more 
     <lb/>
     than we have now. No one in this house has 
     <lb/>
     argued the question in a military point of view, 
     <lb/>
     but even arguing it in that aspect nothing can 
     <lb/>
     disturb the fact to which I have referred, that we 
     <lb/>
     would have no greater power than now, and it is 
     <lb/>
     a libel on the British Government to say that if 
     <lb/>
     we do not adopt the scheme we will be deserted. 
     <lb/>
     No sir, I believe that England would no more 
     <lb/>
     desert us in the hour of extremity than a parent 
     <lb/>
     would desert his child in the hour of danger. 
     <lb/>
     It is not the desire or intention, it has never 
     <lb/>
     been the policy of the British government to 
     <lb/>
     deal with these Provinces in any other manner 
     <lb/>
     than comported with the wishes of the people 
     <lb/>
     Reference has been made to the despatches of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Cardwell,—I wish that statesman were here 
     <lb/>
     on the floor of this House to-day to hear, as he 
     <lb/>
     would, that it is the desire of a number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and of the majority of the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country that the question should be submitted 
     <lb/>
     for their consideration at the polls. Were he 
     <lb/>
     here I feel safe in saying that as a British states<lb break="no"/>man charged with the protection of Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     subjects, he would not hesitate to command the 
     <lb/>
     government of this country to submit the mea<lb break="no"/>sure to the people. The British government, as 
     <lb/>
     I have said , have no other interest in dealing 
     <lb/>
     with us than to further our wishes. Let us go

     back to the period when the mother country gave 
     <lb/>
     us a constitution ; what was the language of the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial ministry then ? It amounted to this, 
     <lb/>
     " Only tell us what you want and you shall have 
     <lb/>
     it, you shall be governed according to the well 
     <lb/>
     understood wishes of your own people, we will 
     <lb/>
     not interfere, the constitution which you propose 
     <lb/>
     shall be the one that we will maintain." That 
     <lb/>
     constitution has continued to be ours from that 
     <lb/>
     day to this, and it is one that I will strive to 
     <lb/>
     guard. It does indeed come with a bad grace 
     <lb/>
     from men brought, I may almost say, from the 
     <lb/>
     backwoods of the country, who but for that con<lb break="no"/>stitution would never have dreamed of being 
     <lb/>
     elevated to the positions they now fill,—I say it 
     <lb/>
     comes with a bad grace from them to strike down 
     <lb/>
     the constitution from which they have derived 
     <lb/>
     such distinction. I trust that they will pause 
     <lb/>
     before doing so, and if they reflect for a moment 
     <lb/>
     upon the consequences of the present measure, 
     <lb/>
     if they reflect that when once done it cannot be 
     <lb/>
     undone, that this decree which we are called upon 
     <lb/>
     to pass will be irrevocable and irretrievable, they 
     <lb/>
     will see how great will be the evils that must en<lb break="no"/>sue. If we have a ministry that is not agreeable 
     <lb/>
     to our wishes, and that does not promote the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country, we may bear with it for a 
     <lb/>
     while, knowing that the time will come when the 
     <lb/>
     people will assert their rights and substitute bet<lb break="no"/>ter men, but in reference to this measure only 
     <lb/>
     pass it now and it will be passed forever—the 
     <lb/>
     doom of Nova Scoita will then be sealed. I 
     <lb/>
     have not said a word as to my views respecting 
     <lb/>
     union in the abstract. I find Nova Scotia a 
     <lb/>
     happy, prosperous, loyal country ; I find her on 
     <lb/>
     the high road of progress and advancement, a 
     <lb/>
     country in which every man may pursue industry 
     <lb/>
     in any branch he may select, a country enjoying 
     <lb/>
     civil and religious liberty in the largest degree, 
     <lb/>
     I find her a comparatively untaxed country, en<lb break="no"/>joying blessings and advantages not to be found 
     <lb/>
     in any other country beneath the sun, and these 
     <lb/>
     are to be lost or to be perilled for what ? Where 
     <lb/>
     is the necessity for the change ? Until I can see 
     <lb/>
     some greater necessity than I now see, my ban 
     <lb/>
     ner shall be Nova Scotia for Nova Scotians, my 
     <lb/>
     device shall be that the privileges we now enjoy 
     <lb/>
     shall be maintained inviolate. At present "I 
     <lb/>
     seek no change, and least of all such a change as 
     <lb/>
     this would bring us." Mr. Speaker, I hold in 
     <lb/>
     my hand a resolution which I intend to offer in 
     <lb/>
     vindication of my position. I trust it will meet 
     <lb/>
     with the concurrence of a large number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This resolution recites among other matters 
     <lb/>
     the fact that an unauthorized conference was 
     <lb/>
     held at Quebec. It further recites the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, and generally covers the ground and ante<lb break="no"/>cedents of the present question. In reference to 
     <lb/>
     the present condition of the Province—I mean 
     <lb/>
     the present crisis of alarm and danger—I would 
     <lb/>
     ask in what position would every man who truly 
     <lb/>
     loved his country desire to see her stand ? He 
     <lb/>
     would desire to see his countrymen one in heart, 
     <lb/>
     and hand in hand, without any question agitating 
     <lb/>
     their minds in connection with political consid<lb break="no"/>erations. Our people, especially at the present 
     <lb/>
     moment, should have but one object in view,— 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     to arrest the common danger and save the com<lb break="no"/>mon country. At such a crisis it is above all 
     <lb/>
     things necessary, just, and wise, that there should 
     <lb/>
     be but one sentiment abroad—that of loyalty to 
     <lb/>
     the British Crown, and that of a determination 
     <lb/>
     to sustain the integrity of the British Empire. 
     <lb/>
     It is because an agitation such as this measure 
     <lb/>
     is inducing will produce consequences of an un<lb break="no"/>favorable character, consequences affecting the 
     <lb/>
     regard of the people for the institutions under 
     <lb/>
     which they live, and dividing their power to resist 
     <lb/>
     an enemy, if an enemy should venture an attack; 
     <lb/>
     it is because, in addition to the other objections 
     <lb/>
     which I have stated that I am apprehensive of such 
     <lb/>
     results as these, that I ask this house to pause 
     <lb/>
     before they consummate a union which the peo<lb break="no"/>ple do not desire—one in fact against which 
     <lb/>
     they have petitioned, and that at a time when 
     <lb/>
     they should be found warm in their allegiance, 
     <lb/>
     as united as one man to protect the soil on

     which they live and upon which they hope to 
     <lb/>
     die. In opposing this perilous consummation, I 
     <lb/>
     am discharging my duty to my constituents, to 
     <lb/>
     myself, and to the country at large. I do trust, 
     <lb/>
     that wedded though some gentlemen in high 
     <lb/>
     position maybe to this measure, the house, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the present danger, will stop at the point 
     <lb/>
     of consummation of this act. It may matter not 
     <lb/>
     to me individually what the decision of this 
     <lb/>
     house may be; it may be that in the changes of 
     <lb/>
     political life, when the term of this Legislature 
     <lb/>
     expires, I may not be found again within these 
     <lb/>
     walls, or have the ambition to seek another 
     <lb/>
     county for the advancement of my position—but 
     <lb/>
     there are those behind us whose interests to all 
     <lb/>
     futurity are involved, and in their name I beseech 
     <lb/>
     the Government of the country, the constitution<lb break="no"/>al guardians of the people, to pause, ere they 
     <lb/>
     force upon a loyal population a scheme against 
     <lb/>
     which the country is arrayed, and which must 
     <lb/>
     inevitably engender feelings which will militate 
     <lb/>
     in all time to come with the true interests of 
     <lb/>
     that common country within whose borders it is 
     <lb/>
     our pride and privilege to dwell. Entertaining 
     <lb/>
     these opinions, I offer for the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     the house the following amendment ;—

     <persName ref="pers:HAMI1">Dr. HAMILTON</persName> said:—If ever there was a 
     <lb/>
     question of magnitude before the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     it is the one which is now under discussion. 
     <lb/>
     I would have wished that this question had 
     <lb/>
     been discussed more on its own merits, but un<lb break="no"/>fortunately it has assumed a party aspect to a 
     <lb/>
     large extent, and a great deal of irrelevant 
     <lb/>
     mater has been introduced. It is a subject 
     <lb/>
     which has agitated the public mind for a length 
     <lb/>
     of time, thougth it has never assumed so serious 
     <lb/>
     an aspect as at present. There are two or three 
     <lb/>
     points in which this question may be viewed. 
     <lb/>
     I will say first that any question should be 
     <lb/>
     considered first in reference to its merits, and 
     <lb/>
     again in connection with the partiess who are 
     <lb/>
     in favour or are opposed to it. There is <hi rendition="simple:italic">now</hi> 
     <lb/>
     some ground upon which to base an argu- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     or there is not. In all the discussions that I 
     <lb/>
     have heard since this question has been up 
     <lb/>
     there are few persons who have taken that 
     <lb/>
     stand upon it which it appears to me its merits 
     <lb/>
     demand. As one of the people of Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, as one having an interest in its welfare, in 
     <lb/>
     every particular, 1 would like to see the ques<lb break="no"/>tion settled on its own merits for the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     this Province as well as of all British North 
     <lb/>
     America. It is one which not only affects us 
     <lb/>
     at the present time, but for our future for weal 
     <lb/>
     and woe. Consequently a hasty decision or 
     <lb/>
     an improper action might be calculated to in<lb break="no"/>jure this Province irremediably. It is true the 
     <lb/>
     question has been before the public for some 
     <lb/>
     time. It has been discussed since the dele<lb break="no"/>gation returned from Canada, as well as in the 
     <lb/>
     Press, though not in that intelligent and de<lb break="no"/>liberate manner necessary to enable the peo<lb break="no"/>ple to come to a fair and honest conclusion. 
     <lb/>
     We are here as a part and parcel of the 
     <lb/>
     British Empire—lying between the Atlantic 
     <lb/>
     and the Pacific—and we must be very ma<lb break="no"/>terially aflected by whatever position the ques<lb break="no"/>tion assumes in the future. In considering this 
     <lb/>
     question, we must not look at it in its pounds, 
     <lb/>
     shillings and pence view only, but in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with our duties to the British Empire. 
     <lb/>
     Changes are continually going on in the world, 
     <lb/>
     in reference to political questions more espe<lb break="no"/>cially. We find that the constitution which 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia had some thirty or forty years ago, 
     <lb/>
     cannot be that of the present day. Refinement, 
     <lb/>
     education, and the resources of the province, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     are daily and gradually improving—we have to 
     <lb/>
     pass and amend laws continually, as the coun<lb break="no"/>try progresses. I regret that this question 
     <lb/>
     should have assumed the party aspect it has. 
     <lb/>
     Like Education, it should be kept free from 
     <lb/>
     anything that may give it a party character, 
     <lb/>
     and should be determined in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the best interests of the people. The future of 
     <lb/>
     these Provinces, as consolidated, has been fully 
     <lb/>
     portrayed by a great number of gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     have preceded me and spoken on the subject, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore it will not be necessary for me to 
     <lb/>
     deal with that part of the question. It is true 
     <lb/>
     that Nova Scotia is a choice little province, and 
     <lb/>
     has got along very well for the last fifty years, 
     <lb/>
     and I would be quite content to let things go on 
     <lb/>
     as they are, if I had a guarantee of their con<lb break="no"/>tinuance. Whilst we have not this guarantee, 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary to prepare for any emergency 
     <lb/>
     that may arise. If the Provinces were con<lb break="no"/>solidated into one empire—perhaps that term 
     <lb/>
     is too extensive—or a Confederation, we would 
     <lb/>
     have unity of action, design and sentiment. If 
     <lb/>
     that would be the result we would have union 
     <lb/>
     which is strength, population which is wealth, 
     <lb/>
     and knowledge which is power. I think a con<lb break="no"/>federation of British North America might be 
     <lb/>
     so arranged and so adapted to our wants and 
     <lb/>
     circumstances that their combination would be 
     <lb/>
     brought about to benefit the whole. I will sun- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     pose that the United States had remained dif<lb break="no"/>ferent and independent States, and had not uni<lb break="no"/>ted, what would have been the result? Would 
     <lb/>
     the 13 States he the 32 United States with all 
     <lb/>
     the power and influence that they now exercise 
     <lb/>
     under the one government managed by one gene<lb break="no"/>ral legislature—with identity of interest, pur<lb break="no"/>pose and design. If each had chosen its own 
     <lb/>
     president—its own representatives—arranged 
     <lb/>
     its own trade relations, customs. and revenues 
     <lb/>
     would not the state of things on this continent 
     <lb/>
     present a very different aspect at this present 
     <lb/>
     time. I want to know if Massachusetts could 
     <lb/>
     have become the great manufacturing state she 
     <lb/>
     now is, if the hostile tariffs and arrangements 
     <lb/>
     that exist between the States were in force The 
     <lb/>
     question has been asked if we have territory 
     <lb/>
     enough to form a Confederation. As far as 
     <lb/>
     territory is concerned, extending from the At<lb break="no"/>lantic to the Pacific, and from 42 degrees to the 
     <lb/>
     North Pole, British North America is much 
     <lb/>
     larger than the present United States, and is 
     <lb/>
     under British control. I think that this terri<lb break="no"/>tory is enough to form a small kingdom to con<lb break="no"/>nection with the British Empire. I don't 
     <lb/>
     think I can do better than to read an extract 
     <lb/>
     from a work, speaking of the territory that 
     <lb/>
     would form the proposed Confederation.

     4. Sir, the first question which we men of the 
     <lb/>
     North must put to ourselves is, Have we a territory 
     <lb/>
     large enough of which to form a nation? At the risk 
     <lb/>
     of travelling over some of the ground trodden over 
     <lb/>
     yesterday by the learned member for Annapolis. I 
     <lb/>
     think it can be shown that we have. Beneath, be<lb break="no"/>hind, and around us, stretching away from the At<lb break="no"/>lantic to the Pacific. All Europe, with its family of 
     <lb/>
     nations, contains but three million seven hundred 
     <lb/>
     and eight thousand, or two hundred and ninety-two 
     <lb/>
     thousand miles less. The United States include three 
     <lb/>
     hundred and thirty thousand five hundred and seven<lb break="no"/>ty-two square miles, or seven hundred and sixty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     nine thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight less 
     <lb/>
     than British America. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     5. We North americans, living under the British 
     <lb/>
     flag, have one-ninth of the whole, and this ought to 
     <lb/>
     give us " ample room and verge enough" for the ac<lb break="no"/>commodation and support of a countless population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     6. The great Province of Canada is equal in size to 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, France, and Prussia. Charmed by 
     <lb/>
     her classic recollections, how apt are we to magnify 
     <lb/>
     every thing in the Old World, and to imagine that 
     <lb/>
     Providence has been kind to her alone. Yet the 
     <lb/>
     noble St. Lawrence is equal in proportion to the Nile 
     <lb/>
     —the great granary of the East which, from the days 
     <lb/>
     of patriarchs, has fed millions with its produce. Take 
     <lb/>
     the Italian's Po, the Frenchman's Rhone, the Eng<lb break="no"/>lishman's Thames, the German's Rhine, and Span<lb break="no"/>iard's Tagus, and roll them into a stream equal to the 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence The great lakes of Canada are larger 
     <lb/>
     in volume than the Caspian Sea; and the Gulf of St. 
     <lb/>
     Lawrence (with which we are so familiar that we for<lb break="no"/>get what it is), contains a surface of one hundred 
     <lb/>
     thousand square miles, and is as large as the Black 
     <lb/>
     Sea, on which the proud fleets of four hostile nations 
     <lb/>
     may at this very moment be engaged. Accustomed 
     <lb/>
     to think and feel as Colonists, it is difficult for us to 
     <lb/>
     imagine that the Baltic, illustrated by Nelson's 
     <lb/>
     achievements and Campbell's verse, is not something 
     <lb/>
     different from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and yet it is 
     <lb/>
     not. Its dimensions are about the same; its climate 
     <lb/>
     rigourous; its coast originally sterile, and the sea 
     <lb/>
     kings and warriors who came out of it, made of no 
     <lb/>
     better stuff than are the men who shoot seals on the 
     <lb/>
     ice flakes of Newfoundland, till farms on the green 
     <lb/>
     hills of Pictou, or fell trees in the forests of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick."

            <p>
     I think it would not require anything more 
     <lb/>
     from me to show that there is territory enough to 
     <lb/>
     make a nation, which I trust, if it does come to 
     <lb/>
     that—will be ruled by the mild sway of Queen 
     <lb/>
     Victoria. In this extensive territory we have a 
     <lb/>
     great many natural advantages—we have agri<lb break="no"/>cultural capabilities, we have forests and the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, iron, coal and gold, and a variety of 
     <lb/>
     other sources of wealth. It is water power, coal 
     <lb/>
     and iron that enable a country to excel in ma<lb break="no"/>nufactures. We have spread all over the face 
     <lb/>
     of the country these substantial elements to 
     <lb/>
     make a people great. I need not speak of the 
     <lb/>
     harbours bars and rivers, for they are innumer<lb break="no"/>able. There is no more healthy climte in the 
     <lb/>
     world than we have in British North America. 
     <lb/>
     We are away from the fever of the South; and 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     it is true we have cold, severe winter in many 
     <lb/>
     parts of the Provinces, but, at the same time, it 
     <lb/>
     always invigorates the body and improves the 
     <lb/>
     activity of the mind, and renders the people who 
     <lb/>
     occupy this territory equal in physical vigor 
     <lb/>
     and mental power to those of any portion 
     <lb/>
     of the world I might refer you to statistical 
     <lb/>
     tables to shew the health of the country, but I 
     <lb/>
     do not wish to weary you. In this territory we 
     <lb/>
     have about 4,000,000 of population, rapidly in<lb break="no"/>creasing. That population consists of farmers, 
     <lb/>
     fishermen and miners, seamen, lumbermen, &amp;c., 
     <lb/>
     who are well calculated to bring to fruition all 
     <lb/>
     the various resources which are necessary for 
     <lb/>
     our support and happiness. There are no con<lb break="no"/>flicting interests between these Provinces. Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia has fishing, mining and agricultural capa 
     <lb/>
     bilities. New Brunswick is agricultural and 
     <lb/>
     lumbering; Canada the same; P. E. Island is 
     <lb/>
     purely agricultaral; Newfoundland is a fishing 
     <lb/>
     community; therefore you have in these Provin<lb break="no"/>ces the various elements that constitutc great<lb break="no"/>ness, and the Union will combine these elements. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore an interchange of commodities would 
     <lb/>
     take place from time to time, as circumstances 
     <lb/>
     require it. There are various objections urged 
     <lb/>
     to a Union with Canada. One is, because she 
     <lb/>
     rebelled in 1837, or rather manifested a rebellious 
     <lb/>
     spirit. I do not like to see that spirit, but if 
     <lb/>
     there was not something of the same kind in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, there was at least a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     excitement and feeling manifested when Canada 
     <lb/>
     assumed the position she did. In view, however, 
     <lb/>
     of the many evidences of loyalty that Canada 
     <lb/>
     has exhibited in times past, it is hardly worth 
     <lb/>
     while to charge upon her that, many years since 
     <lb/>
     she was dissatisfied in consequence of the exist<lb break="no"/>ence of political grievances. Canada, we are 
     <lb/>
     told again, is greatly in debt. If she has an 
     <lb/>
     amount of debt which is greater than that of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia at the present day, but not equal 
     <lb/>
     to that of New Brunswick in comparison with 
     <lb/>
     their respective populations, she has an amount 
     <lb/>
     of wealth to show for it that perhaps no other 
     <lb/>
     Province amoung the whole can show. I think 
     <lb/>
     the debt of Canada is about $21.60 a head; in 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick it is $23. Nova Scotia is get<lb break="no"/>ting fast on to the stage that Canada has reached. 
     <lb/>
     The last estimate was $16 or $17. By the time 
     <lb/>
     all her public works are completed, she will have 
     <lb/>
     as large a debt as Canada, but whether she will 
     <lb/>
     have as much to show for it as Canada is quite 
     <lb/>
     another question. With regard to thc product<lb break="no"/>ive wealth of Canada, there are no less than 
     <lb/>
     500,000 persons who cultivate the soil directly 
     <lb/>
     or indirectly There are 237,654 persons who 
     <lb/>
     own and occupy farms. The value of the farms 
     <lb/>
     is put down at $464,322,217. The value of pro<lb break="no"/>ducts annually raised is no less than $100,000,000. 
     <lb/>
     She has 2000miles of railway,216 miles of canals, 
     <lb/>
     valued at $16,000,000. She has 40 colleges, with 
     <lb/>
     8,000 students; 8,000 Grammar and Common 
     <lb/>
     Schools, educating 500,000 pupils, and the mos: 
     <lb/>
     perfect system of education in the world. If 
     <lb/>
     this is a country that is dangerous to unite 
     <lb/>
     with, it appears to me that the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     around these benches misunderstand the resour<lb break="no"/>ces and state of Canada at the present time. In 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">265</fw>
           
     Canada every fifth person is at school—in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia one-tenth,—that is, under the old law. 
     <lb/>
     The per centage of education in Canada is greater 
     <lb/>
     than that in New York, Massachusetts, or Penn<lb break="no"/>sylvania. I think, therefore, that those who un<lb break="no"/>dertake to say that Canada is a country not 
     <lb/>
     to be desired—that we cannot either properly or 
     <lb/>
     judiciously unite with her—have not taken the 
     <lb/>
     trouble to inform themselves upon these facts 
     <lb/>
     that are within their reach. The greatest misre<lb break="no"/>presentation has been sent to the country by the 
     <lb/>
     Anti-Union press concerning Canada. Not a 
     <lb/>
     fight occurs, not a train runs off the track and 
     <lb/>
     kills one or two persons in that Province but it 
     <lb/>
     it is blazoned forth in that press ; but you 
     <lb/>
     hear nothing of the great capabilities of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and the surplus of crops and revenue.— 
     <lb/>
     With regard to the subject of Union and the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec scheme, I shall only remark on one or 
     <lb/>
     two points, for the whole subject has been al<lb break="no"/>ready most fully and ably discussed. Some 15 
     <lb/>
     years ago the hon. member for East Halifax in<lb break="no"/>troduced a bill to provide for representation by 
     <lb/>
     population; but I think nothing was done with 
     <lb/>
     it. A few years afterwards it was introduced 
     <lb/>
     again. We had a very unequal representation : 
     <lb/>
     Queens with her population 9,000 had as 
     <lb/>
     large a representation as Pictou with her 29, 
     <lb/>
     000 people. Hants had five, Annapolis three, 
     <lb/>
     and Kings four members, with nearly an equal 
     <lb/>
     population. This discrepancy could not be 
     <lb/>
     accounted for on any just principle This state 
     <lb/>
     of things has been the result of the progress of 
     <lb/>
     time Whenever a dead-lock occurred between 
     <lb/>
     parties, and government necessities demanded 
     <lb/>
     it, the representation of some particular county 
     <lb/>
     was increased. It will be remembered what a 
     <lb/>
     hue and cry was raised when a bill was intro<lb break="no"/>duced by the present Judge in Equity to a ter 
     <lb/>
     and equalize the representation of the country. 
     <lb/>
     My own opinion is that there is no other true 
     <lb/>
     principle than representation by population It 
     <lb/>
     has been said that wealth should be the basis. 
     <lb/>
     When discussing this question with a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who has since passed away, I asked him: as 
     <lb/>
     Halifax has an amount of wealth equal to Lu<lb break="no"/>nenhurg, Queens, Shelburne, Yarmouth and 
     <lb/>
     Digby combined would you give her the same 
     <lb/>
     representation that all these counties have? 
     <lb/>
     Certainly you would not Take production 
     <lb/>
     again. I might bring statistics to show that 
     <lb/>
     there is more production in Antigonishe than 
     <lb/>
     in any other county in the province, according 
     <lb/>
     to her population. Guysboro is another county 
     <lb/>
     which produces very heavily in fish, etc. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I cannot see that it is possible to 
     <lb/>
     base representation upon any other principle 
     <lb/>
     than population. My attention has been turned 
     <lb/>
     to this subject ever since the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Halifax introduced the bill I spoke of, 
     <lb/>
     and I have come to this conclusion. If you 
     <lb/>
     form a union with the other provinces, on what 
     <lb/>
     other principle can you base it? You coulp 
     <lb/>
     not base it on wealth, or production, or territory. 
     <lb/>
     Population is the only true and safe principle. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, so far as that principle in the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     scheme is concerned, it has my hearty co<lb break="no"/>operation.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
         <cb/>
            <p>
     With regard to the financial part of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme that has been so fully and ably dealt with 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Archibald and other gentlemen who are 
     <lb/>
     generally considered <hi rendition="simple:italic">au fait</hi> with figures, that it 
     <lb/>
     would be idle for me to say anything on the 
     <lb/>
     subject A great deal has been said on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, and were I to compare all the calculations 
     <lb/>
     that have been made, you would see what a di<lb break="no"/>versity of opinion exists Take the resources 
     <lb/>
     of Canada and divide it into population, and do 
     <lb/>
     the same with Nova Scotia or any other of the 
     <lb/>
     Colonies, and you will find pretty much the 
     <lb/>
     same result—only a few cents difference. Take 
     <lb/>
     the expenses of the government, and you find 
     <lb/>
     very much the same thing. Canada is obliged 
     <lb/>
     to collect a large amount of revenue on certain 
     <lb/>
     articles of importation, for she manufactures 
     <lb/>
     more largely than we do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I shall now turn your attention to another fea<lb break="no"/>ture in this question. Let me sup ose that there 
     <lb/>
     is an individual desperately sick. The physician 
     <lb/>
     attending him feels hardly able to grapple with 
     <lb/>
     the disease alone, and calls in assistance. The 
     <lb/>
     physicians then hold a consultation, but they may 
     <lb/>
     disagree. How are they to settle the difficulty ? 
     <lb/>
     They will consult the best authorities on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion and the men who have written and given the 
     <lb/>
     results of their experience, and the issue is that 
     <lb/>
     the weight of authority carries the day. The 
     <lb/>
     same thing may be said in respect to a Court of 
     <lb/>
     Law. The Judges consult the authorities, and 
     <lb/>
     bring to bear all the examples relating to the 
     <lb/>
     case, and decide accordingly. I do not wish to 
     <lb/>
     draw any invidious comparisons between indivi<lb break="no"/>duals, but I would ask who have advocated Con<lb break="no"/>federation in Nova Scotia. We find on the list 
     <lb/>
     the late R. J. Uniacke, the present Judge in Equi<lb break="no"/>ty, Mr. Howe, the Chief Justice, the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, Mr Archibald, Hon. Mr. Henry, Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. McCully, Hon. Mr. Ritchie, and others I 
     <lb/>
     need not now name. Here is an array of men 
     <lb/>
     who have occupied a very prominent position in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia ; every one of these gentlemen have 
     <lb/>
     expressed themselves in favor of Union, and no 
     <lb/>
     better authorities can be cited than they. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe said, years ago, it was the dream of his 
     <lb/>
     boyhood and the purpose of his political life but I 
     <lb/>
     am told that it was only a theory with him— 
     <lb/>
     theory generally precedes practice. Now is the 
     <lb/>
     time to put that theory into practice—never was 
     <lb/>
     there a more auspicuous period to do so than now. 
     <lb/>
     When I say that the most eminent men in this 
     <lb/>
     Province have supported, and are supporting 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, I need hardly add that the same 
     <lb/>
     thing may be fairly stated of the other Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Whom have we in opposition to this scheme ? 
     <lb/>
     We have the hon. member for Guysboro, who 
     <lb/>
     may be presumed to be the leader of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion since he introduced the amendment to the 
     <lb/>
     original resolution. We have Mr. Jones, Mr 
     <lb/>
     Andrew Uniacke, and two or three other gentle<lb break="no"/>men in Halifax. I do not wish to make any in<lb break="no"/>vidious comparisons between these gentlemen. 
     <lb/>
     lf you can produce an array of talent against 
     <lb/>
     Confederation like what I have given as support<lb break="no"/>ing it, I would like to hear of it. I will merely 
     <lb/>
     say that from the year 1834 up to the present 
     <lb/>
     time I have been a reader of the " Nova Scotian" 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="266" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1866-04-17_Page_266.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">266</fw>
            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
          
     and " Morning Chronicle," and I must confess 
     <lb/>
     that if I have been impressed in favour of Confe<lb break="no"/>deration it has been from perusing the able and 
     <lb/>
     eloquent writings and speeches of Mr. Howe on 
     <lb/>
     the subject Mr. Howe's opposition cannot now 
     <lb/>
     effect anything, he cannot wipe away the princi<lb break="no"/>ples to establish which he has devoted his whole 
     <lb/>
     public life. It will be remembered that, some 
     <lb/>
     time ago, he wrote a letter denying that he had 
     <lb/>
     written anything on the subject of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I have always entertained the opinion 
     <lb/>
     that he has been opposing the scheme from its 
     <lb/>
     very inception by the present government. I 
     <lb/>
     have read his productions so long, that I can de<lb break="no"/>tect them anywhere. If he would come out un<lb break="no"/>der his own name. and oppose the scheme fairly 
     <lb/>
     and honorably, I would respect him much more 
     <lb/>
     than I can possibly under present circumstances. 
     <lb/>
     He said he had not written a line to any one, ex<lb break="no"/>cept to his wife A gentleman told me that he 
     <lb/>
     saw an article that was corrected by Mr. Howe's 
     <lb/>
     own hand; and yet a short time before he pub<lb break="no"/>lished a letter in "The Reporter" which was copied 
     <lb/>
     generally by the press, stating that he had not 
     <lb/>
     written an article for several months. I received 
     <lb/>
     a letter last night from a friend of mine in the 
     <lb/>
     country, who writes that he hopes the House will 
     <lb/>
     adopt Confederation. He is one of the most in<lb break="no"/>fluential men in my own county, and has been an 
     <lb/>
     admirer of Mr. Howe, but he speaks in the strong<lb break="no"/>est terms against the course pursued by that gen<lb break="no"/>tleman on this question. I met a gentleman last 
     <lb/>
     night from Cornwallis, and I asked him what was 
     <lb/>
     the feeling in Kings. " Mr. Howe has done two 
     <lb/>
     things," was the reply; "he has cemented the 
     <lb/>
     Conservatives to a man, and has divided the pro<lb break="no"/>gressive Liberals from those who are opposed to 
     <lb/>
     union and progress." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As respects the hon. member for East Halifax, 
     <lb/>
     he has been on both sides of this question. He 
     <lb/>
     puts me in mind of the boy who complained to 
     <lb/>
     his mother that Bill took all his portion of the 
     <lb/>
     bed out of the middle, and he had to lie on both 
     <lb/>
     sides. I regret that he should have introduced 
     <lb/>
     into this debate the reference he made to the 
     <lb/>
     Queen, to the representative of Majesty, and to 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Geo. Brown. It is not necessary to refer 
     <lb/>
     to the papers that support Confederation. It has 
     <lb/>
     been said that clergymen have no right to deal 
     <lb/>
     with matters like this. Clergymen, I contend, 
     <lb/>
     exercise their legitimate functions when they in<lb break="no"/>struct their people in an important crisis. There<lb break="no"/>fore I believe that the religious press is only per<lb break="no"/>forming its duty in discussing this question and 
     <lb/>
     advising the people on the subject. Temperate 
     <lb/>
     and argumentative articles have appeared in its 
     <lb/>
     columns, and no fault can be found with it for 
     <lb/>
     pursuing this course. As respects the secular 
     <lb/>
     press, the weight of authority is ln favor of Con<lb break="no"/>federation. The only influential press that op<lb break="no"/>poses the measure is the Chronicle, and we all 
     <lb/>
     know the inconsistent and extraordinary course 
     <lb/>
     it has pursued. Therefore, whether you take 
     <lb/>
     the leading presses or the ablest minds in the 
     <lb/>
     country, you find the overwhelming weight of 
     <lb/>
     authority in favor of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have had consultation with many leading 
     <lb/>
     men in my own County and they have said that 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     they believe the time has. come to adopt Union.— 
     <lb/>
     As respects the question of an appeal to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, that has been very effectually settled by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blanchard and the circumstance which was 
     <lb/>
     brought to the notice of the House by the hon 
     <lb/>
     member for Guysboro does not apply at all. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Johnston succeeded after a great deal exer<lb break="no"/>tion, in passing the Municipal Incorporation Bill 
     <lb/>
     through the Legislature, but it was with the pro<lb break="no"/>viso that it should be left to the acceptance or re<lb break="no"/>jection by the people. That was the clog put on 
     <lb/>
     it by the Liberal Government. The only two 
     <lb/>
     Wards in Kings that adopted it were those where 
     <lb/>
     meetings were held and the question was fully dis<lb break="no"/>cussed. An important change took place some 
     <lb/>
     years ago in reference to Government when the 
     <lb/>
     Departmental System was introduced I do not 
     <lb/>
     remember that it was submitted to the polls. I 
     <lb/>
     believe the peoples' representatives have the right 
     <lb/>
     to judge of the matter themselves. It will be re<lb break="no"/>membered that the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Morning Chronicle's</hi> second 
     <lb/>
     exposition of a well known despatch from the 
     <lb/>
     Col Secretary was, that it meant "the well un<lb break="no"/>derstood wishes" of the educated portion of the 
     <lb/>
     people as expressed by their representatives." As<lb break="no"/>suming this to be correct, I think it would be 
     <lb/>
     found that if the present question was submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the polls, we would not get "the well under<lb break="no"/>stood wishes of the more intelligent portion of 
     <lb/>
     the community, as this question would be mixed 
     <lb/>
     up with the school bill, and other matters con<lb break="no"/>nected with the government of the day I believe 
     <lb/>
     the people have the right, not only to discuss 
     <lb/>
     questions of public policy at meetings held for 
     <lb/>
     that purpose, but they have the right of petition<lb break="no"/>ing. I see by the papers that they have been 
     <lb/>
     holding a meeting at Canning for the purpose of' 
     <lb/>
     discussing this question. This is not the first one 
     <lb/>
     held there. Being a native of the County I re<lb break="no"/>present, and for upwards of thirty years a pratice 
     <lb/>
     tioner of medicine in Canning and vicinity, I 
     <lb/>
     ought to know the people pretty well, and while 
     <lb/>
     I must acknowledge having received a great deal 
     <lb/>
     of kindness and professional support there, as well 
     <lb/>
     as having very warm political supporters, but there 
     <lb/>
     is no place int he North Riding where political feel<lb break="no"/>ings are carried to a greater extent than in Can<lb break="no"/>ning, and consequently where I have stronger 
     <lb/>
     political opponents. There is no difficulty at any 
     <lb/>
     time in getting up a political meeting in Canning, 
     <lb/>
     especially when the subject appears to affect party 
     <lb/>
     interests. I believe this meeting was suggested 
     <lb/>
     by parties in Halifax for the purpose of influen<lb break="no"/>cing the votes of the members for North Kings 
     <lb/>
     on the subject of Confederation. I have some 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the mode of getting up and circula<lb break="no"/>ting petitions, and do not think that petitions can 
     <lb/>
     always be looked upon as the exact exponent of 
     <lb/>
     public sentiment. Many persons are careless 
     <lb/>
     about the matter and allow their names to be 
     <lb/>
     placed there without considering the subject, 
     <lb/>
     especially when no pecuniary interests are at 
     <lb/>
     stake. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     New Brunswick has been referred to in this de<lb break="no"/>bate. All I can say is there has been a great 
     <lb/>
     change in the public sentiment of that Province 
     <lb/>

       federate ; Fredericton, for instance, returned Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fisher by an overwhelming majority. This 
     <lb/>
     change must occur wherever the question is fairly 
     <lb/>
     and temperately viewed and discussed. There is 
     <lb/>
     no use denying the fact that the time has come 
     <lb/>
     when we should unite ; everything that is trans<lb break="no"/>piring around us points to that result, I have not 
     <lb/>
     come to a hasty determination to support this re<lb break="no"/>solution on. This question is like a jug of yeast 
     <lb/>
     it must. go through a certain amount of ferment ; 
     <lb/>
     but it will come out all right in the end. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe, and Mr. Annand, who are now opposing 
     <lb/>
     this measure, would be the first to put their 
     <lb/>
     shoulder to the wheel and carry Confederation, it 
     <lb/>
     they could come into office tomorrow. Under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances I do not feel disposed to 
     <lb/>
     stand in the way of a question that mist come 
     <lb/>
     sooner or later These are the convicrions of my 
     <lb/>
     own mind. It is not because I feel disposed to 
     <lb/>
     occupy any preferment. If the House were dis<lb break="no"/>solved tomorrow I should not regret if I went 
     <lb/>
     home and never returned to public life. I often 
     <lb/>
     wish I had never studied or paid any attention to 
     <lb/>
     political history; it only keeps a person constantly 
     <lb/>
     perplexed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me here. mention what struck my obser<lb break="no"/>vation on a visit I paid to Canada last autumn. I 
     <lb/>
     travelled some 3000 miles and attended two Pub<lb break="no"/>lic Exhibitions. I was much gratified by what I 
     <lb/>
     saw of the great manufacturers Some of the most 
     <lb/>
     delicate surgical instruments are manufactured in 
     <lb/>
     that province. Agricultural Implements are large<lb break="no"/>ly produced in the country. The cloth manu<lb break="no"/>facturers are far beyond anything I had expected 
     <lb/>
     to see. I attended a ploughing match, and there 
     <lb/>
     saw some 102 teams enter for competition ; 
     <lb/>
     tully 6000 persons were present. Never in the 
     <lb/>
     course of my life did I see such excellent work, 
     <lb/>
     but what surprised the particularly was the fact 
     <lb/>
     that I saw a host of boys discussing the merits of 
     <lb/>
     the ploughing. When boys took such an inter<lb break="no"/>est as that in ploughing, 1 thought there need be 
     <lb/>
     no fears as to future agricultural operations in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Whilst in the Province I mixed as 
     <lb/>
     much as I could with the people, for I wished to 
     <lb/>
     learn all I could about Canada's industrial 
     <lb/>
     resources, the intelligence of the people, and 
     <lb/>
     especially her fruit culture. When persons 
     <lb/>
     found 1 was from the Lower Provinces, they 
     <lb/>
     would ask me, " What are you afraid of ? Why 
     <lb/>
     do the Lower Provinces oppose the Union with 
     <lb/>
     us." I must say that from what I saw of the 
     <lb/>
     Agriculturalists they are a very desirable class 
     <lb/>
     of people to associate with. Under all the circum<lb break="no"/>stances I cannot thlnk we have any reason to fear 
     <lb/>
     a union with the flourishing province of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     On the contrary I believe that Nova Scotia will be 
     <lb/>
     largely benetitted by the consolidation of all the 
     <lb/>
     Provinces of British North America under one 
     <lb/>
     government and under the protection of ille 
     <lb/>
     British Empire.

     They are closely identified in interest and feel<lb break="no"/>ing with the inhabitants of the other portions

     of the Province, are known far and wide, as 
     <lb/>
     well as in this country, for their industry and 
     <lb/>
     enterprise, were the first pioneers in one of 
     <lb/>
     our great industrial pursuits— one that has 
     <lb/>
     done more to elevate our position and make 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, known far and wide than any 
     <lb/>
     other. This Message is sent to me by these. 
     <lb/>
     To protest in their behalf a aiust a Union of 
     <lb/>
     this Province with Canada, elieving as they 
     <lb/>
     do, that such a. measure will demoralizethe 
     <lb/>
     people, alienate their affections from Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain and endanger British institutions- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     transfer our revenues into the hands of stran<lb break="no"/>gers, disarrange financial affairs, and jeopar<lb break="no"/>dize our local improvements. We, as the old<lb break="no"/>est colony of British North America, have en<lb break="no"/>joyed a Legislative Assembly for over one hun<lb break="no"/>dred and Responsible Government for 20 
     <lb/>
     years, with full liberty to levy and appropriate 
     <lb/>
     taxes; and to deprive us of these privileges, as 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the resolution, they believe to bo 
     <lb/>
     most unjustifiable. In making these state<lb break="no"/>ments they do not arrogate to themselves any 
     <lb/>
     superiority over other counties. They acknowl<lb break="no"/>edge the claims of all other sections to consi<lb break="no"/>deration, and are proud that this is our com<lb break="no"/>mon country. It is with pride they remem<lb break="no"/>ber that they can claim as their own one of the 
     <lb/>
     ablest statesmen that ever stood on the floor 
     <lb/>
     of this house, to watch over the interests of 
     <lb/>
     the people of Nova Scotia. He did not come 
     <lb/>
     here, like our leading men of the present day 
     <lb/>
     prepared to destroy, but to improve the con<lb break="no"/>stitution we now possess, and not to hand over. 
     <lb/>
     this Province to another country, irrespective 
     <lb/>
     of the wishes of its people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The arguments that have been advanced in support 
     <lb/>
     of this resolution shew that the scheme is more one 
     <lb/>
     of theory than of practice. The argument which 
     <lb/>
     they have most labored is this: that it is necessary to 
     <lb/>
     unite with Canada in order to ensure our common 
     <lb/>
     safety. Everybody admits that numbers are strength ; 
     <lb/>
     but those numbers must be in a position to assist each 
     <lb/>
     other. If you haven large territory, exposed at all 
     <lb/>
     points to danger,—just as Canada,—separated from 
     <lb/>
     you by a great tract of count , you cannot expect 
     <lb/>
     assistance from it. Its union With you does not bring 
     <lb/>
     strength, but weakness—if you are to have trade. it 
     <lb/>
     must be in a position to afford it.—If we look at the 
     <lb/>
     map, and see the configuration of British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica, you can recognize how absurd are the argu<lb break="no"/>ments of the advocates of Union. Nova Scotia has 
     <lb/>
     no natural relation whatever to Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [Mr. Killam here pointed out the relative positions 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia and Canada on the map, and contend<lb break="no"/>ed that neither in defence nor trade would we gain any 
     <lb/>
     benefit by union.] 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Between us and Canada extends a vast tract of de<lb break="no"/>sert country.—If you look at the water communica<lb break="no"/>tion, you see how roundabout it is, and unsatisfactory 
     <lb/>
     as far as trade relations are concerned. In winter the 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence is closed for five months, and the com<lb break="no"/>munication must be made either by the United states, 
     <lb/>
     or over the uninhabited waste lying between New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick and Canada. We cannot expect any as<lb break="no"/>sistance from that country in case of war, for the na<lb break="no"/>ture of its territory, running along for many hundreds 
     <lb/>
     of miles by the frontier or the American Republic, 
     <lb/>
     requires that all its forces should be ke t at home for 
     <lb/>
     their own defence. In case of a war with th the United 
     <lb/>
     States, therefore, no troops can come from Canada to 
     <lb/>
     our aid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In case of a Union we could give no aid to Canada 
     <lb/>
     except in a financial point of view—by the revenues 
     <lb/>that they would draw from us. Separated from us<lb/>
    as it is, is folly to suppose it could be otherwise. 
     <lb/>When in 1783 Great Britain gave up the old colonies 
     <lb/>which she had settled on this continent the great 
     <lb/>mistake was that they had not all, including Canada, 
     <lb/>

     been given up in one block. I can give you a good 
     <lb/>
     authority on this point, as some gentlemen may take 
     <lb/>
     issue with me. Lord Brougham, in his historical 
     <lb/>
     sketches of eminent Statesmen, speaking of Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Jervis, says: His sagacity no man ever found at fault, 
     <lb/>
     while his provident anticipations of future events 
     <lb/>
     seemed even beyond the reach of human penetration 
     <lb/>
     He says we shall give a remarkable example of this 
     <lb/>
     matter in 1889, in a matter of deep interest at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent moment—(if of deep interest then, the in<lb break="no"/>terest is much greater now). When Lord Shelburne's 
     <lb/>
     peace (1783) was signed, and before the terms were 
     <lb/>
     made public, he sent for the Admiral, and showing 
     <lb/>
     them asked his opinion. I like them very well, said 
     <lb/>
     he, but there is a great omission. In What? In 
     <lb/>
     leaving Canada as a British Province. How could 
     <lb/>
     we possibly give it up, inquired Lord Shelburne 
     <lb/>
     " How can you hope to keep it," replied the veteran 
     <lb/>
     warrior. With an English republic just established 
     <lb/>
     in the sight of Canada, and with a population of a 
     <lb/>
     handful of English settled among a body of heredi<lb break="no"/>tary Frenchmen, It is impossible; and rely on it you 
     <lb/>
     only retain a running sore, the source of endless dis<lb break="no"/>quiet and expense. Would the country bear it ! 
     <lb/>
     Have you forgotten Wolf and Quebec! asked his 
     <lb/>
     Lordship. " Forgotten Wolf and Quebec." No, it 
     <lb/>
     is because I remember both, 1 served with Wolf at 
     <lb/>
     Quebec; having lived so long I have had full time for 
     <lb/>
     reflection on this matter, and my clear opinon is that 
     <lb/>
     if this fair occasion ior giving up Canada is neglected 
     <lb/>
     —nothing but difficulty in either keeping or resigning 
     <lb/>
     it will ever after be known. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is quite evident that Great Britain has nothing to 
     <lb/>
     be proud of in the management of her affairs as res<lb break="no"/>pects the arrangement here spoken of. She has had 
     <lb/>
     war with the United States and came out of it with<lb break="no"/>out accomplishing her objects. Consequently she 
     <lb/>
     neither acquired honor nor glory as far as the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can people are concerned. Nothing is more probable 
     <lb/>
     that what has been prophesied will occur sooner of 
     <lb/>
     later. I have another extract bearing upon the <choice><sic>samg</sic><corr>same</corr></choice> 
     <lb/>
     subject, which I do not think gentlemen will say come, 
     <lb/>
     from a disloyal source. Mr. Oliphant, M. P., deliver<lb break="no"/>ed an address at Stirling on America. In speaking of 
     <lb/>
     Republican institutions, he said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     " To his mind there was no spectacle furnished by 
     <lb/>
     the world at this moment se interesting as the 30,000,<lb break="no"/>000 Anglo Saxons working out by hard experience 
     <lb/>
     the unworked problems of Republican government 
     <lb/>
     In the first place there was no other race fit to cope

     Although he did not believe in them for this country, 
     <lb/>
     he did most devoutly believe in republican institutions

     for America. As an Englishman he had no sort of ob<lb break="no"/>jection to the Monroe doctrine and the spread of <choice><sic>And<lb break="no"/>glo</sic><corr>Anglo</corr></choice> Saxon republics all over the American continent 
     <lb/>
     —the more the better. That was the reason he had 
     <lb/>
     no particular objection to see the Union divided, pro<lb break="no"/>vided slavery was abolished, nor did he think it would 
     <lb/>
     matter half as much as Americans imagined. More<lb break="no"/>over he thought some day or other it must come to 
     <lb/>that. We shall be quite prepared to see Canada erec

     <lb/>old enough. There is no reason because we were a 
     <lb/>constitutional monarchy, and well satisfied to remain 
     <lb/>so, that we should insist upon our Colonies, who had 
     <lb/>none of the traditions or associations which had made

     Here is a speech delivered by a member of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Parliament; he believes in Republics for all Am<lb break="no"/>erica. Look at the geographical position of this con<lb break="no"/>tinent and consider what seems to be the most natur<lb break="no"/>al arrangement. We have thirty millions of people 
     <lb/>
     directly before us, in every way more conven ent to 
     <lb/>
     us than Canada; they are of the same stock, same 
     <lb/>
     feelings, as ourselves; they have everything that can 
     <lb/>
     make a people great and glorious. If you have to 
     <lb/>
     make any political arrangements, let them be consist<lb break="no"/>ent and natural. I do not think that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia want annexation to the United States 
     <lb/>
     but why should you drive them against their interests 
     <lb/>
     and inclinations into a  union with Canada—with 
     <lb/>
     which they have no natural means of communication, 
     <lb/>
     and no sympathy. Why, if our young women were 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     to attempt to-morrow to go to Canada by way of the 
     <lb/>
     States, they would be courted and married before 
     <lb/>
     they got half-way there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have wondered often when I have heard gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     in this Legislature talking of the advantages that will 
     <lb/>
     accrue from Union with Canada. A great amount of 
     <lb/>
     words has been used on the subject, but I cannot 
     <lb/>
     see how our manufactures are to be developed by 
     <lb/>
     Union, Just look at the map, and see where our 
     <lb/>
     products would have to go. Why before they got 
     <lb/>
     there, they would cost so much that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada could not afford to buy them when they 
     <lb/>
     could purchase similar articles, which paid duty at 
     <lb/>
     a lower price. We cannot expect to manufacture as 
     <lb/>
     largely as Canada. We cannot compete with her, or 
     <lb/>
     the great manufacturing countries of the world. If 
     <lb/>
     the Provincial Secretary says that a great stimulus 
     <lb/>
     will be given to manufactures, I give him credit for 
     <lb/>
     thinking otherwise, We have now 350,000 people 
     <lb/>
     busily engaged in carrying on all the industrial pur<lb break="no"/>suits that they able to carry on. We know by the 
     <lb/>
     statement that has been laid on the table that Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia owns 400,000 tons of shipping. Consider what 
     <lb/>
     an immense amount of labor and money has been ex<lb break="no"/>pended to create it ; but also remember that ten years 
     <lb/>
     hence every one of them must be renewed. We own 
     <lb/>
     more ships in proportion to our population than any 
     <lb/>
     other part of the world, and our experience has 
     <lb/>
     shown that they must be renewed as I have stated. 
     <lb/>
     This renewal will cost an immense sum ot 
     <lb/>
     money. We are carrying on a fishery of a most 
     <lb/>
     extensive character, which must tax to the utmost 
     <lb/>
     the energies of those engaged in it. More vessels 
     <lb/>
     han ever are leaving my own county —filled with 
     <lb/>
     able bodied men, to endure the privations and labors 
     <lb/>
     of a fisherman's life on the Banks. We are largely 
     <lb/>
     engaged in Mining and Lumbering, and Trade—Agri<lb break="no"/>culture engrosses the attention of a large proportion 
     <lb/>
     of the people. Everybody has his hands full, and yet 
     <lb/>
     you say we want more work. We are now one of the 
     <lb/>
     greatest manufacturing countries of the world in one 
     <lb/>
     great branch; our shipping is a more lucrative source 
     <lb/>
     of wealth than any manafacturies that can be created 
     <lb/>
     by Annexation to Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As to what Mr. Young, Mr. Johnson, or Mr. Howe 
     <lb/>
     may have said, it makes little difference now. It is 
     <lb/>
     the duty of this Legislature to look at the present 
     <lb/>
     circumstances of the country, and provide for its 
     <lb/>
     best interests. We should not wander away from 
     <lb/>
     the subject immediately before us. This Union ques<lb break="no"/>tion has been tried in British North America and has 
     <lb/>
     failed The Union between Upper and Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da has failed. and now they come asking us to help 
     <lb/>
     them out of their difficulties. Mr. Brown formed a 
     <lb/>
     coalition with Cartier and Macdonald and they came 
     <lb/>
     meet the Maritime Delegates and persuaded them to 
     <lb/>
     join in a political Union with Canada. Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     should pause before injuring herself irremediably for 
     <lb/>
     the sake of helping the Canadians out of their politi<lb break="no"/>cal embarrassments, They got into a mess, and now 
     <lb/>
     wish to mix us up with it. You have all heard the 
     <lb/>
     story about the Spider and the Fly. The Spider told 
     <lb/>
     the Fly a " fine story, and got him that way into his 
     <lb/>
     mesh, and there was the end of the poor thing." 
     <lb/>
     And it was just so with the Canadians. The Mari<lb break="no"/>time Delegates were dazzled. if not by Canadian gold, 
     <lb/>
     by fine stories—and thus fell into the net prepared for 
     <lb/>
     them. " We give larger salaries to our public men. 
     <lb/>
     we are more liberal in our expenditure; we shall

     have five or six Lieutenant-Governors to appoint— 
     <lb/>
     number of other offices to select from; here is your 
     <lb/>
     chance." This is the language that was probably 
     <lb/>
     used to cajole our delegates. Elated by the prospect 
     <lb/>
     before them, our delegates came back thinking that 
     <lb/>
     the people would take their view of matters. All these 
     <lb/>
     things make people wonderfully loyal at times. 
     <lb/>
     They can hardly bear to hear a whisper about annex<lb break="no"/>ation to the United States. Let us hear what Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Murdoch says in his history of Nova Scotia about a 
     <lb/>
     matter bearing u on this point. At page 448, No. 
     <lb/>
     13., speaking of the excitement in the old American 
     <lb/>
     Colonies in reference to the stamp act, he says :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>

     Things like these make a great many people in<lb break="no"/>tensely loyal. Take away their salaries and their 
     <lb/>
     cocked hats, and their honours, and they become a 
     <lb/>
     good deal like other people. c am not going to ac<lb break="no"/>knowledge that I am not as loyal as an gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who sits on their benches. I love, and wish to live 
     <lb/>
     under British institutions, I have no desire to change 
     <lb/>
     them : but if we are to have a change, if it is necess<lb break="no"/>ary, should not every man be at liberty to say how 
     <lb/>
     that change should be made. Should we press the 
     <lb/>
     people into Union with a country with which they 
     <lb/>
     have no wish to unite, and not allow them to express 
     <lb/>
     their opinions? It is said that the people of Yarmouth 
     <lb/>
     are disloyal—I deny it, they are as loyal, and have 
     <lb/>
     done as much to show it, as any people in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince. When we see our present institutions about to 
     <lb/>
     be swept away, it is enough to rouse our feelings and 
     <lb/>
     passions.

     Gentlemen have had an opportunity of watching 
     <lb/>
     my public conduct for very many years in this house 
     <lb/>
     and country, but can any of them say that I have had 
     <lb/>
     an other object in view except the advancement of 
     <lb/>
     this province. I have done much to place the pres<lb break="no"/>ent party in power; but when I came here and found 
     <lb/>
     that they were about to desert the principles on 
     <lb/>
     which I had supported them, I left them, and assumed 
     <lb/>
     an independent position. I have pursued this course 
     <lb/>
     whenever the interests of my country demanded it. 
     <lb/>
     I did as much as anyone to advocate the retrench<lb break="no"/>ment scheme. and was pledged to support it. It has 
     <lb/>
     been charged against me in a paper supporting the 
     <lb/>
     government that I and another hon. member would 
     <lb/>
     not sustain them became 1 could not get office. The 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Secretary knows that I never wanted of<lb break="no"/>fice; I was above it; I have business enough of my 
     <lb/>
     own to attend to. I do not think myself suited for 
     <lb/>
     office. I have been tied up to indoor business; but I 
     <lb/>
     had my eyes about me, and saw through the designs 
     <lb/>
     of some political gentlemen. If I had been disposed 
     <lb/>
     to yield to some of them, I cauld have had anything 
     <lb/>
     that I wanted; but that is foreign to my nature. If 
     <lb/>
     I can support a government on principle, I must 
     <lb/>
     leave them. Now these gentlemen with whom I was 
     <lb/>
     formerly associated come here to barter away the 
     <lb/>
     rights and interests of the people of Nova Scotia. 
     <lb/>
     There is no principle in a course like that. It is be<lb break="no"/>neath the dignity of statesmen to do such a thing, in 
     <lb/>
     the face of public sentiment. Such a union could ne<lb break="no"/>ver last; there would be no unity of feeling and sym<lb break="no"/>pathy. Suppose an election were to come off to-mor<lb break="no"/>row, how many of the gentleman who are pressing 
     <lb/>
     forward this unjust measure may expect to see Otta<lb break="no"/>wa? Hardly one of them. The members that will go 
     <lb/>
     to Canada will carry with them a feeling of hostility 
     <lb/>
     to this Province—they will bring discord into the 
     <lb/>
     councils of the Confederation; your present conduct 
     <lb/>
     can lead to no other result, The members of this 
     <lb/>
     House know the sentiments of our people, from Cape 
     <lb/>
     Sable to Cape North, and should hesitate before 
     <lb/>
     pressing this measure rashly upon them. We should 
     <lb/>
     allow more time for the consideration of a question 
     <lb/>
     fraught with such important results. There is no ne<lb break="no"/>cessity whatever for dealing with this subject with 
     <lb/>
     such intemperate haste. It is reported, from day to 
     <lb/>
     day, that we are to be invaded by a band of robbers 
     <lb/>
     called Fenians, who wish to seize and destroy our 
     <lb/>
     property; and yet, at this critical time, you are going 
     <lb/>
     to agitate and distract the people of the country, and 
     <lb/>
     to divide one section against another. The people are 
     <lb/>
     quite prepared to meet any invaders, an with the 
     <lb/>
     help of Great Britain. they will be successful—why 
     <lb/>
     then this haste? I do trust that if any words of mine 
     <lb/>
     can have any effect on this House, that a majority 
     <lb/>
     will not be found ready to sell their country to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians. If the day should come when Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia will be wrested from us and given to Canada, it 
     <lb/>
     will be one of mourning and lamentation among the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     people. Of course we shall have to submit to it—for 
     <lb/>
     I am not going to counsel rebellion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are going to disturb all our financial arrange<lb break="no"/>ments, and hand into the Canadian treasury much 
     <lb/>
     more than we can expect to receive, We have had 
     <lb/>
     revenue enough for our purposes, and when it was 
     <lb/>
     not sufficient we have raised the duties to suit our<lb break="no"/>selves. If any money is spent improperly it is soon 
     <lb/>
     made up, and we are able to exercise the strictest 
     <lb/>
     supervision over our expenditures. But now we 
     <lb/>
     are about to entrust the extensive power to the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament at Ottawa, to be used as the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians may choose. The sum of 80 cents a head that 
     <lb/>
     we are to receive is a most contemptible amount to 
     <lb/>
     offer to a people for the amount of money they are to 
     <lb/>
     put into the treasury. We have now a large revenue, 
     <lb/>
     and there is every reason to believe that as our pub 
     <lb/>
     lic works are extended we shall be able to meet our 
     <lb/>
     liabilities. It will be far more satisfactory to have 
     <lb/>
     the management of our own revenues, and to be able 
     <lb/>
     to raise the duties when we think proper. than to en<lb break="no"/>trust the power to a Legislature 800 miles off. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our trade with Canada is small, not as much as 
     <lb/>
     with Newfoundland or New Brunswick, while the 
     <lb/>
     population is ten times as great. Our exports to that 
     <lb/>
    Province are mostly of Foreign productions. The es<lb break="no"/>timate on which our revenue an expenditure is based 
     <lb/>for the current year, now in the hands of every mem<lb break="no"/>ber, shows that all we should have to apply for pro<lb break="no"/>vincial purposes, including the 80 cents per head, 
     <lb/>would only amount to $419,000 out of a gross revenue 
     <lb/>of about $1 500.000. I have not closely estimated my<lb break="no"/>self what our imports of 1865 with the Canadian ta<lb break="no"/>riff would have amounted to, but have been informed 
     <lb/>by a competent person who has done so, that it 
     <lb/>would have added $680,000 —enough to pay the inter<lb break="no"/>est on the $8,000,000 of debt proposed to be assumed 
     <lb/>by the General Government, and leave $220,000. 
     <lb/>How is our education, educational institutions, roads, 
     <lb/>bridges, Lunatic Asylum, Penitentiaries, Legislative 
     <lb/>expenses, and improvements and casualties of every 
     <lb/>kind to be provided for. The $419,000 is very little 
     <lb/>over half we have in the estimate for this year for 
     <lb/>similar purposes, with the present tariff. Mr. Speaker 
     <lb/>I thank you and the House for the very attentive 
     <lb/>hearing you have given on this important subject.

     <persName ref="pers:MCDO4">Mr. MCDONALD</persName> then said :—The present 
     <lb/>
     question is one of the most important subjects 
     <lb/>
     that can engage the attention of a free people, 
     <lb/>
     involving as it does their political rights and 
     <lb/>
     condition for all time. It is not therefore to be 
     <lb/>
     wondered at, that each member of this house, 
     <lb/>
     in the discharge of his duty to his constituents, 
     <lb/>
     should be desirous of placing on record the sen<lb break="no"/>timents by which he is influenced in coming to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion at which he may arrive. This is 
     <lb/>
     the only excuse I shall offer in detaining the 
     <lb/>
     house with a few remarks on the resolution un<lb break="no"/>der consideration. The arguments for and 
     <lb/>
     against Confederation have been widely dis<lb break="no"/>seminated throughout the country—the subject 
     <lb/>
     in the form of the Quebec scheme has been dis<lb break="no"/>cussed in this house by the Delegates who origi<lb break="no"/>nated it, on the public platform, and in the col<lb break="no"/>umns of the press. The people therefore, we may 
     <lb/>
     assume, are more or less familiar with the 
     <lb/>
     grounds and reasons on which the framers and 
     <lb/>
     supporter of the measure ask public support. 
     <lb/>
     It will not be necessary for me, under these 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, to go at any length into the argu<lb break="no"/>ments which have influenced my own mind. 
     <lb/>
     Since this debate arose nothing has been evolv<lb break="no"/>ed that has not already appeared in the press of 
     <lb/>
     the opponents of the scheme. The advocates 
     <lb/>
     of Union to-night have not to meet a single ar<lb break="no"/>gument that has not been previously consider<lb break="no"/>

     ed and refuted—that the people had not had a 
     <lb/>
     full opportunity of discussing and reflecting 
     <lb/>
     upon. Therefore it is that I shall feel myself at 
     <lb/>
     liberty, as a representative of one of the most 
     <lb/>
     important counties in Nova Scotia, to state in 
     <lb/>
     a very brief and concise manner the reasons 
     <lb/>
     which induce me to support the resolution be<lb break="no"/>fore the house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is one argument which has been used 
     <lb/>
     by the opponents of the scheme which requires 
     <lb/>
     consideration. I admit that, if it be true, it is 
     <lb/>
     a fundamental argument, for it lies at the very 
     <lb/>
     basis of the question we are discussing. It is 
     <lb/>
     one which should therefore be fully and satis<lb break="no"/>factorily answered before we ask the people of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia to accept this measure at our 
     <lb/>
     hands. That argument, if I understand it 
     <lb/>
     aright, and as it has been advanced by all the 
     <lb/>
     speakers on the opposite side, and more parti<lb break="no"/>cularly by the only lawyer who is supporting 
     <lb/>
     the opposition, is this : that we are not in a 
     <lb/>
     position constitutionally to pass on the measure 
     <lb/>
     in this Legislature; that this House, in its legis<lb break="no"/>lative capacity, is not competent to decide upon 
     <lb/>
     this important measure, affecting as we all ad<lb break="no"/>mit it does to a large degree, the rights and 
     <lb/>
     interests of the people, without a reference to 
     <lb/>
     them at the polls. If this be true, we are at<lb break="no"/>tempting to discuss a question with which we 
     <lb/>
     have no right to deal—we are assuming a 
     <lb/>
     power and authority which the constitution 
     <lb/>
     does not invest us with—and we would be 
     <lb/>
     guilty of one of the highest crimes of which 
     <lb/>
     public men can stand convicted before the peo<lb break="no"/>ple who have entrusted their rights to their 
     <lb/>
     hands. If, however, as I contend we have a 
     <lb/>
     right to pass upon this question under the con<lb break="no"/>stitution handed down to us from the earliest 
     <lb/>
     days of constitutional authority then the ques<lb break="no"/>tion assumes a different aspect, and we have 
     <lb/>
     only then to consider whether it is not for their 
     <lb/>
     benefit and welfare that the people should seek 
     <lb/>
     by this union to become an integral part of 
     <lb/>
     what in a short time must be one of the com<lb break="no"/>manding nationalities of the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I must say that I was astonished not only to 
     <lb/>
     hear a lawyer but other members of this Legis<lb break="no"/>lature who from their position, ought to be 
     <lb/>
     somewhat versed in constitutional knowledge— 
     <lb/>
     for I need not tell you it does not require a 
     <lb/>
     legal mind to understand the general principles 
     <lb/>
     of constitutional law upon which the rights and 
     <lb/>
     interests of this Parliament are based—attempt 
     <lb/>
     to delude this House with the style of argument 
     <lb/>
     resorted by the hon. member for Halifax and 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Guysborough in dealing 
     <lb/>
     with this important branch of the subject. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Halifax, who is one of 
     <lb/>
     the oldest members of this Legislature, and who 
     <lb/>
     has taken an active part in all the discussions 
     <lb/>
     which have agitated this country, for a long 
     <lb/>
     time, has no excuse for misinterpreting those 
     <lb/>
     principles of constitutional law with which he 
     <lb/>
     should be familiar. Much less should the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Guysborough, a gentleman of legal 
     <lb/>
     attainments, who has filled the position of 
     <lb/>
     Speaker of this House, attempt to deal with a 
     <lb/>
     question of such magnitude and dogmatically 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
     assert doctrines in constitutional law without as<lb break="no"/>serting a single authority in support of his argu<lb break="no"/>ment. In propounding an argument radically 
     <lb/>
     striking at what I consider one of the highest 
     <lb/>
     privileges of this Legislature, he ought to have 
     <lb/>
     given us the result of his reading, and have 
     <lb/>
     shown this House and country at least one in<lb break="no"/>stance in the whole constitutional history of 
     <lb/>
     England where the right of Parliament to deal 
     <lb/>
     with a question like this was denied. I chal<lb break="no"/>lenge the hon. member and any gentleman in 
     <lb/>
     this House who assumes the same views, to 
     <lb/>
     show me in the whole constitutional history of 
     <lb/>
     England down to the present time a single case 
     <lb/>
     in which it was contended that the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     of England, or of any Colony enjoying the 
     <lb/>
     blessing of the British constitution, were not 
     <lb/>
     absolutely and constitutionally authorized in 
     <lb/>
     their legislative capacity to discuss and 
     <lb/>
     finally decide upon any measure which, in their 
     <lb/>
     opinion touched the rights and interests of the 
     <lb/>
     people they represented. I shall not occupy 
     <lb/>
     any time in debating a question which is as 
     <lb/>
     plain as the sun at noon-day. But I feel it im<lb break="no"/>portant that the people of this country should 
     <lb/>
     be rightly informed on the question, and see 
     <lb/>
     how baseless are the assertions of those who 
     <lb/>
     contend that the representatives of this House— 
     <lb/>
     that the Legislature of this country, for some. 
     <lb/>
     reasons, have been arrogating to themselves a 
     <lb/>
     power which is not delegated to them by the 
     <lb/>
     constitution and are bartering away most un<lb break="no"/>justifiably (to quote the hon. member for Yar<lb break="no"/>mouth) the rights and liberties of the province. 
     <lb/>
     In order that the people and the country may 
     <lb/>
     be satisfied on this point I will read one or two 
     <lb/>
     authorities of very high standing—which are 
     <lb/>
     recognized in England as of the highest weight 
     <lb/>
     in matters of constitutional law and practice. 
     <lb/>
     May in his work on the privileges of Parliament 
     <lb/>
     says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     "The Legislative authority of Parliament extends 
     <lb/>
     over the United Kingdom and all its Colonies and 
     <lb/>
     foreign possessions, and there are no limits to its 
     <lb/>
     power of making laws for the whole empire than 
     <lb/>
     those which are incident to all sovereign authority— 
     <lb/>
     the willingness of the people to obey, or their power 
     <lb/>
     to resist. Unlike the Legislatures of many other 
     <lb/>

     In addition to this I shall quote the opinion of

     I could, if it were necessary, quote other, many

     member for Guysboro to produce to this house and 
     <lb/>
     the country the authority on which he founded the 
     <lb/>
     bold assertion that the members of this Legislature 
     <lb/>
     are forgetting their duties to the people when they 
     <lb/>
     undertake to consider for the benefit of the country, 
     <lb/>
     not a radical change in the constitution, but simply a 
     <lb/>
     modification of their present relations and circum<lb break="no"/>stances.

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     If what I have read be sound constitutional 
     <lb/>
     law—if we have the right to consider and final<lb break="no"/>ly pass upon this question, I hope we shall 
     <lb/>
     not again be told we are ignoring the just au<lb break="no"/>thority of the people and the duty we own to 
     <lb/>
     our constituents in our efforts to promote their 
     <lb/>
     interests by multiplying their sources of 
     <lb/>
     wealth, while we secure their enjoyment 
     <lb/>
     of all their just rights and privileges. And 
     <lb/>
     now, sir, we can legitimately examine the expe<lb break="no"/>diency of the proposed change, and enquire 
     <lb/>
     whether the Union of these Colonies be a pro<lb break="no"/>per and judicious measure on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country. But first let me refer 
     <lb/>
     to one view of the question which is perhaps of 
     <lb/>
     some importance, in the opinion of some, and 
     <lb/>
     has indeed been referred to in this debate I 
     <lb/>
     refer to the position occupied in reference to 
     <lb/>
     this question by its present opponents in former 
     <lb/>
     times. It is quite true men may legitimately 
     <lb/>
     change their opinion on public questions, but in 
     <lb/>
     doing so they invite inquiry as to the motives 
     <lb/>
     by which they are actuated and the reasons for 
     <lb/>
     the change—and although I do not think it of 
     <lb/>
     very much consequence, nor will the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country, I imagine think it of much conse<lb break="no"/>quence, what have been or are now the opini<lb break="no"/>ons of the Honble member for Halifax, yet 
     <lb/>
     his position in this house as one of the leading 
     <lb/>
     opponents of <choice><sic>Uniou</sic><corr>Union</corr></choice> and his well known and re<lb break="no"/>cognised connection with a gentleman outside of 
     <lb/>
     this house whose opinions exercise much more 
     <lb/>
     influence in the country than his own—make 
     <lb/>
     it perhaps worth our while to inquire whether it 
     <lb/>
     be true as the hon. member for Halifax has 
     <lb/>
     ventured to assert that neither Mr. Howe nor 
     <lb/>
     himself have ever been committed to a Union 
     <lb/>
     of these colonies. It is quite natural, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that a man like Mr. Howe who for 
     <lb/>
     many years has filled a large space in the pub<lb break="no"/>lic eye, who has borne a prominent part in the 
     <lb/>
     political contests and changes of many years, 
     <lb/>
     and occupied a foremost position in the discus<lb break="no"/>sion of the most important and grave public 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
            
     question which have agitated the country for a 
     <lb/>
     quarter of a century—it is natural I say that 
     <lb/>
     the sentiment of such a man should be recei<lb break="no"/>ved by the country with some weight of autho<lb break="no"/>ity. Mr. Howe has recently assumed a posi<lb break="no"/>tion on this great question which his mouth<lb break="no"/>piece in this house, the hon. member for Hali<lb break="no"/>fax as well as the hon. and learned member 
     <lb/>
     for Guysboro has sought to justify—while they 
     <lb/>
     have ventured to assert that Mr. Howe was 
     <lb/>
     never committed to a Union of these Colonies, 
     <lb/>
     other gentlemen have called attention to the re<lb break="no"/>solution of 1362 and other public acts indicat<lb break="no"/>ing his desire to promote this Union, unless in<lb break="no"/>deed, we accept the shameless assertion that 
     <lb/>
     their measures were a sham and delusion. I 
     <lb/>
     shall therefore only detain the house by read<lb break="no"/>ing one or two paragraphs from a speech of 
     <lb/>
     former years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not necessary that I should say one word 
     <lb/>
     derogatory to that gentleman, and I am sure I 
     <lb/>
     have no desire to do so I shall compare his 
     <lb/>
     past with his present course, but I shall accord 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Howe his due influence and position in 
     <lb/>
     this country. Unless I was willing to do so, I 
     <lb/>
     could not venture to ask this House and the 
     <lb/>
     country to contrast his former with his present 
     <lb/>
     opinions, and to ask the people to accept from 
     <lb/>
     his own mouth the evidence which condemns 
     <lb/>
     his present course and that of gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site. When he chooses for personal or other 
     <lb/>
     grounds to recede trom the position he occupied 
     <lb/>
     in former days, he occupies a position which, I 
     <lb/>
     may say, will not be accepted by the country 
     <lb/>
     as worthy of himself or of his past greatness. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing surprises me so much as the hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber for East Halifax who is the Editor of the 
     <lb/>
     book which I holdin my hand entitled "Speeches 
     <lb/>
     and Public Letters" of Hon. J. Howe, who has 
     <lb/>
     prepared the very evidence on which I intend 
     <lb/>
     to convict both himself and Mr. Howe of at<lb break="no"/>tempting to deceive and betray the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country in the most important matter ever 
     <lb/>
     submitted to them, and who, on more than one 
     <lb/>
     occasion, endorsed the sentiments which Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe promulgated to the country on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject. I wish, sir, I had time to quote a very 
     <lb/>
     great deal from the volume before me; it is 
     <lb/>
     one which ought to be read more than it is 
     <lb/>
     in this country at this particular time. If I 
     <lb/>
     wished to impress upon the people the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of a Union of the Colonies I do not think 
     <lb/>
     I could do it more convincingly than by scat<lb break="no"/>tering this contribution to our literature over 
     <lb/>
     the face of this country. Sir, it is filled with 
     <lb/>
     arguments in favour of Union, and therefore 
     <lb/>
     it is that the people who have accepted these 
     <lb/>
     opinions of Mr. Howe as of great weight ought 
     <lb/>
     to pause before giving their opposition to these 
     <lb/>
     same views when they are being carried out 
     <lb/>
     by his successors, and not to accept at the 
     <lb/>
     hands of his disciples or of himself views dia<lb break="no"/>metrically opposite to those he so long labour: 
     <lb/>
     ed to inculcate. Mr. Howe on various occa<lb break="no"/>sions, in the discharge of his public duties, 
     <lb/>
     advocated not only in this country but in 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain a Union of the Colonies; and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps no colonist (without derogating from 
     <lb/>
     the position of many eminent men who have 
     <lb/>
     justly acquired great influence in this country)

     This is very significant language from Mr. Howe, 
     <lb/>
     and I now quote Mr. Annand's comments thereon: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     " Mr. Howe desired to create a NORTH AMERICAN 
     <lb/>
     NATION, watchful of republican America, even while 
     <lb/>
     pursuing common objects, but in perpetual friendship 
     <lb/>
     and alliance with the British Isles." 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Here we have the sentiments of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Halifax, under his own hand, 
     <lb/>
     nearly eight or nine years ago,—when he did 
     <lb/>
     not expect that his political opponents would 
     <lb/>
     succeed in carrying into effect what he and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howe then expressed a desire to form, a 
     <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">British American Nation</hi>. What does this 
     <lb/>
     mean? Is not that a Union of the Colonies? 
     <lb/>
     Or is it some new combination of which we 
     <lb/>
     have not yet heard? The House will recollect 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. member for Halifax, in the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion of this question last night, while en<lb break="no"/>deavoring to avoid the dilemma in which he 
     <lb/>was placed by the resolution which he moved 
     <lb/>in 1862, stated that they did not intend to do 
     <lb/>anything—that the resolution was a delusion— 
     <lb/>that they looked forward to a Union after the 
     <lb/>Railway was completed. Mr. Howe always 
     <lb/>declared that a railway was an essential prece<lb break="no"/>dent of Union, but be also as invariably con<lb break="no"/>tended that the railway was only the means 
     <lb/>towards that great end. " Why do I 
     <lb/>want a railway? Perhaps for the pecuniary 
     <lb/>and commercial advantages that it may bring 
     <lb/>to us, but the great object I have in view is a 
     <lb/>Union of the Colonies." That was the sum and 
     <lb/>substance of his arguments I ask then when 
     <lb/>we attain the great end he had in view 
     <lb/>and at the same time, and by means 
     <lb/>of the Union obtain the Railway which 
     <lb/>he vainly laboured so hard to secure, why 
     <lb/>does he now factiously oppose the mea<lb break="no"/>sure which brings about the very result he 
     <lb/>wished to obtain. Mr Howe says on the same 
     <lb/>occasion :—     
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>" Of one thing I am proud to-day : of the unanimity 
     <lb/>and evident attachment to the home of our fathers 
     <lb/>which have characterized this meeting. In the gene<lb break="no"/>rous offer of the government and people of England, 
     <lb/>we have felt John Bull's heart, beating against our

     <choice><sic>wShortly</sic><corr>Shortly</corr></choice> afterwards Mr. Howe visited New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, and in a speech delivered there, thus reported 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for Halifax in the book I have

     <choice><sic>ef erred</sic><corr>referred</corr></choice> to :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     " I thought it was now full time that we had higher 
     <lb/>
     objects in view than a mere transit traffic, and I 
     <lb/>
     therefore urged the general views and aspects of 
     <lb/>
     these Provinces, for the purpose of preparing the 
     <lb/>
     public mind in England to promote their elevation <hi rendition="simple:italic">to 
     <lb/>
     a far higher status in the scale of nations</hi>." And Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Annand thus comments on the above and previous 
     <lb/>
     parts of the same speech. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " Having very adroitly detached some of the promi<lb break="no"/>nent public men of New Brunswick, and brought out 
     <lb/>
     in bold relief the proportions of that great field of 
     <lb/>
     honorable emulation and exertion which they would 
     <lb/>
     tread, when Union of the Provinces by iron roads 
     <lb/>
     had been followed by the political organization which 
     <lb/>
     would be the immediate result, he said:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     " If the sphere were wide enough here, what would 
     <lb/>
     you do with such men? You would send Judge 
     <lb/>
    Wilmot to administer justice. Where? To a small 
     <lb/>Province? No: but to an American Empire. You 
     <lb/>would place Mr. Chandler on the bench of the United 
     <lb/>Provinces; you would hold out to the young men of 
     <lb/>your country a sphere and a field for their exertions 
     <lb/>and their ambition which none of them have open to 
     <lb/>them now. How? By violence? By rebellion? 
     <lb/>By bloodshed? No. You would seek to live under 
     <lb/>the old flag. You would seek not separation from 
     <lb/>the mother country—that would be madness, folly, 
     <lb/>bad faith; but with the <hi rendition="simple:italic">consent of the Sovereign, and 
     <lb/>the acquiesence of the Imperial authorities,</hi> by the 
     <lb/>united action and good sense of all the Provinces. 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">You would seek by union to elevate them all to a high<lb break="no"/>er status than any of them separately can ever enjoy.</hi> 
     <lb/>I believe that Railways will be of great use to these

      <lb/>almost indispensable, to produce a social and politi<lb break="no"/>cal organization of the people, <hi rendition="simple:italic">to raise these Provinces 
     <lb/>to a higher position than they can ever singly attain "</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     And in his report to his own government, in 1851, 
     <lb/>
     he says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " Among all ranks and classes the railroad seemed 
     <lb/>
     to be regarded as indispensable agencies by which 
     <lb/>
     North Americans would be drawn into a common 
     <lb/>
     brotherhood, inspired with higher hopes, and ulti<lb break="no"/>mately elevated by some form of political association,

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In his speech on the organization of the empire, he

     said :—

            <p>
     "If, then, the British and Colonial statesmen do

     Scotia would rise into a great nation?—He 
     <lb/>
     was speaking then of British America—asking 
     <lb/>
     them to build the road and obtain that stand<lb break="no"/>ing in the world which the advocates of union 
     <lb/>
     are now endeavoring to bring about. He was

     advocating then exactly what we are advocat<lb break="no"/>ing now. I would like, before passing from 
     <lb/>
     this subject, to read another extract to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Yarmouth who, pointing to the 
     <lb/>
     map before him, said that Canada was a dreary 
     <lb/>
     waste—that we could not expect any commer<lb break="no"/>cial or manufacturing advantages from con<lb break="no"/>nection with her—that she, from her natural

     commercially or politically. The hon member 
     <lb/>
     is in unison with Mr. Howe on this question 
     <lb/>
     now, but let us see what. the hon. member's

     friend has said on former times about Canada,

     when it was not his interest to traduce that

     discloses for our children, and boundless as are the

     fields of honorable labor which it presents another,

     the imagination of a poet could not exaggerate, but

     which the statesman may grasp and realize, even in

     <lb/>
     of sentiment, which they so much require, is our first 
     <lb/>
     duty. But, after all, they occupy but a limited por<lb break="no"/>tion of that boundless heritage which God and na<lb break="no"/>ture have given to us and to our children. Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick are but the frontage of a 
     <lb/>
     territory which includes four millions of square

     miles, stretching away behind and beyond them, to 
     <lb/>
     the frozen regions on the one side and the Pacific on 
     <lb/>
     the other. Of this great section of the globe, all the 
     <lb/>
     Northern Provinces, including Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land and Newfoundland, occupy but four hundred 
     <lb/>
     and eighty-six thousand square miles. The Hudson's 
     <lb/>
     Bay territory includes two hundred and fifty thou<lb break="no"/>sand miles. Throwing aside the more bleak and in<lb break="no"/>hospitable regions, we have a magnificent country 
     <lb/>
     between Canada and the Pacific, out of which five 
     <lb/>
     or six no le Provinces may be formed, larger than 
     <lb/>
     any we have, and presenting to the hand of industry, 
     <lb/>
     and to the eye of speculation, every variety of soil,

     climate, and resources. With such a territory as this

     <lb/>
     shall stop even at the western bounds of Canada? or 
     <lb/>
     even at the shores of the Pacific? Vancouver's, Is<lb break="no"/>land, with its vast coal measures, lies beyond The 
     <lb/>
     beautiful islands of the Pacific and the growing com<lb break="no"/>merce of the ocean, are beyond. Populous China 
     <lb/>
     and the rich East, are beyond; and the sails of our 
     <lb/>
     children's children will reflect as familiarly the sun<lb break="no"/>beams of the South, as they now brave the angry

     tempests of the North The maritime Provinces 
     <lb/>
     which I now address, are but the Atlantic frontage 
     <lb/>
     of this boundless and prolific region; the wharves 
     <lb/>
     upon which its business will  be transacted, and be<lb break="no"/>side which its rich argories are to lie. Nova Scotia

     is one of these Will you, then, put your hands uni<lb break="no"/>tedly, with order, intelligence, and energy to this

     I scarcely require to make an apology for 
     <lb/>
     reading to this house an extract so eloquent. 
     <lb/>
     1 may say that eloquent as have been the 
     <lb/>
     speeches of the advocates of this scheme, none 
     <lb/>
     of them can exceed this, or more fully recog<lb break="no"/>nize the importance and benefits of Union. I 
     <lb/>
     would be quite content to put these words 
     <lb/>
     of the eminent man from whom I quoted 
     <lb/>
     against the remarks that the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Yarmouth thought proper to make. And I 
     <lb/>
     would ask him to give the same weight to these 
     <lb/>
     words of Mr. Howe, as he is ready to give the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of the same gentleman to-day. There 
     <lb/>
     is no man who is acquainted with the resources 
     <lb/>
     of Canada—with the industry and energy of her 
     <lb/>
      people—with the great progress that has been 
     <lb/>
      made in all the elements of prosperity, but 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     must recognize the want of truth in the state<lb break="no"/>ments of the hon. member, and the want of 
     <lb/>
     magninimity he displayed in disparaging a 
     <lb/>
     colony which has increased more rapidly in re<lb break="no"/>cent years than any other part of the world. 
     <lb/>
     There is no country in North America that, in 
     <lb/>
     the last fifty years, has advanced so rapidly 
     <lb/>
     and so steadily in all the sources of material 
     <lb/>
     wealth and greatness as the Province of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada.

     On another occasion, in a great speech which

     <lb/>
     on the Organization of the Empire he says :—

     " Sir, the first question which we men of the North

     <lb/>
     travelling over some of the ground trodden yesterday 
     <lb/>
     by the learned member for Annapolis, I think it can 
     <lb/>
     be shown that we have. Beneath, around, and be<lb break="no"/>hind us, stretching away from the Atlantic to the 
     <lb/>
     Pacific are four millions square miles of territory. 
     <lb/>
     All Europe with its family of nations, contains but

            <p>
     These were the sentiments that Mr. Howe 
     <lb/>
     impressed upon the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     What then did they lead to? When the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary moved the resolution, two 
     <lb/>
     years ago, for the Union of the Maritime Colo<lb break="no"/>nies, I stated in a very short speech, that from 
     <lb/>
     my earliest recollection of the political history 
     <lb/>
     of this country I had been impressed with the 
     <lb/>
     conviction that the leading men on both sides 
     <lb/>
     had always advocated the Union of the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Colonies, and that a desire 
     <lb/>
     for such Union largely pervaded the public 
     <lb/>
     mind of this country. I regretted, on that oc<lb break="no"/>casion, that instead of a Union of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, we could not aspire to a Union of 
     <lb/>
     all the Colonies in British North America. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, I did not stand alone in entertaining that 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and I venture to assert that it was 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of the large majority of the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country, until their fears and prejudices 
     <lb/>
     were aroused by demagogues who had other 
     <lb/>
     ends to serve, and not a leading man but has 
     <lb/>
     been found in the front pressing forward this 
     <lb/>
     great question. But Mr. Howe, in a letter 
     <lb/>
     which he published the other day, says we are 
     <lb/>
     powerless to defend ourselves. Let us see 
     <lb/>
     what he thought on that subject a few years 
     <lb/>
     ago; after eloquently referring to the necessity 
     <lb/>
     for the future consolidation of these colonies. 
     <lb/>
     he said :—

     " Taking our population at two millions and a half,

            <p>
     So much then for Mr. Howe, and now let us 
     <lb/>
     enquire what are we to obtain from a Union of 
     <lb/>
     the Colonies. It is hardly worth while detaining 
     <lb/>
     the house on this branch of the subject, for it has 
     <lb/>
     been so very amply discussed; but let me say 
     <lb/>
     that this union will give us commercial great 
     <lb/>
     ness, political status, social distinction, and mili 
     <lb/>
     tary power I will not say we are going all at 
     <lb/>
     once to become a great Empire, to be able to com<lb break="no"/>pete with the great nation close to us—but let us 
     <lb/>
     unite these colonies, consolidate their strength and 
     <lb/>
     resources, and we start fair for all the greatness 
     <lb/>
     which the Anglo-Saxon race is sure to attain 
     <lb/>
     when it has the means and the opportunity. We 
     <lb/>
     start with a larger population than the United 
     <lb/>
     States had when their national existence began, 
     <lb/>
     with a country far in advance of those States at 
     <lb/>
     the time of their separation, in all the elements of 
     <lb/>
     national prosperity and greatness. We will have 
     <lb/>
     direct railway communication with the whole 
     <lb/>
     country behind us, as soon as the political union 
     <lb/>
     is consummated. The hon member for Yar<lb break="no"/>mouth says that we cannot have extensive com<lb break="no"/>mercial relations with Canada, and that union 
     <lb/>will give no impulse to our commercial enter<lb break="no"/>prise, and he scouted the idea that we can sus<lb break="no"/>tain manufacturing establishments. Why should 
     <lb/>we not have manufactures ? He says we have 
     <lb/>not the population. True, I reply, and whilst we 
     <lb/>remain isolated as at present—whilst we have had 
     <lb/>only a population of 330,000 people, he is quite 
     <lb/>right to say we cannot rise above our present con<lb break="no"/>dition. No one knows better than he that a large 
     <lb/>manufactory in Halifax or Yarmouth of any par<lb break="no"/>ticular article could supply the Province. We 
     <lb/>can afford no inducements to men of large capi<lb break="no"/>tal to expend their money in developing our re<lb break="no"/>sources. Give us, however, the population of 
     <lb/>four millions that union will give, strike down 
     <lb/>the hostile tariffs that now stand like a Chinese 
     <lb/>walt between the Provinces. and you have the 
     <lb/>market for manufactures which is now wanting 
     <lb/>to stimulate enterprise. The hon. member says 
     <lb/>we have not the means or resources, Then again 
     <lb/>I say the hon member's knowledge of this coun<lb break="no"/>try should have prevented him making this asser<lb break="no"/>tion. If there is a country in the world of equal 
     <lb/>dimensions, that by virtue of its geographical po 
     <lb/>sition and natural resources, has greater facilities 
     <lb/>for commerce and manufactures, 1 have yet to 
     <lb/>learn where it is ? You have immense tracts of 
     <lb/>the finest quality of coal at the pit's mouth, you 
     <lb/>have mines of iron, and alongside them again you 
     <lb/>have the lime required to convert iron to useful 
     <lb/>purposes. Only give facilities for making these 
     <lb/> resources productive, and what portion of the 
     <lb/>Union will develope itself more rapidly than No<lb break="no"/>va Scotia ? This Province has rapidly <choice><sic>develope<lb break="no"/>ed</sic><corr>developed</corr></choice> her resources, notwithstanding the disadvan<lb break="no"/>tageous position in which she is placed ; her 
     <lb/>mines of coal and iron have made progress, and 
     <lb/>her commercial progress bears witness to the 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
            
     energy of the people, but give us the demand 
     <lb/>
     that the wants of four millions of people will cre<lb break="no"/>ate, and she will increase to a remarkable degree 
     <lb/>
     in all the elements of prosperity. What has made 
     <lb/>
     Massachusetts the great manufacturing state it is? 
     <lb/>
     That the cotton of New Orleans comes to 
     <lb/>
     to be converted into cloth—that the iron of Penn<lb break="no"/>sylvania comes to be converted into cutlery in 
     <lb/>
     the manufacturies of Boston. Why can Massa<lb break="no"/>chusetts supply manufactures to the whole Union? 
     <lb/>
     Because the hostile tariffs meet her productions 
     <lb/>
     at every state boundary. Why should not Hali<lb break="no"/>fax be the Boston of British North America?— 
     <lb/>
     Why should not the cotton of New Orleans be 
     <lb/>
     manufactured in this city, and supplied to every 
     <lb/>
     town in the Confederacy? Why should not to<lb break="no"/>bacco be made, and sugar refined here as well as 
     <lb/>
     in Boston? No reason in the world is there why 
     <lb/>
     it should not be so, except that we have no mar<lb break="no"/>ket, no population, fenced in as we are by the 
     <lb/>
     hostile tariffs of every surrounding country Sup<lb break="no"/>posing each of the United States had remained 
     <lb/>
     isolated and separate communities, that each 
     <lb/>
     state had preserved its own revenue and trade 
     <lb/>
     loses, in what position would they be in now?— 
     <lb/>
     Weak, insignificant communities, instead of com<lb break="no"/>ponent parts of one of the strongest and proudest 
     <lb/>
     nations of the world. I ask then, is it not our 
     <lb/>
     duty to adopt this measure. If our trade shall be 
     <lb/>
     enlarged and wealth will be increased, then it is 
     <lb/>
     an answer to all the story we have heard about 
     <lb/>
     taxation. The people have been told time and 
     <lb/>
     again until they began to believe it is so—that 
     <lb/>
     they are going to be taxed to pay the debt of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. There is no foundation for such a belief, 
     <lb/>
     but suppose I assume for the sake of argument 
     <lb/>
     that the statement is partially true, and that in<lb break="no"/>stead of paying 10 we shall pay 15 or 17 percent; 
     <lb/>
     but if our commerce prosper as largely as I have 
     <lb/>
     predicted, then I ask the hon. member for Yar<lb break="no"/>mouth whether the mere trifle of increased duty 
     <lb/>
     should stand in the way, when compared with the 
     <lb/>
     progress that this country will make in all the 
     <lb/>
     elements of productive industry. It is not many 
     <lb/>
     years since the construction of railways was com<lb break="no"/>menced in this country, and I remember how 
     <lb/>
     many persons said they were to be our 
     <lb/>
     ruin. Mr. Howe was going to swamp us.— 
     <lb/>
     Our taxation was to be doubled. And 
     <lb/>
     a great many persons thought that if our 
     <lb/>
     duties were largely raised we would be ruined 
     <lb/>
     beyond redemption. I dare say the hon. mem 
     <lb/>
     ber for Yarmouth did a great deal to create the 
     <lb/>
     idea throughout the country, for he was then as 
     <lb/>
     now opposed to every progressive measure.— 
     <lb/>
     We built the Railways and the croakers have 
     <lb/>
     turned out false property. Our duties have been 
     <lb/>
     doubled, and I will undertake to say that there 
     <lb/>
     is not a man in the House who will say that we 
     <lb/>
     are not now better able to pay our increased 
     <lb/>
     duties than we were to pay the lesser duty ten 
     <lb/>
     years ago This is an illustration of what may 
     <lb/>
     be the result of the Union with the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Colonies It gives us room and 
     <lb/>
     expansion—it gives us what population will 
     <lb/>
     always afford ; and everything that promotes the 
     <lb/>
     wealth of a country, and while we have these no 
     <lb/>
     fear of taxation ruining us or cramping our

     energies. I do not intend to occupy the House

     <lb/>have, and 1 will tell you how. We are rapidly 
     <lb/>increasing in population even now but give us 
     <lb/>the facilities for commerce and manufactures that 
     <lb/>Union will afford then you will have hundreds 
     <lb/>where you have now one added to the number 
     <lb/>of the people. And the same thing will occur in 
     <lb/>Canada and the other Provinces. What is the 
     <lb/>reason that this Province has been for so many 
     <lb/>years sparsely settled —it is only where mines 
     <lb/>have been worked that you have any large centres 
     <lb/>of industry. Immigration seeks a country where 
     <lb/>there is plenty of room and work. Give us the 
     <lb/>population and the industry that Union will 
     <lb/>certainly bring with it, and you will have a 
     <lb/>greater ability to contribute towards defence, both 
     <lb/>in money and men.

            <p>
     When I listened to the hon. member for Yar<lb break="no"/>mouth, I thought of the last occasion when he 
     <lb/>
     pointed to the same map which now hangs be<lb break="no"/>fore me. He is the last mm in the world of 
     <lb/>
     whom I would say a single disrespectful word 
     <lb/>
     but from his anxiety to see anything beyond 
     <lb/>
     Yatmouth, he is at times, I might say at all 
     <lb/>
     times one of the most inconsistent man that ever 
     <lb/>
     sat in this House. No doubt every one is dis<lb break="no"/>posed to give the hon. member credit for his 
     <lb/>
     commercial enterprise for the zeal with which 
     <lb/>
     he discharges his duties, but the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country must know that on almost all the great 
     <lb/>
     questions which tend to promote the wealth and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, he has always been a drag on the 
     <lb/>
     wheel. Therefore I say that on a question like 
     <lb/>
     this gentlemen will not be disposed to accept his 
     <lb/>
     assertions or opinions with the confidence that 
     <lb/>
     they would otherwise be disposed to extend to 
     <lb/>
     them. When we were discussing the intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway, three years ago we saw the same 
     <lb/>
     map before us. On that occasion the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber in his attempt to defeat the lntercolonial pro<lb break="no"/>position resolved to the argument that the road 
     <lb/>
     we ought to build was the one to Pictou. But 
     <lb/>
     when the hon. member had an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     being consistent with himself building that road 
     <lb/>
     to Pictou what did he? His party came into 
     <lb/>
     power, and in fulfilment of the pledge which 
     <lb/>
     they had given when the hon. member was one 
     <lb/>
     of their supporters, proposed to construct the 
     <lb/>
     railway to Pictou, but this consistent gentleman 
     <lb/>
     opposed the measure to which he was solemnly 
     <lb/>
     pledged left his party because they would 
     <lb/>
     not violate their pledges as readily as him<lb break="no"/>self. Yet the hon. member told us to-day 
     <lb/>
     that he invariably acts upon principle. He left 
     <lb/>
     his party on that very question, although standing 
     <lb/>
     in the presence of the House  bet re that very 
     <lb/>
     ma.» he promised to support  us in carrying it—  
     <lb/>
     He says he did not want office,  I daresay he did 
     <lb/>
     not for himself but he has put it into my power 
     <lb/>
     to declare that if he did not wish to enter the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment himself be left the party that he sus<lb break="no"/>tained on the verv Pictou Railway question three 
     <lb/>
     years ago because some of his friends did not get 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     office. (Mr. Killam—No.) I say yes; the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member took occasion at a recent date to state 
     <lb/>
     that he left because I was appointed Railway 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner. He wished that another gentle<lb break="no"/>man, a personal follower of his own, should be 
     <lb/>
     appointed. I shall not trouble the House with 
     <lb/>
     any lengthy observations on the financial branch 
     <lb/>
     of this subject, but there are one or two points in 
     <lb/>
     the speech of the hon member for East Halifax, 
     <lb/>
     that I may briefly notice. He stated that the 
     <lb/>
     revenue derived from local sources, under Con<lb break="no"/>federation, would be $155,000. This sum added 
     <lb/>
     to the subsidy of 80 cents a head, amounting to 
     <lb/>
     $264,800, gives a total of $419,800, to be appro<lb break="no"/>priated for local purposes. Here I am quite con<lb break="no"/>tent to take the figures of the hon member, but he 
     <lb/>
     went further. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now to make a set off to this revenue for local 
     <lb/>
     purposes, the hon member for Halifax resorts to 
     <lb/>
     the most unfair method of assuming that future 
     <lb/>
     grants for local purposes will, for the future, be as 
     <lb/>
     large as they are this year. That hon member 
     <lb/>
     knows well, Sir, that never in the history of this 
     <lb/>
     country have the grants for Education, Roads 
     <lb/>
     and Bridges, Navigation securities, and special 
     <lb/>
     grants for such purposes as the St Peter Canal, 
     <lb/>
     and opening and enlarging many of the Harbors 
     <lb/>
     on our coasts been so large and munificent as 
     <lb/>
     during the last three years. And he also knows, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, that it has never been imagined by any one 
     <lb/>
     in this House that these large grants could be 
     <lb/>
     continued. Where Sir, are we to obtain the 
     <lb/>
     means to meet the obligations the country has 
     <lb/>
     assumed except by discontinuing these exception<lb break="no"/>al grants as the necessity arises. Whence is to 
     <lb/>
     come the interest on the Pictou Railway which 
     <lb/>
     already forms a considerable sum to the debt of our 
     <lb/>
     account? Where are we to find the subvention 
     <lb/>
     we are to pay to the Annapolis and Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Riilways? Why, Sir the hon member well 
     <lb/>
     knows that if Union did not take place, and all 
     <lb/>
     these liabilities fall upon our own shoulder, that 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding the prosperity of the country, 
     <lb/>
     we should be obliged not only to reduce all these 
     <lb/>
     special and exceptional grants, but be obliged to 
     <lb/>
     resort to additional taxation to sustain the credit 
     <lb/>
     of the country, and yet the hon gentleman ven<lb break="no"/>tures to place before the country the figures quo<lb break="no"/>ted in his speech as a fair estimate of our local 
     <lb/>
     outlay after the Union is consummated 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, 1 shall submit my estimate to the 
     <lb/>
     House and challenge a comparison of my figures 
     <lb/>
     with those of the hon member. The liabilities I 
     <lb/>
     put as follows:—

     or $4,640 dollars less than the amount now 
     <lb/>
     available for local purposes. The House will see 
     <lb/>
     that I have given the full amount of the Educa<lb break="no"/>tional grant, and I have also been induced to 
     <lb/>
     leave all the principal services at the full figure our 
     <lb/>
     altered circumstances will require The road 
     <lb/>
     grant I have somewhat reduced, as it is evident 
     <lb/>
     to all that as soon as our new obligations begin 
     <lb/>
     to weigh on the Treasury, that and other services 
     <lb/>
     must be curtailed to meet their demands. The 
     <lb/>
     Hon. member for Halifax has also unfairly in<lb break="no"/>creased the amount of local liabilities by includ<lb break="no"/>ing in many of the services named by him, sums 
     <lb/>
     which under Confederation will be borne by the 
     <lb/>
     general Revenues. Now Sir, this estimate is 
     <lb/>
     based on the supposition that the sources of our 
     <lb/>
     local Revenue will not in the future yield a larger 
     <lb/>
     amount than at present, but such a proposition 
     <lb/>
     seriously made would be laughed at. Why, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     what do we see on the papers on this table ? — 
     <lb/>
     This, Sir, that the casual Revenue and receipts 
     <lb/>
     from Crown Lands above, two items of our 
     <lb/>
     local Revenue have increased three fold within 
     <lb/>
     the last four years, while the receipts from Gold 
     <lb/>Mines, also form a new and increasing source of 
     <lb/>Revenue Now, Sir, without being subject to the 
     <lb/>charge of being too sanguine, I may fairly 
     <lb/>assume that all those sources of Revenue shall be 
     <lb/>as prosperous for the next five years as they have 
     <lb/>been in the past. But to keep within the safest 
     <lb/>bounds, suppose they only double within that 
     <lb/>time, and the Hon member would have an ad<lb break="no"/>ditional $l55,000 for local purposes, so that in<lb break="no"/>stead of being obliged to resort to direct taxation, 
     <lb/>he might by the exercise of the economy and 
     <lb/>financial skill for which he is so famous, not only 
     <lb/>meet all his wants in a liberal manner but 
     <lb/>actually leave a balance in the chest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The hon member for Yarmouth tells us that we 
     <lb/>
     cannot expect any commercial advantages from 
     <lb/>
     connection with Canada that there was not nor 
     <lb/>
     could there be any communication between us 
     <lb/>
     I am surprised to hear the hon member make 
     <lb/>
     such a statement. Is the trade of a country 
     <lb/>
     which reaches the enormous sum of one hundred 
     <lb/>
     millions a year worth nothing? Does he not 
     <lb/>
     know that our intercourse with that country is 
     <lb/>
     already very considerable and is rapidly increas<lb break="no"/>ing Her politicians and merchants are opening 
     <lb/>
     up new outlets for trade, and endeavoring in 
     <lb/>
     every way possible to develope the resources of 
     <lb/>
     the country to the utmost limit, and it only re<lb break="no"/>quires time to make these efforts successful. In<lb break="no"/>deed, the merchants of that country manifest a 
     <lb/>
     spirit of enterprise and energy which our own 
     <lb/>
     would do well to observe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Many hon members, the hon member for East 
     <lb/>
     Halifax among the number, have stated that this 
     <lb/>
     question is not understood in England—that Mr 
     <lb/>
     Cardwell has been hastily drawn into the support 
     <lb/>
     of a measure that his own judgment would not 
     <lb/>
     approve of. I can only say that I have lately 
     <lb/>
     had an opportunity of seeing some of the loyal 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
   
     dependencies of Great Britain—of seeing a group 
     <lb/>
     of colonies having as enterprising and intelligent 
     <lb/>
     class of men as are to be seen in any part of the 
     <lb/>
     globe. Under the most adverse circumstances 
     <lb/>
     they have pressed forward the industrial resources 
     <lb/>
     of their respective countries, small as they are, 
     <lb/>
     until now they feel encouraged in looking to the 
     <lb/>
     future. These men understand as thoroughly as 
     <lb/>
     any men that I have ever met with, the condition 
     <lb/>
     of the Empire and the colonial dependencies;  and 
     <lb/>
     I was never more gratified than to find that they 
     <lb/>
     one and all, manifested a strong desire to see this 
     <lb/>
     union perfected. They are British in all their 
     <lb/>
     feelings and aspirations, and look upon the con<lb break="no"/>summation of this union as another step towards 
     <lb/>
     the strengthening and consolidation of British 
     <lb/>
     power in the world. Men more capable of form<lb break="no"/>ing a correct judgment on the subject I did not 
     <lb/>
     meet anywhere. That is an evidence of the opin<lb break="no"/>ions formed respecting the proposed union by 
     <lb/>
     men not biased by prejudice; in fact, wherever 
     <lb/>
     you find Englishmen who understand the condi<lb break="no"/>tion and relations of these colonies they are all in 
     <lb/>
     favor of this scheme. This is a reply, to a large 
     <lb/>
     extent, to the argument of the hon member for 
     <lb/>
     East Halifax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been said outside of this House that the 
     <lb/>
     result of this scheme will be the political extinct<lb break="no"/>ion of its promoters. A good authority with 
     <lb/>
     some has told us that the men who carry this 
     <lb/>
     scheme must make up their minds to go off the 
     <lb/>
     arena of public life, and their places will be filled 
     <lb/>
     by those who are opposing this measure I am 
     <lb/>
     quite content. Starting young in politics I am 
     <lb/>
     naturally desirous of seeing the country prosper 
     <lb/>
     for I feel I must more or less participate in that 
     <lb/>
     prosperity; but all I can say personally is this—if 
     <lb/>
     the union be carried I shall be quite satisfied 
     <lb/>
     whoever may reap the fruits. It makes little 
     <lb/>
     difference after all who shall receive the political 
     <lb/>
     advantages whilst the interests of the country are 
     <lb/>
     advanced, as they will be by the successful con<lb break="no"/>summation of the measure of Union. But this 
     <lb/>
     also let me say the opponents of Union may 
     <lb/>
     succeed in deriving a little temporary popularity 
     <lb/>
     by their course, but the people sooner or later, 
     <lb/>
     when they see the benefits  that the scheme 
     <lb/>
     confers upon them will acknowledge their mistake 
     <lb/>
     and give their confidence and esteem, where it is 
     <lb/>
     properly due. I am quite content to wait the 
     <lb/>
     coming of that time when the very men who may 
     <lb/>
     now reject Union will be the same who will 
     <lb/>
     accept it and recognize the claims of its friends 
     <lb/>
     and promoters to their consideration. (Cheers)

     speak and instruct their representatives on

     this great question. But this right—their right

     —as I shall hereafter attempt to show, having 
     <lb/>
     been denied them, it becomes imperative on 
     <lb/>
     us to speak in their behalf; and when I reflect 
     <lb/>
     upon this, and consider that perhaps I am par<lb break="no"/>ticipating in the last discussion of the last Par<lb break="no"/>liament of Nova Scotia, I feel almost borne 
     <lb/>
     down by the responsibilities of the position— 
     <lb/>
     by the solemnities of the hour. The Prov. Sec. 
     <lb/>
     says we shrink from the discussion of this 
     <lb/>
     question. No sir, we do not. We never have 
     <lb/>
     been backward on any public occasion 
     <lb/>
     to discuss it, and all we ask now 
     <lb/>
     is that it may be carried down to 
     <lb/>
     every village and town in Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     and upon full and fair discussion the de<lb break="no"/>cision of the people accepted. The member 
     <lb/>
     for Inverness says all the lawyers, all the lead<lb break="no"/>ing statesmen—all the professed politicians fa<lb break="no"/>vour the scheme and therefore the strong in<lb break="no"/>ference is that it is right. I beg to differ with 
     <lb/>
     him in his conclusion. When the professional

     living hy politics—agree upon any measure I 
     <lb/>
     cannot regard it as evidence that it will be 
     <lb/>
     beneficial to their country. The simple fact that 
     <lb/>
     it is to improve the passion of those of them who 
     <lb/>
     may be successful may make them unanimous 
     <lb/>
     in supporting it, and comparing the list of 
     <lb/>
     salaries in Canada with those in Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     we find so great a difference that it is not im<lb break="no"/>possible, but it has influence here. Let me 
     <lb/>
     mention a few of the salaries found on that 
     <lb/>list.<lb/>

            <p>
     From this comparison we might, if so dis<lb break="no"/>posed, draw the inference that the unanimity 
     <lb/>
     of our professional politicians arises from the 
     <lb/>
     fact that Confederation will give them very 
     <lb/>
     much larger salaries. But, much as we desire 
     <lb/>
     to discuss this question, we must protest 
     <lb/>
     against treating it in the tone and style of the 
     <lb/>
     past few days. The most dissolute and aban<lb break="no"/>doned character, when brought into the pre<lb break="no"/>sence of his death-warrant, assumes a more 
     <lb/>
     reformed and sometimes evinces a Christian- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     like spirit. The house has now before it its 
     <lb/>
     death-warrant, and while we may not hope to 
     <lb/>
     see it die like a Christian, it should at least 
     <lb/>
     imitate the Indian savage, who sings his death 
     <lb/>
     song with calmness and dignity, in the belief 
     <lb/>
     that he is about to enter the happy hunting- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     grounds. and in like manner did I expect to 
     <lb/>
     see the advocates of this proposition sing the 
     <lb/>
     death-song, inasmuch as it will give them the 
     <lb/>
     entrance to Canada, the " happy hunting- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     ground" for office-seekers. The government 
     <lb/>
     charged as who oppose this scheme with mere<lb break="no"/>ly desiring delay, that on a change of govern<lb break="no"/>ment we may be in a position to carry the 
     <lb/>
     measure ourselves and divide the spoils. I do 
     <lb/>
     not accept the charge. l fling it back to those 
     <lb/>
     who make it, and tell them they are not the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     men to impugn our motives. They who raised 
     <lb/>
     this question—who gave it existence—who 
     <lb/>
     have arranged all the offices: the Judgships, 
     <lb/>
     the Governorships, and others, and who, 
     <lb/>
     when this measure is forced through as 
     <lb/>
     they are doing, shall fill those high posi<lb break="no"/>tions, are the men of all others open to a 
     <lb/>
     charge of motives, and they should have 
     <lb/>
     more modesty than raise it. Sir, I envy no 
     <lb/>
     man his office or his honors, and God forbid 
     <lb/>
     that I should ever enjoy them at the sacrifice 
     <lb/>
     of my countrymen's rights. Others may take 
     <lb/>
     them, but however great their reward may be 
     <lb/>
     personally, it will not make their country's 
     <lb/>
     wounds the less sore. It is not true, as was 
     <lb/>
     believed in the dark days of superstition, that 
     <lb/>
     "a salve to the sword will cure the wound it 
     <lb/>
     has given." I oppose this proposition because 
     <lb/>
     I believe it wrong in itself ; because, territo<lb break="no"/>rially situated as we are, it will tend to destroy 
     <lb/>
     the harmony and good feeling existing among 
     <lb/>
     these Provinces by bringing into conflict their 
     <lb/>
     diversified interests; that it will retard the 
     <lb/>
     prosperity of this province, by imposing upon 
     <lb/>
     us heavy financial burthens ; that it will 
     <lb/>
     weaken our connection with the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try and our means of defence, by rendering 
     <lb/>
     the people less attached to their form of gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and ultimately carry us into the arms 
     <lb/>
     of the Great Republic. Having taxed the pa<lb break="no"/>tience of the House on a former occasion with 
     <lb/>
     my objections to the Quebec scheme, I need 
     <lb/>
     not now repeat them, although they are ex<lb break="no"/>actly applicable as against this resolution. 
     <lb/>
     For although not mentioned in it, the hon. in<lb break="no"/>troducer of the resolution has declared his entire 
     <lb/>
     approval of it, and will take care to appoint 
     <lb/>
     on the delegation a majority holding the same 
     <lb/>
     opinions as himself. Beside this we have be<lb break="no"/>fore us nothing from any of the other Provinces 
     <lb/>
     to lead us to suppose that they have abandon<lb break="no"/>ed the Quebec arrangement. Indeed I do not 
     <lb/>
     see how the Canadian ministry can, when 
     <lb/>
     they only carried the measure through their 
     <lb/>
     house on a distinct pledge, that there should 
     <lb/>
     be no departure from the terms agreed upon 
     <lb/>
     at Quebec. I shall trouble the house with but 
     <lb/>
     one extract to this point, and from the speech 
     <lb/>
     of Hon. Atty. Gen. Carder, who said:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote><p>
     " I have already declared, in my own name, and 
     <lb/>
     on behalf of the government, that the delegates who 
     <lb/>
     go to England will accept from the Imperial govern<lb break="no"/>ment no act but one based on the resolutions adopt<lb break="no"/>ed by this house, and they will not bring back any 
     <lb/>
     other. (Hear, hear.) I have pledged my word of 
     <lb/>
     honor, and that of the government, to that effect." 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     After such a pledge how can the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     delegates depart from the Quebec scheme? 
     <lb/>
     And presuming that the honorable members 
     <lb/>
     for Richmond and Inverness, Messrs. Miller 
     <lb/>
     and McDonnell, are appointed on the delega<lb break="no"/>tion they will be overruled by the Canadians 
     <lb/>
     and their co-delegates from Nova Scotia. I 
     <lb/>
     had proposed to direct the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     house to the obstacles to a Union, other than 
     <lb/>
     exists, in the configuration of the territory 
     <lb/>
     which it is proposed to confederate; but the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Yarmouth has so well illus<lb break="no"/>trated this that I need not detain the house, 
     <lb/>
     I am sure those who listened to the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman this afternoon must have felt the utter 
     <lb/>
     impossibility of uniting and so interweaving 
     <lb/>
     the several interests of that territory as to 
     <lb/>
     make them harmonize and blend as one. Our 
     <lb/>
     Province is almost an island,—detached

     Here is a territory the size of the entire Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Nova Scotia, so long as it remains un<lb break="no"/>settled must render a union between New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick and Canada an impossibility. 
     <lb/>
     The Fin Secy. in addressing the house read 
     <lb/>
     extracts from speeches of Hon. Mr. Howe, 
     <lb/>
     advocating the Intercolonial Railway as "a 
     <lb/>
     means to an end." The end contemplated 
     <lb/>
     here, I presume, is the settlement of this ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, and the making, in such settlement, 
     <lb/>
     that connection between the two Provinces as 
     <lb/>
     might render, at some period, a political 
     <lb/>
     Union possible. And until that be first done 
     <lb/>
     I hold it is madness to enforce such a Union. 
     <lb/>
     Nor did I believe that with the boundary line 
     <lb/>
     of the two Provinces wiped out by settlements 
     <lb/>
     can the extraordinarv anticipations of the De<lb break="no"/>legates be realized from a country shaped as 
     <lb/>
     are these Provinces. Turn to the map of the 
     <lb/>
     world and you will find every country, occu<lb break="no"/>pying a first. class position, compact in shape, 
     <lb/>
     and just as the country departs from that it 
     <lb/>
     descends in the scale of nations. England has 
     <lb/>
     been styled " the tight little isle of the sea." 
     <lb/>
     There is in her a compact territory, which af<lb break="no"/>fords that blending of interest which leads to 
     <lb/>
     a harmonious co-operation for the good of the 
     <lb/>
     whole. We have been frequently reminded 
     <lb/>
     since this question arose of the Heptarchy in 
     <lb/>
     England, and the great results of her Union. 
     <lb/>
     Union for her was a natural act, and so may 
     <lb/>
     it be said of England and Scotland. The bound<lb break="no"/>ary line is wiped out by the dense population, 
     <lb/>
     which flow back and forth, that the in<lb break="no"/>fluence of the interest of each extends 
     <lb/>
     into and operates upon the other, forming a 
     <lb/>
     strong and enduring union. Ireland has not 
     <lb/>
     this territorial connection. The influence of 
     <lb/>
     her interests is bounded by the sea-shore, and 
     <lb/>
     naturally seeks a centre within her own terri<lb break="no"/>tory. There is not the same interweaving of 
     <lb/>
     interests, and consequently the bond of union 
     <lb/>
     ia acknowledged to be weaker than between 
     <lb/>
     England and Scotland. England grew in 
     <lb/>
     greatness and power by every union which 
     <lb/>
     commanded  territory and people and interests, 
     <lb/>
     having for each a natural affinity, but when 
     <lb/>
     she  went beyond that she gained only elements  
     <lb/>
     Of weakness, She crossed the Channel into 
     <lb/>
     France, and attempted to draw that people 
     <lb/>
     and country to her, but the more territory she 
     <lb/>
     acquired  the weaker she became, and eventu<lb break="no"/>ally yielded to the inflexible law of nature that 
     <lb/>
     the drawings  of all people are to their natural 
     <lb/>
     centre of interest. Look at France upon the 
     <lb/>
     map No straggling arms or long jutting head 
     <lb/>
     lands, but all compact, and forming a country 
     <lb/>
     which claims and holds a first position  among 
     <lb/>
     Empires. Go over the map of Europe, and 
     <lb/>
     just as you find countries departing from that 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     compact shape you find them descending in 
     <lb/>
     the scale of nations. But I may be referred to 
     <lb/>
     England's colonies scattered all over the globe 
     <lb/>
     and having no territorial connection with Eng<lb break="no"/>land, and be asked how she has held them 
     <lb/>
     without their being a source of weakness?— 
     <lb/>
     Simply by permitting them to manage all 
     <lb/>
     matters of internal policy as suited 
     <lb/>
     themselves. Attempting no action affecting 
     <lb/>
     the internal interest of a colony further than 
     <lb/>
     was compensated for by a protection of her 
     <lb/>
     external interests. By this wise and liberal po<lb break="no"/>licy she has seen her colonies grow and pros<lb break="no"/>per in a remarkable degree. She departed 
     <lb/>
     from this policy when she proposed to tax the 
     <lb/>
     thirteen New England States, but the people 
     <lb/>
     regarded it as a violation of their chartered 
     <lb/>
     rights, and they severed the connection with 
     <lb/>
     the parent state. England saw the mistake 
     <lb/>
     Lord North had committed, and compel<lb break="no"/>led him to repeal the act imposing a tax on 
     <lb/>
     colonists, and from that time to the present 
     <lb/>
     the policy pursued by England towards her 
     <lb/>
     colonies has been growing more enlightened 
     <lb/>
     and liberal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But we have been told in this discussion. 
     <lb/>
     that England takes very strong ground on this 
     <lb/>
     question, and urges it for our acceptance, and 
     <lb/>
     so far have members of Government gone as 
     <lb/>
     to bring to their aid the name of Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     the Queen. I have for some months seen that 
     <lb/>
     name used in the public newspapers in con<lb break="no"/>nection with this scheme, and felt it difficult 
     <lb/>
     to restrain my indignation at these who resort<lb break="no"/>ed to such unjust means to influence public 
     <lb/>
     opinion, but when the hon. Prov. Seccretary 
     <lb/>
     took the same course in introducing his re<lb break="no"/>solution, I listened to him with absolute 
     <lb/>
     disgust. Who taught those men to take 
     <lb/>
     such liberties with the name of our be<lb break="no"/>loved Sovereign? It was Governor Eyre, of 
     <lb/>
     Jamaica, and his officials who headed procla<lb break="no"/>mations " The Queen's Wish," and who in their 
     <lb/>
     administration first exasperated the people and 
     <lb/>
     then butchered them. Let our officials beware 
     <lb/>
     how far they follow that unfortunate example. 
     <lb/>
     But, says the Prov. Secretary, it is mention<lb break="no"/>ed in the speech at the opening of Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     Suppose it is, we all know that except in cases 
     <lb/>
     where ministers do not feel that it would in<lb break="no"/>terfere with their policy, the Sovereign does 
     <lb/>
     not alter a line or syllable of the opening 
     <lb/>
     speech. If there is one thing more than 
     <lb/>
     another for which we love and honor Queen 
     <lb/>
     Victoria, it is for her home virtues, and yet 
     <lb/>
     the ministry claim the right to regulate even 
     <lb/>
     her household—to say what maids of honour 
     <lb/>
     shall surround her person. Again we are told 
     <lb/>
     that we should accept this scheme from res<lb break="no"/>pect to the wishes of the British Government. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, I yield to no man in my respect for a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, which is a reflex of the opinions and 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of so liberty-loving a people as 
     <lb/>
     those of the British Isles, and when I study 
     <lb/>
     the policy established by that reflex of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish ideas, I both admire and respect it. Com<lb break="no"/>mencing with the repeal of that law under 
     <lb/>
     which Lord North taxed the New England 
     <lb/>
     Colonies, and from which they rebelled, I 
     <lb/>
     trace down a policy growing year by 
     <lb/>
     year more liberal, progressing with the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the age, and conferring upon 
     <lb/>
     us colonists all the privileges and freedom 
     <lb/>
     which the most ardent lover of self govern<lb break="no"/>ment can desire. And now should Mr. Card<lb break="no"/>

     well, who, in a short administration has had 
     <lb/>
     in Jamaica a butchery and in Australia the 
     <lb/>
     machinery of government brought to a stand, 
     <lb/>
     insist upon our accepting a certain scheme, 
     <lb/>
     no matter how injurious we may consider it 
     <lb/>
     to our interests our respect for the long esta<lb break="no"/>blished policy of England should of itself make 
     <lb/>
     us hesitate. No man nor no single govern<lb break="no"/>ment changes the policy of Britain in a day. 
     <lb/>
     No policy lives there unless founded upon 
     <lb/>
     public sentiment. And when a Colonial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary attempts to enforce a change in the entire 
     <lb/>
     constitution ofthe country in which we live, 
     <lb/>
     regardless of our wishes, we may well regard 
     <lb/>
     it only as the act of an individual, until we 
     <lb/>
     know that the people who make and unmake 
     <lb/>
     Colonial Secretaries have turned their atten<lb break="no"/>tion to it and approve of it. I am told that 
     <lb/>
     public opinion in England does favor this 
     <lb/>
     scheme. It may and still be in harmony with 
     <lb/>
     the policy pursued towards us. Public opinion 
     <lb/>
     in England may be founded upon the infor<lb break="no"/>mation given that the leaders of all parties 
     <lb/>
     had combined in the scheme of Union and the 
     <lb/>
     usual inference would be that the mass of the 
     <lb/>
     people approved. But if the Pro. Secy. will 
     <lb/>
     grant us a general election; and if a majo<lb break="no"/>rity, overwhelming as I believe it would 
     <lb/>
     be, is found against this Union, and 
     <lb/>
     public opinion thereafter insist upon our 
     <lb/>
     adopting it then shall I believe there is a change 
     <lb/>
     of policy by the people of England, and then, 
     <lb/>
     but not until that is thus shown, shall I think 
     <lb/>
     it necessary to consider what sacrifices of our 
     <lb/>
     interests we should make from respect to the 
     <lb/>
     British Government. We are told that there 
     <lb/>
     is not time for this; that events are gathering 
     <lb/>
     about us that preclude the possibility of a dis<lb break="no"/>solution; that we are threatened with invasion 
     <lb/>
     and that unless we yield to the wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     British Government, our country will not be 
     <lb/>
     protected. The men who tell us this slander 
     <lb/>
     Old England and are guilty of treason. What 
     <lb/>
     danger threatens us now? Whence comes 
     <lb/>
     the threatened invasion? Not from any act 
     <lb/>
     we or any of our people have committed, nor 
     <lb/>
     from anything connected with our internal or 
     <lb/>
     external interests, but from that which is akin 
     <lb/>
     to the act about to be perpetrated here: a 
     <lb/>
     forced union. Ah, sir, forced marriages sel<lb break="no"/>dom prove fortunate, and the forced union of 
     <lb/>
     Ireland with England is bearing fruit. We 
     <lb/>
     had a few years ago O'Connoll's great agita<lb break="no"/>tion for a repeal of that union, but it was res<lb break="no"/>trained in its action by the master mind of the 
     <lb/>
    great Dan and by the influences of the Crown, 
     <lb/>but housands of Irishmen have gone out from 
     <lb/>under the British flag, feeling in their heart 
     <lb/>that their country has been wronged, and have 
     <lb/>found under other flags the influences that have 
     <lb/>strengthened and perpetuated that sense of 
     <lb/>wrong, and thus they and their offspring 
     <lb/>have been but too easily led by designing 
     <lb/>knaves into this Fenian movement, which 
     <lb/>now threatens our peace. And now are we 
     <lb/>to be told, when we have placed the entire re<lb break="no"/>sources of our country for defence—when 
     <lb/>every militia man is falling into line, and 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia one vast drill shed, that England 
     <lb/>will not help us—meet the danger she has 
     <lb/>brought upon us—unless we agree to this 
     <lb/>scheme of Confederation. Then, sir, would she 
     <lb/>stand disgraced before the civilized world. 
     <lb/>If the British Parliament sustain a govern<lb break="no"/>ment that makes this the condition upon 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
          
     which they will now aid us, the whole world 
     <lb/>
     will ring with the Frenchman's cry, " Perfidi<lb break="no"/>ous Albion," and old Cromwell will come 
     <lb/>
     back to empty another Parliament House. 
     <lb/>
     No, every war ship that comes steaming into 
     <lb/>
     our harbour contradicts this assertion, and 
     <lb/>
     every intelligence we receive from England 
     <lb/>
     assures us that the peeple sustain the govern<lb break="no"/>ment in making our protection their honor. 
     <lb/>
     I have under my hand a letter from a manu<lb break="no"/>facturer in Manchester, who holds the position 
     <lb/>
     of Major in the volunteers. in whose ranks 
     <lb/>
     some of the best blood of England has en<lb break="no"/>listed, and in this letter there are the strongest 
     <lb/>assurances of an interest in our position and a 
     <lb/>desire to aid us in repelling the danger. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Speaking of Fenianism I am reminded that 
     <lb/>
     the hon member for Richmond announced, on 
     <lb/>
     the authority of a New York paper, that one 
     <lb/>
     of the planks of the Fenian platform is to op<lb break="no"/>pose the confederation of these Provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Prov. Sec'y also attempts to draw from 
     <lb/>
     this an argument in favor of his resolution. 
     <lb/>
     Now the object of Fenianism is the liberation 
     <lb/>
     of Ireland. The first necessity in this attempt 
     <lb/>
     is to secure a territory that will serve as a base 
     <lb/>
     for operations. This territory must also be 
     <lb/>
     British, because the seizing of any other 
     <lb/>
     would involve a double conflict, hence it is of 
     <lb/>
     the first importance to Fenianism that there 
     <lb/>
     shall be a British Province within easy reach 
     <lb/>
     of them. Suppose that to-morrow we should 
     <lb/>
     be annexed to the United States, that organi<lb break="no"/>zation would cease to exist. Othello's occu<lb break="no"/>pation would be gone. There would be no 
     <lb/>
     suitable and assailable British territory left 
     <lb/>
     for them to secure as a base of Operations, and 
     <lb/>
     I do not doubt that the leaders of that move<lb break="no"/>ment, seeing plainly that annexation to Canada 
     <lb/>
     will soon be followed by annexation of the 
     <lb/>
     whole to the American States, and feeling the 
     <lb/>
     strong necessity of having us remain British 
     <lb/>
     provinces, do not favour Confederation. I do 
     <lb/>
     no mean to say that those who here favor it 
     <lb/>
     do so as the means to the end : annexation to 
     <lb/>
     the United States, but I firmly believe that will 
     <lb/>
     be the result ; and if I did not value British 
     <lb/>
     connection; if I did not value the liberty and 
     <lb/>
     blessings which flow to us from the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion under which we live, and if I were so 
     <lb/>
     craven hearted as not to be ready to meet any 
     <lb/>
     danger arising to us because of our connection 
     <lb/>
     with England, I, too, would become a Con<lb break="no"/>federate, and seek to enter that current which 
     <lb/>
     will sweep us all into republicanism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I acknowledge England expects us to do 
     <lb/>
     more for our own defence than we have hith<lb break="no"/>erto done, but when this is expected of us, and 
     <lb/>
     when we are ready and willingto meet the ex<lb break="no"/>pectations, is it, I ask, the time to curtail our 
     <lb/>
     liberties—to take away our rights? When a 
     <lb/>
     greater strain is put upon the wheel, it is not 
     <lb/>
     the time to cut out part of the spokes; when 
     <lb/>
     the gale increases, it is not the time to weaken 
     <lb/>
     the cable; nor is this the time to weaken our 
     <lb/>
     attachment to the mother country by this Con<lb break="no"/>federation under which we shall at all times 
     <lb/>
     feel perplexed to know whether we owe alle<lb break="no"/>giance to England or Canada. Like one of 
     <lb/>
     Brigham Young's children adrift in the harem, 
     <lb/>
     we shall feel we have too many mothers. We 
     <lb/>
     have here a good many men claiming descent 
     <lb/>
     from the old Loyalists, men who settled this 
     <lb/>
     country in the belief that the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment gave up the claim to tax these colonies 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     They came here in the belief that the revenues 
     <lb/>
     they or their descendants raised would be en<lb break="no"/>tirely under their own control and disposal; 
     <lb/>
     and now after nearly a century, will England, 
     <lb/>
     without the consent of the people of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, hand over our entire revenues, our en<lb break="no"/>tire property, and our constitution, to a Pro<lb break="no"/>vince more difficult of access to us than the 
     <lb/>
     mother country is, and yet at the same time 
     <lb/>
     claim from us greater contributions to the na<lb break="no"/>tional defences? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>We have been told that it is necessary to place 
     <lb/>all our means of defence under one head . If 
     <lb/>this means that our Militia systems shall be as<lb break="no"/>similated, it can as well be done without as 
     <lb/>with confederation: but if it means that being 
     <lb/>under one control the men shall be drawn 
     <lb/>from one province to another, then I question 
     <lb/>very much the propriety of so doing. I believe 
     <lb/>the local militia of England or Scotland cannot 
     <lb/>be taken beyond certain limits without a spe<lb break="no"/>cial Act of Parliament, and the cases in which 
     <lb/>it would be wise to do so are rare indeed. The 
     <lb/>man who may not have a natural inclination 
               <lb/>nor a training to the "pomp and circum<lb break="no"/>stance" of military life is comparatively use<lb break="no"/>less except for <hi rendition="simple:italic">home defence</hi>. His home and his 
     <lb/>household altars he will defend with his life, 
     <lb/>but take him beyond these influences and he 
     <lb/>needs a long training to be any service in war<lb break="no"/>fare. The means of defence to a country de<lb break="no"/>pends upon the population to territory. These 
     <lb/>Provinces are alike assailable through their 
     <lb/>whole frontier, and while we have twenty of 
     <lb/>a population to the square mile of territory 
     <lb/>New Brunswick and Canada have only eight. 
     <lb/>Hence the only result of placing the control 
     <lb/>of the militia of the provinces under one head 
     <lb/>by confederation will be to draw the militia 
     <lb/>men from this province to the others: a pro<lb break="no"/>position which we have already seen does not 
     <lb/>find favor with the militia. We have seen al<lb break="no"/>ready two regiments refuse the oath of <choice><sic>allegi<lb break="no"/>anch</sic><corr>allegiance</corr></choice> under the impression that power had 
     <lb/>been given to take them to Canada—and I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that such a feeling is general. The peo<lb break="no"/>ple will rise en masse to defend this country, 
     <lb/>which is dear to them. but will utterly refuse 
     <lb/>to be taken away into the wilderness, and 
     <lb/>leave their homes unprotected.

     <lb/>cry shame on them for holding this view? No 
     <lb/>sir—they are ready to defend Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>the utmost. With their faces seaward they 
     <lb/>will wait and watch for the foe, and should he 
     <lb/>come they will give no man occasion to cry 
     <lb/>shame. Every breeze that comes across the 
     <lb/>waters to them from old England will bring 
     <lb/>courage to their hearts and nerve to their arm; 
     <lb/>but take them a thousand miles away into 
     <lb/>Canada and their arms will fall unnerved and 
     <lb/>powerless at the thought that their own homes 
     <lb/>are undefended. Connected with this argu<lb break="no"/>ment of defence we are told the intercolonial 
     <lb/>railway is essential and can only be had by 
     <lb/>confederation. I admit its value for defence, 
     <lb/>but why cannot it be had without this scheme. 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have always 
     <lb/>been ready and anxious to build it, and have 
     <lb/>offered to do more than perhaps their just 
     <lb/>share, and now we are quite willing to build 
     <lb/>it upon the principles which form the basis of 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     this scheme of confederation and which the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians declare is just and the only one 
     <lb/>
     upon which Union can take place. Now if 
     <lb/>
     this principle of representation by population 
     <lb/>
     and eighty cents per head all round be just it 
     <lb/>
     can easily be applied to the building of this 
     <lb/>
     railroad. The total population of the three 
     <lb/>
     Provinces is 3,090,561, and the length of road, 
     <lb/>
     as given by Mr. Fleming, from Truro to 
     <lb/>
     River du Loup is 422 miles. Nova Scotia and 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick have a population of 582,904, 
     <lb/>
     which would make their share a fraction less 
     <lb/>
     than 80 miles. Now they are not only willing 
     <lb/>
     to build this but have actually contracted for 
     <lb/>
     109 miles from Truro to Moncton,—29 miles 
     <lb/>
     more than their share by the principle of popu<lb break="no"/>lation,—and all that the Canadians require to 
     <lb/>
     do is to apply the principle and build down to 
     <lb/>
     meet us at Moncton. I should like much to 
     <lb/>
     see them thus reverse the principle and give 
     <lb/>
     us a foretaste of it, but there is no probability 
     <lb/>
     that they will. They know too well that un<lb break="no"/>der confederation our excess of contributions 
     <lb/>
     to the general fund will more than meet the 
     <lb/>
     interest on the entire cost of the road. I shall 
     <lb/>
     not trouble the house at this late hour with 
     <lb/>
     any calculations or arguments to this point 
     <lb/>
     but I believe on a former occasion I 
     <lb/>
     proved to the entire satisfaction of the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Secretary that Nova Scotia alone 
     <lb/>
     would be better off in a financial view to build 
     <lb/>
     the road herself than enter into this confeder<lb break="no"/>ation under the Quebec scheme. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     Prov. Sec'y has often characterized the propo<lb break="no"/>sition of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to 
     <lb/>
     build seven-twelfths of the road as monstrous; 
     <lb/>
     but the Hon. George Brown, speaking at To<lb break="no"/>ronto of the building of it under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, says:—" It may, however, be some com<lb break="no"/>fort for my friends to know that we have a 
     <lb/>
     prospect of getting the road built upon terms 
     <lb/>
     much more reasonable than we had ever 
     <lb/>
     hoped to obtain." Now, while we object to 
     <lb/>
     these terms, we say that if it be so necessary 
     <lb/>
     for defence, we have already contracted for 
     <lb/>
     29 miles more than our share by the principles 
     <lb/>
     which are represented as just under Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. A great deal has been said of the 
     <lb/>
     commercial advantages of this road, and of 
     <lb/>
     the great effect it is to have upon this city. 
     <lb/>
     That it is to make the Province one vast bee<lb break="no"/>hive, and that the traffic of a continent is to 
     <lb/>
     centre here. I think the report of the last sur<lb break="no"/>vey made in 1864 by Mr. Fleming, should be 
     <lb/>
    sufficient to dispel any such delusion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I find that nearly all the lines given by him 
     <lb/>
     strike the European and North American rail<lb break="no"/>way about 37 miles from St. John, and then 
     <lb/>
     he shews that all the freight traffic passing 
     <lb/>
     down from Canada will seek the nearest out<lb break="no"/>let, which will be St. John or St. Andrews.— 
     <lb/>
     But supposing we take the central route, that 
     <lb/>
     route strikes 13 miles west of Moncton, making 
     <lb/>
     St John a nearer port than Halifax by 112 
     <lb/>
     miles. He says on page 90:—

     " By the projected lines for the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way, St. Andrews and St. John, on the Bay of Fun<lb break="no"/>dy, are the nearest open winter ports to Canada with<lb break="no"/>in British territory, and they would, therefore, be

     <lb/>
     proposed by this resolution, our constitution. 
     <lb/>
     It is not in our commissions. The supporters 
     <lb/>
     of the resolution argue on the extent of our 
     <lb/>
     powers; but I look more to our right to do so, 
     <lb/>
     without first consulting those whom we rep<lb break="no"/>resent. If I understand Responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, it means that we either have the sanc<lb break="no"/>tion of the people to carry a measure, or that 
     <lb/>
     we shall decide upon questions in such a way 
     <lb/>
     as we feel will meet their approval—that we 
     <lb/>
     must ever keep in view a going back to the 
     <lb/>
     people to have our acts approved or condemn<lb break="no"/>ed. The charter of our rights is not found in 
     <lb/>
     any one despatch from the Colonial Office, but 
     <lb/>
     runs through a number, granting one conces<lb break="no"/>sion after another, all tending to this one point, 
     <lb/>
           
     that the people shall be consulted, and to them 
     <lb/>
     we are to be responsible for our action here.

     Under this resolution before us public opi<lb break="no"/>nion cannot have is legitimate influence. It 
     <lb/>
     is not proposed that the action of members is 
     <lb/>
     ever to he passed upon by the people. Neither 
     <lb/>
     can it be said that because the question of 
     <lb/>
     Union has been for some years agitated that 
     <lb/>
     we were empowered at the last general elec<lb break="no"/>tion to pass it. The resolution of this house in 
     <lb/>
     1861, on which the hon. Pro. Secy. lays such 
     <lb/>
     great stress, speaks of the obstacles to Union 
     <lb/>
     and of the desirability of having "the question 
     <lb/>
     set at rest." From the action of the delegates 
     <lb/>
     appointed under that resolution it was sup<lb break="no"/>posed to be " set at rest" as impracticable, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore was not a question before the people at 
     <lb/>
     the last General Election, and to pass it now and 
     <lb/>
     put it forever beyond their reach would be un<lb break="no"/>constitutional and unjust. The supporters of 
     <lb/>
     this resolution claim Lord Durham as one of the 
     <lb/>
     early promoters of a Union of the Colonies. I 
     <lb/>
     refer them to his views on this point, as given in

     Strongly as Lord Durham advocated a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Union of these colonies, hc tells us it 
     <lb/>
     would not be just to adopt it without the appro<lb break="no"/>val of tho people. But I find that even the poli<lb break="no"/>ticians of Canada admit that it should be referred 
     <lb/>
     to the people, if there be any doubt as to the 
     <lb/>
     opinions which they held. Mr. Cameron, in the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Assembly, after approving of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, proposed a reference to the people, ar<lb break="no"/>guing that if they gave their approval the Union

     would be more permanent ; he says :

     doubt as to the opinions of the people, the mea<lb break="no"/>sure should be submitted to them before being 
     <lb/>
     passed. In Canada, perhaps, there was no doubt, 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     in this house who do not believe that a large 
     <lb/>
     majority of the people are opposed to the meas<lb break="no"/>ure. The hon. Atty. General, who aids in forc<lb break="no"/>ing it through, entertained different opinions in 
     <lb/>
     1861. In a speech delivered here by him on the 
     <lb/>
     8th of March in that year I find him using this

            <quote><p>

     <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName>.—Read what we said.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCLE4">Mr. McLELAN</persName> continued :—We said at that 
     <lb/>
     time that we acted with a view to our accounta<lb break="no"/>bility to our constituents at the next election, and 
     <lb/>
     that we were willing to take the responsibility of 
     <lb/>
     having our acts endorsed or not; but the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will see the difference between the two 
     <lb/>
     cases.—You are proposing to pass a Resolution 
     <lb/>
     upon which no man voting for it will go back to 
     <lb/>
     the people for the ratification of his act. The 
     <lb/>
     Atty. General says we have no precedent for ask<lb break="no"/>ing a dissolution on this question. I think it is 
     <lb/>
     ho who should have precedents before handing 
     <lb/>
     over the entire Province to a distant colony with<lb break="no"/>out the permission of the people. He says, he 
     <lb/>
     saw one in the union of New Zealand. The cases 
     <lb/>
     differ, but even there he should have told us that 
     <lb/>
     the people are dissatisfied and seeking a repeal 
     <lb/>
     of the Union by petitions to the British Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. And so it will be here, if you pass this 
     <lb/>
     resolution and carry out its intentions without 
     <lb/>
     consulting the people. But if you can obtain a 
     <lb/>
     majority to favor it, then you may hope for it to 
     <lb/>
     be enduring. It is one of the principles inherent 
     <lb/>
     in the minds of all claiming British origin to 
     <lb/>
     accept and obey the opinions of the majority. 1 
     <lb/>
     do not believe, however, that a majority can be 
     <lb/>
     found to assent to a proposition which would 
     <lb/>
     sweep away our constitution and even blot out 
     <lb/>
     the name of Nova Scotia from the map of the 
     <lb/>
     world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for Richmond, Mr. Miller, 
     <lb/>
     in calling for this resolution, told us how proud 
     <lb/>
     he is of Nova. Scotia. It is not he alone who is 
     <lb/>
     proud of her. We are proud of being Britsh 
     <lb/>
     subjects, of being British Americans, but not 
     <lb/>
     less so, of being called Nova Scotians. That 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, however, seeks to blot out this 
     <lb/>
     name. Whilst he addressed the House I 
     <lb/>
     thought of that anecdote told by Hugh Miller 
     <lb/>
     of the codfishing captain on a voyage to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, who, on oing down to his cabin to 
     <lb/>
     consult his chart. and finding it in shreds and 
     <lb/>
     tatters, told his men they might as well turn 
     <lb/>
     about, for the rats had eaten Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     I do not mean to say that Nova Scotia will be 
     <lb/>
     literally devoured, but the rats are striving to 
     <lb/>
     eat out the name from the map of North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica. Sir, if this proposition be carried into ef<lb break="no"/>fect without consulting the people, I anticipate 
     <lb/>
      
            <cb/>
          
     the most serious results. There is in the breast 
     <lb/>
     of every man claiming British allegiance a 
     <lb/>
     principle—a feeling—implanted by God him<lb break="no"/>self that he should be consulted in all changes 
     <lb/>
     affecting his rights and privileges and the con<lb break="no"/>stitution under which he lives? In no part of 
     <lb/>
     the British Empire is that feeling more strong 
     <lb/>
     and irrepressible than in this country, and if 
     <lb/>
     the Provincial Secretary carries out his propo<lb break="no"/>sition without consulting the people, this prin<lb break="no"/>ciple will rebel against the act. I have no hesi<lb break="no"/>tation in telling the hon. gentleman that he is 
     <lb/>
     tampering with the loyalty and allegiance of 
     <lb/>
     the people. He knows our attachment to the 
     <lb/>
     mother country is strong, but he must not 
     <lb/>
     count too much on it. Let me read to him as a 
     <lb/>
     warning an extract from the report of that 
     <lb/>
     celebrated Statesman, Lord Durham: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " Indeed, throughout the whole of the North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces there prevails among the 
     <lb/>
     British population an affection for the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, and a preference for its institutions, 
     <lb/>
     which a wise and firm policy, on the part of 
     <lb/>
    the Imperial Government may make the found<lb break="no"/>ation of a safe honorable and enduring connec<lb break="no"/>tion. <hi rendition="simple:italic">But even this feeling may be impaired,      and 
     <lb/>
     I must warn those in whose hands the disposal of 
     <lb/>
     their destinies rests, that a blind reliance on the 
     <lb/>
     all enduring loyalty of our countrymen may be 
     <lb/>
     carried too far."</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then he says speaking of the evils of having 
     <lb/>
     a colony disaffected :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "If the British Nation shall be content to 
     <lb/>
     retain a barren and injurious Sovereignty, it 
     <lb/>
     will but tempt the chances of foreign aggres<lb break="no"/>sion, by keeping continually exposed to a 
     <lb/>
     powerful and ambitious neighbour a distant 
     <lb/>
     dependency, in which an invader would find 
     <lb/>
     no resistance, but might rather reckon an 
     <lb/>
     active co-operation from a portion of the resi<lb break="no"/>dent population." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The passage of this resolution before us seems 
     <lb/>
     a small matter, but it may produce the evils, 
     <lb/>
     named by Lord Durham. The most trifling 
     <lb/>
     causes often produce the most alarming re<lb break="no"/>sults. The Castle may be strong and bid defi<lb break="no"/>ance to the invader, but a rat may undermine 
     <lb/>
     its walls. The ship may ontride many a storm 
     <lb/>
     but a small insect may so destroy the strength 
     <lb/>
     of her timbers, that she will go down at the 
     <lb/>
     first blast of the next gale. Our city is healthy 
     <lb/>
     and happy, but a single breath drawn by a 
     <lb/>
     visitor, to the Cholera ship in the harbor, may 
     <lb/>
     bring to us pestilence and death. Taking 
     <lb/>
     Walter Scott's beautiful simile, the tree may 
     <lb/>
     strike deep its roots and send wide its branches, 
     <lb/>
     clothed in luxuriant foliage, but a small worm 
     <lb/>
     may destroy its vitality and make of it an un<lb break="no"/>sightly trunk, from which the raven and the 
     <lb/>
     vulture shall watch for their prey, or the majes<lb break="no"/>tic eagle find a perch. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     " I asked the strong oak of the forest, where<lb break="no"/>fore, its boughs were withered and seared like 
     <lb/>
     the horns of the Stag, and it showed me that a 
     <lb/>
     small worm had gnawed its roots." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our forefathers brought to this country the 
     <lb/>
     British Acorn; they gave it congenial soil. 
     <lb/>
     Their descendants have carefully guarded and 
     <lb/>
     tended it, and wherever the sons of Nova. Scotia 
     <lb/>
     have stood, beside the men of the fatherland 
     <lb/>
     in the hour of danger, the world has seen that 
     <lb/>
     we too have "hearts of oak", but strong and 
     <lb/>
     vigorous as this plant of loyalty may be, the 
     <lb/>
     passage of this resolution may touch its vitali<lb break="no"/>

     ty. It will not wither in a night; it did not 
     <lb/>
     spring up in a day, but its decay will be more 
     <lb/>
     rapid than its growth. And when in after 
     <lb/>
     years the Nova Scotian is asked " wherefore 
     <lb/>
     the tree is dead—its branches withered and 
     <lb/>
     scared and a resting place for the great Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Eagle" he will point to this little resolution 
     <lb/>
     as the worm which gnawed its roots. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I ask the Prov. Sec.—I ask the House to 
     <lb/>
     pause, and reflect upon the consequences which 
     <lb/>
     every judicious man who  understands the 
     <lb/>
     people of this Province will see are but too 
     <lb/>
     likely to flow from the passage of this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. When these consequences are developed 
     <lb/>
     then perhaps the Prov. Secy. will lament the 
     <lb/>
     evil he has brought upon the country. Lord 
     <lb/>
     Palmerston speaking of the Emperor of Russia 
     <lb/>
     said, " there is no greater calamity can befall a 
     <lb/>
     man than to be born to a heritage of triumph<lb break="no"/>ant wrong." Sir, the Prov. Secy, had not the 
     <lb/>
     "  heritage." He sought the" wrong," it remains 
     <lb/>
     with this House to say whether the "wrong" 
     <lb/>
     shall be " triumphant." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I entreat the House to withhold from him 
     <lb/>
     the power to make his wrong triumphant—to 
     <lb/>
     prevent the evils which may flow from this 
     <lb/>
     confederacy. The Financial Secretary says 
     <lb/>
     we prophecy evil. I am no prophet, nor yet 
     <lb/>
     am I the son of a prophet, but I may close by 
     <lb/>
     repeating the words which the great King of 
     <lb/>
     Prophets, Isaiah, tells us God himself com<lb break="no"/>manded him to utter, "Say ye not, a confede<lb break="no"/>racy to all them to whom this people shall say, 
     <lb/>
     a confederacy, neither fear ye their fear, nor

     that of all the momentous questions that have

     position, and must either form a united con<lb break="no"/>federacy for purposes of defence, or be swal<lb break="no"/>lowed up by the gigantic powerful repub<lb break="no"/>lic on our borders. For many years 
     <lb/>
     we have moved on peacefully and pros<lb break="no"/>perously under the fostering care of the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country, until we have outgrown the 
     <lb/>
     state of infancy, and reached that condition of 
     <lb/>
     maturity, population, and prosperity, which 
     <lb/>
     entails upon us increased responsibilities.— 
     <lb/>
     There can be no doubt that valuable and 
     <lb/>
     important as these North American Provinces 
     <lb/>
     are to the Mother Land, from their position to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the United States they necessarily are the 
     <lb/>
     weakest and least secure of the outlying 
     <lb/>
     Colonies of the Empire, and more than all 
     <lb/>
     others are calculated to cause fears for their 
     <lb/>
     safety. Hence the extreme solitude of Imperi<lb break="no"/>al statesmen and soldiers, as well as politic<lb break="no"/>ians, to see them at the earliest possible 
     <lb/>
     moment placed in such a position and so 
     <lb/>
     united together as will best ensure their safe<lb break="no"/>ty, and strengthen their connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Crown. It is however all important for us as 
     <lb/>
     Legislators, empowered to deal with the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the people, to see that the contemplated 
     <lb/>
     Union is consummated on terms fair and equi<lb break="no"/>table to all the Colonies proposed to be united 
     <lb/>
     and that the just rights of our own Province 
     <lb/>
     should be carefully guarded. The question is 
     <lb/>
     important to us both in a political and financial 
     <lb/>
     point of view. But above all others, to those 
     <lb/>
     who value British connection, towers the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of defence. And at the present time when 
     <lb/>
     hordes of armed Fenians threaten an invasion 
     <lb/>
     of our land, it assumes increased importance. 
     <lb/>
     I believe in the maxim that " Union is strength" 
     <lb/>
     and the whole current of entreaty and advice 
     <lb/>
     from the Mother Land, whence we must look 
     <lb/>
     for protection in our time of need, unmistake<lb break="no"/>ably points to a similar conclusion. If we 
     <lb/>
     desire to ensure a continuance of that protec<lb break="no"/>tion, it is evident, that whatever opinions in 
     <lb/>
     the matter we may entertain, the parties from 
     <lb/>
     whom we expect to receive it, believe that pro<lb break="no"/>tection can be best provided, and our safety 
     <lb/>
     secured by the whole of the Provinces being 
     <lb/>
     united under one common head. With the 
     <lb/>
     financial features of the case I will not at<lb break="no"/>tempt to deal as it has been viewed in all its 
     <lb/>
     aspects, by gentlemen who have given to this 
     <lb/>
     branch of the subject much care and research. 
     <lb/>
     It was fully gone into during the debate of last 
     <lb/>
     session, and even under the Quebec scheme, I 
     <lb/>
     have been unable to discover where the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the province are not fairly guarded. 
     <lb/>
     I cannot however, say, that I was ever a de<lb break="no"/>fender of the entire scheme of Union agreed 
     <lb/>
     upon. Its basis undoubtedly is sound and the 
     <lb/>
     measure was prepared as far as possible to 
     <lb/>
     guard the interests of the weaker provinces. 
     <lb/>
     But where the independent judgments of a 
     <lb/>
     number of gentlemen with different interests 
     <lb/>
     to serve, are brought in contact, it is impossible 
     <lb/>
     that each can have his own way and there 
     <lb/>
     necessarily must be mutual compromises, or 
     <lb/>
     nothing could be accomplished. This we are 
     <lb/>
     informed was the case in reference to the Que<lb break="no"/>bec scheme, and there being no controlling in<lb break="no"/>fluence, the wonder is that so much was done. 
     <lb/>
     But under the resolution to which the House is 
     <lb/>
     now asked to assent, this will be remedied, and 
     <lb/>
     the unfair pressure of any province justly 
     <lb/>
     modified. We can place the utmost confidence 
     <lb/>
     in the integrity and love of justice which 
     <lb/>
     characterises British Statesman, when the facts 
     <lb/>
     are fairly brought before them under the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the resolution, which affords the smallest and 
     <lb/>
     weakest colony, little Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     the same voice in the advocacy of its claims as 
     <lb/>
     will be enjoyed by either of the enormous Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian provinces. There is no reason to sup<lb break="no"/>pose that the interests and wishes of each, 
     <lb/>
     colony will not be strongly urged and justly 
     <lb/>
     dealt with. But it is said Upper Canada, from 
     <lb/>
     its rapidly increasing wealth and population 
     <lb/>
     after Confederation, will use her power and 
     <lb/>

     crush the Maritime Provinces. I deny that any 
     <lb/>
     such power will be exercised. But even should 
     <lb/>
     this be the case, what possible motive could 
     <lb/>
     there be for such a course? On the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     with a common revenue and common interest, 
     <lb/>
     it would clearly be for the benefit of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada that the lower provinces 
     <lb/>
     should prosper equally with themselves—that 
     <lb/>
     their population should increase—their resour<lb break="no"/>ces be developed, and their manufactures and 
     <lb/>
     trade be extended. And the same feeling 
     <lb/>
     would be felt towards Canada by the lower 
     <lb/>
     provinces. The prosperity and advancement 
     <lb/>
     of one would be felt to be to the advantage of 
     <lb/>
     all, and the local jealousies which now actuate 
     <lb/>
     us would speedily pass away. It is true, our 
     <lb/>
     present means of communication with Canada 
     <lb/>
     are circuitous and liable to interruption ; but 
     <lb/>
     with the construction of the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way which will immediately follow union, this 
     <lb/>
     defect will be remedied, and with the rapid and 
     <lb/>
     easy communication, and the increased trade 
     <lb/>
     that will doubtless spring into existence, we 
     <lb/>
     will soon get to know each other—confidence 
     <lb/>
     will take the place of distrust, and our people 
     <lb/>
     will feel that a larger field is thrown open to 
     <lb/>
     their enterprise. It is said the corrupt states<lb break="no"/>men of Canada, in their anxiety for union, are 
     <lb/>
     animated with selfish motives, and want to get 
     <lb/>
     control of our country and revenues to pay 
     <lb/>
     their burdensome public debts. This is a de<lb break="no"/>vice of the enemy got up to frighten our people. 
     <lb/>
     Any person who has travelled over that vast 
     <lb/>
     country and become acquainted with its great 
     <lb/>
     resources and growing trade, cannot fail to be 
     <lb/>
     convinced that this is entirely groundless.—The 
     <lb/>
     public debt of Canada, in proportion to her pop<lb break="no"/>ulation, is little in excess of our own, while her 
     <lb/>
     resources and ability to meet it are equaly good. 
     <lb/>
     But I am satisfied that altho' Canadians are 
     <lb/>
     certainly anxious for Union with us, it is not 
     <lb/>
     on this selfish ground. They know that, while 
     <lb/>
     their country is rapidly increasing in popula<lb break="no"/>tion and wealth, without more intimate con<lb break="no"/>nection with the Maritime Provinces and an 
     <lb/>
     outlet to the sea at all seasons, they will be 
     <lb/>
     continually at the mercy of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     United States; who having cautiously put an 
     <lb/>
     end to the Reciprocity Treaty, threaten also to 
     <lb/>
     terminate the transport of Canadian bonded 
     <lb/>
     Goods over their territory and thus worry the 
     <lb/>
     people into a desire for Annexation. Should 
     <lb/>
     this be the case and the United States be thus 
     <lb/>
     increased by the addition of three millions of 
     <lb/>
     people, and their great country severed from 
     <lb/>
     British rule ; could the maritime provinces 
     <lb/>
     even with the aid of Britain, for any length of 
     <lb/>
     time maintain their connection with the em<lb break="no"/>pire? No, Mr. Speaker, let Canada fall under 
     <lb/>
     Yankee rule, and we may make up our minds 
     <lb/>
     soon to follow. The old flag under which we 
     <lb/>
     have hitherto rested in peace and revelled in 
     <lb/>
     liberty will depart from our shores, and the 
     <lb/>
     Stars and Stripes flaunt in triumph over 
     <lb/>
     our Citadel and Forts. But it is agreed 
     <lb/>
     by our opponents that this resolution 
     <lb/>
     should not be adopted without an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people being first made—and that the course 
     <lb/>
     we are pursuing is unconstitutional. In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion the objection is unsound and if the 
     <lb/>
     request was assented to it would lead to no 
     <lb/>
     practical result. Of the constitutional right of 
     <lb/>
     the Representatives of the people in Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, to deal with all matters affecting their 
     <lb/>
     constituents, there can be no doubt, the princi<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     ple is admitted by all authorities on constitu<lb break="no"/>tional law, and certainly under no circum<lb break="no"/>stances could representatives of the people be 
     <lb/>
     returned and this House so untrammelled by 
     <lb/>
     pledges, and free to exercise an independent 
     <lb/>
     judgment on the question as the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who now occupy these branches. But we are 
     <lb/>
     told that nine tenths of the people are against 
     <lb/>
     Union, and that they have proved this to be 
     <lb/>
     true from the petitions laid on the table of the 
     <lb/>
     House. Now what proofs do they give us that 
     <lb/>
     this is true, or that any large number of the 
     <lb/>
     people are opposed even to the Quebec Scheme. 
     <lb/>
     I have before me a list of every petition 
     <lb/>
     presented from every part of this Province 
     <lb/>
     during this session up to this time. The only 
     <lb/>
     parties that have done anything—which have 
     <lb/>
     sent in any respectable number of names—are 
     <lb/>
     those to which the hon member for Richmond 
     <lb/>
     was instrumental in sending petitions; namely 
     <lb/>
     Inverness, Richmond, and Antigonishe. From 
     <lb/>
     Inverness we have 1119 petitioners out of 20,000 
     <lb/>
     people; Hants sends 607; Lunenburg, 502; 
     <lb/>
     Digby, 584; Antigonishe, 1920; King's 445; 
     <lb/>
     Guysboro, 367; Victoria, 531; North Colchester, 
     <lb/>
     126; Shelburne, 250; East Halifax, 205; Cum<lb break="no"/>berland, 172; Richmond, 638. Making a total 
     <lb/>
     of 8000. Digby, Cape Breton, and Yarmouth 
     <lb/>
     do not appear to have sent in a single petition. 
     <lb/>
     Are not these facts proof that there is no such 
     <lb/>
     feeling of excitement against the scheme as 
     <lb/>
     has been represented? ls that evidence that 
     <lb/>
     the people of Nova Scotia are working to 
     <lb/>
     exhibit their indignation against any person 
     <lb/>
     who deals with this scheme? I believe that 
     <lb/>
     the people of this Province having considered 
     <lb/>
     this matter, have made up their minds that 
     <lb/>
     the event is inevitable, and that they are 
     <lb/>
     content to trust their rights and liberties to the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who are within these walls. They 
     <lb/>
     are satisfied that tied up with the people as we 
     <lb/>
     are all of us—that whatever we possess being 
     <lb/>
     bound up in the prosperity of the country— we 
     <lb/>
     are not likely to jeopardize the public interests. 
     <lb/>
     Under these circumstances I feel that we are 
     <lb/>
     safe in passing the resolution before us, and 
     <lb/>
     that on its adoption largely depends the 
     <lb/>
     safety of the people of this country. lt is for us 
     <lb/>
     to consider if the Confederation of these Prov<lb break="no"/>inces will increase their strength and power, it 
     <lb/>
     is not our duty as well as interest, to yield to 
     <lb/>
     the advice of the British Government and pass 
     <lb/>
     this measure. 1 believe that such will be the 
     <lb/>
     results of Union, and I am therefore ready for 
     <lb/>
     one to support the resolution, believing that in 
     <lb/>
     doing so we are tending to perpetuate British 
     <lb/>
     rule, and British liberty through the length and 
     <lb/>
     breadth of British North America.

     Division of the county of Halifax, against this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, although they have had abundant 
     <lb/>
     time to do so. It is hardly necessary for me to 
     <lb/>
     allude to their sentiments, since the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber who has last spoken has shown that the 
     <lb/>
     Western Division of Halifax has not sent in a 
     <lb/>
     single petition against the Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     these Colonies (Cheers) Before I came into 
     <lb/>
     this Legislature—before I had any idea of poli<lb break="no"/>tical life, I was in favour of a Union of British 
     <lb/>
     North America. I was in favour of it because 
     <lb/>
     I thought it would give a higher standard to 
     <lb/>
     the people—that it would give them an eleva<lb break="no"/>tion of sentiment and thought, and a respecta<lb break="no"/>bility of position that they cannot expect to 
     <lb/>
     have in their present isolated position. There<lb break="no"/>fore it has been from my first inception of 
     <lb/>
     public life that I have earnestly and zealously 
     <lb/>
     advocated the object which the public men of 
     <lb/>
     the day have in view—a Union of British North 
     <lb/>
     America. When I looked at the state of feeling 
     <lb/>
     in this House last session, I was of opinion 
     <lb/>
     that there were hardly half a dozen of men 
     <lb/>
     belonging to the party with which I was con<lb break="no"/>nected, that were ready to come up to the mark 
     <lb/>
     and vote for a Union of the Provinces. To my 
     <lb/>
     utter surprise, on the meeting of this House, I 
     <lb/>
     found that an entire change had taken place 
     <lb/>
     in the opinions and feelings of gentlemen, and 
     <lb/>
     I of course could not otherwise than suppose 
     <lb/>
     that they are influenced by the knowledge 
     <lb/>
     they have gained of the views of their consti<lb break="no"/>tuents during the recess of Parliament. I 
     <lb/>
     have in my conversations with members of 
     <lb/>
     this House stated over and over again that I 
     <lb/>
     was not in favour of a Union of these Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces without the consent of the people. I 
     <lb/>
     feel that with their consent a Union might be 
     <lb/>
     consummated that would be highly beneficial, 
     <lb/>
     and be regarded with esteem and respect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I have offered my opinions so often on this 
     <lb/>
     subject, that if the question was not to be taken 
     <lb/>
     to-night, I would not raise my voice, for I am 
     <lb/>
     utterly unable to address the House at length, 
     <lb/>
     labouring as I have been for some days under 
     <lb/>
     indisposition. Now I find that the discussion of 
     <lb/>
     this question in the Canadian Parliament, in 
     <lb/>
     1865, occupied from the 3rd Jan. to the 26th 
     <lb/>
     March. The House discussed the question as 
     <lb/>
     in Committee, and everybody had an ample op<lb break="no"/>portunity of expressing his views. The subject, 
     <lb/>
     however, has been so often discussed in this Le<lb break="no"/>gislature—at public meetings, and in the Press, 
     <lb/>
     that it is an old question here, whilst it was a 
     <lb/>
     comparatively new one in Canada. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     it is not all necessary that a great deal of time 
     <lb/>
     should be occupied with the discussion of this 
     <lb/>
     question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we regard the condition of these Provinces 
     <lb/>
     we must at once see that the time has come 
     <lb/>
     when a change must take place in their present 
     <lb/>
     condition. They have, to some extent, out<lb break="no"/>grown their present Colonial condition—their 
     <lb/>
     state of pupilage; and, therefore, we believe the 
     <lb/>
     time has come when they want to be united for 
     <lb/>
     greater security—for mutual protection. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the people of this Colony do wish to 
     <lb/>
     continue the connection with Great Britain, 
     <lb/>
     and if Union is an indispensable condition to 
     <lb/>
     the perpetuity of that connection, as we are 
     <lb/>
     told by the British Government and statesmen, 
     <lb/>
     we should not hesitate to adopt it. Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain has turned her attention towards the con<lb break="no"/>dition of these Colonies; she has looked at 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     them with a parental regard, and offered them 
     <lb/>
     her advice; and it is only our duty that we ac<lb break="no"/>cept that advice in the same spirit in which it 
     <lb/>
     is offered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of the importance of this question, it 
     <lb/>
     is necessary that we should all approach its 
     <lb/>
     discussion with that gravity and respect that 
     <lb/>
     is due from us as the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     people. In the commencement of the debate I 
     <lb/>
     raised my voice against anything like a dis<lb break="no"/>play of personal feeling and party prejudices— 
     <lb/>
     that we should deal with the question in a be<lb break="no"/>coming spirit, and entire regard to the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the people who have entrusted their affairs 
     <lb/>
     to our care. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I do not intend to refer to the speeches which 
     <lb/>
     have been made on this question, but there is 
     <lb/>
     one part of the address of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Yarmouth that I cannot allow to pass without 
     <lb/>
     a comment. He pointed to the map and show<lb break="no"/>ed the difference of latitude and longitude be<lb break="no"/>tween Nova Scotia, Montreal, Toronto, and 
     <lb/>
     other parts of Upper Canada, for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of showing that the characteristics of the coun<lb break="no"/>try were unfavorable for union. I confess the 
     <lb/>
     confederacy will not present that compact ap<lb break="no"/>pearance which the United States present, but 
     <lb/>
     when you look at the difference of longitude 
     <lb/>
     between Maine and California, you need not 
     <lb/>
     think of the difference between Halifax and 
     <lb/>
     Toronto. You do not hear of California being 
     <lb/>
     discontented with the Union, separated as she 
     <lb/>
     is by natural barriers from the rest of her sister 
     <lb/>
     States. She is a flourishing member of the 
     <lb/>
     Union. Railroads and telegraphs have brought 
     <lb/>
     communities together heretofore at distances 
     <lb/>
     which precluded the possibility of feeling. It 
     <lb/>
     will therefore be seen that the argument of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member does not amount to a great deal 
     <lb/>
     after all. When we look back at the position 
     <lb/>
     which this question has occupied for a great 
     <lb/>
     many years, we find that all of the leading 
     <lb/>
     minds of this province have advocated Union; 
     <lb/>
     but it was not until 1863 that Canada was will<lb break="no"/>ing to listen to propositions from the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. Circumstances have changed in 
     <lb/>
     the Province of Canada, and as an evidence of 
     <lb/>
     the feelings of the people I need only refer to 
     <lb/>
     the fact, that after the Quebec scheme was ma<lb break="no"/>tured, no less than 50 constituencies were ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to, and only four candidates appeared 
     <lb/>
     on the hustings opposed to the scheme, and 
     <lb/>
     only one was returned in opposition. Here you 
     <lb/>
     have an evidence of the popularity of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation in Canada. The re<lb break="no"/>sult of the elections in New Brunswick has 
     <lb/>
     been different, but now we find that a great 
     <lb/>
     change is rapidly taking place in the senti<lb break="no"/>ments of the people of that Provmce. In New<lb break="no"/>foundland the question has assumed a most 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory aspect; although occupying an iso<lb break="no"/>lated position, the legislature has shown a 
     <lb/>
     most favorable disposition to enter the union 
     <lb/>
     when Nova Scotia and the other provinces give 
     <lb/>
     their assent to the measure. As respects 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, I am not able just 
     <lb/>
     now to say anything definite, but no doubt 
     <lb/>
     she will also fall in in good time. It 
     <lb/>
     has been said by the Provincial Secretary 
     <lb/>
     that a Union was impracticable whilst New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick occupied a position of uncompro<lb break="no"/>mising hostility to the scheme, but the feeling 
     <lb/>
     of that Colony, as I have just stated, is under 
     <lb/>
     going is constant change, and it is therefore 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
          
     right that we should be prepared to embrace 
     <lb/>
     the first opportunity of dealing with the ques<lb break="no"/>tion. As respects the Quebec resolutions, I have 
     <lb/>examined them myself. They were submitted 
     <lb/>to the Imperial Government, and Mr. Cardwell 
     <lb/>only takes exception to two of the resolutions 
     <lb/>—with respect to the constitution of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council, and the pardoning power grant<lb break="no"/>ed to the Lieutenant Governors. After hav<lb break="no"/>ing been examined by the statesmen and press 
     <lb/>of England, as well as of North America, and 
     <lb/>approved by such eminent authorities on both 
     <lb/>continents, I think these resolutions must be en<lb break="no"/>titled to much respect; and therefore I cannot 
     <lb/>go to the length that some people do in respect 
     <lb/>to this scheme. Although delegates may be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed by the Provinces to discuss the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Colonial Union in England, the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions must form the platform—the basis of that 
     <lb/>discussion. I would myself prefer a legislative 
     <lb/>Union of the Provinces, but I feel that it is im<lb break="no"/>practicable, in view of the fact that it is opposed 
     <lb/>by Lower Canada, with its large French popu<lb break="no"/>lation and peculiar laws and Institutions which 
     <lb/>they have retained since the time of Wolfe.— 
     <lb/>Their prejudices must be respected.and there 
     <lb/>fore I believe, from my conversation with 
     <lb/>gentlemen of influence in Lower Canada, that 
     <lb/>we cannot have a legislative Union at present, 
     <lb/>though do not know what may be in the womb 
     <lb/>of time. The first course that is to be pursued 
     <lb/>to adopt is a Federal Union, as propounded in 
     <lb/>the Quebec Scheme.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TOBI1">Mr. Tobin</persName> concluded by apologizing for de<lb break="no"/>taining the House at so late an hour, but he 
     <lb/>
     could not refrain from offering some remarks 
     <lb/>
     on account of the importance of the question, 
     <lb/>
     and set down amid cheers.

            </p>

            <p>
     In answer to an enquiry, the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary stated that it was the inten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Government to bring the debate to 
     <lb/>
     a close that night. The session was already 
     <lb/>
     far advanced, and gentlemen were desirous of 
     <lb/>
     returning to their homes. A great deal of ordi<lb break="no"/>nary business yet remained to be transacted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL3">Mr. MILLER</persName> said:—I am desirous that we 
     <lb/>
     should get to the ordinary business of the 
     <lb/>
     House as soon as possible, and I am therefore 
     <lb/>
     ready to forego any observations that I 
     <lb/>
     might feel disposed to make. I have indeed 
     <lb/>
     peculiar reasons for wishing to address the 
     <lb/>
     House in reply to the attacks made upon me. 
     <lb/>
     Some gentlemen have attempted to charge me 
     <lb/>
     with inconsistency in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     question of a reference to the people at the 
     <lb/>
     polls, but if I could reply I would soon show 
     <lb/>
     the fallacy of the statements that have been 
     <lb/>
     made in reference to my course. I could 
     <lb/>
     justify my action, in this great crisis of the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of British North America, in a way 
     <lb/>
     that would be a conclusive answer to the 
     <lb/>
     charge made against me. If the present crisis 
     <lb/>
     was an ordinary one, I would be one of the 
     <lb/>
     last men to consent that any great question 
     <lb/>
     should be decided without going to the people, 
     <lb/>
     but I feel that to pursue such a course at the 
     <lb/>
     present time would be suicidal—that it would 
     <lb/>
     be tantamount to throwing the whole thing 
     <lb/>
     away. Therefore there is no man in this House 
     <lb/>
     who has greater reasons than myself to wish to 
     <lb/>
     speak tonight, but in deference to the desire of 
     <lb/>
     the majority I am ready to forego that privi<lb break="no"/>lege, and allow to pass unnotice the slanders 
     <lb/>
    that have been uttered against me for pursuing 
     <lb/>what I consider is a patriotic course.

            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAC7">Mr. BLACKWOOD</persName> said :—I think that no 
     <lb/>
     member should hesitate to give his opinions to 
     <lb/>
     the country on such an occasion as this, and I 
     <lb/>
     fear that the undue pressure brought to bear to 
     <lb/>
     force us to a division will have the effect of pre<lb break="no"/>venting some gentlemen from expressing their 
     <lb/>
     views. Occupying the position in which this 
     <lb/>
     Legislature is placed, I think that ample time 
     <lb/>
     should be given to every member to collect his 
     <lb/>
     thoughts and bring them to bear upon the discus<lb break="no"/>sion. The resolution before us I do not intend 
     <lb/>
     to support. I al 1in believed in Responsible 
     <lb/>
     Government and the principle upon which that 
     <lb/>
     sort of Government rests—that the people shall 
     <lb/>
     be ruled according to their well understood wish<lb break="no"/>es. A member who knows the views of his con<lb break="no"/>stituents on this question should be prepared to 
     <lb/>
     give his vote like a man; but a member not 
     <lb/>
     knowing those visws, or knowing that a majority 
     <lb/>
     of those whom he represents are against the mea<lb break="no"/>sure, is in duty bound to vote against the reso<lb break="no"/>lution which will takeaway their privileges with<lb break="no"/>out appeal. I feel it to be my duty to refrain 
     <lb/>
     from giving away the rights of the people with<lb break="no"/>out affording them an opportunity of expressing 
     <lb/>
     their opinions and judging for themselves. If 
     <lb/>
     the great intelligence possessed by the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country were brought to bear on this house 
     <lb/>
     to-night, it would be seen that they would not 
     <lb/>
     part with their rights without a struggle. Union 
     <lb/>
     may be a good thing, but I should like to be sure 
     <lb/>
     that we are going to gain some substantial ad<lb break="no"/>vantages by it. I find in the speeches of those 
     <lb/>
     who advocate the scheme a great deal of mere 
     <lb/>
     theory. Looking at the matter as a surrender of 
     <lb/>
     some of our privileges, I think it behooves us to 
     <lb/>
     examine well before passing the resolution. I 
     <lb/>
     have yet expressed no opinion on the principle 
     <lb/>
     of Union, but I will now say to the house and to 
     <lb/>
     the country that I will assent to no scheme until 
     <lb/>
     the people have passed upon it. By the division 
     <lb/>
     to-night we may establish what will be called an 
     <lb/>
     union, but will that be a union ofthe people ? 
     <lb/>
    Give me a union of heart, and thought, and ac<lb break="no"/>tion—a union that will strengthen the arm and 
     <lb/>nerve the heart upon every occasion. The peo<lb break="no"/>ple, I maintain, are able to judge of the question 
     <lb/>for themselves, and if they choose Union, I will 
     <lb/>gladly assent, but if they reject the scheme, away 
     <lb/>goes the proposition. It may be said that this 
     <lb/>Legislature constitutes the united wisdom of the 
     <lb/>country; and, while I admit that a large amount 
     <lb/>of intelligence is to be seen around these bench<lb break="no"/>es, I feel that, in the locality which I represent, 
     <lb/>there are men from whom I should like to hear. 
     <lb/>As the hour is late, I will not further occupy the 
     <lb/>time of the house, and I will conclude by saying 
     <lb/>that this matter should be placed in the hands of 
     <lb/>the people.

     <persName ref="pers:ROSS10">Mr. Ross</persName> said ;—At this hour of the night, or

     rather of the morning, I do not intend to say

     much on the question now before the house. As 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
        
     remarked by my friend, Mr. Blackwood, the

     Provincial Secretary is driving us into a corner, 
     <lb/>
     when forcing us to a division when we should be 
     <lb/>
     in our beds. I have taken a large number of 
     <lb/>
     notes, and intended defining my position, if not 
     <lb/>
     to the satisfaction of the majority of this house, 
     <lb/>
     at least to a majority of the people of Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, and particularly that of my own constituents. 
     <lb/>
     A singular but unholy union had taken place.— 
     <lb/>
     Even during the delegation to Quebec a certain 
     <lb/>
     gentleman in the Legislative Council and the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Secretary could scarcely find language 
     <lb/>
     strong enough to express the terms of abuse and 
     <lb/>
     reproach which the one applied to the other.— 
     <lb/>
     When they got those princely dinners,—those 
     <lb/>
     ovations, with abundance of good wine, they be<lb break="no"/>gan to forget what was due to Nova Scotia and 
     <lb/>
     to the interests of the people. As long as these 
     <lb/>
     were opposed to each other the wrongs and inju<lb break="no"/>ries done to our people were well exposed; but 
     <lb/>
     now both support each other, without regard to 
     <lb/>
     the interests of Nova Scotia. We are told that 
     <lb/>
     we are on the eve of a great crisis, and it is true 
     <lb/>
     that some Fenians are organizing in the States, 
     <lb/>
     but they intend to restore to Ireland what we are 
     <lb/>
     about destroying in this Province, namely, our 
     <lb/>
     noble and glorious Constitution. The Ameri<lb break="no"/>can people are now beginning to enjoy peace, 
     <lb/>
     and it will be the work of years to place their fi<lb break="no"/>nancial affairs on a sound and proper basis.— 
     <lb/>
     They desire peace, and both France and Eng<lb break="no"/>land will look with jealous eye on any extension 
     <lb/>
     of their power on this continent. France is in<lb break="no"/>terested in Mexico, and Great Britain in the 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces, and both would 
     <lb/>
     unite to prevent further increase of territory to 
     <lb/>
     the States. This is the best guarantee for peace. 
     <lb/>
     In the event of war it is acknowledged by those 
     <lb/>
     sent out officially to report on our defences that 
     <lb/>
     Canada, with its long line of land and water 
     <lb/>
     boundary is our weak spot, and that it cannot be 
     <lb/>
     defended as well as Nova Scotia, which is almost 
     <lb/>
     surrounded by water. Here we have men who 
     <lb/>
     will defend us, and are willing to do so ; but 
     <lb/>
     force us into a union with Canada, and you will 
     <lb/>
     create a feeling of disloyalty among our people. 
     <lb/>
     the extent of which it is painful to contemplate, 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, in the question of defence we gain 
     <lb/>
     weakness instead of strength. It is said that, 
     <lb/>
     with the present rate of consumption, coal will be 
     <lb/>
     soon scarce in Great Britain, and then Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and Cape Breton would be the last places 
     <lb/>
     that would be abandoned. Mr. Archibald says 
     <lb/>
     that this house will remain. But take away 
     <lb/>
     from us the power of self-government, and you 
     <lb/>
     take away what we most dearly cherish. The 
     <lb/>
     Quebec scheme is largely copied from the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of New Zealand, and it is singular that 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of that country was published 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. McGee about the time that our delegates 
     <lb/>
     were giving away Nova Scotia to meet Canadian 
     <lb/>
     necessities. In New Zealand there are nine dif<lb break="no"/>ferent Provinces, each having its own distinct 
     <lb/>
     local Government, and there they complain that 
     <lb/>
     they are expensive, without any benefits arising 
     <lb/>
     from the expenditure. In that country they are 
     <lb/>
     strongly advocating separation, and the whole

     <lb/>
    Province of Auckland is unanimous in agitating   
     <lb/>a separation from the Southern Island. The 
     <lb/>Confederation works injuriously to the interests 
     <lb/>of the people, and we are about adopting what 
     <lb/>they are most anxious to reject. The Governor 
     <lb/>of New Zealand is called the Superintendent, and 
     <lb/>is elected by the people ; but here our local Go<lb break="no"/>vernor, selected by the Government at Ottawa, 
     <lb/>would be some creature that had claims on the. ' 
     <lb/>political party in power and who would not have 
     <lb/>popularity enough to get a seat at Ottawa. Such 
     <lb/>will be the men who will be the future Governors 
     <lb/>of these Colonies. The House of Assembly is bad 
     <lb/>enough now, but then it will be worse ; they<lb/>will be like the case ofa certain house from which 
     <lb/>the money-changers were driven. The Provin<lb break="no"/>cial Secretary says he did not approach the 
     <lb/>member from Richmond. That reminded me of 
     <lb/>an old man once in my county having a a copy of 
     <lb/>Bunyan's Holy War, and showing a neighbor 
     <lb/>the picture of the taking of Mansoul, said—" See, 
     <lb/>see, what the big D - l won't do, he has got 
     <lb/>the little d is to do for him." Some influen<lb break="no"/>ces are at work, as will be seen by the sudden 
     <lb/>change in the minds of some members: If we 
     <lb/>are to have British institutions, why do we not 
     <lb/>follow their pattern? When Scotland was united 
     <lb/>to England, the local Parliament was abolished, 
     <lb/>and such was the case in Ireland. If we are to 
     <lb/>have Union, let it be alegislative one. There is 
     <lb/>something grand in the idea of one Government, 
     <lb/>one Legislature—but in retaining the local legis<lb break="no"/>lature, we will have the expense without any cor<lb break="no"/>responding benefit—the shadow without the sub<lb break="no"/>stance,—a nest of corruption for persons who 
     <lb/>will not be able to obtain seats at Ottawa. Our 
     <lb/>present revenue is about $ 3.20 per head on our 
     <lb/>population ; out of this we should have to hand 
     <lb/>over to Canada for the General Government 
     <lb/>$ 2.40, leaving 80 cents for all local purposes, to 
     <lb/>which we add royalty on coal and some other 
     <lb/>small amounts. The first clause of the local ar<lb break="no"/>ticles gives the power of self-taxation, which 
     <lb/>is just what we should avoid; but without 
     <lb/>it our roads and bridges will go down. There is 
     <lb/>no doubt but that the delegates anticipated in 
     <lb/>their happy moments the great position that they 
     <lb/>would occupy under Confederation, forgetting 
     <lb/>the interest of Nova Scotia in the desire for po<lb break="no"/>sition and self aggrandisement—imitating Nero, 
     <lb/>who fiddled when Rome was burning. The 
     <lb/>member for Kings, Dr. Hamilton, said that in 
     <lb/>medical practice, physicians often try experi<lb break="no"/>ments, but it   only on sick men or dead bodies. 
     <lb/>Novascotia is neither sick nor dead, but sound 
     <lb/>and in good health, wealth, and prosperity.— 
     <lb/>The Prov. Secretary says that there are but few 
     <lb/>petitions against the measure; but was it not 
     <lb/>sent to all parts of the Province that Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion would not be considered this session ? This 
     <lb/>was no doubt a piece of strategy on the part of 
     <lb/>the Pro. Secretary, who now takes everybody by 
     <lb/>surprise. There was one petition that I present<lb break="no"/>ed signed by all the magistrates at sessions 
     <lb/>with the Custos at the head,—a pretty strong in<lb break="no"/>dication that I at least am representing the views 
     <lb/>of my constituents. The whole history of Con<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     
    federation is based on the ambition of some of our 
     <lb/>public men and on the necessities of Canada.— 
     <lb/>  Ambition is the sin of angels, and even politicians 
     <lb/>finding that they were losing power, must go to 
     <lb/>Ottawa. They are like the evil one, as described 
     <lb/>by Milton, who would rather rule in hell than fill 
     <lb/>a subordinate place in heaven. I have no ambi<lb break="no"/>tion to gratify, no self interest to advance—but 
     <lb/>as I was early taught that Responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was government according to the well un<lb break="no"/>derstood wishes of the people, I will not agree to 
     <lb/>sell their birthrights without asking their con<lb break="no"/>sent, but will on the contrary stand by what I 
     <lb/>consider the dearest rights of Nova Scotia, and 
     <lb/>  the express views of those whom I represent.

     <persName ref="pers:FRAS4">Mr. JAS FRASER</persName> said :—If this were a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of ordinary importance, I would content 
     <lb/>
     myself by giving a silent vote, as I have fre<lb break="no"/>quently done, but on a. measure of such great 
     <lb/>
     consequence I do not think that I would be 
     <lb/>
     justified in doing so. I will tell the house can<lb break="no"/>didly that my opposition to the resolution be<lb break="no"/>fore us is not due to any hostile feelings in re<lb break="no"/>ference to the principle of union. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it. is necessary that petitions should 
     <lb/>
     come from my constituents to inform me of 
     <lb/>
     their wishes, because, living as I do among 
     <lb/>
     them, I must be aware of their views, and un— 
     <lb/>
     less a very great change has taken place since 
     <lb/>
     I left them I know that they are not prepared 
     <lb/>
     to adopt the proposition of union at present. 
     <lb/>
     At this time last year a scheme of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     was before the people, and they had an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of examing and judging it. They 
     <lb/>
     did examine it, and a majority of them became 
     <lb/>
     opposed to it—not because a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     pains and talent had not been taken with the 
     <lb/>
     measure; because now that we are about to 
     <lb/>
     form a new delegation, I do not think that we 
     <lb/>
     can send gentlemen of more talent and more 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the business they have to per<lb break="no"/>form than those who went before. If I vote 
     <lb/>
     for this resolution, when I return to my con<lb break="no"/>stituents and tell them that I voted for union 
     <lb/>
     they will naturally ask what kind. of a union 
     <lb/>
     we are to get, and I shall be unable to tell 
     <lb/>
     them ;—last year I could give them the details, 
     <lb/>
     this year I can only say that the matter is to 
     <lb/>
     be arranged three thousand miles away, and 
     <lb/>
     if they ask me whether the representatives of 
     <lb/>
     the people will have an opportunity of pas<lb break="no"/>sing on it afterwards can, only tell them no 
     <lb/>
     such opportunity will be afforded, and that 
     <lb/>
     they will be bound by the arrangements which 
     <lb/>
     are made in England. I regret that my con<lb break="no"/>victions compel me to ditfer from many whose 
     <lb/>
     opinions I value, and whose friendship I de<lb break="no"/>sire to maintain, but I must act conscientious<lb break="no"/>ly, and do what I believe to be for the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country. I must say I cannot un<lb break="no"/>derstand those who say that persons who do 
     <lb/>
     not fall in with the idea. of union are disloyal, 
     <lb/>
     —the people whom I represent are as loyal as 
     <lb/>
     any upon the face of the globe, and if any man 
     <lb/>
     had the hardihood to charge disloyalty upon 
     <lb/>
     them it would not be necessary to hurl back 
     <lb/>
     the imputation—it would rebound with greater 
     <lb/>
     force than that with which it came. Union 
     <lb/>
     I believe to be desirable when we are pre<lb break="no"/>pared for it, but at present the people are not 
     <lb/>
     prepared, and they do not understand how

     we would be in a better or stronger position 
     <lb/>
     if we disturbed our institutions. While union, 
     <lb/>
     if not formed in opposition to the wishes of

     the people would be strength, a union so forced 
     <lb/>

     the day when all these colonies will be united, 
     <lb/>

     of our constituents without waiting for that, 
     <lb/>
     and it is to be feared that other matters would

     that when the people are prepared for union

     I will not be found an obstacle in the way

     believing that a majority of them are at

     <persName ref="pers:LAWR1">Mr. LAWRENCE</persName> said :—I rise to make a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks on the question before the House, in 
     <lb/>
     discharge of the duty I owe to my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, and also to the country at large. I feel 
     <lb/>
     some reluctance in addressing the House at 
     <lb/>
     this late period of the session, but the profound 
     <lb/>
     anxiety with which I regard the feeling of the 
     <lb/>
     people impels me to speak. Standing as I do 
     <lb/>
     the representative of a free and intelligent 
     <lb/>
     people, honored with their confidence, anxious 
     <lb/>
     to discharge faithfully the trust reposed in me, 
     <lb/>
     I feel it is my duty to express my sentiments 
     <lb/>
     freely on the present occasion. There can be 
     <lb/>
     no great love for union where the parties to be 
     <lb/>
     joined have not the slightest desire to associate 
     <lb/>
     with each other,—right or wrong, beneficial or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise, it is impossible to persuade the mass 
     <lb/>
     of the people that the system which gives to 
     <lb/>
     them an equal voice in the government of the 
     <lb/>
     country is not the best. How many of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent members would be here, if they said to 
     <lb/>
     the people in 1863, that they were going to 
     <lb/>
     change the constitution of the country? All 
     <lb/>
     great questions ought to be examined with 
     <lb/>
     caution. Party considerations should sink, and 
     <lb/>
     as to the spirit with which I enter into this de<lb break="no"/>bate, I claim nothing more than to know what 
     <lb/>
     course is best to secure harmony and loyalty 
     <lb/>
     in our country. Neither the smiles of friends 
     <lb/>
     nor the frowns of foes no political thunder 
     <lb/>
     either on the right hand or the left will move 
     <lb/>
     me, or change my mind as regards the action 
     <lb/>
     taken by the government on this question. A 
     <lb/>
     mere politician, thrown up by the dark and tur<lb break="no"/>bid waters of party, actuated by self-interest, 
     <lb/>
     can have no lasting influence over a question 
     <lb/>
     of this sort,—this is no party question; it pass<lb break="no"/>es beyond all such considerations, and such 
     <lb/>
     feelings should be far from every mmd, Gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen mistake the feeling of the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country, if they hope to excite their admira<lb break="no"/>tion, or secure their confidence by displaying 
     <lb/>
     such newborn zeal in forcing confederation on 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
           
     the people. The spirit of liberty will make it<lb break="no"/>self heard wherever it exists. Let us take 
     <lb/>
     care of our rights, for political expediency in 
     <lb/>
     limiting a people's freedom is a dangerous 
     <lb/>
     principle, and will never satisfy a free people. 
     <lb/>
     I believe one of our great objects, at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time, should be to foster a spirit of peace 
     <lb/>
     and harmony amongst our own people, and 
     <lb/>
     harmony can only be maintained by a patrio<lb break="no"/>tic, wise, and noble use of power. The people 
     <lb/>
     in every part of this country must feel that 
     <lb/>
     their rights are protected. So far from lend<lb break="no"/>ing ourselves to any scheme which would 
     <lb/>
     threaten the safety or prosperity of our 
     <lb/>
     country, we should not hesitate to plant our<lb break="no"/>selves in opposition even to our political as<lb break="no"/>sociates when they seek to promote it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We are a free people, prosperous beyond 
     <lb/>
     doubt, advancing cautiously in wealth, under 
     <lb/>
     the protection of our good old flag, the only 
     <lb/>
     banner which floats over a limited monarchy 
     <lb/>
     and a free people. Under the British constitu<lb break="no"/>tion we have far more freedom than any other 
     <lb/>
     country on the face of the earth. We have 
     <lb/>
     sprung from a nation in whose veins the blood 
     <lb/>
     of freedom circulates, and who carry every<lb break="no"/>where the deepest attachment to their Sove<lb break="no"/>reign. It is the spirit of that constitution which 
     <lb/>
     unites and invigorates every part of the Em<lb break="no"/>pire, down to the lowest member, but to pass 
     <lb/>
     confederation, without asking the voice of the 
     <lb/>
     people, will only be sowing the seed of dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction and contention among a vey large por<lb break="no"/>tion of our population. A representative of the 
     <lb/>
     people is bound by the highest moral obliga<lb break="no"/>tions to respect their wishes, and obey their 
     <lb/>
     will, when their sober judgment has been as<lb break="no"/>certained. Now I deplore the intolerant spirit 
     <lb/>
     which I see every day manifested around these 
     <lb/>
     Benches; it is utterly inconsistent with the 
     <lb/>
     true spirit of freedom. The foundation of free 
     <lb/>
     constitutional government is the voice of a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of the people, and so long as it deserves 
     <lb/>
     the name, and wins the affection of the people, 
     <lb/>
     it can never be in any great danger. Now if a 
     <lb/>
     question of right arises between the constitu<lb break="no"/>ent and the representative body, by what au<lb break="no"/>thority shall it be decided? If you leave it to 
     <lb/>
     the Judges, they will tell you that the law of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament is above them. What then re<lb break="no"/>mains but to leave it to the people to decide for 
     <lb/>
     themselves? My political career may be short 
     <lb/>
     and the accomplishment may fall far short of 
     <lb/>
     the purposes, but the consciousness of duty dis<lb break="no"/>charged shall be glorious. The people are not 
     <lb/>
     asking for any change, and this subject would 
     <lb/>
     sleep if it were not for the rising zeal of some 
     <lb/>
     who dread an appeal to the people. Interested 
     <lb/>
     men may call for measures which they them<lb break="no"/>selves should be most ready to lament and 
     <lb/>
     condemn, but upon them let the responsibility 
     <lb/>
     rest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, in regard to Confederation, I say frank<lb break="no"/>ly, that whenever a majority ot the people 
     <lb/>
     speak in favor of union, let them have it; but I 
     <lb/>
     will not consent to a change of the constitution 
     <lb/>
     without their consent. If the representatives 
     <lb/>
     are unfaithful to their trust, and abuse their 
     <lb/>
     powers by disposing of the birth-right of the 
     <lb/>
     people, then responsible government is not 
     <lb/>
     worthy of the name. We have no right to sur<lb break="no"/>render the liberties and privileges which we 
     <lb/>
     were appointed to guard. The multitude, even

     <lb/>
     than those in office, who cannot see their own 
     <lb/>
     defects and errors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The first move in regard to a union of any 
     <lb/>
     kind was made in the session of 1864 by this 
     <lb/>
     Legislature. The Provincial Secretary then 
     <lb/>
     moved a resolution asking us to empower the 
     <lb/>
     Lieutenant Governor to communicate with 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick and P. E. Island, in reference 
     <lb/>
     to the appointment of delegates to meet at some 
     <lb/>
     central point, to take into consideration and 
     <lb/>
     agree upon a basis for a union of the maritime 
     <lb/>
     provinces. That resolution was passed almost 
     <lb/>
     without opposition. I think it was the duty of 
     <lb/>
     the delegates first to have reported, for the in<lb break="no"/>formation of the people of these provinces, 
     <lb/>
     what their success was as regards a union of 
     <lb/>
     the maritime provinces. But the action taken 
     <lb/>
     by the delegates at that time as to a maritime 
     <lb/>
     union passed away like a morning cloud or a 
     <lb/>
     dream in the night,—poor Nova Scotia was lost 
     <lb/>
     sight of, and a delegation to Canada was form<lb break="no"/>ed, without asking the lower provinces whe<lb break="no"/>ther they were willing or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it is the duty of every man around 
     <lb/>
     these benches to define his position in regard 
     <lb/>
     to this great question. My position is this: 
     <lb/>
     I am in favor of a union of the maritime prov<lb break="no"/>inces, but not a union with Canada; that was 
     <lb/>
     my position from the time the scheme of union 
     <lb/>
     was first brought forward, and I still entertain 
     <lb/>
     the same views, and I believe thatit is the 
     <lb/>
     view of a very large portion of the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country. Before I would betray the trust 
     <lb/>
     reposed in me, or consent, by any act or vote 
     <lb/>
     of mine, to surrender one jot or one tittle of the 
     <lb/>
     rights, or the honor, or the glory of this country 
     <lb/>
     "my right hand shall forget its cunning, and 
     <lb/>
     my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have heard a good deal said about the 
     <lb/>
     Fenians, and about disloyalty to the Crown.— 
     <lb/>
     What does all this mean ? Is it to frighten 
     <lb/>
     the people into Confederation? Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     is as loyal as any other country on the face of 
     <lb/>
     the earth, but do not disturb the birthright of 
     <lb/>
     the people without their consent. Sir, as 
     <lb/>
     regards the Fenians or any other foe, when<lb break="no"/>ever they come to disturb the peace of our 
     <lb/>
     country, I as one am ready to meet them under 
     <lb/>
     the British flag—the flag of freedom; but I 
     <lb/>
     intend on this occasion, at whatever hazard or 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice of a personal kind, to do what I con<lb break="no"/>sider is my duty to my constituents and the 
     <lb/>
     country at large.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The principle which lies at the foundation of 
     <lb/>
     our constitution, is that which declares the 
     <lb/>
     people to be the source of political power. A 
     <lb/>
     constitution written on paper is not a safe one, 
     <lb/>
     a constitution to be safe must be written on 
     <lb/>
     the hearts of the people. The powerful tempt<lb break="no"/>ation to betray our trust, held out by the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, to surrender up our own convic<lb break="no"/>tions, ought to be resisted; a steady adherence 
     <lb/>
     to truth, whether in favor or out of favor, must 
     <lb/>
     mark the course of every man who will not 
     <lb/>
     lose his own respect. I do not despise popu<lb break="no"/>larity, I respect it. But it is that popularity 
     <lb/>
     which follows, and not that which is sought 
     <lb/>
     after; and if there be one quality, which a 
     <lb/>
     representative of our country ought to cultivate 
     <lb/>
     at the present time above all others, it is 
     <lb/>
     independence. Not a defiance of the well 
     <lb/>
     understood wishes of the people; his course 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     should be a manly and steady adherence to 
     <lb/>
     principle, through good report and evil report: 
     <lb/>
     a stout defiance of what he considers right 
     <lb/>
     through sunshine and through storm. Such 
     <lb/>
     independence every man should cultivate who 
     <lb/>
     undertakes to serve his country. Caesar, who 
     <lb/>
     yielded to that infirmity of noble minds—the 
     <lb/>
     love of power, fell in the very Senate Cham<lb break="no"/>ber under the avenging dagger of Brutus.— 
     <lb/>
     Again, Napoleon's brilliant but unwise career 
     <lb/>
     was checked, at the moment when he gained 
     <lb/>
     his highest position. When he had kept the 
     <lb/>
     nations in dread, he was sent a prisoner to an 
     <lb/>
     island far from every field of his glory, and 
     <lb/>
     where the dashing billows mocked at the 
     <lb/>
     surges of his own passions. Our liberty, 
     <lb/>
     once taken away, may never return, and I 
     <lb/>
     see by the features of the proposed scheme, 
     <lb/>
     if it be carried into effect, we would be 
     <lb/>
     exposed to two dangers: centralization and 
     <lb/>
     disunion;—the General Government would 
     <lb/>
     have gigantic power, and might employ its 
     <lb/>
     functions to enrich one section of the union 
     <lb/>
     at the expense of the other. Its complex 
     <lb/>
     character—blending the powers of the General 
     <lb/>
     Government with those of the several Local 
     <lb/>
     Governments, exposes it to dangers from its 
     <lb/>
     own action. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are yet in the freshness of youth, and 
     <lb/>
     the fairest of our sisters, our seaboard and min<lb break="no"/>eral wealth hold out a strong temptation to 
     <lb/>
     those abroad. But, sir. I would say with all 
     <lb/>
     sincerity, let the people of Nova Scotia make 
     <lb/>
     their own choice. The power of figures has 
     <lb/>
     been brought forward in gigantic appearence 
     <lb/>
     before the people of this country, differing in 
     <lb/>
     the various calculations to the amount of 
     <lb/>
     some millions of dollars, but it would puzzle 
     <lb/>
     the brain of the best mathematical scholar to 
     <lb/>
     arrive at the real truth of the matter. We may 
     <lb/>
     rely upon it that trade will regulate itself like 
     <lb/>
     water, it will find its level. That union is 
     <lb/>
     strength, is true, but to be strength it must be 
     <lb/>
     a whole union, not a half. We see nothing like 
     <lb/>
     a united public opinion in favor of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion in this country,—the contrary is the case, 
     <lb/>
     public opinion seems to be split throughout the 
     <lb/>
     hand,—so much so, that a small majority in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of the resolution would be a very poor safe<lb break="no"/>guard of a lasting union. It has been said with 
     <lb/>
     a good deal of force, that the power to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question is invested in the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the people. I do not deny but they 
     <lb/>
     have such power, for a government with a large 
     <lb/>
     majority can do almost anything. But such 
     <lb/>
     power in regard to a change in the constitution 
     <lb/>
     without the consent of the people of this coun<lb break="no"/>try wlll never be exercised by me. Slight 
     <lb/>
     causes have given rise to the fiercest and most 
     <lb/>
     cruel wars which history records, the plough<lb break="no"/>ing up of a few acres of soil plunged the states 
     <lb/>
     of Greece into a sanguinary conflict. An at<lb break="no"/>tempt to collect ship money shook the empire 
     <lb/>
     of England, and drove Hampden to the field, 
     <lb/>
     where he lost his life in one of the first battles 
     <lb/>
     ever fought for constitutional liberty, and 
     <lb/>
     brought the annointed head of a king to the 
     <lb/>
     block. A tax of a; few cents on a pound of 
     <lb/>
     tea drove the colonies into a war, which broke 
     <lb/>
     the dominion of the British government, and 
     <lb/>
     left them independent states. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, look at Ireland. She constitutes a 
     <lb/>
     portion of the British Empire. What battle 
     <lb/>
     has been fought in modern times by the British 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="291" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1866-04-17_Page_291.jpg"/>
            <fw type="running">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</fw>
            <fw type="num">291</fw>
           
     arms, where Irish blood has not been freely 
     <lb/>
     spilled, and where Irish valor has not contri<lb break="no"/>buted to win the day? The Irishmen in the 
     <lb/>
     ranks have ever been true to their trust. They 
     <lb/>
     bore the British flag in triumph against the 
     <lb/>
     marshals of France. At Waterloo, they up<lb break="no"/>held it for Wellington against the splendid ar<lb break="no"/>ray which Napoleon mustered in person, and 
     <lb/>
     yet what is the state of Ireland to-day? Why, 
     <lb/>
     the fertile soil of Ireland, teeming with abund<lb break="no"/>ance, is made to support foreign landlords, ab<lb break="no"/>sentees, who squander abroad the wealth 
     <lb/>
     which Ireland yields, and thousands of her 
     <lb/>
     sons and fair daughters have to come to Ame<lb break="no"/>rica, where they can have all the safeguards to 
     <lb/>
     industry and enterprise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Every Novascotian can survey his country 
     <lb/>
     with patriotic pride; he may sit in her councils, 
     <lb/>
     an equal among equals, and no man who re<lb break="no"/>presents her people should surrender their 
     <lb/>
     rights. If he does so he is already dead to the 
     <lb/>
     noble impulses which can alone preserve peace 
     <lb/>
     and liberty. The protracted discussion carried 
     <lb/>
     on in this House, and the angry feelings which 
     <lb/>
     too often characterized it, only fill the country 
     <lb/>
     with apprehension, and impede the progress 
     <lb/>
     of public business. A storm which sweeps 
     <lb/>
     the ocean and drives the vessel before its fury, 
     <lb/>
     makes the mariner look more closely to his 
     <lb/>
     means of safety, and a political storm which 
     <lb/>
     threatens to disturb the constitution of a coun<lb break="no"/>try, only brings about a new impulse as to the 
     <lb/>
     great elementary principles upon which the 
     <lb/>
     fabric rests. Now, as regards the petitions that 
     <lb/>
     have come from the country, they have not 
     <lb/>
     met with that cordial reception which they are 
     <lb/>
     entitled to. It has been said that they were 
     <lb/>
     signed by men, women and children, and were 
     <lb/>
     got up by a political opposition. Now, sir, as 
     <lb/>
     regards the petitions that came from North 
     <lb/>
     Hants, I beg to say from my own personal 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the names attached to them that 
     <lb/>
     they were not signed by women and children, 
     <lb/>
     but were signed by Conservatives and Liberals 
     <lb/>
     (so called); men that know their duty both to 
     <lb/>
     themselves and their country, and would not 
     <lb/>
     be backward in speaking out for the protection 
     <lb/>
     of their birth right, if called upon to do so. 
     <lb/>
     General Harrison, when about to give his vote 
     <lb/>
     on a great question, made a noble reply to a 
     <lb/>
     friend, who told him he would ruin himself by 
     <lb/>
     the vote which he proposed to give, he exclaim<lb break="no"/>ed, " It is better to ruin myself than to destroy 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of my country." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In a free government there must always be 
     <lb/>
     divisions and parties; and there should be,— 
     <lb/>
     because eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, 
     <lb/>
     and nothing so stimulates vigilance as the con<lb break="no"/>flicting opinions of parties. But we should 
     <lb/>
     ever remember that the claims of our country 
     <lb/>
     stand far above the claims of party. Why 
     <lb/>
     does a patriot await the result with suspended 
     <lb/>
     animation and pale cheek? Because upon the 
     <lb/>
     issue hangs the fate of his country. If victory 
     <lb/>
     light upon his standard, his altar and his fire<lb break="no"/>side are safe. Now, sir, with our fertile soil, 
     <lb/>
     our noble streams, our mineral wealth, large 
     <lb/>
     seaboard for navigation and shipbuilding—our 
     <lb/>
     population intelligent, enterprising, and religi<lb break="no"/>ous,—these will enable us to advance with a 
     <lb/>
     steady and sure march in civilization. And I 
     <lb/>
     am for that sort of industry which spreads 
     <lb/>
     wealth among the laboring classes, and elevates 
     <lb/>
     them gradually in the scale. I believe in firm 
     <lb/>
     protection of the rights of the weak, whenso<lb break="no"/>
            
   <cb/>
           
     ever they are in danger by the power of the 
     <lb/>
     strong; and wherever you find Englishmen, 
     <lb/>
     Irishmen, and Scotchmen, you will find that 
     <lb/>
     they carry with them the high qualities of their 
     <lb/>
     race, which have led the way in civilization, by 
     <lb/>
     spreading the great principle of freedom—<choice><sic>free<lb break="no"/>doom</sic><corr>freedom</corr></choice> in religion and freedom in government— 
     <lb/>
     over the world. Their prosperity has been 
     <lb/>
     brought about by an overruling Providence. 
     <lb/>
     There are many who look more to the creature 
     <lb/>
     than to the Creator; they trust to their own 
     <lb/>
     strength instead of looking to Him who governs 
     <lb/>
     the affairs of men; and if a sparrow cannot fall 
     <lb/>
     to the ground without His notice, il is also 
     <lb/>
     probable that an empire cannot rise without 
     <lb/>
     His aid. May the light of liberty which now 
     <lb/>
     shines over our land long remain to gladden 
     <lb/>
     generations yet unborn! May the flag that 
     <lb/>
     floats over every part of British territory, and 
     <lb/>
     catches the eye of the navigator returning from 
     <lb/>
     every country, which is borne by our ships 
     <lb/>
     upon all the waters of the globe, and which is 
     <lb/>
     known and honored as the flag that is as<lb break="no"/>sociated with all the glories of our past history, 
     <lb/>
     let its folds glitter before the eyes of mankind 
     <lb/>
     as the sign of hope and universal freedom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have thus expressed a few of my thoughts 
     <lb/>
     on this important subject now under conside<lb break="no"/>ration, and if the time has come when all inde<lb break="no"/>pendence of public opinion must be sacrificed 
     <lb/>
     at the shrine of power, when the people will 
     <lb/>
     sustain no man who dares to be candid, then, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I desire to have no participation in the 
     <lb/>
     administration of public affairs. I can be 
     <lb/>
     much happier and much more profitably 
     <lb/>
     employed in giving my attention to humbler 
     <lb/>
     duties. The right for the people to decide this 
     <lb/>
     question for themselves, is one of those great 
     <lb/>
     political rights of which no one should desire 
     <lb/>
     to deprive them; and I cannot consent, for one 
     <lb/>
     single moment, to abandon any part of their 
     <lb/>
     claims. I hope there is yet independent spirit 
     <lb/>
     in this house, that we shall not be guilty of so 
     <lb/>
     great an outrage as that proposed. Those who 
     <lb/>
     concur in passing Confederation at the present 
     <lb/>
     time, will take upon themselves an awful res<lb break="no"/>ponsibility; a responsibility for which their 
     <lb/>
     constituents will call them to a strict account. 
     <lb/>
     This resolution may pass, but if it does, those 
     <lb/>
     who vote for it will lose the confidence, and the 
     <lb/>
     judgment and good sense of a very large 
     <lb/>
     majority of the people. I see that party train<lb break="no"/>ing is going on; prescriptive spirit is rising; 
     <lb/>
     every appeal that can be made to human pas<lb break="no"/>sions is urged, and names not of the most 
     <lb/>
     pleasing kind are freely bestowed upon those 
     <lb/>
     who have the firmness to oppose a change  in 
     <lb/>
     the constitution. Sir, names can never effect 
     <lb/>
     principles or change position Ingenuity may 
     <lb/>
     coin them, and effrontry apply them, but the 
     <lb/>
     actual relations of life remain the same,— 
     <lb/>
     therefore let us be faithful to our great trust— 
     <lb/>
     From the battlefields of all the earth upon 
     <lb/>
     which liberty has set up her standard, there 
     <lb/>
     comes to us the cry "be faithful;" from the 
     <lb/>
     crumbled senate halls of nations for ever 
     <lb/>
     passed away, there comes to us an implor<lb break="no"/>ing appeal to be faithful to those who put 
     <lb/>
     their confidence in us. But, if Confederation 
     <lb/>
     must pass by a majority in the House, with<lb break="no"/>out the consent of a majority of the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country, then I say to my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, and also to the country at large, " thou 
     <lb/>
     canst not say I did it."

     Nova Scotia. Sir, I regret exceedingly that a 
     <lb/>
     resolution was passed in this House in 1864, 
     <lb/>
     authorizing a delegation to consult as to the 
     <lb/>
     propriety of a union of the Maritime Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     for out of that has grown the delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, and there with closed doors a consul<lb break="no"/>tation was held which ended in bartering away 
     <lb/>
     this fine Province, the people, and the consti<lb break="no"/>tution, to Canadian rule. There we have been 
     <lb/>
     sold, there we have been valued, there the 
     <lb/>
     rights dear to us of governing ourselves, and 
     <lb/>
     of being in ourselves a free, independent and 
     <lb/>
     contented people, were given up ; and when it 
     <lb/>
     is, known through the length and breadth of 
     <lb/>
     the land that this resolution has been passed, 
     <lb/>
     then it is that the indignation of the people 
     <lb/>
     will be aroused to an extent perhaps that will 
     <lb/>
     be calculated to weaken the strong feel<lb break="no"/>ings of attachment to their rulers that had 
     <lb/>
     hitherto existed. If this question had been 
     <lb/>
     approached in a way that was fair and honor<lb break="no"/>able by first submitting the whole question to 
     <lb/>
     the country at the polls, and if it were then 
     <lb/>
     passed by the Legislature there would not 
     <lb/>
     have been the cause of complaint which at pre<lb break="no"/>sent exists. This is indeed a most dangerous 
     <lb/>
     step which is about to be taken; we have a 
     <lb/>
     thinking and intelligent people in Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia—a people that will not be likely to tolerate 
     <lb/>
     having their constitution bartered away with<lb break="no"/>out their consent, and without having those 
     <lb/>
     privileges which responsible government was 
     <lb/>
     intended to secure to them. I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     that the Imperial Parliament will ratify this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, if they are made properly acquainted 
     <lb/>
      with the whole transaction and with the facts 
     <lb/>
     which bear upon the case. Loyalty to the 
     <lb/>
     Crown has been spoken of. Sir, we pretend 
     <lb/>
     to foster that feeling, whilst at the same time 
     <lb/>
     a few men who now govern the country—who 
     <lb/>
     are expected to govern the people according to 
     <lb/>
     their well understood wishes, and who ob<lb break="no"/>tained place and power at the polls in 1863 un<lb break="no"/>der the cry of retrenchment, but who have so 
     <lb/>
     managed the public affairs as to gain for them<lb break="no"/>selves, as they well know, the withering re<lb break="no"/>buke of seven-eighths of the people, to cap the 
     <lb/>
     climax—without submitting the measure to 
     <lb/>
     the people—they urge us to pass a resolution 
     <lb/>
     to deprive our beloved country of its Consti<lb break="no"/>tution. Sir, I would ask can language be em<lb break="no"/>ployed sufficiently strong to convey the disap<lb break="no"/>proval of this act? I have heard strong lan<lb break="no"/>guage made use of here at times; I heard only 
     <lb/>
     the other day the Prov. Secretary make use of 
     <lb/>
     the word " traitor" to another hon gentleman 
     <lb/>
     across the floor of this house. Sir, I will not 
     <lb/>
     make use of that term, but I am at a loss for 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     language sufficiently strong and severe with<lb break="no"/>out doing so. What can be said of the men 
     <lb/>
     who, in the face of the fact of nine-tenths of 
     <lb/>
     the people of this Province being decidedly 
     <lb/>
     adverse to the passage of this resolution, pro<lb break="no"/>pose to sweep away our constitution and make 
     <lb/>
     us subservient to the rule of Canadian States<lb break="no"/>men, in whose wisdom for governing a country 
     <lb/>
     we have but little faith, and from whom we 
     <lb/>
     are severed for six months of the year as to any 
     <lb/>
     mode of travelling over British territory by 
     <lb/>
     land, and entirely shut out by sea, and for the 
     <lb/>
     other six months we have very indifferent com<lb break="no"/>munication. It is said we are to have the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway. This may be the case in 
     <lb/>
     the course of time, but the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way should have preceded the Union of the 
     <lb/>
     Colonies. Why, sir, suppose a war was to 
     <lb/>
     break out between the United States and G. 
     <lb/>
     Britain, and the General Parliament had to be 
     <lb/>
     convened in winter months at Ottawa, how 
     <lb/>
     are we to reach there? Would it be over the 
     <lb/>
     ice. or on snow shoes over land? Sir, had the 
     <lb/>
     public men of Canada been true to their inte<lb break="no"/>rests, and the Colonial Secretaries of England 
     <lb/>
     been true to their engagements, we should 
     <lb/>
     long before this have had the railway built.— 
     <lb/>
     Can Canadians or Nova Scotians expect to 
     <lb/>
     build that railway on terms made easier as to 
     <lb/>
     finances than by the offers made by the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Government in 1862, to which the Canadians 
     <lb/>
     refused to accede? If they had acceded, the 
     <lb/>
     road might now have been built. The reason 
     <lb/>
     for Canada not accepting the offers then made 
     <lb/>
     may have been that they expected at some 
     <lb/>
     future day to use that work as a lever by 
     <lb/>
     which to force the Maritime Provinces into a 
     <lb/>
     union; and, sir may we not well believe that 
     <lb/>
     they have accomplished the end in view? They 
     <lb/>
     must be famous for their powers of persuasion 
     <lb/>
     or they never could have buttered the delega<lb break="no"/>tion from this Province so smoothly as to get 
     <lb/>
     them to sign that document at Quebec. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve it was at the last great dinner at Mon<lb break="no"/>treal that the iniquitous scheme was comple<lb break="no"/>ted—a scheme so unjust to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     Province—a scheme by which the country and 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution they loved so well have been 
     <lb/>
     most grossly bartered away—and a scheme 
     <lb/>
     that the government of this Province will not, 
     <lb/>
     nay, sir, dare not, submit to the people at the 
     <lb/>
     polls. But it may be said by the friends of 
     <lb/>
     this measure that the scheme is to be altered, 
     <lb/>
     they having met the propositions of the hon 
     <lb/>
     gentleman from Richmond, but does not every 
     <lb/>
     one know that this is a farce, a delusion? Does 
     <lb/>
     not every one know that that proposition was 
     <lb/>
     known to the government long before it was 
     <lb/>
     announced on the floors of this house? The 
     <lb/>
     resolution is that the British Government shall 
     <lb/>
     arbitrate between contending parties, when 
     <lb/>
     the British Government have already declared 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the Quebec scheme, and, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     without looking minutely into the matter; but 
     <lb/>
     having passed on the Quebec scheme already, 
     <lb/>
     they will not retract;—and the government of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia having already pledged them<lb break="no"/>selves over and over again to the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     scheme, does any one suppose that they will 
     <lb/>
     compromise themselves by going as a dele<lb break="no"/>gation to England to persuade the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Government to make alterations which 
     <lb/>
     they well know Canada will not agree to. 
     <lb/>
     They would be fools if they did, seeing the 
     <lb/>
     way in which this resolution passed this house, 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="293" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1866-04-17_Page_293.jpg"/>

     if it does pass. Do you wish to heap insult 
     <lb/>
     upon injury by trying to delude the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country with such a resolution? Sir, I say 
     <lb/>
     again do you wish to insult the common intel<lb break="no"/>ligence of Nova Scotians? Several questions 
     <lb/>
     that should be answered by the promoters of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme are these: Did not the delegation 
     <lb/>
     at Quebec sit in secret? Did they not con<lb break="no"/>clude that Quebec scheme with closed doors? 
     <lb/>
     Was it not understood by all the parties then 
     <lb/>
     that the terms of the scheme were not to be 
     <lb/>
     disclosed until all the delegates should return? 
     <lb/>
     Did not the Canadian delegates proceed post 
     <lb/>
     haste to England, there to implore the Secre<lb break="no"/>tary for the Colonies to aid their propositions? 
     <lb/>
     And was it not urged at the Colonial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary's office nearly as soon as in Temperance 
     <lb/>
     Hall? Sir, I do not wonder that the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians should with such haste endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     excite the sympathies of the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment in favour of this scheme when they had 
     <lb/>
     made a bargain so much to their own advan<lb break="no"/>tage. I believe that could the disadvantages 
     <lb/>
     that this involves to Nova Scotia have been 
     <lb/>
     shewn to the British government they could 
     <lb/>
     not have been so blind to our interests as to 
     <lb/>
     favour such a scheme; but all this will be re<lb break="no"/>presented to the British government. It is 
     <lb/>
     not impossible nor unlikely that this may yet 
     <lb/>
     be a question of greater moment in the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of England than may now be imagined, 
     <lb/>
     and when it is known that this Quebec scheme 
     <lb/>
     is so distasteful to the people of this province; 
     <lb/>
     when the injustice of the case comes to be 
     <lb/>
     known, and the discontent and strife that will 
     <lb/>
     be engendered thereby, I feel some hope that 
     <lb/>
     the British government will pause before they 
     <lb/>
     pass an act to make this resolution become the 
     <lb/>
     law of the land. I presume that the British 
     <lb/>
     government will have a detailed account of 
     <lb/>
     the whole scheme; a pounds shillings and 
     <lb/>
     pence version of the whole affair; a matter of 
     <lb/>
     fact proposition for them to solve; and when 
     <lb/>
     they do know, as I believe they do not know, 
     <lb/>
     that Nova Scotia must lose at least $200,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year by the arrangement, which they will 
     <lb/>
     have to make up by direct taxation—and that 
     <lb/>
     that will be a mode of raising money—that 
     <lb/>
     will be likely to create a very bad feeling and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps almost a revolution in the country, 
     <lb/>
     they will pause before they pass the act. But, 
     <lb/>
     sir, in making use of this language, I am quite 
     <lb/>
     aware that I shall be styled by the promoters 
     <lb/>
     of this infamous scheme an annexationist; but 
     <lb/>
     this I deny, and I claim to possess as loyal 
     <lb/>
     feelings to my beloved Queen as any man in 
     <lb/>
     this assembly. and it is with feelings loyal to 
     <lb/>
     the crown of Great Britain that I warn you 
     <lb/>
     now of the danger there is of creating a feeling 
     <lb/>
     of hostility to the Government of Britain by 
     <lb/>
     the passage of this act. The feelings of the 
     <lb/>
     people of England have been quoted here by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Attorney General, and the applause he 
     <lb/>
     received at the Manchester dinner when intro<lb break="no"/>duced as one of the union delegates. But, sir, 
     <lb/>
     did the honorable Attorney General ask 
     <lb/>
     them their views of our relation to Eng<lb break="no"/>land under the union? If he had they would 
     <lb/>
     have told him that united we would no 
     <lb/>
     longer be an expense to England for protec<lb break="no"/>tion. And this is the general impression of 
     <lb/>
     the people of England. I was in England last 
     <lb/>
     winter, and in Manchester, and was in conver<lb break="no"/>sation with gentlemen there of high standing, 
     <lb/>
     some of the Manchester school, and found that 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     this was the general idea that these Provinces 
     <lb/>
     united would no longer be a burthen to the 
     <lb/>
     people of England for protection, and I found 
     <lb/>
     this to be the idea of a very large proportion 
     <lb/>
     of the people there with whom I came in con<lb break="no"/>tact, but I do not mean to say that the British 
     <lb/>
     government entertain that idea. Now, sir, 
     <lb/>
     having kept the house so long at this late 
     <lb/>
     hour I will not prolong my remarks, but should 
     <lb/>
     have done so if time had been allowed. I feel 
     <lb/>
     that I am doing my duty to Nova Scotia, as 
     <lb/>
     my native land, to the people I am here to 
     <lb/>
     represent, and to myself, by voting against the 
     <lb/>
     resolution laid on the table by the hon. Prov. 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     devolves upon me of expressing my views on 
     <lb/>
     this resolution. I may state that until this 
     <lb/>
     evening no one has been informed of the way 
     <lb/>
     in which I intend to vote; when meetings 
     <lb/>
     were held at Yarmouth and Argyle I said I 
     <lb/>
     would not give a decided opinion until the le<lb break="no"/>gislature met, and the pros and cons of the 
     <lb/>
     question laid before us. I have come here, I 
     <lb/>
     have heard speeches upon both sides, and have 
     <lb/>
     made up my mind to vote against the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion which the government have introduced. I 
     <lb/>
     feel that the duty which I owe to my constitu<lb break="no"/>ency, and that duty is not a small one, requires 
     <lb/>
     that I should take this action. Since coming 
     <lb/>
     to this house I have supported the government 
     <lb/>
     almost to a vote, sometimes with a disregard 
     <lb/>
     of my personal position, but on this measure I 
     <lb/>
     will do what is right irrespctive of political 
     <lb/>
     feelings and with a determination to stand or 
     <lb/>
     fall by the course which I pursue. I have fre<lb break="no"/>quently felt diffident in addressing the house, 
     <lb/>
     feeling that I was a young member and unac<lb break="no"/>customed to public speaking, in comparrison 
     <lb/>
     with some gentlemen who frequently address 
     <lb/>
     us, but to-night I stand firm in the conviction 
     <lb/>
     that the course I am taking is one that be<lb break="no"/>comes my position. We find that out of the 
     <lb/>
     ten or eleven lawyers who have seats in this 
     <lb/>
     house, nine are in favor of the scheme, and 
     <lb/>
     what is their object unless it be personal ag<lb break="no"/>grandisement? To-night we have seen a gen<lb break="no"/>tleman sitting here, and not revealing even to 
     <lb/>
     his own colleagues that he had " paired off" 
     <lb/>
     with another member and did not intend to 
     <lb/>
     vote on the division. That certainly looks sus<lb break="no"/>picious, and has convinced me that all the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances connected with the transaction 
     <lb/>
     have not been revealed. I have made these 
     <lb/>
     few remarks without preparation, and would 
     <lb/>
     not have spoken to-night if the Prov. Secre<lb break="no"/>tary had not forced the division.

     <persName ref="pers:BROW3">Dr. BROWN</persName> said :—At this hour of the night,

     Mr. Speaker, and fatigued as I am by a long

     <lb/>
     not object to the resolution before the house,

     provided the people were allowed to decide

     time would gradually alter their tone, and at 
     <lb/>
     last willingly adopt the change. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But I ask, sir, where is the necessity for this 
     <lb/>
     indecent haste? Haste in a two-fold sense. 
     <lb/>
     Haste, not only in cramming this measure 
     <lb/>
     down the people's throats without their consent 
     <lb/>
     and against the will of a vast majority, but 
     <lb/>
     haste in bringing this debate to a close to-night, 
     <lb/>
     and thus stifling the voice of free discussion. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing can be more arbitrary than the con<lb break="no"/>duct of the government. They can fritter 
     <lb/>
     away days and weeks on useless and frivol<lb break="no"/>ous matters, but on the great question, whether 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia shall retain her rights and liber<lb break="no"/>ties—her very existence, the Provincial Sec'y 
     <lb/>
     denies us an hour. I ask, sir, where is the 
     <lb/>
     necessity for action? Why not remain as we 
     <lb/>
     are? What is the emergency? Is it, because, 
     <lb/>
     as the Provincial Secretary has admitted, the 
     <lb/>
     government and union party in this house are 
     <lb/>
     afraid to hear the voice of the people? I thank 
     <lb/>
     the Pro. Secy. for the admission—it is candid, 
     <lb/>
     ande xplains his position. The emergency, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, is not the emergency of the people, 
     <lb/>
     it is the emergency of the rulers of the people. 
     <lb/>
     Why is it that they will not refer this measure, 
     <lb/>
     this most momentous of all measures that ever 
     <lb/>
     came before this Legislature, to the people 
     <lb/>
     whom it most concerns? simply because they 
     <lb/>
     dare not. Do you suppose, sir, can any man 
     <lb/>
     imagine, if the government had a ghost of a 
     <lb/>
     chance they would hesitate to appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     hustings? The voice of the people and the 
     <lb/>
     voice of their representatives are stifled, be<lb break="no"/>cause they know it is against them. Now, sir, 
     <lb/>
     this act may be perpetrated, the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Nova Scotia may be 
     <lb/>
     trampled on, and ignored, but I apprehend this 
     <lb/>
     will not be the end of the contest. The voice of 
     <lb/>
     the people though silenced for the present will 
     <lb/>
     make itself heard. I mistake much if the free 
     <lb/>
     and intelligent people of Nova Scotia will 
     <lb/>
     quietly submit to be crushed and overridden— 
     <lb/>
     I mistake much if the honest and enlightened 
     <lb/>
     farmers of Kings County will quietly submit 
     <lb/>
     to it. And when I speak of Kings County I 
     <lb/>
     mean not only South Kings, which I have the 
     <lb/>
     honor to represent, but North Kings which is, 
     <lb/>
     I have every reason to know, equally strong in 
     <lb/>
     its condemnation of this measure. I do not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate to declare it as my opinion in the pre<lb break="no"/>sence of the members for North Kings that 
     <lb/>
     three-fourths of the electors of that district are 
     <lb/>
     opposed to it, and are only waiting for an op<lb break="no"/>portunity to sweep it and its authors away to<lb break="no"/>gether. My learned friend from North Kings, 
     <lb/>
     Dr. Hamilton, says he has learned from a cor<lb break="no"/>respondent in Kings that Mr. Howe's letters 
     <lb/>
     have had the effect of cementing the Conser<lb break="no"/>vatives in that county. I agree with him that 
     <lb/>
     the minds of all parties, With few exceptions, 
     <lb/>
     concur in one point—in denouncing union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I have just returned from a visit 
     <lb/>
     home, and find the anti-union feeling stronger 
     <lb/>
     than ever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Several of my pro-confederate neighbours 
     <lb/>
     said to me, they would like confederation but 
     <lb/>
     not without the test of the people's approval.— 
     <lb/>
     Dr. Hamilton also disputes the reported issue 
     <lb/>
     of the Canning meeting, now I have it from 
     <lb/>
     the most reliable authority, authority that the 
     <lb/>
     learned member himself will not question, 
     <lb/>
     that against one of the resolutions carried, there 
     <lb/>
     was but one vote, and against the other only 
     <lb/>
     three or four. Canning is in the Doctor's im<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     mediate vicinity and a large number of his 
     <lb/>
     constituents reside there. The learned mem<lb break="no"/>ber referred also to his provable retirement 
     <lb/>
     from public life. I advise him to do so by all 
     <lb/>
     means. He certainly could not do a more pru<lb break="no"/>dent thing. I should be glad also to hear my 
     <lb/>
     friend and colleague Mr. Bill give his opinion 
     <lb/>
     on the resolutions before the house. On a 
     <lb/>
     question of such transcendant proportions and 
     <lb/>
     magnitude, a question truly of life and death, 
     <lb/>
     no man should be content with giving a silent 
     <lb/>
     vote. I conclude by imploring the house to 
     <lb/>
     let the people he heard at the polls. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAMI1">DR. HAMILTON</persName>:—My observations merely re<lb break="no"/>ferred to North Kings, I did not refer to South 
     <lb/>
     Kings, and I am prepared to-morrow to resign 
     <lb/>
     my seat, if Dr. Brown will contest it with me. 
     <lb/>
     With regard to the meeting at Canning. I have 
     <lb/>
     four letters in my pocket referring to it; one 
     <lb/>
     says there were sixty persons present; another 
     <lb/>
     says eighty; another says that the number was 
     <lb/>
     one hundred, and a good many of them were 
     <lb/>
     boys. I should like to ask Dr. Brown who in<lb break="no"/>stigated the meeting? I think the suggestion 
     <lb/>
     came from a gentleman not far from me. As 
     <lb/>
     to South Kings, the hon. member knows that I 
     <lb/>
     have stood at the polling places pleading for 
     <lb/>
     him before he chose to change sides. I have in 
     <lb/>
     my possession a letter from one of the first men 
     <lb/>
     in King's, and he says he hopes the House will 
     <lb/>
     pass Confederation; another letter is from a 
     <lb/>
     person who says he would like to see the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can flag floating over the Province, and perhaps 
     <lb/>
     such sentiments as his had a good deal to do 
     <lb/>
     with the Canning meeting.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW3">DR. BROWN</persName> :—I accept the learned member's 
     <lb/>
     challenge to meet him at North King's. It will 
     <lb/>
     give me great pleasure to vacate my seat to<lb break="no"/>morrow, if he will do the some for that pur<lb break="no"/>pose. It will be a pleasant and innocent way 
     <lb/>
     for him to learn the opinion of his constituents. 
     <lb/>
     I don't know who the learned member's cor<lb break="no"/>respondents are. D. R. Daton, Esq. was mine, 
     <lb/>
     and the Doctor himself will agree with me that 
     <lb/>
     this gentleman is entitled to credit and respect. 
     <lb/>
     I did not, as he insinuates, suggest the meeting 
     <lb/>
     at Canning—in that my learned friend has only 
     <lb/>
     made a bad guess. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. KILLAM</persName> : —It is well known, as was ad<lb break="no"/>mitted by the Pro. Sec. himself, that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment do not possess the confidence of the 
     <lb/>
     country and what then is our position? The 
     <lb/>
     government, in the face of this fact, bring for<lb break="no"/>ward a measure to change our entire constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, and call upon members to support them. 
     <lb/>
     What would the leader of the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons do if he were obligod to make such an 
     <lb/>
     admission ? The observations of some gentle<lb break="no"/>men who have spoken to-night I think will give 
     <lb/>
     the government a lesson that cannot soon be 
     <lb/>
     forgotten. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCKA1">Mr. MCKAY</persName> said :—I intend to adopt a differ<lb break="no"/>ent course from that pursued by my colleague 
     <lb/>
     on this question, and I will state a few of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons which influence me Last winter I was 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the Quebec scheme; this session : 
     <lb/>
     resolution has been introduced to modify that

     <lb/>
     direction of the neighboring Republic. One 
     <lb/>
     of the members for Yarmoutb admitted that 
     <lb/>
     nine-tenths of the people of that county are in 
     <lb/>
     favour of annexation,—these are opinions which 
     <lb/>
     no loyalist can endorse. Another gentleman 
     <lb/>
     taking a prominent stand in this discussion has 
     <lb/>
     made remarks concerning our Lieut Governor 
     <lb/>
     which I cannot endorse. I have received some 
     <lb/>
     letters from my constituents, asking me to sup<lb break="no"/>port the resolution, and I have received none 
     <lb/>
     to the contrary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. KILLAM</persName> replied that his colleague, Mr 
     <lb/>
     Townsend, had merely intimated that a majo<lb break="no"/>rity of the people of Yarmouth preferred an<lb break="no"/>nexation to Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LOCK1">Mr. LOCKE</persName> said that in the session of 1862 
     <lb/>
     the Atty. General applied the phrase "dumb 
     <lb/>
     logs" to gentlemen whom he opposed,—that 
     <lb/>
     expression could be very appropriately applied 
     <lb/>
     to gentlemen on the government side, who al<lb break="no"/>lowed the speeches of gentlemen opposed to 
     <lb/>
     the resolution to pass unanswered.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HENR1">Hon. ATTY GEN</persName> said that the gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     whom that phrase was applied in 1862, bore it 
     <lb/>
     pretty easily, and he presumed that his friends 
     <lb/>
     could do the same on this occasion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question was then taken upon Mr S.

            <p>
     To amend the Act incorporating the Govern<lb break="no"/>ors of King's College, Windsor.

            <p>
     Bill relative to Assessment in the county of 
     <lb/>
     Yarmouth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To authorize the sale of a school house at

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     An act for the better security of the Crown 
     <lb/>
     in Nova Scotla against seditious and treason<lb break="no"/>able practices and acts.

            <p>
     On the bill to amend chap. 45 of County 
     <lb/>
     Assessment some desultory discussion ensued. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName> explained that at present 
     <lb/>
     assessment is based upon real and personal 
     <lb/>
     property. A man who possesses a large 
     <lb/>
     amount of income, and little or no real estate, 
     <lb/>
     is not taxed in proportion to his wealth. The 
     <lb/>
     object of the bill is to make his income liable, 
     <lb/>
     and thereby relieve the poorer classes to a 
     <lb/>
     large extent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. STEWART CAMPBELL said that this was 
     <lb/>
     an attempt to impose upon the Province at 
     <lb/>
     large an income tax, at best a most inquisito<lb break="no"/>rial tax. He moved that the bill be deferred. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ALLISON thought that the bill was very 
     <lb/>
     much required; a farmer was now heavily 
     <lb/>
     taxed, whilst his neighbour, a much richer one 
     <lb/>
     who lent money, had little or no taxes to pay 
     <lb/>
     comparatively. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BLANCHARD said that the present bill 
     <lb/>
     only meant to establish the principle in exist<lb break="no"/>ence in the city. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COFF1">Mr. COFFIN</persName> and Mr. TOWNSEND hoped that 
     <lb/>
     the bill would not pass, as it might operate in<lb break="no"/>juriously. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. PARKER supported the bill, as it would 
     <lb/>
     favour the poor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BILL said that there was no question as 
     <lb/>
     to the correctness of the principle of the bill, 
     <lb/>
     but how would it work in the country where 
     <lb/>
     the credit system so largely prevails? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. COWIE said that the difficulty was to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain the actual income a man might have. 
     <lb/>
     He could understand how the bill might work 
     <lb/>
     in reference to a man who lends money out at 
     <lb/>
     interest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BLANCHARD said that the bill was not 
     <lb/>
     of an inquisitorial character; if a man was not 
     <lb/>
     taxed fairly he had his remedy by making an 
     <lb/>
     affidavit of the fact. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr DONKIN believed that any gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who reflected on the subject would see the 
     <lb/>
     propriety of the hill before the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. ATTY. GENL. was in favour of the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of the hill; but suggested whether a more 
     <lb/>
     simple machinery could not be found than 
     <lb/>
     what was in the hill. He believed that a fair 
     <lb/>
     system of taxation, something like what was 
     <lb/>
     proposed in the bill, would relieve the indus<lb break="no"/>trial classes largely from taxation. He was 
     <lb/>
     afraid the present measure went too far. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. PRO. SEC. was of opinion that the bill 
     <lb/>
     was a good one; the effect would be to relieve 
     <lb/>
     the poorer classes.    
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS10">Mr. ROSS</persName> pointed out defects in the existing
