     HON ATTY GEN said that it would be found 
     <lb/>
     on consideration that the eff ct of the bill would 
     <lb/>
     be to lessen the present taxation of the po rer 
     <lb/>
     classes. The bill was read a second time.

     EDUCATION 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. PROV. SEC reported up from the Com- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     mitte on E ucation. The report among other 
     <lb/>
     things recommended that assistance be granted 
     <lb/>
     to Dr. Forrester in the publication of   work on 
     <lb/>
     Education that would be found invaluable to 
     <lb/>
     teachers and others. It stated that during the 
     <lb/>
     present session 31 p titions had been presented 
     <lb/>
     in favor of, and 5 against assessment for the 
     <lb/>
     support of schools.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr ARCHIBALD objected to that part of the 
     <lb/>
     Report which referred to the Halifax Grammar 
     <lb/>
     School; the effect would be, he said, to transfer 
     <lb/>
     property properly belonging to the whole body 
     <lb/>
     of thé citizens to a private body. He sustained 
     <lb/>
     the grant to Dr. Forrester as most judicious. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dr. Brown and Mr. S Campbell objected to 
     <lb/>
     the grant to Dr Forrester 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The report was allowed to lie on the table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The sc ool bill was then taken up for its 3rd 
     <lb/>
     reading. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. S CAMPBELL then moved that 20 cents 
     <lb/>
     be substituted for 30 cents in the 2nd clause. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr Blanchard said he would support th 
     <lb/>
     amendment, as the clauses would operate un<lb break="no"/>fairly in a county like lnverness. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Bill also supported the amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The motion was lost on the following divi<lb break="no"/>sion :— 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     For—Heffernan, Hatfield Hebb, Balcam. Mc

     Farlane. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Bill moved that the bill be recommitted 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of adding these words: " if re<lb break="no"/>commended by the Grand Jury, and approved of 
     <lb/>
     by the Court of Sessions " He argued that 
     <lb/>
     the House could not do better than leave the 
     <lb/>
     matter of taxation in the hands of trustworthy 
     <lb/>
     men as composed the Court of Sessions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The motion was lost by 13 to 88 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Bru. again moved that widows and 
     <lb/>
     unmarried females be exempt to the extent of 
     <lb/>
     $1000 ; but did not press the motion on the un 
     <lb/>
     derstanding that the subject would be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with when the Assessment law was under 
     <lb/>
     consideration 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. S. Campbell gave notice to rescind th 
     <lb/>
     vote on his motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Miscellaneous. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. BILL presented a petition signed by 200 
     <lb/>names, from Kings Co against Confederation. 
     <lb/>Mr MORE, a similar petition from the same 
     <lb/>county.<lb/>

            <p>
     HON ATTY GEN. a petition from Glace Bay 
     <lb/>

     Mr ANNAND a petition from North Queen's 
     <lb/>
     against Confederation.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON ATTY GENL a petition from Col, 
     <lb/>
     Chearnley and a number of Volunteer Officers 
     <lb/>
     complaining that they are not placed on an 
     <lb/>
     equality with Militia Officers ' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. COLIN CAMPBELL urged the strong 
     <lb/>
     claims of the Volunteer organization to favour<lb break="no"/>able consideration They had the right of the 
     <lb/>
     fi ld in the case of war, and yet were ranked 
     <lb/>
     inferior to Militia offic rs They had not been 
     <lb/>
     fairly dealt with; for instance they had only 
     <lb/>
     r ceived $4 a year when they had been promisesd 
     <lb/>
     $5 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr BILL was glad to hear such opinions ex<lb break="no"/>pressed relative to the Volunteers, but thought 
     <lb/>
     the subject might be appropriately referred to 
     <lb/>
     the Commander-in Chief 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. PRYOR said that there was every disposi<lb break="no"/>tion on the part of t e Militia Committee to not 
     <lb/>
     friendly towards the Volunteers 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon PROV SEC. aid that the Government 
     <lb/>
     were disposed to treat the Volunteers in the 
     <lb/>
     most friendly manner. and had always done 
     <lb/>
     their best to promote their progress. If any re<lb break="no"/>duction had been made on the amount contem<lb break="no"/>plated to be given to them, it was without his   
     <lb/>
     knowledge.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. COLIN CAMPBELL said he was glad to 
     <lb/>
     hear the Provincial Secretary state that the 
     <lb/>
     Volunteers we e entitled to the $5 last year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In reply to Mr. Archibald the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary stated that every precau'ion had been 
     <lb/>
     taken to prevent any communication between 
     <lb/>
     the inhabitants and the C olera ship lying in 
     <lb/>
     Quarantine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON Mr. SHANNON presented a petition from 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants of Waverley asking for a lock-up- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     house also a bill in accordance with the prayer 
     <lb/>
     thereof. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr COWIE introduced a bill to amend Chap. 
     <lb/>
     29 acts of 1865 "for the better encouragements 
     <lb/>
     of education." The object is to extend the 
     <lb/>
     time for district No 8 of the town at Liverpool 
     <lb/>
      or the borrowing of certain moneys for educa— 
     <lb/>
     tional purposes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The House then adjourned.

     Upon the motion to take up the order of the 
     <lb/>
     day, <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName> asked that the debate be de<lb break="no"/>ferred in consequence of the arrival of the mail

     steamer from England, which had brought him 
     <lb/>
     important correspondence requiring immediate

     reply. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

     <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">HON. PROV. SEC</persName>. replied that the Government 
     <lb/>were desirous of pressing the matter to a conclu<lb break="no"/>sion, as the Session had far advanced. It was
     <lb/>well known that gentlemen opposite desired de<lb break="no"/>lay for the purpose of creating an agitation of the

     for an adjournment of the debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL3">Mr. MILLER</persName> called attention to the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, in publishing his recent 
     <lb/>
     Speech on this question, had omitted a consider<lb break="no"/>able portion of it. It was of great importance 
     <lb/>
     that this debate should be fairly sent to the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and he trusted that the paper referred to 
     <lb/>
     would receive no portion of the grant for pub<lb break="no"/>lishing the debates, unless this matter was reme<lb break="no"/>died. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName> said he was not aware of the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstance until that moment. He should be 
     <lb/>
     ashamed if any one in his employ could be guilty 
     <lb/>
     of the act intentionally. He would request that 
     <lb/>
     the Committee on Reporting and Printing in<lb break="no"/>vestigate the matter. He did not see why the 
     <lb/>
     debate should be thus forced on. Some time 
     <lb/>
     ago he had asked the Government to define their 
     <lb/>
     policy on the question, and the answer given was, 
     <lb/>
     that they had no policy until after New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick had taken action. It would be impossible 
     <lb/>
     for him to remain in the house that afternoon.

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROV. SEC</persName>. said that no one could say 
     <lb/>
     that justice had not been done to the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman in this debate—as to courtesy, he, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Annand, was entitled to none, for he had been 
     <lb/>
     representing a majority of the house as corrupt 
     <lb/>
     and venal. He, Pro. Secy., was not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     accept the statement that private business inter<lb break="no"/>fered with Mr. Annand's attendance, for that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman had spent the morning in the streets, 
     <lb/>
     and had made no secret of his intention to post<lb break="no"/>pone the debate.

     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName> rose to reply; but upon interrup<lb break="no"/>ions coming from the galleries, <persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. Campbell</persName>

     [...] <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName> asked what would be 
     <lb/>
     thought if two sections of any denomination 
     <lb/>
     agreed to unite and the House resolved that 
     <lb/>
     they should not do so? That was the position 
     <lb/>
     of this case; not a man connected with the 
     <lb/>
     united body had voted for the bill excepting 
     <lb/>
     the Attorney General who was the counsel of 
     <lb/>
     the claimants. The rule which the House had 
     <lb/>
     just laid down would, if applied to some other 
     <lb/>
     churches, rend them to the foundation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP4">Mr. C. J. CAMPBELL</persName> said he wanted nothing 
     <lb/>
     more than the strong expressions and threats 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Archibald to convince the house that 
     <lb/>
     the bill would pass. It seemed as if that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman could not get sufficiently strong 
     <lb/>
     terms of abuse to apply to him, Mr. C., and 
     <lb/>
     the Inspector of Schools. For his part he was 
     <lb/>
     content that the hon. gentleman should abuse 
     <lb/>
     him, for such abuse did not affect him in the 
     <lb/>
     smallest degree. He had understood the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to threaten the house with a Pres<lb break="no"/>byterian ascendency — that showed that the 
     <lb/>union was merely for party purposes. What 
     <lb/>matter was it to the house what Church, he 
     <lb/>Mr. C., belonged to? 300 persons had petition<lb break="no"/>ed and had declared and shown that <choice><sic>ther</sic><corr>their</corr></choice> pro<lb break="no"/>ty had been taken from them. He himself 
     <lb/>had seen the cemeteries referred to locked. 
     <lb/>The bill would not take a penny from the uni<lb break="no"/>ted body, its object was to repeal an obnoxi<lb break="no"/>ous clause which gave them property that they 
     <lb/>never paid for. He came there to represent 
     <lb/>his constituency, and to state the claims of any 
     <lb/>parties putting them in his hands, and did not 
     <lb/>care how many were opposed to him if he was 
     <lb/>right. He felt himself hardly equal to the task 
     <lb/>of combatting gentlemen on the other side with 
     <lb/>all their ability, for he could with difficulty 
     <lb/>speak the English language, but the remarks 
     <lb/>of Mr. Archibald showed that this was the 
     <lb/>greatest defeat of that gentleman's public life. 
     <lb/>That gentleman must have felt the strength of 
     <lb/>the case laid before the house, when he had 
     <lb/>declined the challenge to argue out the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and had been ashamed to further his own 
     <lb/>progeny , being obliged to get another member, 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Inverness, to do the dirty 
     <lb/>work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAN2">Mr. BLANCHARD</persName> said it was very seldom 
     <lb/>
     that any member even condescended to such 
     <lb/>
     ungentlemanly, indecent and contemptible 
     <lb/>
     vituperation as that which had just been heard. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing better, however, was to be expected 
     <lb/>
     from the hon. member for Victoria. That gen<lb break="no"/>tleman had said that he could not speak the 
     <lb/>
     English language—that had been abundantly 
     <lb/>
     proved, and the words he used were only fit 
     <lb/>for the arena of the fish market. The next 
     <lb/>time he spoke as he had done he would receive 
     <lb/>a still more severe reply. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAN2">Mr. BLANCHARD</persName> then withdrew his notice 
     <lb/>
     of motion to rescind, on the understanding that 
     <lb/>
     the bill would be again opposed on the motion 
     <lb/>
     for the second reading.

     The adjourned debate was resumed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND said:—In rising to address the 
     <lb/>
     House on a question for transcending in magni<lb break="no"/>tude any measure ever submitted for our con<lb break="no"/>sideration If feel I am under no ordinary responsi<lb break="no"/>bility. On this occ sion we have arrayed against 
     <lb/>
     us a large amount of ability from, we suppose, all 
     <lb/>
     the talent of the government combined with that 
     <lb/>
     of the leader of the opposition. Although I de<lb break="no"/>sire that some one more able than myself was 
     <lb/>
     here to put to the members of the House and to 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country the important bearings 
     <lb/>
     of the question, yet I feel that if the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who surround me " speak the truth and feel it," 
     <lb/>
     it will send an echo throught the Province, and if 
     <lb/>
     there should be a maj rity in the House in favor 
     <lb/>
     of a transfer of our privileges to a gov rnment to 
     <lb/>
     be organized six or eight hundred miles off, yet 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen who oppose the bargain will go 
     <lb/>
     down honored to posterity. I feel on this occa<lb break="no"/>sion the necessity for more than ord inary calm 
     <lb/>
     ness—I feel it would ill become me to imitate the 
     <lb/>
     p raicious example set on more than one occa<lb break="no"/>sion by the leader of the government. Have we 
     <lb/>
     not seen that gentleman approaching a question 
     <lb/>
     which involves the dearest rights of the 
     <lb/>
     people, which involves the rights of mem- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     berss who sit here, have we not seen 
     <lb/>
     him rising to move a reso u ion which 
     <lb/>
     will sweep away our constitu on, not in 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of a statesman dealing with a large 
     <lb/>
     public question, but in the tone and spirit of an 
     <lb/>
     angry, an excited, aud when this d bate con<lb break="no"/>cludes, it may be found a disappointed partizan ! 
     <lb/>
     I do not intend to approach the question in that 
     <lb/>
     frame of mind, or to follow him in the intempe<lb break="no"/>rate abuse of gentlemen not here to defend them<lb break="no"/>selves. The mover of the resolution spent an 
     <lb/>
     hour and a half in assailing the Pro e of the 
     <lb/>
     country and those who contribute to and conduct 
     <lb/>
     it. Transferring our thoughts to a wider arena, 
     <lb/>
     can we imagine Mr. Gladstone coming to the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons and prefacing his Reform 
     <lb/>
     Bill hy a tirade against one of the Organs of 
     <lb/>
     pub ic opinion? Could that statesman co des<lb break="no"/>cend to such a course, he would be hissed out of 
     <lb/>
    the House of Commons. And yet that is the
