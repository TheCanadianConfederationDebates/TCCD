            <!-- TY, 2018-01-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
            
            <!--        <p>
     Mr. ARCHIBALD asked what would be 
     <lb/>
     thought if two sections of any denomination 
     <lb/>
     agreed to unite and the House resolved that 
     <lb/>
     they should not do so? That was the position 
     <lb/>
     of this case; not a man connected with the 
     <lb/>
     united body had voted tor the bill excepting 
     <lb/>
     the Attorney General who was the counsel of 
     <lb/>
     "la claimants. The rule which the House had 
     <lb/>
     just laid down would, if applied to some other 
     <lb/>
     churches, rend them to the foundation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. C. J. CAMPBELL said he wanted nothing 
     <lb/>
     more than the strong expressions and threats 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Archibald to convince the house that 
     <lb/>
     the bill would pass. It seemed as if that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman could not get sufficiently strong 
     <lb/>
     terms of abuse to apply to him, Mr. C., and 
     <lb/>
     the Inspector of Schools. For his part he was 
     <lb/>
     content that the hon. gentleman should abuse 
     <lb/>
     him, for such abuse did not affect him in the 
     <lb/>
     smallest degree. He had understood the hon. 
     <lb/>
    gentleman to threaten the house with a Pres- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>byserian ascendency — that shewed that the 
     <lb/>union was merely for party purposes. What 
     <lb/>matter was it to the house what Church. he 
     <lb/>Mr. C., belonged 'o? 300 persons had petition- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>od and had declared and shown that ther pro- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>ty had been taken from them. He himself 
     <lb/>ad seen the cemeteries referred to locked. 
     <lb/>The bill would not take a penny from the uni- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>ted body, its object was to repeal an obnoxi- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>ous clause which gave them property that they 
     <lb/>never paid for. He came there to represent 
     <lb/>his constituency, and to state the claims of any 
     <lb/>parties putting them in his hands. and did not 
     <lb/>care how many were opposed to him if he was 
     <lb/>right. He felt himself hardly equal to the task 
     <lb/>of combatting gentlemen on the other side with 
     <lb/>all their ability, for he could with difficulty 
     <lb/>speak the English language, but the remarks 
     <lb/>of Mr. Archibald showed that this was the 
     <lb/>greatest defeat of that gentleman's public life. 
     <lb/>That gentleman must have felt the strength of 
     <lb/>the case laid before the house, when he had 
     <lb/>declined the challenge to argue out the ques- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>tion, and had been ashamed to further his own 
     <lb/>progeny , bei g obliged to get another member, 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Inverness, to do the dirty 
     <lb/>work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Mr. BLANCHARD said it was very seldom 
     <lb/>
     that any member even condescended to such 
     <lb/>
     ungentlemanly, indecent and contemptible 
     <lb/>
     vituperation as that which had just been heard 
     <lb/>
     Nothing better, however, was to be expected 
     <lb/>
     from the hon. member for Victoria. That gen- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tleman had said that he could not speak the 
     <lb/>
     English language—that had been abundantly 
     <lb/>
    proved, and the words he used were only fit 
     <lb/>for the arena of the fish market. The next 
     <lb/>time he spoke as he had done he would receive 
     <lb/>a still more severe reply. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     Mr BLANCHARD then withdrew his notice 
     <lb/>
     of motion to rescind,on the understanding that 
     <lb/>
     the bill would be again opposed on the motion 
     <lb/>
     {or the second reading.

     HON PROV SEC'Y laid on the table the Re-

     port of the Fruit Growers' Association. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Also a petition in favour of assessment for 
     <lb/>
     support of schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ARCHIBALD presented a petition for 
     <lb/>
     the establishment of a new post road in Col-

     Mr. BLACKWOOD presented a petition from

     Commissioners and Trustees of Stirling dis- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tric , in reference to a school-house which had 
     <lb/>
     been destroyed by fire. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. STEWART CAMPBELL asked the govern- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment to lay on the table any correspondence in 
     <lb/>
     their possession in reference to the abandon- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment of the Quebec scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ARCHIBALD introduced a bill to amend 
     <lb/>
     chap 72 of Revisul Statutes, respecting Com-

     missioners of Sewers.

            <p>
     The adjourned debate was resumed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName> said:—In rising to address the 
     <lb/>
     House on a question for transcending in magni<lb break="no"/>tude any measure ever submitted for our con<lb break="no"/>sideration If feel I am under no ordinary responsi<lb break="no"/>bility. On this occ sion we have arrayed against 
     <lb/>
     us a large amount of ability from, we suppose, all 
     <lb/>
     the talent of the government combined with that 
     <lb/>
     of the leader of the opposition. Although I de<lb break="no"/>sire that some one more able than myself was 
     <lb/>
     here to put to the members of the House and to 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country the important bearings 
     <lb/>
     of the question, yet I feel that if the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who surround me " speak the truth and feel it," 
     <lb/>
     it will send an echo throught the Province, and if 
     <lb/>
     there should be a maj rity in the House in favor 
     <lb/>
     of a transfer of our privileges to a gov rnment to 
     <lb/>
     be organized six or eight hundred miles off, yet 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen who oppose the bargain will go 
     <lb/>
     down honored to posterity. I feel on this occa<lb break="no"/>sion the necessity for more than ordinary calm 
     <lb/>
     ness—I feel it would ill become me to imitate the 
     <lb/>
     p raicious example set on more than one occa<lb break="no"/>sion by the leader of the government. Have we 
     <lb/>
     not seen that gentleman approaching a question 
     <lb/>
     which involves the dearest rights of the 
     <lb/>
     people, which involves the rights of mem<lb break="no"/>berss who sit here, have we not seen 
     <lb/>
     him rising to move a resolution which 
     <lb/>
     will sweep away our constitution, not in 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of a statesman dealing with a large 
     <lb/>
     public question, but in the tone and spirit of an 
     <lb/>
     angry, an excited, aud when this debate con<lb break="no"/>cludes, it may be found a disappointed partizan ! 
     <lb/>
     I do not intend to approach the question in that 
     <lb/>
     frame of mind, or to follow him in the intempe<lb break="no"/>rate abuse of gentlemen not here to defend them<lb break="no"/>selves. The mover of the resolution spent an 
     <lb/>
     hour and a half in assailing the Pro e of the 
     <lb/>
     country and those who contribute to and conduct 
     <lb/>
     it. Transferring our thoughts to a wider arena, 
     <lb/>
     can we imagine Mr. Gladstone coming to the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons and prefacing his Reform 
     <lb/>
     Bill hy a tirade against one of the Organs of 
     <lb/>
     pub ic opinion? Could that statesman co des<lb break="no"/>cend to such a course, he would be hissed out of 
     <lb/>
    the House of Commons. And yet that is the 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="running">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</fw>
            <fw type="num">229</fw>
            
     way in which this question has been approached 
     <lb/>
     by the Provincial Secretary. Let me at the out<lb break="no"/>set invite the attention of the House to the state 
     <lb/>
     of this country two years ago. There had been 
     <lb/>
     discussions in past years in reference to Union, 
     <lb/>
     and there had been diversities of opinion, some 
     <lb/>
     being in favor of a Legislative and some in favor 
     <lb/>
     of a Federal Union; but I challenge any gentle<lb break="no"/>man to show me that beyond the more expression 
     <lb/>
     of abstract opinion in favor of Union, any reso<lb break="no"/>lution was ever proposed. The country was then 
     <lb/>
     peaceful, contented and prosperous ; no one here 
     <lb/>
     thought of changing our constitution for the ake 
     <lb/>
     of connection with Canada. Some of us enter<lb break="no"/>tained views favorable to a union of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. But no one dreamed of giving up our 
     <lb/>
     present institutions and accepting a subordinate 
     <lb/>
     status in another country. l then ask, How does 
     <lb/>
     this question of Confederation arise? By what 
     <lb/>
     necessity has it been produced? Does it arise 
     <lb/>
     from the necessities of the people or Legislature 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia? Why, sir, we all know that 
     <lb/>
     but for the necessities of Canada, as admitted by 
     <lb/>
     the Provincial Secretary himself and by his col<lb break="no"/>league in the delegation, that question would 
     <lb/>
     never have been pressed upon our attention Am 
     <lb/>
     I to understand , as was said elsewhere, that owing 
     <lb/>
     to the Canadian necessities- owing to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the Government of Canada had come to a 
     <lb/>
     dead lock, there being three changes of adminis 
     <lb/>
    tration in three years, and Parliamentary Govern 
     <lb/>ment having become impossible, therefore it was 
     <lb/>that the people of Canada to rid themselves of 
     <lb/>their difficulties, financial and political, cast their 
     <lb/>eyes upon these Provinces as affording a means of 
     <lb/>escape? We all know what took place in 1864. 
     <lb/>A resolution passed authorising the appointment 
     <lb/>of delegates to confer on the question of a Mari<lb break="no"/>time Union; those delegates proceeded to Char<lb break="no"/>lottetown, and there they were met by Canadian 
     <lb/>speculators in politics, by whom they were 
     <lb/>spirited away to Quebec, and were seduced from 
     <lb/>their allegiance to this country and from the mis<lb break="no"/>sion with which we charged them. In October, 
     <lb/>after a fortnight's debate at Quebec, and amidst 
     <lb/>exhaustive festivities, they passed resolutions fa<lb break="no"/>vorable to a union of the Provinces of British 
     <lb/>America. These gentlemen have said that this 
     <lb/>delegation, was authorised by the ministers of the 
     <lb/>Crown and by the Governor General, but it had 
     <lb/>no authority from us. The debate at Quebec 
     <lb/>was conducted in secret, all its deliberations were 
     <lb/>carried on with closed doors, and there is good 
     <lb/>reason to believe that but for the accidental publi<lb break="no"/>cation of those resolutions the scheme might have 
     <lb/>been passed at last Session. I was in England 
     <lb/>when these negotiations were going on, and did 
     <lb/>not return until a few days before the resolutions 
     <lb/>were received. My opinion as to the scheme was 
     <lb/>asked, my answer was ' I have not yet made up 
     <lb/>my mind, but will take time to consider." I did 
     <lb/>take time. and having occasion to make a jour<lb break="no"/>ney of some 20 miles I put the papers in my 
     <lb/>pocket, read them, and when I returned l had 
     <lb/>come to the conclusion that the scheme was un<lb break="no"/>just to this Province, politically and finan<lb break="no"/>cially and that I would be recreant to my 
     <lb/>responsibility to the country if I gave it my sup<lb break="no"/>

    

    
            <cb/>
            
     port. We may be told that the proposition for 
     <lb/>
     union was received with acclamation by the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of England, -let any man go to England to<lb break="no"/>day, and although the allusion is somewhat dis<lb break="no"/>pelled we hear it said: " the Colonies should unite 
     <lb/>
     because the time has come when you should 
     <lb/>
     assume the burthen of your own defence " That 
     <lb/>
     sentiment will be found in the despatches from 
     <lb/>
     beginning to end, it was the burthen of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Cardwell's recent speech at Oxford. With refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the opinion of the Coloniel Secretary of 
     <lb/>
     State l would say-when the scheme of union 
     <lb/>
    was sent home for approval it was at 
     <lb/>once indorsed, in 1864 the Imperial Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had no policy on the subject, 
     <lb/>no desire that we should be confederated, 
     <lb/>but on the contrary , the Lieutenant Governors 
     <lb/>were restricted to the consideration of a Maritime 
     <lb/>Union. I will be told that after the receipt of 
     <lb/>despatches from this side of the water the Colonial 
     <lb/>Secretary consented to delegates proceeding to 
     <lb/>Quebec my argument is that Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>Government, until these representations were sent 
     <lb/>to the Colonial Office, had no policy in reference 
     <lb/>to union. What followed ? In consequence of 
     <lb/>strong despatches from the Governor General re<lb break="no"/>presenting that union was popular in all the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, under this inspiration and believing that 
     <lb/>the thirty-three delegates truly represented the 
     <lb/>sentiments of the people Her Majesty's Ministers 
     <lb/>committed themselves to the policy of union. I 
     <lb/>do not hesitate to say, and in saying it I reveal no 
     <lb/>confidential communication, that l had an inter<lb break="no"/>view with Mr. Cardwell, in which I gave him the 
     <lb/>independent view taken by these Provinces,— 
     <lb/>for the first time that gentleman obtained the 
     <lb/>opinions held by the opposition in this House, and 
     <lb/>the views I gathered from that interview were of 
     <lb/>this effect: " Her Majesty's Government have 
     <lb/>committed themselves to the scheme and are 
     <lb/>therefore bound, if possible, to carry it out."— 
     <lb/>That is the true position of the question at the 
     <lb/>Colonial Office Mr. Cardwell committed a grave 
     <lb/>error which no British statesman in the Colonial 
     <lb/>Office ever committed before in expressing his ap<lb break="no"/>probation of a scheme which had never been 
     <lb/>submitted to the ratification of the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the people. We have been told 
     <lb/>that the public opinion in England is in favor of 
     <lb/>union. Not one in ten of the people of England 
     <lb/>know that there are such places as Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and 
     <lb/>few have heard even of Canada. The first idea 
     <lb/>arising in their minds is that the union will be a 
     <lb/>good thing because the union of the three king<lb break="no"/>doms was good ; but I met only two men during 
     <lb/>my visit to the Mother Country who did not be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the scheme before us was a Legislative 
     <lb/>union ; and when I mentioned what it really was 
     <lb/>—that we were to have a general government and 
     <lb/>then five local Governments, there was not an in<lb break="no"/>telligent man with whom I met that did not treat 
     <lb/>it with contempt. The leading and animating 
     <lb/>opinion of the people of England was that the 
     <lb/>Union scheme was to take from the Mother 
     <lb/>Country a large portion of the burthens with 
     <lb/>which she has been charged in reference to our 
     <lb/>defence. Among others whom I met, was a very

            <p>
     worthy gentleman who was Warden of Fish<lb break="no"/>monger's Hall ; and some will hardly credit me 
     <lb/>
     when I say that this is one of the wealthiest orga<lb break="no"/>nisations in London. That gentlemen was the 
     <lb/>
     Warden when the Prince of Wales dined there, 
     <lb/>
     and it was in that Hall that Mesrs. Galt and 
     <lb/>
     Cartier received their first public dinner in Eng<lb break="no"/>land. The first observation of my friend the 
     <lb/>
     Warden was. "  Mr. Annand, I hope you are in 
     <lb/>
     favor of Confederation." I said that 1 was 
     <lb/>
     not. " What " said he, " not in favor of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, I imagined that all your people 
     <lb/>
     were so". I then explained the reasons of my 
     <lb/>
     opposition, stating that the Provinces were not 
     <lb/>
     connected, that there were four or five hundred 
     <lb/>
     miles of wilderness without there being any 
     <lb/>
     means of communication. His reply was that 
     <lb/>
     he had seen some observation in a newspaper 
     <lb/>
     and that his opinion was that the Railway ought 
     <lb/>
     to precede the union, and when I mentioned the 
     <lb/>
     many prejudices that existed he said: " this is not 
     <lb/>
     a thing to be hurried, satisfy yourselves that 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is right and build your railroad ". 
     <lb/>
     That was the opinion of this gentleman and I 
     <lb/>
     think it is the real opinion of the people of Eng<lb break="no"/>land. But we are told also that the Queen, (God 
     <lb/>
     bless Her Majesty ) is in favor of the scheme— 
     <lb/>
     Under our constitution   the Queen can do no 
     <lb/>
     wrong, she is not responsible for a word contain<lb break="no"/>ed in the speech with which Parliament is opened 
     <lb/>
     but her ministers are charged with that responsi<lb break="no"/>bility. The Queen we may imagine, has some 
     <lb/>
     thing   to think about than the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     British North America   in her household and the 
     <lb/>
     exercises of domestic virtues. I attach no im<lb break="no"/>portance therefore to that argument and gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite must be weak indeed for argument 
     <lb/>
     when they bring Her Majesty's name into the 
     <lb/>
     debate. Her name should not be mentioned 
     <lb/>
     here. Then it is said that the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment are in favor of Union—I have given some 
     <lb/>
     of the reasons as stated by the Colonial Secretary. 
     <lb/>
     There are fifty or sixty  Colonies to be managed 
     <lb/>
     and if five or six of those in British America 
     <lb/>
     could be knocked into one the labours and 
     <lb/>
     responsibilities of the Colonial office would 
     <lb/>
     be lightened. We have also been told 
     <lb/>
     that the British press are in favor of it, the 
     <lb/>
     press are probably animated by the feelings of the   
     <lb/>
     Colonial Secretary , and imagine that the change 
     <lb/>
     instead of being forced upon us in defiance of our 
     <lb/>
     wishes, was desired on our part, but tell intelli<lb break="no"/>gent Englishmen that the attempt to unite us will 
     <lb/>
     be contrary to the wishes of nine-tenths of our 
     <lb/>
     people and the knowledge of this fact would 
     <lb/>
     smash the strongest government in England that 
     <lb/>
     attempted to  [illegible]  the measure. The press be<lb break="no"/>lieve we desire the change, that the scheme was 
     <lb/>
     fair and just, and above all, they  believe the scheme 
     <lb/>
     will lead us to assume a great portion of that 
     <lb/>
     burthen will which the mother country has been 
     <lb/>
     charged in connection with our defence. We are 
     <lb/>
     told that the Governor, the Hero of Kars, is in 
     <lb/>
     favor of it. I do not desire to say anything disre<lb break="no"/>spect[illegible]that highly repectable and able Gene<lb break="no"/>ral, I respecthim as a warrior who stood true to 
     <lb/>
     the causes of his country and felt fully served his 
     <lb/>
     Sovereign, a would undertake to find in the

     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. Annand</persName> continued :—While, as I have

     said, I have the greatest possible respect for

     the abilities of the officer presiding over the

     government of the country, in his military 
     <lb/>
     capacity, on questions of local politics, and re<lb break="no"/>lating to the formation of a new constitution 
     <lb/>
     for these Colonies these are not the men to 
     <lb/>
     whom I would look for instruction. The name 
     <lb/>
     of the General and of the Admiral have also 
     <lb/>
     been improperly introduced into the debate to 
     <lb/>
     give weight and authority to the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation—these are the proper judges in 
     <lb/>
     time of war, we are ready to follow them in the 
     <lb/>
     field and to fight under their flag upon the sea, 
     <lb/>
     but it is highly indecorous to bring the names 
     <lb/>
     of these functionaries here and least of all, 
     <lb/>
     should the clergy be so prominently referred to 
     <lb/>
     within these walls, we respect them, in the dis<lb break="no"/>charge of their duties in connection with their 
     <lb/>
     flocks, but a clergyman is out of place when 
     <lb/>
     mixed up with the excitement incident to 
     <lb/>
     politics and party strife. Then we have been 
     <lb/>
     told " you have all the religious press of the 
     <lb/>
     country against you." Now, do we go for our 
     <lb/>
     political opinions to such newspapers as these? 
     <lb/>
     These are authorities while they confine them<lb break="no"/>selves to the tenets of the doctrines which they 
     <lb/>
     uphold, but no longer, and I am authorised 
     <lb/>
     here to state, on behalf of many Presbyterian 
     <lb/>
     clergymen and of many leading Wesleyans and 
     <lb/>
     Baptists, that they repudiate the opinions of 
     <lb/>
     these journals. But if it be true, as has been 
     <lb/>
     represented, that all this combination is on the 
     <lb/>
     side of the Government, I ask how is it that 
     <lb/>
     the great body of the people are arrayed against 
     <lb/>
     them. The reference to these religious bodies 
     <lb/>
     challenges this reply. The Provincial Secreta<lb break="no"/>ry may quote these distinguished names and re<lb break="no"/>fer to these organs of popular opinion, but how 
     <lb/>
     is it that he dare not at this moment open a sin- 
     <lb break="no"/>
     ple constituency in the country? There have 
     <lb/>
     been three elections since the scheme was pro- 
     <lb break="no"/>
     pounded, and at every one of these the Govern- 
     <lb break="no"/>
     ment has been " routed horse, foot and artille- 
     <lb break="no"/>
     ry." What do I care for the opinions to which 
     <lb/>
     be has referred, when I know he dare not open 
     <lb/>
     a single constituency, and that the greatest mis- 
     <lb break="no"/>
     fortune that could befall him would be a vacan- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cy in any of the seats? I therefore hurl back 
     <lb/>
     the allusions he has made. My mind can carry 
     <lb/>
     me back to the time when we were struggling 
     <lb/>
     for responsible government, we asked Her Ma- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     jesty's Ministers for the concession and we had 
     <lb/>
     them against us, we had against us the press 
     <lb/>
     of England, Her Majesty's Representative, and 
     <lb/>
     the General here, but we were right, we pressed 
     <lb/>
     for the rights and privileges of a free people, 
     <lb/>
     and achieved the system that we now enjoy.— 
     <lb/>
     Therefore away with the arguments drawn 
     <lb/>
     from the opinions of the Admiral, and General, 
     <lb/>
     and Governor,—their feeling is to obey the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial authorities, and their opinions may 
     <lb/>
     be expected to be moulded by their govern- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment. We have been referred to the despatch 
     <lb/>
     of the 24th June 1865, in which it is said:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " Such an union seems to Her Majesty's Go- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     vernment to recommend itself to the Provinces 
     <lb/>
     on many grounds of moral and material ad-

            <p>
     vantages—as giving a well founded prospect

     prosperity." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What. are the matters tending to the pros- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     perity of the country? The improvement of 
     <lb/>
     trade and commerce, a large market for the 
     <lb/>
     produce of the country. And can it be said 
     <lb/>
     that Confederation will increase our market? 
     <lb/>
     Will anyone say that we will buy a barrel of 
     <lb/>
     flour more from Canada unless a discrimi- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     nating duty is imposed? Will Canada buy 
     <lb/>
     any more fish or coal under Confederation? 
     <lb/>
     Can it be said that our productions will be al- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     lowed to enter Canada upon terms more favor- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     able than those imposed on American articles? 
     <lb/>
     I do not give the Canadians credit for so much 
     <lb/>
     love for us. We may have free trade between 
     <lb/>
     the Provinces without a political union. lt 
     <lb/>
     can be effected through our various govern- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ments. Would any one hazard a statement of 
     <lb/>
     the reverse in the face of the evidence upon our 
     <lb/>
     journals? I have entertained some doubts as 
     <lb/>
     to whether free trade in manufactures is at 
     <lb/>
     present desirable. There are manufactures 
     <lb/>
     growing up here which are now so weak as to 
     <lb/>
     require legislative aid; and to bring them into 
     <lb/>
     competition with the more a vanced manufac- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tures of Canada would be to ruin those who 
     <lb/>
     have embarked their capital in such enter- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     prises among us; but if it should prove de- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sirable I would throw no obstacle in the way. 
     <lb/>
     Then, is it necessary to have the Union to as 
     <lb/>
     similate our currencies? No one will hazard 
     <lb/>
     such a statement. The effort has never been 
     <lb/>
     made; and until it fails, I will not admit 
     <lb/>
     the argument drawn in favor of a political 
     <lb/>
     union. It would be impossible to assimilate 
     <lb/>
     our currencies with that of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and with the States we have a hundred com- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     mercial transactions for one with Canada— 
     <lb/>
     'i'hen comes the question of postage. Our pos- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tal system is now nearly the same,the only dif- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ference being, that while in Nova Scotia news- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     papers pass free, in Canada there is a tax 
     <lb/>
     which impedes circulation. The question of 
     <lb/>
     the usury laws has been brought here for dis- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cussion, but I would suggest that if we are to 
     <lb/>
     have Confederation we need not discuss the 
     <lb/>
     subject,—in Canada the rate of interest is much 
     <lb/>
     higher than with us, in some instances as high 
     <lb/>
     as from eight to nine per cent. Then there is 
     <lb/>
     the question of the tariffs, there may be no great 
     <lb/>
     difficulty on this subject if Canada is willing to 
     <lb/>
     suffer such a lo s of revenue as would arise 
     <lb/>
     from striking off her twenty per cent duties.— 
     <lb/>
     In that case there could be no difficulty in as- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     similating our tariffs, and this it will be re- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     membered was one of the conditions in the ar- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     rangements of 1862. Much has been said about 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway,—-this has been the 
     <lb/>
     grand lever used to operate on the people. We 
     <lb/>
     are told that we can have no railway unless we 
     <lb/>
     confederate, but looking at the necessities of 
     <lb/>
     Canada—at the position she would be in if diffi- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     culties arose, ice-locked for six months in the 
     <lb/>
     year, we find how essential it is to her indepen- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     dence. While these are the facts so little loyal 
     <lb/>
     sentiment is there among the puhlic men of 
     <lb/>
    Canada that they will not make the effort to 
     <lb/>secure that road, but will run the risk of sever- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>ance from the British Emplre while using it as 
     <lb/>a lever to bring about Confederation. Then 
     <lb/>comes the question of defence— we are told we 
     <lb/>cannot defend ourselves unless Confederated. 
     <lb/>I admit the potency of the argument in refer- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>

    
            <cb/>
            <p>
     ence to the Intercolonial Railway as a means 
     <lb/>
     of defence, and I believe that that road will be 
     <lb/>
     exceedingly useful in time of war, but it. might 
     <lb/>
     be cut in two or three places in the event of 
     <lb/>
     hostilities. Any one reading the history of   
     <lb/>
     Sherman's campaign knows how easy it is to 
     <lb/>
     cut a railway, and how easily these Provinces 
     <lb/>
     could be separated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Pro. Sec. read a speech delivered by me 
     <lb/>
     on a former occasion in reference to the ques- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tion of defence and I am prepared to reiterate 
     <lb/>
     the same sentiments to day. My mode would 
     <lb/>
     be this: I would have the people contribute 
     <lb/>
     liberally pound for pound with Canada, or any 
     <lb/>
     other portion of the Empire, for the protection 
     <lb/>
     of our homes, I would pay that amount into 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial treasury and would charge the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial government with the defence. I 
     <lb/>
     would be willing to have this levied as a tax 
     <lb/>
     per head or a percentage on our revenue. If 
     <lb/>
     it be true, and I believe it is, that the British 
     <lb/>
     government intend to throw upon Canada. the 
     <lb/>
     expense other fortifications and of her gun- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     boats for the lakes, here will be an enormous 
     <lb/>
     amount that we must pay into the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     exchanges, not. for our defence but: for theirs. 
     <lb/>
     The Prov. Sec. referred on a previous day to 
     <lb/>
     my friend Mr. Howe, and to the opinions that 
     <lb/>
     he uttered in England in advocating the I ter- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     colonial Railway,——tbat gentleman   did express 
     <lb/>
     strong opinions, but they were not so much on 
     <lb/>
     the subject of the union of the Colonies as in 
     <lb/>
     connection with that railway. Taking advan- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tage of the apprehension existing in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the Trent affair, Messrs. Howe and Tilley 
     <lb/>
     used every argument they could urge. I do 
     <lb/>
     not hold myself responsible for every opinion 
     <lb/>
     expressed upon these matters and I may per- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     haps admit that Mr. Howe has committed 
     <lb/>
     mistake almost as grave as those of the Pro- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     vincial Secretary himself. In reference to the 
     <lb/>
     contribution from the treasury for defence, do 
     <lb/>
     not let me be misunderstood as to the mode in 
     <lb/>
     which the tax should be levied. By the con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sent of our own Parliament, responsible to our 
     <lb/>
     own people, we should contribute such an 
     <lb/>
     amount as the country could afford. What do 
     <lb/>
     we require for defence? lt is said that as we 
     <lb/>
     are now situated we cannot march a militia- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     man from one Province to another. Then all 
     <lb/>
     that is required in case of an attack is an 
     <lb/>
     authority by which we can ai l each other. Do 
     <lb/>
     we not now see all British America armed to 
     <lb/>
     the teeth and prepared for the conflict without 
     <lb/>
     Confederation? Then there is this difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     the way. When we are confederated the Com- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     mander-in-Chief would have his head-quarters 
     <lb/>
     at Ottawa; and we will find that if Canada is 
     <lb/>
     attacked and these Provinces threatened, the 
     <lb/>
     Executive Government at Ottawa will natu- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     rally prefer the protection of their own home- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     steads to our security, and will withdraw our 
     <lb/>
     men for their defence. What did Ww hear some 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadian statesmen say some time ago? 
     <lb/>
     One of them said, "Look down at the Mari- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     time Provinces; they have 30,000 sailors to man 
     <lb/>
     our gunboats." Another repeated the remark;   
     <lb/>
     but it never occurred to them that we might 
     <lb/>
     also be threatened with attack, and that it 
     <lb/>
     might become necessary to send down some of 
     <lb/>
     the yeomanry of the West in exchange for our 
     <lb/>
     seamen. Th iridea seemed selfish and narrow 
     <lb/>
     and limited only to the defence of their own 
     <lb/>
     country at our expense. It is said that Con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     federation will make us much more powerful 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     for defence. But Confederation does not give 
     <lb/>
     us a man more or a pound more; it adds neither 
     <lb/>
     to the material nor the sinews of war. If I 
     <lb/>
     need refer to any authority on the subject, I 
     <lb/>
     have it under my hand—an authority which 
     <lb/>
     even the Provincial Secretary and the Attor- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ney General will admit to be conclusive. I 
     <lb/>
     read an ex ract from a leading paper in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, the Toronto Globe, in answer to a cor- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     respondent who urged the objection "that 
     <lb/>
     Canada, under Confederation, would be com- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     pelled to furnish a quota for the defence of the 
     <lb/>
    Lower Provinces, whereas they could aid us 
     <lb/>none at all, and therefore we should be rela- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>tively weakened." The Globe, in reply, said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     " It so happens. however. that for purposes of defence 
     <lb/>
     we are already Confederated, the Imperial Government being 
     <lb/>
     the centra. power. It is quite true that we could not in 
     <lb/>
     the present state of things be compelled,without the 
     <lb/>
     consent of our Legislature, to send troops to serve in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia; but the home authorities have a most 
     <lb/>
     powerful means of coercion in their hands. They 
     <lb/>
     would tell us at once that if we selfishly refused to aid 
     <lb/>
     them in the concentration of troops at the point where 
     <lb/>
     the Commander—in- Chief judged such concentration to 
     <lb/>
     be most needed for the preservation of the whole of 
     <lb/>
     British North America they would leave us to our 
     <lb/>
     fate."              
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " In fact, we regard the addition of their population as a 
     <lb/>
     clear gain to Canada. New Brunswick might demand 
     <lb/>
     their assistance and ours too—for next to our own 
     <lb/>
     Province she is most open to attack but when the 
     <lb/>
     danger had passed her strength would be thrown in 
     <lb/>
     wherever needed Moreover. the Maritime Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     in consequence of the large proporti n they have of 
     <lb/>
     a seafaring populati n. furnish a most valuable ele- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment of defence   hich we do not possess." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Prov. Sec. said " if you would only unite 
     <lb/>
     you would be defended by the entire forces of 
     <lb/>
     the Empire." Will he undertake to say that if 
     <lb/>
     we decline to unite we will not be defended hy 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty's army and navy? Will he 
     <lb/>
     hazard that opinion? No, because he had to 
     <lb/>
     admit that come what would Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>
    Governmcnt could not afford to lose these Prov- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>inces. Then away goes the story aboutcasting 
     <lb/>us off ,an.l even the leader of the Opposition 
     <lb/>said that England was bound to uphold the 
     <lb/>Colonies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     There is another view of the question and it 
     <lb/>
     is not the least interesting,—in connection with 
     <lb/>
     finances under confederation as compared 
     <lb/>
     with the present position. I have in my hand 
     <lb/>
     a calculation made from our public docu- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ments— from the estimate laid on the table of 
     <lb/>
     this House at this Session, and I will be pre 
     <lb/>
     pared to show the House, and through the press 
     <lb/>
     the people, the enormous sum we would 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice by Confederation. In the event 
     <lb/>
     of union the taxes known as Customs 
     <lb/>
     duties would be collected and paid into 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa treasury , so with the light duties, our 
     <lb/>
     railroads would become the property of the 
     <lb/>
     General Government, and our revenues would 
     <lb/>
     be derived from the following sources :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     in addition to this there would be the sub- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
    sidy of 80 cents per head, amounting to $264,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>000. mak ng in all $419,000. to be appropriated 
     <lb/>for the public services of the country. Certain 
     <lb/>large services, such as revenue expenses, civil 
     <lb/>

     other day as correctly representing the actual 
     <lb/>
     requirements of this country for the leading 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     amounts will be required under Confederation 
     <lb/>
     as now, and cannot well be performed for less.

            <p>
     The total cost of these services will be $487- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     518. and I put it to the house can you afford to 
     <lb/>
     reduce any of them? And if so, where are 
     <lb/>
     you to begin? Then there is another species 
     <lb/>
     of expenditure which refers to the altered 
     <lb/>
     condition of affairs under Confederation; we 
     <lb/>
     have not yet been informed as to the sort of 
     <lb/>
     local government that we are to have,—we 
     <lb/>
     know not whether there will be one or two 
     <lb/>
     branches of the Legislature, or how many 
     <lb/>
     members each will have; but 1 assume 
     <lb/>
     that our Legislative expenses will be $20 000 
     <lb/>
     instead of nearly $50,000, as at presen . We 
     <lb/>
     will require a Prov. Secretary, he may not be 
     <lb/>
     a gentleman of such distinguished talents as 
     <lb/>
     the gentleman before me, because he may be 
     <lb/>
     called to a more exal ed sphere—he may as- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     pire to be Prov. Secretary of the Confederated 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, he may be one of those g vernors   
     <lb/>
     who will be sent down to administer our affairs, 
     <lb/>
     cert in it is that all those gentlem n who have 
     <lb/>
     acted as delegates will be spirited away from 
     <lb/>
     us. The expenses of the Prov. Secretary's 
     <lb/>
     office I have put down at $4050. and l have 
     <lb/>
     included in this the cost of the Financial Se- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cretary's department. For our Treasurer I 
     <lb/>
     have put down $3,100. We will require a 
     <lb/>
    Crown Officer to act as Atty. General, though 
     <lb/>I presume we can dispense with the Solicitor 
     <lb/>General, and for that officer I have put 
     <lb/>down $1,600. Miscellaneous services last year 
     <lb/>amounted to $35,044, but I have aimed them 
     <lb/>at 10,000, Navigation Securities I have re- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>duced from $80000 to $26,000,-l may be told 
     <lb/>that this last will be a charge upon the general 
     <lb/>government, but many of our small services 
     <lb/>will be entirely lost sight of by that great 
     <lb/>government in the extension of her canals, and 
     <lb/>in attending to the wants of the Nor h West 
     <lb/>territory. For Public works, in reference to the 
     <lb/>extension,I have allowed nothing, although 
     <lb/>we need extension of the Lunatic Asylum, 
     <lb/>-Public works,iucluding Board, maintenance, 
     <lb/>Hospital for insane. Penitentiary, &amp;c.., I put 
     <lb/>down at $50,600; Printing, $5,000; Packets and 
     <lb/>Ferries, throwing ont of consideration the 
     <lb/>steamboat service, $11,070. Altogether we 
     <lb/>have for Confederation under these services, 
     <lb/>$131,420.

     from this all the revenue to be got this year, 
     <lb/>
     £419 l00, and it will leave a balance against

     the Province, taking the estimate of the 
     <lb/>
     present year, in round numbers of $200 000. 
     <lb/>
     Do not let the house be mistaken,—this very 
     <lb/>
     year if Confederation existed we would lose 
     <lb/>
     $200.000, as is shown by the estimate laid 
     <lb/>
     upon the  table. I put it then to the house, are 
     <lb/>
     you going to throw on the people the burden 
     <lb/>
     of taxing themselves to maintain these works? 
     <lb/>
     Will you enter into a scheme of union that 
     <lb/>
     will take from our treasury $20,000 a year? 
     <lb/>
     And bear this in mind, that while our wants 
     <lb/>
     will go on increasing every year the subsidy 
     <lb/>
     will remain  at 80 cents a head according to the 
     <lb/>
     census of 1861 In the event of a war which 
     <lb/>
     would prevent the sale of our coal, our rev- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     enue would be $30,000 or $40,000 1ess. I ask the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who went home last year, with 
     <lb/>
     special grants of $10,000 for their counties, how 
     <lb/>they are to be provided for when Confedera- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>tion is accomplished? You must either throw 
     <lb/>off the road grant or else deprive the people of 
     <lb/>the liberal allowance for education. The Pro. 
     <lb/>Secretary on a former occasion charged me 
     <lb/>with inconsistency in enunciating here prin- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>ciples contrary to those which I have  placed 
     <lb/>upon the  journals. I deny ever having com- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>mitted myself to any scheme of union with 
     <lb/>Canada, and I will quote from some of the 
     <lb/>journals that he referred to. The resolution 
     <lb/>moved in 1801 by Mr. Howe, was as follows; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     " Whereas, The  subject of a union of the North Am- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     erican Provinces,  or of the Maritime Province of 
     <lb/>
     British American   has been from time to time mooted 
     <lb/>
     and discussed to aid  the Colonies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "And Whereas, While many advantages may be 
     <lb/>
     secured by sucha union, either of all these Provinces 
     <lb/>
     or of a portion of them many an' serious obstacles 
     <lb/>
     are presented, which can   only be overcome by mutual 
     <lb/>
     consultation of the leading men of the Colonies, and 
     <lb/>
     by free communication with the Imperial Govern- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
    ment 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
      "Therefore Resolved, That His Excellency, the 
     <lb/>
     Lieutenant Governor be respectfully  requested to put 
     <lb/>
     himself in communication with his Grace the Colo- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     nial Secretary and his Excellency the Governor Gen- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     eral, and the Lieutenant Governors of the other 
     <lb/>
     North American provinces. in order to ascertain the 
     <lb/>
     policy of her Majesty's Government  and the opinions 
     <lb/>
     of the other colonies with a view to an enlightened 
     <lb/>
     consideration  of a question involving the highest inter- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ests and union  when the  public mind in all the Pro- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     vinces ought to be set at rest " 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Here you  have a resolution stating the fact 
     <lb/>
    that a diversity of opinion exists in the Pro- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>vinces as to union, and that there were two 
     <lb/>kinds of union, one of the Maritime Colonies 
     <lb/>and the other including Canada so that the 
     <lb/>gentlemen voting for that resolution voted for 
     <lb/>the appointment ot Delegates to ascertain 
     <lb/>whether the uniou should embrace all the 
     <lb/>Colonies or only tha Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The resolution suggested an "enlightened 
     <lb/>
     consideration" of the question, and we all 
     <lb/>
     know the result of that consideration, and an-

            <p>
     by the Delegates assembled at Quebec in Sep- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tember, 1862. The chief mission of the Dele- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     gates was in connection with the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway. Union was mentioned at the Con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     vention, but only incidentally discussed, no 
     <lb/>
     resolution being moved and no record of the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings being kept So that it merely 
     <lb/>
     amounts to this :—we pass a resolution  stating 
     <lb/>
     that there is a diversity of opinion on the sub- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ject of Colonial union, which should be con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sidered and set at rest; but no man in the 
     <lb/>
     House has been committed to any  scheme of 
     <lb/>
     union, much less to the Quebec scheme. I am 
     <lb/>
     not, therefore inconsistent in taking my pre- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sent course, nor is any member who was then 
     <lb/>
     in the legislature, and I could feel myself at 
     <lb/>
     liberty to vote against any scheme that did 
     <lb/>
     not commend itself to my judgment  But. of 
     <lb/>
     all the members of the House, the Prov. Sec'y 
     <lb/>
     is the last who should dare to talk about in- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     consistency. His whole life has been a life of 
     <lb/>
     inconsistency, front the first time he took a 
     <lb/>
     seat here. We know how he acted in refer- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ence to the construction of railways. What is 
     <lb/>
     his policy on that subject now ? It is the po- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     licy of the gentleman who preceded him. He 
     <lb/>
     had  a policy in reference to retrenchment, by 
     <lb/>
     which $79 000 a year was to be saved; he went 
     <lb/>
     to the country with the cry, and that is the 
     <lb/>
     last we have heard of it, while nearly every  
     <lb/>
     public service has been largely increased under  
     <lb/>
     his administration. The Pro Sec. seems ex- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ceedingly sensitive just now; he declares that 
     <lb/>
     by those shocking appeals from the press we 
     <lb/>
     are disturbing the public mind; why could we 
     <lb/>
     not have been quiet, until the gentlemen ac- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     complishing this measure had been spirited 
     <lb/>
     away to another country. He said, in refer- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ence to some remarks which have appeared, 
     <lb/>
     that he would be justified in dealing with me 
     <lb/>
     after another fashion. I understand him to 
     <lb/>
     mean, by that, that he could have brought me 
     <lb/>
     to the bar of the House for these remarks. I 
     <lb/>
     challenge him to shew me his right to do so 
     <lb/>
     even if l wrote the article alluded to; and Ï 
     <lb/>
     challenge him to show anything in the article  
     <lb/>
     to warrant the language he has used. Then 
     <lb/>
     we are told that the press has had the auda- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     city to charge members of this house with be- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ing traitors. Unquestionably the press did so, 
     <lb/>
     but did he ever turn to the meaning of the 
     <lb/>
     word? Webster says a traitor is one who de- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ceives, who betrays his country; and I say, 
     <lb/>
     taking that sense, there are men here who de- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     serve the appellation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. PROV. SEC.—I think the hon member 
     <lb/>
     is safe in making that assertion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND continued—I hurl back the 
     <lb/>
     charge upon the Prov. Sec., because he is bar- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tering the liberties of the country I charge 
     <lb/>
     upon him that he is a deœiver, a. betrayer of 
     <lb/>
     his countrv—that he is a traitor. There are 
     <lb/>
     men in this House who, within the last fort-. 
     <lb/>
     night, have corresponded with their consider- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ents, sending them down sheaves of pullout 
     <lb/>
     against Confederation, by which the people im- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     plored the House not to pass any measure on 
     <lb/>
     the subject until it had been referred to them. 
     <lb/>
     There are men in this House who occupied that 
     <lb/>
     position a few days ago, and who today are 
     <lb/>
     found in the rants  of those who will pass the 
     <lb/>
     scheme and prevent the people from expressing 
     <lb/>
     their opinion. These men are betraying the

            <p>
     The Provincial Secretary intimated that there 
     <lb/>
     is one gentleman here who deserves the name 
     <lb/>
     of traitor ; he referred on one occasion to the 
     <lb/>
     apology which I made for using language that 
     <lb/>
     I was sorry for. Any gentleman who has been 
     <lb/>
     betrayed into heated and improper language is 
     <lb/>
     acting an honest and honorable part in acknow- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ledging his error I did that without hesita- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tion, although the Provincial Secretary did not 
     <lb/>
     state the words to which he alluded; but wh t 
     <lb/>
     did I find in the press ? In a portion of the 
     <lb/>
     press  reflecting the views of that gentleman I 
     <lb/>
     saw a most  extravagant and distorted account 
     <lb/>
     —a most  unwarranted and untruthful version of 
     <lb/>
     what occurred. To put myself  right I wrote to 
     <lb/>
     the gentleman to whom the words were used, 
     <lb/>
     and I will let my justification go forth with the 
     <lb/>
     misrepresentation that has been circulated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
      (Mr. Annand here read copies of letters from 
     <lb/>
    Mr. B Wier and Mr F. M. McDonald, stating 
     <lb/>'that Mr. A.'s remark in reference to a Fenian 
     <lb/>attack upon Canada was in reply to an excla- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>mation of Mr Wier ) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     These, said Mr A , are the naked facts of the 
     <lb/>
     case. I met a worthy friend who is perhaps a 
     <lb/>
     little excitable, and he used exceedingly strong 
     <lb/>
     language to me. I used very strong language 
     <lb/>
     to him in retort, but I remember we left  laugh- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ing at the extravagant expressions on both sides 
     <lb/>
     Gentlemen opposite are very sensitive about 
     <lb/>
     remarks made in the press, and if they could, 
     <lb/>
     would probably stifle the press and muzzle 
     <lb/>
     conversations out of doors, but I hold in my 
     <lb/>
     hand the record of language scarcely less for- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cible than mine, but with this distinction, that 
     <lb/>
     instead of being uttered in a. moment of excite- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment in a public street these words were de- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     liberately placed upon the Journals of the 
     <lb/>
     country, I find here a resolution moved by 
     <lb/>
     hon. Mr. Johnson the leader of the opposi- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tion in this house at a time when excitement. 
     <lb/>
     ran high in consequence of the removal of cer- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tain magistrates, an extract from which reads 
     <lb/>
     as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " And this House is of opinion that if such an ex- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ercise of executive administration should be vindica- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ted the most sacred interests of society would be 
     <lb/>
     placed in the  power of every corrupt and unscrupu- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>lous Government that could command a subservient 
     <lb/>majority  in the   Legislature, and the people  of Nova 
     <lb/> Scotia being driven to desire some constitution better 
     <lb/>balanced and protected the connection between the 
     <lb/>Colony  and  the Parent State would be weakened and 
     <lb/>endangered.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     I can any more: I recollect, in 1849 when Ca- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     nada was in rebellion when the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     buildings were burned, when the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General was  hunted through the streets, there 
     <lb/>
     was a Journal in this town in the interest of 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen  opposite that was so outspoken as 
     <lb/>
     to justify fully the persons who committed 
     <lb/>
     these deeds,, and yet I never heard of any of 
     <lb/>
     them being arraigned here for using disloyal 
     <lb/>
     expressions. We have heard much about loy- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     alty,— what makes loyalty? Is it not the insti- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tutions of a  country? Deprive a people of that  
     <lb/>
     which they  cherish and every freeman  among 
     <lb/>
     them will  detest those who do the deed. The 
     <lb/>
     Pro. Sec. made a great complaint about the re- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ference to Canadian gold and talked about 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     bringing a member to the bar for having pub- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     lished that paragraph. He also more than in- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sinuated that my friend Mr. Howe had been cor- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     rupted by American gold, and by implication 
     <lb/>
     myself also who he said was the mouth-piece 
     <lb/>
     of that gentleman in this house. This is the 
     <lb/>
     paragraph referred to by the  Pro. Secretary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " In the course of the Confederate Debate in the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Assembly, last winter, the hon George 
     <lb/>
     Brown referred to the large sum that was given for 
     <lb/>
     the purchase of the State of  Louisiana, and suggested 
     <lb/>
     that the expenditure of as large or even a larger sum, 
     <lb/>
     in the purchase of the State of the Maritime Pro- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     vinces, would be a profitable Canadian investment. 
     <lb/>
     Mr Brown's hint, we have reason to believe, has not 
     <lb/>
     been lost sight of by the Confederates. Canadian 
     <lb/>
     gold, it is said is here, and in sufficient abundance 
     <lb/>
     to  overcome the scruples of certain representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the people. The country has a sharp eye on the 
     <lb/>
     House just now, and will duly appreciate the sudden 
     <lb/>
     conversion of members, should any unhappily be 
     <lb/>
     found willing to accept the base bribe," 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hold under my hand the language of hon. 
     <lb/>
     George Brown to which that paragraph re- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     fers and he says: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " He could not understand why we should hesitate 
     <lb/>
     about bringing in a million of people with a great 
     <lb/>
     country and great resources; we might as well hesi- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tate about some petty   allowance of money. There 
     <lb/>
     was no such instance in history he believed ; other na- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tions paid large sums for territory. Louisiana  was 
     <lb/>
     bought tor twenty millions  of dollars. What would 
     <lb/>
     we not give for Maine or Michigan or Minnesota, 
     <lb/>
     which it was possible to pay. Others pay large sums 
     <lb/>
     to secure emigrants We spent some $25,000 per an- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     num yet we heard peddling objections raised  now in 
     <lb/>
     a union. to give us nearly a million of people and 
     <lb/>
     vast and rich territories; a few dollars for a few 
     <lb/>
     years ought not to stand in the way." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Does  any one need to be told that the mean- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ingof this is that the secret service money of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, if required might be had? (Cries of 
     <lb/>
     Oh! oh! from government side of house.) Gen- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tlemen need  not be so excited, for I tell them 
     <lb/>
     that 1 had a conversation with Mr. Brown not 
     <lb/>
     very long ago, in which 1 was led to believe 
     <lb/>
     that it I would join the Confederates I might 
     <lb/>
     have had money, and place, and preferment 
     <lb/>
     in Canada as inducements to my supporting 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon PROV SEC asked that Mr. Annand's 
     <lb/>
     words be taken down as he intended to test their 
     <lb/>
     accuracy by telegraphing to Mr. Brown immed- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     iately. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The SPEAKER said he could take down no 
     <lb/>
     words which were not unparliamentary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon PROV. SEC said that he merely desired 
     <lb/>
     that no injustice  be done to the hon gentleman 
     <lb/>
     in the representation  of his remarks 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND continued:—My  remarks I pre- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sume have been already taken down by the 
     <lb/>
     proper officer and it will be unnecessary for me 
     <lb/>
     to repeat them. The Pro. Sec has referred to 
     <lb/>
     the union of Canadas, but l do not  wonder that 
     <lb/>
     the scheme was adopted by at two third vote in 
     <lb/>
    the Parliament ot that Colony. We have been 
     <lb/>told that we extolled Mr. Smith as " an incor- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>ruptable patriot." Whatever Mr Smith's 
     <lb/>claims may be on the people of New Brunswick 
     <lb/>they appreciate them. and without wishing to 
     <lb/>say a word derogatory to the credit of the mem- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>bers oi the learned profession here, I doubt that 
     <lb/>there is one of them who, when the office of 
     <lb/>Chief Justice was vacant, and when he was  
     <lb/>pressed by  friends and foes to take the position, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <lb/>
     men would have made such a sacrifice as that at 
     <lb/>
     which the Provincial Secretary sneers. We 
     <lb/>
     have been asked " what corrupted the Admiral 
     <lb/>
     and the General or the city of Halifax ?" I 
     <lb/>
     made no such charge against any of them. This 
     <lb/>
     city is largely in favour of Confederation, be- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cause they believe that they cannot get the 
     <lb/>
     railway without it. Then we have been told 
     <lb/>
     that we cannot get an expression of opinion 
     <lb/>
     from the country. Sir, I ask why not? It has 
     <lb/>
     been said that the question will be largely mixed 
     <lb/>
     up with others—with the question of education, 
     <lb/>
     the railway, retrenchment, and other subjects, 
     <lb/>
     but I maintain that there is a mode of getting 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of the people—the way in which 
     <lb/>
     their opinion was obtained upon the Municipal 
     <lb/>
     Corporation bill. In that case the vote was ta- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ken upon the measure alone, and such a vote 
     <lb/>
     would settle this question in a single day. It 
     <lb/>
     has been said also that our only object is to up- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     set the Government, but I ask is it not patent to 
     <lb/>
     every man that if this agitation ceased to- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     morrow gentlemen opposite would not have 
     <lb/>
     the ghost of a chance of occupying their positions 
     <lb/>
     again. Let them open a single constiuency 
     <lb/>
     and obtain a decision either on this question or 
     <lb/>
     on the general policy of the government, and 
     <lb/>
     that decision will be conclusive. These gentle- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     men know that their fate is sealed, and they are 
     <lb/>
     afraid to meet it—for this reason, as much as 
     <lb/>
     for any other has this matter been urged on us 
     <lb/>
     this session. The Prov. Sec. took great liber- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ties with a friend of mine and with me, for he 
     <lb/>
     counted my name with his as that gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     mouthpiece, in attributing base motives to him. 
     <lb/>
    It is said that when Mr. Howe's salary ceased he  
     <lb/>became an agitator from personal motives, but I 
     <lb/>happen to know that in taking this step he 
     <lb/>is incurring risks which few would run.— 
     <lb/>He holds letters from leading men m Eng 
     <lb/>land recognizing his claims upon the consi- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>deration of the Imperial Government, and 
     <lb/>by the patriotic courage he has taken he may<lb/>have forfeited that consideration I throw back<lb/>then the foul insinuation that Mr. Howe has<lb/>thrown nns- it into the scale because the in-<lb break="maybe"/>dusenments of salary have ceased. The Pro<lb/>Sec spoke about "button holing" and " sapping<lb/>loyalty' in the same connection and this loads<lb/>me in imagine another scene: I imagine a mem<lb/>ber of the House bring sep for by a distinguish-<lb break="maybe"/>ed and bring addressed int his isn<lb/>guing :— my dear sir if you will only move a<lb/>resolution in the Assembly asking the House to<lb/>affi h- policy of union and leaving the de-<lb break="maybe"/>tails to be gentled at the Colonial Office your<lb/>services will be appreciated and recognized by<lb/>Her Majesty's Government" I can imagine<lb/>such an rgenirene and I can imagine the per-<lb break="maybe"/>son thus addressed through a pro-man, wish a<lb/>ros his fortuanate being thus made, rejecting<lb/>the proposal.

     tion. We may have the abstract right to do so 
     <lb/>but I put it to them one and all when we were<lb/>elected three years ago if members had told<lb/>their constituents that they would if elected des-<lb break="maybe"/>troy the constitution of the country how many of <lb/>them would have been here? The trust repos-<lb break="maybe"/>ed in them was for a very different purpose, it<lb/>was that they should transact the public busi-<lb break="maybe"/>ness according to the well understood wishes of<lb/>their constituents. The opinions of Merssrs.<lb/>Howe. Young and Johnston have been referred<lb/>to in this connection,—these gentlemen said that<lb/>the proposition must be ratified by the legisla-<lb break="maybe"/>ture as of course it must, but will any man un-<lb break="maybe"/>dertake to say that either of them dreamed of<lb/>such a change being effected without an appeal<lb/>to the people? I have too much confidence in<lb/>the patriotism of one and all of them to believe<lb/>that they ever entertained such an opinion. We<lb/>have however pretty good authority for saying<lb/>that the constitution should not be changed with-<lb break="maybe"/>out submitting the scheme to the people. Mr.<lb/>Archibald in course of his speech at Temper-<lb break="maybe"/>ance Hall last winter said:<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" It is for the people of Nova Scotia to ratify or<lb/>reject what we have done. It will not promote their<lb/>interests—if they believe the result will be injurious<lb/>and not beneficial, let them reject it; but it they feel<lb/>as we have felt that their future prosperity and hap-<lb break="maybe"/>piness are identified with, and inseparable from <lb/>Union—if the time is now come for it—let them be<lb/>equal to the emergency ; let them accept the position<lb/>which we believe the progress of events and their <lb/>own true intrests render necessary for their future<lb/>happiness and prosperity.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

    

            <p>
     What did that language mean? Did it refer 
     <lb/>
     to this House or to the people? He knows he 
     <lb/>
     meant the people ol the countrv Mr. Tilley in 
     <lb/>
     addressine an audience at St. John. said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " It was not the intention of the Government of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick to force the matter up and the people. 
     <lb/>It was now bef reihem, and he asked for is a calm<lb/>and candid consideration. He could assure them<lb/>that if there is the least questions as to the opinion of<lb/>the people upon it, it shall be submitted to them at the<lb/>polls"<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     That was the language of one of the most 
     <lb/>
     enlightened statesmen ot British America,— he 
     <lb/>
     Went to the pPOplt-l people with this question, and went 
     <lb/>
     down gallantly defending his principles Let 
     <lb/>
     me read the opinion of Hon. Mr. Dickey, an- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     other of the delegates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     These are surely pretty good authorities. for 
     <lb/>
     here we have three. of those gentleman who are 
     <lb/>
     now pressing the matter on us indorsing the

     <lb/>
     which the IenflPr leader of the Government will not

     <lb/>
     the. Prov Secretary at Kemville, in reply to a 
     <lb/>
     charge from me that at Windsor he had made 
     <lb/>
     a speech ignoring the people where he denied 
     <lb/>
     that. he ever entertained such an opinion, and 
     <lb/>
     said he recognized their full right in relation to 
     <lb/>
     the question ; and yet we find him to-day bring-

            <p>"If the people;s representatives are satisfied that<lb/>the country is oppoed to this Union they can yet <lb/>reject it or they can obtain a dissolution by asking <lb/>for it. No Government could prevent it. What w<lb/>

     Here then, you have the recorded opinions of

     the Delelegates themselves, recognizng the

     right of the people to be consulted before such a 
     <lb/>
     radical change in the constitution of our coun 
     <lb/>
     try. And again, the Provincial Secretary re- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     corded his opinion, and it was a sound one that 
     <lb/>
     the time of peace and prosperity is the time to 
     <lb/>
     consider a change in our institutions, and not 
     <lb/>
     when we know not at what hour our country 
     <lb/>
     may be invaded and our homes desolated : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " The people sent us together not to consider the 
     <lb/>
     moans of aggresslon on the throne ; but to enquire 
     <lb/>
     how far we could advance our interests in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the parent state. and thev wisely sent us at a 
     <lb/>
     tim-. (mark now!) when we were not convulsed by 
     <lb/>
     the throes of civil strife but when we could meet in the 
     <lb/>
     midst of pence and prosperity to consider the means of 
     <lb/>
     securing our privileges." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The House of Lords the other day refused to 
     <lb/>
     consider the state of affairs in Ireland because 
     <lb/>
     that country was in danger of civil war, and we 
     <lb/>
     have the authority upon this point of Earl Rus- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sell, who, at the time of the Crimean war aban- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     doned his Reform Bill, and allowed it to slum 
     <lb/>
     ber until now. These are the examples of the 
     <lb/>
     mother country. and they should challenge our 
     <lb/>
     admiration and respect. How can you ask the 
     <lb/>
     men of Shelburne and Yarmouth, knowing the 
     <lb/>
     strong opinions they hold, to rally with true 
     <lb/>
     enthusiasm and earnestness in defence of the 
     <lb/>
     country, when their most valued institutions 
     <lb/>
     are being swept away ? The government in 
     <lb/>
     taking this course. assume a fearful responsibility. 
     <lb/>
     Members  may take this step but they will do an 
     <lb/>
     act bearing no example in the history of mod- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ern times, and they will leave behind them a 
     <lb/>
     riven and distracted country If they borrowed 
     <lb/>
     lessons from the past, and looked at what has 
     <lb/>
     occurred in other countries. they would pause 
     <lb/>
     before they consummate the unholy deed. It 
     <lb/>
     is a serious thing to deprive a people of all the 
     <lb/>
     institutions they hold dear, and I trust that 
     <lb/>
     whatever the government mav do in the mat- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ter— whatever the delegates to Quebec and their 
     <lb/>
     friends may do. I trust there will be found in 
     <lb/>
     this House a sufficient body of men. knowing as 
     <lb/>
     they must that nine-tenths of their constituents 
     <lb/>
     are opposed to the scheme, to stand by the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the country

     Mr. MILLER said :—I feel it a duty I owe to 
     <lb/>
     a gentleman occupying a high position in Bri- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tish America who is not here to defend him- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     self to give the version of the conversation 
     <lb/>
     referred to by Mr. Annand, as he stated it to 
     <lb/>
     me just after it took place. I do not desire to 
     <lb/>
     misrepresent the hon. member for East Hali- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     fax in a single word, and if, in what I am about 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     to say, I make a mistake, it will be an error of 
     <lb/>
     memory and nothing more. On the occasion 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Brown's visit to this city, Mr. Annand 
     <lb/>
     and myself were requested to call and see him. 
     <lb/>
     Being very busy at the time I was not able to 
     <lb/>
     have that pleasure, and I could do no more 
     <lb/>
     than leave a card for him a short time be- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     fore his departure from the city. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman did see him, and had, as he after- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     wards informed me, a long conversation with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Brown. He (Mr. Annand) afterwards 
     <lb/>
     told me that they took up the question of Con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     federation, and that he beat Mr. Brown on 
     <lb/>
     every point of the argument He informed me 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Brown having been beaten on the ar- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     gument of Confederation, and the mode of con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     vincing him had used language something 
     <lb/>
     like this: "You and I have been personal 
     <lb/>
     friends, we have long acted together, and it is 
     <lb/>
     too bad that at this poriod I should be obliged 
     <lb/>
     to throw myself into the hands of our oppon- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ents to carry this measure; the liberal party 
     <lb/>
     to which we both belong are going to rule, if 
     <lb/>
     the provinces are united." These remarks 
     <lb/>
     having no effect, he (Mr. Annand) told me that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Brown then said that. " the Maritime Pro- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     vinces, during the present. winter, failed to do 
     <lb/>
     anything to meet the views of the British Go- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     vernment on this question, Canada would 
     <lb/>
     seek some other mode of settling her difficul- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ties, and leave the Maritime Provinces to their 
     <lb/>
     fate. At the conclusion of the conversation I 
     <lb/>
     understood the member for East Halifax to say 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Brown used this language: " Annand, 
     <lb/>
     you should not oppose union ; you have no- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     thing to fear; a man of your ability would al- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ways have his proper position under Confede- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ration." I will not deny that Mr. Annand re- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     marked that he thought Mr Brown's language 
     <lb/>
     held out an improper inducement to influence 
     <lb/>
     his action, but the words money, place or pre- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ferment were never mentioned by Mr. Annand 
     <lb/>
     to me, as I feel confident they would have 
     <lb/>
     been if they had been used. He would have 
     <lb/>
     been too glad to reveal anything of the kind to 
     <lb/>
     me if it were true. This was the extent of the 
     <lb/>
     conversation as the member for East. Halifax 
     <lb/>
     detailed it to me. Mr Brown first arguing 
     <lb/>
     the question of Confederation, then appealing 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Annand's party feelings, and then using 
     <lb/>
     the words l have already given. Whether the 
     <lb/>
     inference which he has drawn from these ex- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     pressions is a legitimate one, and whether he 
     <lb/>
     did or did not colour the facts in relating them 
     <lb/>
     to me, l am not prepared to say. But I will 
     <lb/>
     say the hon. member was disposed to make 
     <lb/>
     the most of Mr. Brown's remarks in his con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     versation with me. l feel bound to give this 
     <lb/>
     contradiction to the hon. member, in justice to 
     <lb/>
     an absent man. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND—It is unnecessary to say any 
     <lb/>
     thing more than that the hon. member has not 
     <lb/>
     stated correctly what l reported as having 
     <lb/>
     passed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. PROV. SEC. said he had to request, in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with a well known rule nt Parlia- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment, that the hon member for East Halifax 
     <lb/>
     lay upon the table the letters which he read as 
     <lb/>
     a portion of his speech. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND contended that there was no 
     <lb/>
     such rule of Parliament, and that the chair 
     <lb/>
     had previously decided against such a de- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     mand.

            </p>

     Hon. PROV. SECY. said :—I wish to call the

     attention of the house to the fact that on Friday 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for East Halifax (Mr. Annand,) 
     <lb/>
     made a statement destructive of the character of 
     <lb/>
     a public man in British America of high stand- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ing, and I rose immediately to state that it was 
     <lb/>
     my intention to telegraph to Mr. Brown on the 
     <lb/>
     subject. My object at the time was to give the 
     <lb/>
     member for East Halifax an opportunity of cor- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     recting me if I misstated him. I at once tele- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     graphed to Mr. Brown these words :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     'To Hon George Brown, M. P. P., Toronto:  
     <lb/>
     Mr. Annand said, on the floor of the House to-day: 
     <lb/>
     ' I had an interview with the Hon. George Brown re- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cently. I could  have had money if I had wished it, 
     <lb/>
     and was promised preferment and place in Canada if 
     <lb/>
     I would support Confederation.' "    
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will take my oath that this was the language 
     <lb/>
     that was used. Mr. Brown's answer is here be- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     fore me. He says :—   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " It is impossible Mr. Annand could have made 
     <lb/>
     such a statement. It Is true that he called upon me 
     <lb/>
     at your house and we discussed the question of Con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     federation ; but money, or preferment, or any other 
     <lb/>
     personal consideration was neither promised nor sug- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
    gested, nor  harboured in speech or thought by me.— 
     <lb/>The speech, however concocted, is a villainous false 
     <lb/>hood.<lb/>(Cheers in the galleries.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND.— In the first place, let me say— 
     <lb/>
    and I am in the judgment of my friends who 
     <lb/>heard me—that the word money never came out 
     <lb/>of my mouth. Let me state the facts. I was 
     <lb/>not offered  money ; I was not offered preferment 
     <lb/>directly, but the hon. member for Richmond has 
     <lb/>correctly stated the substance of the converse- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>tion. I was  reminded by Mr. Brown that I be- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>longed to the Old Liberal party, of which he had 
     <lb/>been for very many years the leader in Canada. 
     <lb/>I was approached by him in this way : "I have 
     <lb/>always sworn by the Chronicle and the Nova 
     <lb/>Scotian. We are all Liberals. They are in the 
     <lb/>ascendancy in Canada ; they will also be in the 
     <lb/>ascendancy in Nova Scotia. Come up to Canada, 
     <lb/>and the Liberals will rule. It will be your inte- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>rest to come."  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. MILLER.—It will be in the recollection 
     <lb/>of the house that the Provincial Secretary in- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>terrupted the hon. member, and asked that his 
     <lb/>words be given in writing, in order that there  
     <lb/>might be no misconception. Now, I not only 
     <lb/>hear the language read by the Prov. Secy., but 
     <lb/>the words as they fell from the hon. member.—

     I was not allowed at the time to give the contra- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     diction of the statement, but did so as soon as I 
     <lb/>
      could. Then I stated precisely what the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member has now said, and yet he replied : " All 
     <lb/>
     I have to say, is, that the hon. gentleman is mis-  
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     taken." Now he says— "it is true." If there is 
     <lb/>
     a man in Nova Scotia or British North America 
     <lb/>
     who, within the last ten days occupies a position 
     <lb/>
     that has drawn upon him the contempt and the 
     <lb/>
     pity of every one, it is the hon. member ; but if 
     <lb/>
     there is anything that could add to his degrada-  
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tion, it is  the humiliating spectacle which he pre- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sents to-day.

     Mr. ANNAND.—The last person who should 
     <lb/>
     rise on the floors of this house and impeach the 
     <lb/>
     veracity of any hon. gentleman is the hon. mem-  
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ber for Richmond.  I have under my hand the 
     <lb/>
     evidence how little importance can be attached to 
     <lb/>
     anything he says. It will be in the recollection 
     <lb/>
     of the house that the hon. member for Inverness 
     <lb/>
      asked me, the other day, how the petitions I pre- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sented against Confederation got down into that 
     <lb/>
     county. I replied it was through the instrumen- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tality of a gentleman who went over to the Gov- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ernment on Confederation. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Richmond rose and said that he was no party 
     <lb/>
     to it.  I hold in my hand this remarkable paper 
     <lb/>
     to show that the hon.gentleman was in favor 
     <lb/>
     of having the question referred to the polls, but 
     <lb/>
     what more ? He came to my office to put into 
     <lb/>
     my hand this paper, and as he did so he said :  
     <lb/>
     " I don't want to be known in this matter ; I 
     <lb/>
     don't wish to go into Inverness, as Mr. McDon- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     nell is a friend of mine ; will you send these pe- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     titions asking that the question of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     be submitted to the people at the polls ?" These 
     <lb/>
     petitions were sent, and, as you have seen, have 
     <lb/>
     come back to the house. The hon. member, 
     <lb/>
     with the view of stimulating the people, wrote 
     <lb/>
     the paper which I hold in my hand, and I had it 
     <lb/>
     printed from his own manuscript. This circular 
     <lb/>
     that went with the petition, was as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " The necessity for petitioning against Confedera- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tion is greater this Session than ever. It is greatly 
     <lb/>
     to be feared that some underhand scheme is being 
     <lb/>
     matured to carry the measure.  None of your repre- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sentatives have publicly declared themselves against     
     <lb/>
     Confederation, although it is understood that two of 
     <lb/>
     them will oppose  the Quebec scheme, while it is a 
     <lb/>
     matter of notoriety that the other is ready, if oppor- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tunity offers, to sacrifice his constituent. lnverness 
     <lb/>
     should,  therefore, speak out to her representatives.— 
     <lb/>
     This is a question where no man should be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     stay on the fence. A member has no right to play fast 
     <lb/>
     and loose with his constituents on so great a question. 
     <lb/>
     He who is not heart and soul with us, is against us.— 
     <lb/>
     Petition strongly and quickly."  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. MILLER.— I think the hon. member will 
     <lb/>
     feel, before I sit down, that he has not made 
     <lb/>
     much out of'the wonderful revelation he has just 
     <lb/>
      given. It is a matter of notoriety that up to a 
     <lb/>
     very recent period I was a determined opponent 
     <lb/>
     of the Quebec scheme, and on every occasion I 
     <lb/>
     did all I could to thwart it. But as respects the 
     <lb/>
     paper in question it was written weeks before 
     <lb/>
     the house met.     
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND.—No!   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      Mr. MILLER. —It was. I tell the hon. gentle- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     man ; it was written at the same time the peti- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tions were sent into my own county that I pre- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
