     MONDAY, May 7.  
 </head>
            <p>House met at 12 o'clock. His Excellency 
     <lb/> <persName ref="pers:GOVE1">Sir WILLIAM FENWICK WILLIAMS</persName>, Lieut.  
     <lb/>Governor, &amp;c., came in state to the Council  
     <lb/>Chamber, and commanded the presence of the  
     <lb/>House therein. After giving his assent to a  
     <lb/>number of Bills, His Excellency was pleased

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly :</hi>  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I congratulate you on the close of an arduous  
     <lb/>Session, during which measures have been  
     <lb/>passed which will, I confidently believe, mate<lb break="no"/>rially promote the prosperity and advancement  
     <lb/>of the Province.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The amendment of the law relating to Edu<lb break="no"/>cation will, I trust, impart increased efficiency  
     <lb/>to the Common School system, and result in<lb/>the more general diffusion of knowledge 
     <lb/>among all classes of the people.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     
     The measures providing for the extension of  
     <lb/>
     Mining Leases will, I doubt not, attract, in an 
     <lb/>
     increased degree, capital from abroad to still  
     <lb/>
     further develope the remarkable mineral  
     <lb/>
     wealth with which this country abounds. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The provision mode for the due representa<lb break="no"/>tion of Nova Scotia at the Paris Exhibition          
     <lb/>
    will diffuse more widely a knowledge of her          
     <lb/>great industrial resources. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The enactments intended to place the treat<lb break="no"/>ment of Pauperism and Disease among the 
     <lb/>
     destitute on a more enlightened and humane 
     <lb/>
     footing, and to protect our shores from the 
     <lb/>
     ravages of infectious diseases, cannot fail to 
     <lb/>
     be productive of general good. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The gallant manner in which all sections of 
     <lb/>
     the country responded to the call to arms, and 
     <lb/>
     the increased provision made for the defence 
     <lb/>
     of the Country, prove conclusively how highly 
     <lb/>
     British institutions are valued, and the sacri<lb break="no"/>fices you are prepared to make to sustain your  
     <lb/>
     connection with the Parent State.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The liberal provision made by you for the 
     <lb/>
     protection of the Fisheries will be an addi<lb break="no"/>tional incentive to the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     to secure that valuable heritage from the en<lb break="no"/>croachments of foreigners. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I thank you for  the liberal appropriation  
     <lb/>made for the Public Service.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. President, and Honourable Members of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council:</hi><lb/>

            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly:</hi><lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Permit me, in conclusion, to express the<lb/>deep gratification your action upon the great<lb/>question of a Union of British North America<lb/>has afforded me, not only as the Representa<lb break="no"/>tive of Her Gracious Majesty, but as one of<lb/>yourselves. It will afford the greatest satis<lb break="no"/>faction to the Imperial Government, as the<lb/>means of imparting additional security to<lb/>this portion of the Empire; and I recognize<lb/>in the patriotic course you have adopted,<lb/>the most efficient guarantee not only for the<lb/>increased prosperity of this Province in com<lb break="no"/>mon with our sister Colonies, but also for<lb/>the permanent connection of them all with the<lb/>British Crown.<lb/>

<!-- GL, 2018-06-05, Commented out below as it follows Debate Day --> 

            <!--<p>[Mr. Annand's reply to Mr. Miller, in report<lb/>of Tuesday, May 1, was sent to the Chronicle<lb/>office along with other "copy," but it has<lb/>neither appeared in that paper not been re<lb break="no"/>turned for insertion in the other journals pub<lb break="no"/>lishing the official reports. Mr, Thompson,<lb/>who reported the whole debate, assures the<lb/>chief Reporter that he reported Mr. Annand<lb/>with this utmost correctness, and that "he can<lb/>have nothing to complain of." The discussion<lb/>lasted a whole afternoon, and if published in<lb/>full would have made at least eight columns.<lb/>Miller spoke at least four times as long as Mr.<lb/>Annand, and his remarks, even when con<lb break="no"/>densed, of course must necessarily occupy<lb/>more space. The points of the speeches of both<lb/>have been given by Mr. Thompson, whose<lb/>fidelity the House has had full opportunity of<lb/>testing during the past session. Mr Annand<lb/>himself has invariably been reported by that<lb/>gentleman, and has never done more than<lb/>make verbal corrections in the manuscript as<lb/>handed to him.â€”J. G. B. ]<lb/>
