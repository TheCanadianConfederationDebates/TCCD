<!-- DL 2018-05-02 commented out below as it is not part of this debate day -->

<!--prominent position in this country—offered a <lb/>
counter scheme of Union in lieu of that submit<lb break="no"/>ted to this Legislature. That scheme has been <lb/>
rejected as far as my observation goes by the <lb/>
whole Anti-Union press up to the present hour. <lb/>
I have heard of no opponent of Union who has <lb/>
had the hardihood to advocate the scheme for the <lb/>
organization of the Empire until the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber did so to-night. He has had the boldness to <lb/>
declare that this scheme is the one which he and <lb/>
his party favor. He says he does not deny that <lb/>
some political change in our condition is neces<lb break="no"/>sary, and has expressed his readiness to adopt the <lb/>
scheme propounded by Mr. Howe for the or<lb break="no"/>ganization of the Empire. By that scheme we <lb/>
are to pay for the wars of the whole Empire. <lb/>
He says he will make us pay pound for pound <lb/>
with the other portions of the Empire. <lb/>
That same idea was enunciated some years <lb/>
ago by Mr. Howe, but I never heard of any <lb/>
who was prepared. to consider it seriously <lb/>
until the hon. member to-night declared <lb/>
that he would make Nova Scotia as Kent <lb/>
or Surrey or any other county of England. <lb/>
The objection to the Quebec scheme was <lb/>
that our representation in the General <lb/>
Legislature was too insignificant, and that <lb/>
we would have to pay for the defence of <lb/>
Canada, that our burthens would be much <lb/>
heavier than they are now. Yet under the <lb/>
plan prepounded by Mr. Howe our people <lb/>
may be summoned at any moment to Cana<lb break="no"/>da, or any portion of the world, wherever <lb/>
her broad empire extends, to fight the bat<lb break="no"/>tles of England; we shall be taxed pound for <lb/>
pound with our fellow-subjects of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Islands—whilst we shall only have a <lb/>
representation of three or four men in the <lb/>
House of Commons. Are the people of <lb/>
this country prepared to accept such a <lb/>
scheme in preference to the one now offer<lb break="no"/>ed for their acceptance? <lb/></p> 

<p>In concluding these few imperfect re<lb break="no"/>marks, Imay say that perhaps Ishall be <lb/>
able to address the House on another occa<lb break="no"/>sion when better prepared to deal with it; <lb/>
but I could not permit the remarks of the <lb/>
hon. member to ass without immediate <lb/>
notice. I shall on y repeat what I said pre— <lb/>
viously that before the hon. member can lay <lb/>
claim to the favorable consideration of the <lb/>
loyal people of this province, he should ex<lb break="no"/>plain away the sentiments which say so <lb/>
little for his allegiance and loyalty to the <lb/>
British Empire. . <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName>:—I desire to make an ex<lb break="no"/>planation in reply to the hon. gentleman. <lb/>
I have never advocated annexation to the <lb/>
United States, I advocate nothing but that <lb/>
we all remain as we are, and maintain our <lb/>
present institutions. As to the taunt about <lb/>
my adhesion to the scheme for the organiza<lb break="no"/>tion of the Empire, I reply that I advocate <lb/>

<cb/>

that scheme because it will make us English <lb/>
How the hon. gentleman will reconcile his <lb/>
imputation of disloyalty with my desire that <lb/>
we should become as a county of England <lb/>
I will leave it to his ingenuity to say. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. PROVINCIAL SECRETARY remarked <lb/>
that the house would be expected to divide <lb/>
on the question on the following evening. <lb/>
Another opportunity would be afforded for <lb/>
discussion when the papers in reference to <lb/>
the delegation were brought down. <lb/></p> 

<p>The debate was adjourned. <lb/></p> 

<p>The house adjourned to the following day <lb/>
at 2.30 <lb/></p> -->

<p rendition="simple:right">TUESDAY, March 19.<lb/></p> 

<p>The House met at 2 30 PM. <lb/>
The adjourned debate was resumed. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:bold"><hi rendition="simple:centre">Speech of Mr. McLelan.</hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCLE4">Mr. MCLELAN</persName> said:—We are told that this <lb/>
debate must be brought to a close this evening, <lb/>
and for those who have opinions to express <lb/>
the time is short. The Provincial Secretary <lb/>
says this haste is imperative, in order that the <lb/>
public business of the country may not be in<lb break="no"/>terfered with. The exigencies of the country <lb/>
may now require this, but I ask who produced <lb/>
the circumstances requiring such hasty delibe<lb break="no"/>rations and forcing us to decide so important a <lb/>
question in so short a period? We in the coun<lb break="no"/>try were prepared months ago to come here <lb/>
and discuss this subject and to attend to the <lb/>
ordinary business of the Legislature, but to <lb/>
suit the convenience of certain hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, the meeting of the House has been post<lb break="no"/>poned to such a late period as to require that <lb/>
the most momentous question ever submitted <lb/>
to Parliament should be passed over almost in <lb/>
silence. For that reason we are told that we <lb/>
must limit our remarks to this single point:— <lb/>
the right of the people to be heard upon the <lb/>
question, and to decide on it for themselves. <lb/>
The Provincial Secretary told us yesterday <lb/>
that he felt proud of the position which he <lb/>
occupied on this question—that he felt proud <lb/>
of the improvements in the bill which is soon <lb/>
to come before us, as compared with the re<lb break="no"/>solutions passed at Quebec. I do not see in <lb/>
the position which he occupies anything to <lb/>
warrant such utterances. He told us last ses<lb break="no"/>sion, as he has told us on every occasion, that <lb/>
the Quebec scheme was just and sound in its <lb/>
principles—that it gave to this Province all it <lb/>
had a right to demand; and the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's colleagues in the delegation reiterated <lb/>
the assertion, and they stated that they were <lb/>
prepared to push that scheme through, and to <lb/>
make it the basis of a Union of the Colonies. <lb/>
If the bill gives us more than that scheme, <lb/>
then whatever it gives in addition is due to us ' <lb/>
who opposed the measure from its inception <lb/>
If the bill gives us five dollars more, the credit <lb/>
is due to the stern opposition the Anti-Con<lb break="no"/>federates have given the question. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman is in this position: he has told us <lb/>
that the Quebec scheme was just and sound, <lb/>
and he has now come back from England <lb/>
claiming to have got more than justice. If <lb/>
these statements be true, he must have done a <lb/>
dishonest thing to some other people, from <lb/>

whom he has taken more than he all along de<lb break="no"/>clared was just; and surely that is not a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to regard with pride. Turning to the only <lb/>
point we are to be permitted, in the magnani<lb break="no"/>mity of the gentlemen opposite, to discuss—the <lb/>
right of the people to be heard on the question <lb/>
—I would first refer to the taunt made by the <lb/>
Financial Secretary. He said we had brought <lb/>
a case here without a precedent to support us, <lb/>
although we had a whole year to obtain such <lb/>
precedents if they existed. I tell him that I <lb/>
have had an abundance of authorities for the <lb/>
position I have taken—authority which I have <lb/>
not sought in the musty pages of Blackstone, <lb/>
to which the hon gentleman last year referred <lb/>
to sustain his position. I have been reading a <lb/>
nobler page than Blackstone ever wrote—a <lb/>
page which bears the impress and imprint of <lb/>
God himself: I mean " the human face divine." <lb/>
I have read the authority which sustains us <lb/>
every day in the year in the faces of my fel<lb break="no"/>low countrymen. Our authority is the look of <lb/>
intelligence on their countenances; I see that <lb/>
in their faces which declares that they have <lb/>
the souls and the reasoning and reflecting <lb/>
powers to enable them to decide on a question <lb/>
affecting them and their posterity as this does. <lb/></p> 

<p>These men till the soil, engage in commerce <lb/>
and fisheries; they have, by their labours and <lb/>
enterprise given us, under the blessing of Pro<lb break="no"/>vidence, all our prosperity, and I take them as <lb/>
my authority. Fifty thousand of these men <lb/>
are devoting their time and means to learn de<lb break="no"/>fence: ready to lay down their lives to protect <lb/>
their country, their homes and their altars. <lb/>
They have during the year paid into the Trea<lb break="no"/>sury through the customs, excise and other de<lb break="no"/>partments, nearly two millions of dollars of <lb/>
their hard earnings, and I say the men who <lb/>
thus in their persons and property are to be <lb/>
affected by this measure are my authority for <lb/>
saying that they should be allowed to decide <lb/>
the question. It is not only to the copies of <lb/>
this authority that are already abroad that I <lb/>
can refer, but every reprint preparing for cir<lb break="no"/>culation confirms that authority. These men <lb/>
are training children; they have sons who will <lb/>
be either taught principles and instilled with <lb/>
feelings that will lead them to rally round the <lb/>
old flag of England, or will lead them beneath <lb/>
a foreign standard to attempt, perhaps, the hu<lb break="no"/>miliation of England. When I see that I feel <lb/>
that my authority for maintaining the rights <lb/>
of the people is strong and conclusive, and <lb/>
should be recognised as such by this Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. In order to meet the sophistry and des<lb break="no"/>troy the cobwebs which some gentlemen learn<lb break="no"/>ed in the law are disposed to weave about the <lb/>
question, it is not necessary to labor the argu<lb break="no"/>ment. I care not how many precedents from <lb/>
Blackstone is brought—I care not if they bring <lb/>
old Blackstone himself from the grave—there <lb/>
is a principle of common sense that would <lb/>
trample them all under foot and proclaim that <lb/>
this right belongs to the people. The very term <lb/>
"responsible government" tells us that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple should deside the question. Responsible to <lb/>
whom? Pass the bill and your responsibility <lb/>
is at an end. Our system of Government <lb/>
implies that you have either had the sanction <lb/>
of the people or intend to return to them for <lb/>
ratification. This bill does not contemplate <lb/>
that you should do that, for the very Act <lb/>
destroys the constitution, and is contrary to <lb/>
the term — Responsible Government. The <lb/>

<cb/>

gentlemen who have spoken on the other side <lb/>
affect to treat lightly the opinion of the <lb/>
people,—but who gave us all our positions? <lb/>
Who sent us here but the people? It is but a <lb/>
few years since they and all of us were per<lb break="no"/>tions of the people, and now forsooth, because <lb/>
they are placed in power beyond the control <lb/>
of their constituents they presume to ignore <lb/>
the rights of those who sent them here, and <lb/>
to destroy the hand that lifted them to posi<lb break="no"/>tions of honor. I can scarcely restrain my <lb/>
feeling within reasonable bounds when I see <lb/>
the determination of gentlemen opposite to <lb/>
ignore the feelings and rights of the people on <lb/>
this question. We are told that the country <lb/>
has not been taken by surprise—that this is no <lb/>
new question, but I maintain that it is an en<lb break="no"/>tire surprise. It is true that for many years <lb/>
the subject of a union of British America has <lb/>
been from time to time discussed, but we all <lb/>
know that these discussions were considered <lb/>
more theoretical than practical, and not the <lb/>
least importance was attached to them as being <lb/>
likely to affect the country. <lb/></p> 

<p>Reference has been made to the action of the <lb/>
Legislature in 1861, when Mr. Howe, whose <lb/>
name has been so frequently mentioned in this <lb/>
discussion,moved a resolution declaring that <lb/>
the subjectof Union had been from time to <lb/>
time considered, and that as serious obstacles <lb/>
existed, which could only be removed by <lb/>
consultation of the leading men of all the Co<lb break="no"/>lonies, a delegation should be appointed with <lb/>
the view of setting the question at rest. That <lb/>
delegation met, and it resulted in no action <lb/>
being taken by this Legislature or by the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. The delegates no doubt found it impossi<lb break="no"/>ble to reconcile the conflicting interests exist<lb break="no"/>ing among the Province, and they made this <lb/>
report, setting it, as a public question, as was <lb/>
believed, at rest. It may be said that Canada <lb/>
was not anxious for Union at that period,— <lb/>
but in 1858 they had asked for it by a des<lb break="no"/>patch signed by Messrs. Cartier and Galt, <lb/>
men who were prominent in the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference. That despatch declared that the <lb/>
harmonious working of their constitution had <lb/>
been rendered almost an impossibility, and <lb/>
asking for a Federative Union ot the Provin<lb break="no"/>ces of British North America on " grounds pe<lb break="no"/>culiar to Canada." <lb/></p> 

<p>In 1858, then, you had Canadian ministers <lb/>
expressing a desire for union, and- declaring, <lb/>
through a public despatch that the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of government had been almost an impos<lb break="no"/>sibility in Canada; and when Mr. Howe went <lb/>
in 1861 to set the question at rest, the desire <lb/>
existed on the part of Canada to overcome the <lb/>
difficulties of their system, and to unite with <lb/>
us. Why, then, this being the case, was not <lb/>
the Union accomplished? The language of <lb/>
the resolution is, " by mutual consultation," <lb/>
implying that there should be mutual conces<lb break="no"/>sion: and perhaps the main reason why a ba<lb break="no"/>sis of union was not then arranged was that <lb/>
the Canadians were unwilling to make such <lb/>
concessions as Mr. Howe, in a due regard for <lb/>
the interests of Nova Scotia, believed should <lb/>
be made before we went into any Union— <lb/>
And let me ask here what concessions <lb/>
they have made in the scheme under <lb/>
consideration? It is impossible for the de<lb break="no"/>legates to lay their finger on a single fea<lb break="no"/>ture in this scheme and say, there is some<lb break="no"/>thing that has been conceded to us by Canada <lb/>

as a compensation for the great loss we shall <lb/>
sustain in going into this Union. Then I say <lb/>
that in 1863, when the elections took place, the <lb/>
question, as a public question, had been set at <lb/>
rest, and did not come under consideration at <lb/>
the hustings. Take the speech of the Provin<lb break="no"/>cial Secretary in 1864, when he introduced the <lb/>
resolution for a Maritime Union, and you will <lb/>
find that the idea of a Confederation with Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, whatever he may have said about it in <lb/>
his lecture at St. John, was not entertained by <lb/>
him as being likely to yield any practical re<lb break="no"/>sult. He says in that speech:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"The proposal which was made and advocated <lb/>
with such singular ability by my hon. friend the <lb/>
leader of the Government several years ago in this <lb/>
Legislature was for a <hi rendition="simple:italic">Legislative Union</hi> of the whole <lb/>
British American Provinces. On that occasion the <lb/>
whole subject of a Union of the Colonies was so fully <lb/>
and ably discussed by the leading minds of both sides <lb/>
of the Legislature as to render it unnecessary that <lb/>
any great amount of attention or time should be oc<lb break="no"/>cupied in going over the grounds which have been so <lb/>
ably detailed. But difficulties have been found—and <lb/>
I may say insuperable difficulties—in grappling with <lb/>
that which so many of the ablest minds in this coun<lb break="no"/>try have advocated in connection with this subject. <lb/>
The union of the Maritime Provinces with Canada <lb/>
has hitherto presented insurmountable obstacles. <lb/></p> 

<p>"I believe that to be a question which far transcends <lb/>
in its difficulties the power of any human advocacy <lb/>
to accomplish." <lb/></p></quote> 

<p>In 1864, when this gentleman was on the <lb/>
delegation, he declared to the people of Cana<lb break="no"/>da that the people of this Province were un<lb break="no"/>informed on this question. That was a year <lb/>
after the elections had taken place. This was <lb/>
his language as found in that report of his <lb/>
speech published by Mr. Whelen, of P. E. Is<lb break="no"/>land, on page 67:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"Uninformed as the public mind in the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces was on this question, the visit and the state<lb break="no"/>ments made by the gentlemen connected with the <lb/>
Government of Canada have aroused attention to it," <lb/></p></quote> 

<p>Here, then, we have the acknowledgment <lb/>
made, after the election of this House, that the <lb/>
public mind was not awake to it,—not even <lb/>
when this question was about to assume a <lb/>
practical shape; and yet we are now told that <lb/>
the country was not taken by surprise, and in <lb/>
the House of Commons that the subject was <lb/>
discussed at every polling booth. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Prov. Sec, however, claims that the in<lb break="no"/>telligent sentiment of the country is with him; <lb/>
—if that be true the hon. gentleman's course is <lb/>
simple and plain,—what obiection can he have <lb/>
to presenting this question to the people and <lb/>
saying, "Will you who are to be affected for <lb/>
weal or woe by this measure accept it?" The <lb/>
answer he gives is that party feeling is so <lb/>
high that a fair decision cannot be obtained at <lb/>
the polls, but he has the proof that party feel<lb break="no"/>ing will not interfere when he has seen gentle<lb break="no"/>men from his own side of the House rallying <lb/>
into opposition, and leading gentlemen formerly <lb/>
opposed to him in politics forgetting the ties of <lb/>
party and going to his support. This is the best <lb/>
proof that the question overrides party feeling, <lb/>
and that feeling will not interfere with its just <lb/>
consideration at the polls. The question has as<lb break="no"/>sumed such importance that no man should al<lb break="no"/>low partyspirit to influence his conduct in oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to his just convictions. I for one honestly <lb/>
believe the measure to be wrong, and I will co<lb break="no"/>operate with any man holding this opinion and <lb/>
willing to oppose the scheme from beginning <lb/>
to end. This, I claim, is the only question be <lb/>

<cb/>

fore the country,—all other parties and all other <lb/>
questions are for the time being set completely <lb/>
aside, and the only plank in the platform of the <lb/>
party with which I wish to co-operate is the <lb/>
determination to stop or repeal the measure. <lb/>
Men, to whatever side they may belong, may <lb/>
express various opinions about the present <lb/>
state and proposed organization of the empire, <lb/>
but the only principle which I can recognize <lb/>
is that this thing must be stopped. Because a <lb/>
leading man connected with the Province has <lb/>
chosen to write an article on the state of the em<lb break="no"/>pire, the Prov. Sec. has undertaken to say that <lb/>
is our platform, and that we are bound to stand <lb/>
or fall by it—that we are bound to present <lb/>
something in opposition to the scheme which <lb/>
they have submitted. But I tell him we pos<lb break="no"/>sessed a satisfactory system of government <lb/>
before this scheme was brought here. Let me <lb/>
now say a word or two respecting the Organi<lb break="no"/>zation of the Empire. It has been time and <lb/>
again stated and acknowledged that the weak<lb break="no"/>est portion of the British Empire is B. N. Ame<lb break="no"/>rica, and we, placed alongside so powerful <lb/>
a neighbour see and feel the truth of the state<lb break="no"/>ment. When last night this subject was <lb/>
touched, my imagination pictured the hor<lb break="no"/>rors of a war between England and America <lb/>
with Nova Scotia for the battle ground as it <lb/>
would be. The picture presented I cannot find <lb/>
language to describe, nor can the most vivid <lb/>
imagination truly paint the desolation which <lb/>
would come upon us should the demon of war <lb/>
drive his horrid ploughshares over this fair <lb/>
Province. The very graves of our fathers <lb/>
would be uprooted and their cherished dust <lb/>
scattered to the winds. Every man sees and <lb/>
feels, moreover, that the chances of war with <lb/>
us are greatly increased by our connection <lb/>
with the mother country. Yet still if treated <lb/>
as men, permitted to enjoy legitimate rights, <lb/>
the British feeling within us will lead us to <lb/>
maintain at all hazards, our allegiance and <lb/>
our connection with Old England, and to con<lb break="no"/>tribute our all; if it comes upon us, to give new <lb/>
triumphstoBritish arms and new ustreto <lb/>
British fame. Placed in this position—the <lb/>
weakest of the Empire—what does Mr. Howe <lb/>
propose? Simply, to strengthen and protect <lb/>
the weak point by bringing to our aid all the <lb/>
might and power of two hundred and fifty <lb/>
millions of British subjects; whilst the dele<lb break="no"/>gates would bring at most but thirty millions <lb/>
to the help of a people perhaps divided in sen<lb break="no"/>timent,_or as we verily believe leave us to the <lb/>
protection of this new nationality alone. As <lb/>
was said here last evening Nova Scotia must <lb/>
belong to some great naval power. We are <lb/>
so situated that a gunboat can shell al<lb break="no"/>most any part of our territory, and not only <lb/>
the treasures of coal and minerals we have <lb/>
within call for protection, but our commerce <lb/>
without; our ships on every sea demand it; <lb/>
and yet this scheme which is being forced <lb/>
upon us will leave us only to the protection <lb/>
of Canada. What! leave us only un<lb break="no"/>der the protection of Canada? What ab<lb break="no"/>surdity: Why, sir, it could not protect one <lb/>
ot' our potato shallops Put one in the har<lb break="no"/>bour and bring to its protection the whole navy <lb/>
of Canada, and there is hardly a fifth rate <lb/>
naval power in the world but would consider <lb/>
it alight task to take possession of theboat <lb/>
and perhaps pelt its defenders to death with <lb/>
the cargo. And then as to the protection of <lb/>

our fisheries against the Americans—it is sim<lb break="no"/>ply preposterous. They could not protect a <lb/>
smoked herring in Digby, much less alive cod<lb break="no"/>fish or a school of mackerel sporting along our <lb/>
coast. And feeling the force of these facts <lb/>
and the importance of our position, we are <lb/>
told that in declining to form this connection <lb/>
and set up shop in this new concern in compa<lb break="no"/>ny with Canada, we are disloyal; and all <lb/>
through the story these gentlemen have been <lb/>
preaching to us about loyalty. They rightly <lb/>
estimated, to a great extent, the feelings of the <lb/>
country when they played upon that word. <lb/>
They have from the outset labored to make us <lb/>
believe that the measure was forced on us by <lb/>
the mother country in order that the feelings <lb/>
ot attachment and the desire to yield to the <lb/>
wishes of the parent state might lead us to fav<lb break="no"/>or the connection, and time and again we <lb/>
have been accused of disloyalty in declining <lb/>
to go into this copartnership. <lb/></p> 

<p>I may be here pardoned for referring to the <lb/>
fact that the history of Canada has shown that <lb/>
her people have not always paid due respect <lb/>
to the British flag. No such charge, however, <lb/>
could be made against our peonle,and it would <lb/>
seem, from the despatches which have been <lb/>
made public during the discussion of this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, that the statesmen of England felt a secu<lb break="no"/>rity so long as we remained loyal and were <lb/>
not tampered with by the Canadians. It <lb/>
seems that on the. 27th of January, 1860, <lb/>
the Duke of Newcastle sent a. despatch <lb/>
marked "confidential," in which he com<lb break="no"/>manded that no delegates should be sent <lb/>
to confer with other Provinces without per» <lb/>
mission fron the Home Government. or with<lb break="no"/>out the occasion of their conference first being <lb/>
stated to him. So far, then, from the British <lb/>
Government forcing the union upon us, our <lb/>
Government were obliged to obtain permis<lb break="no"/>sion before these gentlemen could go upon the <lb/>
delegation. The Lieut. Governor says, in a <lb/>
despatch dated the 18th July:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"It seems proper that l should call your attention <lb/>
to the deapatch of the 27th January, 1860, marked <lb/>
'confidential,' addressed to my predecessor by his <lb/>
Grace the Duke of Newcastle. In that despatch his <lb/>
Grace, whilst apparently expressing no disapproval <lb/>
of the discussion of such a question as that which is <lb/>
now imminent, concludes with the following instruc<lb break="no"/>tion: 'Previous to sending delegates to Quebec or <lb/>
elsewhere, such a proposal should not be authorized <lb/>
by yourself without previous communication with <lb/>
the Secretary of State. in order that the question of <lb/>
the delegates and the instructions to be given them <lb/>
may be known beforehand to Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment.' " <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>We have in the public despatches the clear<lb break="no"/>est proof that the question originated wizh the <lb/>
delegates themselves: they churned up the <lb/>
whole matter in order to butter the fingers of a <lb/>
few leading politicians; and having done so, <lb/>
they tell us we are disloyal because we are un<lb break="no"/>willing to adopt it. We refuse rather because <lb/>
we feel that our loyalty might be affected by <lb/>
the connection. Canada has been, within the <lb/>
recollection of men around me, twice in open <lb/>
insurrection, and within a few years <lb/>
there has appeared a manifesto declaring <lb/>
that annexation to the United States was <lb/>
the only remedy for the political evils of <lb/>
the country. That manifesto was signed by<lb/>
many public men who have since occupied <lb/>
prominent positions in her Parliament and <lb/>
Government; and yet we are called disloyal <lb/>
because we refuse to join with her. I ask <lb/>

<cb/>

gentlemen around me—men of family, who <lb/>
have perhaps daughters whose beauty, whose <lb/>
accomplishments and virtue is their just pride, <lb/>
and whose fair name they would at all hazards <lb/>
maintain,—I ask them what they would say <lb/>
if such a daughter was publicly charged with <lb/>
a want of modesty and virtue for no better rea<lb break="no"/>son than a refusal to share the bed of one twice <lb/>
taken in adultery—one who declared publicly <lb/>
(as in that manifesto) a determination to again <lb/>
play the harlot? I tell the hon, gentleman <lb/>
that if there be any disloyalty in the question, <lb/>
or any show of disloyalty, he and his friends <lb/>
have given it. We have been told that Mr. <lb/>
Howe and the other people's delegates are dis<lb break="no"/>loyal because they referred to the temptations <lb/>
to annexation, in the case which they placed <lb/>
before the British Parliament. Is there any <lb/>
disloyalty in telling the whole truth? Was it <lb/>
not the duty of these gentlemen, as public men <lb/>
writing a letter to Imperial statesmen, to <lb/>
present all the features of the question? When <lb/>
the Financial Secretary gave that taunt, did <lb/>
he forget that that distinguished statesman <lb/>
Lord Durham, in his report to Her Majesty on <lb/>
the state of these Provinces, took the very same <lb/>
course? Earl Durham came out, and examin<lb break="no"/>ed and understood the whole case of the Cana<lb break="no"/>das; he saw the position of the country, and <lb/>
does not seem to think he makes himself <lb/>
amenable to the charge of disloyalty in stating <lb/>
the whole truth, and in drawing attention to <lb/>
the contrast which exists on the two sides of <lb/>
the boundary line. Lord Durham says:<lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"Throughout the course of the preceding pares I <lb/>
have constantly had occasion to refer to this con<lb break="no"/>trast. l have not hesitated to do so. though no man's <lb/>
just pride in his country and firm attachment to its <lb/>
institutions can be more deeply shocked by the. mor<lb break="no"/>tifying admission of inferiority. But I should ill dis<lb break="no"/>charge my duty to Your Majesty—I should give but <lb/>
an imperfect view of the real condition of these Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—were I to detail mere statistical facts, with<lb break="no"/>out dcseribing the feelings which they generate in <lb/>
those who observe them daily, and daily experience <lb/>
their influence on their own fortunes. The contrast <lb/>
which I have described is the theme of every travell<lb break="no"/>er who visits these countries and who observes on <lb/>
one side of the line the abundance. and on the other <lb/>
the scarcity of every sign of material prosperity which <lb/>
thriving agriculture and flourishing cities indicate, <lb/>
and of civilization, which schools and churches testi<lb break="no"/>fy, even to the outward senses <lb/></p> </quote>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"It cannot be denied indeed that the continuance <lb/>

in stronger and clearer terms than those used <lb/>
by Mr. Howe and his associates? and I have <lb/>

and disregarded, says that if we are left un<lb break="no"/>disturbed and with the control of our revenues <lb/>
there will be no thoughts of annexation. Lis<lb break="no"/>ten to this conclusion:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"We have thus, my lord, simply stated the case as <lb/>
presented to us by General Banks and the Quebec <lb/>
Confederation. With all the temptations offered us <lb/>
at Washington, we ask simply to be let alone, or we <lb/>
ask to be folded to our mother's bosom, and not cast <lb/>
out into the wilderness of untried experiments and <lb/>
political speculation. Nova Scotia says to England, <lb/>
as Ruth said to Naomi, ' Where you go we will go; <lb/>
your people shall be our people.' This love and affec<lb break="no"/>tion spring from a thousand sources that we need <lb/>
not linger to describe, but which it would he a fatal <lb/>
mistake to suppose can ever be transferred. You <lb/>
cannot endorse our hearts or our allegiance over to <lb/>
the Canadians as you would a note of hand." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>These were the sentiments offered by Mr. <lb/>
Howe, and for which the Financial Secretary <lb/>
undertakes to make the charge of disloyalty. <lb/>
I only wish that there were more men in the <lb/>
British Empire who gave as true and firm al<lb break="no"/>legiance to the Crown as Joseph Howe. I <lb/>
wish Nova Scotia had more sons occupying the <lb/>
exalted position in which he stands, and as <lb/>
mindful of her interests. In all his actions <lb/>
and speeches the interest of the Provinces <lb/>
appears uppermost, and one cannot but be re<lb break="no"/>minded of the Persian ambassador who took <lb/>
with him to France a turf dug from the soil of <lb/>
his own land, to which every morning be paid <lb/>
religious salutation, so that he might bear <lb/>
throughout the day the recollection of his <lb/>
country, and labor for her advantage. So is it <lb/>
with Mr. Howe; he seems ever to have with <lb/>
him a recollection of his country and her in<lb break="no"/>terests, while other politicians go on dele<lb break="no"/>gations or embassies, engage in exhaustive <lb/>
festivities and in salutations to the pro<lb break="no"/>ducts of other countries forget the interests of <lb/>
their own. <lb/></p> 

<p>We are told that we are disloyal on account <lb/>
of our allies, of some expression made by <lb/>
public men in the neighboring States in con<lb break="no"/>nection with this matter. You will remember <lb/>
that at at the period of the Canadian insurrec<lb break="no"/>tion a large amount of sympathy was mani<lb break="no"/>fected by the people of the United States with <lb/>
the Canadas, and what does Earl Durham tell <lb/>
us in his report as the reason why that sym<lb break="no"/>pathy was drawn towards the Canadians? <lb/>
Was the belief that there was a desire to vio<lb break="no"/>late the constitution of the country, and to <lb/>
take from the Provinces the control of their <lb/>
revenues? He thinks that was sufficient <lb/>
cause for the people who had taken so much <lb/>
pride in their war of independence to bestow <lb/>
their sympathy, and it may be that the people <lb/>
on that side of the line look on this measure as <lb/>
an attempt to take from the people of this co<lb break="no"/>lony their constitution, and to deprive them <lb/>
of the control of their measures without their <lb/>
consent. But, because these people live on <lb/>
that side of the line are they the less able to <lb/>
judge of the merits of the guestion? <lb/></p> 

<p>I hold, as I have said, if there be any dis<lb break="no"/>loyalty in the matter it is on the part of those <lb/>
who here and elsewhere are attempting to <lb/>
force on us this scheme of Confederation, and <lb/>
are thereby weakening the Empire and en<lb break="no"/>dangering our connection with England. I <lb/>
need hardly remind the house of the term <lb/>
which these gentlemen have used: we are to <lb/>
form a " new nation," the Confederation is to <lb/>
be a " new nationality," and these terms im<lb break="no"/>

<cb/> 

ply that it is to be separate and distinct from <lb/>
the mother country. I turn back to the de<lb break="no"/>bate on the Canadian Militia Bill in 1863, and <lb/>
there I find one of the Ministry, Mr. McGee <lb/>
declaring that he favored connection with Bri<lb break="no"/>tain merely that Canada might have time to <lb/>
grow and strengthen and obtain the Maritime <lb/>
element—" to give Canada and the other <lb/>
provinces time to be linked together, and be<lb break="no"/>come a great united nation." Here is <lb/>
the declaration of one of the Canadian Minis<lb break="no"/>try, and again you have the Prov Sec declar<lb break="no"/>ing in the following language that the object <lb/>
of promoting union was to effect a change in <lb/>
the system of Government. At a public din<lb break="no"/>ner at Quebec he used this language—"When <lb/>
it is understood that the object of this meeting <lb/>
of delegates is to ascertain whether the time <lb/>
has not come when a more useful system of <lb/>
government can be devised for these British <lb/>
American Provinces, I need not say its im<lb break="no"/>portance is one which it is impossible to over<lb break="no"/>estimate. " Again—" As was observed by Mr. <lb/>
Cartier, great as is your country, large as is <lb/>
your population, inexhaustible as are your re<lb break="no"/>sources, the maritime provinces have some<lb break="no"/>thing to give you equally essential to the form<lb break="no"/>ation of a great nation." <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PRO SEC</persName>.—Go on—the more the bet<lb break="no"/>ter. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCLE4">Mr. McLELAN</persName>—Yes, the more the better, <lb/>
provided the people of this country desired to <lb/>
change their system of government, and, if <lb/>
it were possible, to make of these disjointed <lb/>
provinces stretching along almost the whole <lb/>
length of a continent, a united and prosperous <lb/>
nation. If the provinces, laid side by side <lb/>
as one with one interest, extending over the <lb/>
whole from a common centre, you might <lb/>
talk of forming a nation, and say " the more <lb/>
the better," but you are in this attempting phy<lb break="no"/>sical impossibilities, and will only bring into <lb/>
conflict separate and distinct interests, which <lb/>
can only be worked harmoniously from Eng<lb break="no"/>land or some other independent centre. Let <lb/>
me just say to the hon. gentleman—"That <lb/>
which God hath put asunder let no man at<lb break="no"/>tempt to join." <lb/></p> 

<p>But Mr. Archibald seems also to have aspi<lb break="no"/>rations after a new nationality, I find him using <lb/>
this language in Canada, " Nova Scotia came <lb/>
not asking Canada to accept her, but she told <lb/>
Canada that with the magnificent back coun<lb break="no"/>try of the latter, and her territory and wealth <lb/>
and her desire to become a great nation, Nova <lb/>
Scotia had a frontier and resources of which <lb/>
she need not be ashamed; but if she enjoyed as <lb/>
she did, all the advantages and free<lb break="no"/>dom ot resposible institutions, why <lb/>
was she desirous to change her rela<lb break="no"/>tions? The time had arrived when we <lb/>
were about to assume the position of a great <lb/>
nation, and such being the case we should not <lb/>
shrink from its responsibilities." I tell him <lb/>
that Nova Scotia was not " desirous to change <lb/>
her relations;" her people regard our relations <lb/>
with the Mother Country with just pride,— <lb/>
and the gentlemen who give utterance to such <lb/>
sentiments and express such desires are not <lb/>
exactly the men to taunt us with disloyalty. <lb/>
Mr. McCully also on a subsequent festive oc<lb break="no"/>casion talks of furnishing the maritime ele<lb break="no"/>ment for a new nation. <lb/></p> 

<p>But if we are chargeable with disloyalty be<lb break="no"/>cause of our allies, what of the allies of the <lb/>

hon. delegates? The hon. member for South <lb/>
Colchester in a. letter to his fellow-country<lb break="no"/>men, claimed to have allies in the United <lb/>
States—allies reflecting his opinions. and <lb/>
among them he named the New York <hi rendition="simple:italic">Albion</hi>. <lb/>
What does that paper say a few weeks after <lb/>
when speaking of the formation of a nation in<lb break="no"/>dependent of Great Britain. <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"We favor and even warmly advocate Confedera<lb break="no"/>rion withaview to the ultimate realization of these <lb/>
cherished anticipations." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>And in another number the same paper <lb/>
says— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"The colonists. unaccustomed to national responsi<lb break="no"/>bilities. have been slow to move in the direction so <lb/>
plainly suggested, namely <hi rendition="simple:italic">that of a separate national <lb/>

But, finally aroused to the absolute necessity of ac<lb break="no"/>tion in this direction, A scheme with this end in <lb/>

<p>Another of their allies (the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Standard</hi>) <lb/>
referring to the means tried to carry out the <lb/>
scheme. declares that it endangers the relations <lb/>
of the Mother Country—and quotes Mr. Oliphant <lb/>
as authority to say that no genuine effort was <lb/>
made by the Government to secure a renewal of <lb/>
the Reciprocity Treaty, without which Confede<lb break="no"/>ration could not have been secured, and adds the <lb/>
attempt to dragoon the Provinces into Confede<lb break="no"/>ration is dangerous to the relations of the Colo<lb break="no"/>nies with the Mother Country. I may add this <lb/>
gentleman is not alone in the opinion that no <lb/>
genuine effort was made to secure the renewal of <lb/>
the treaty,—Mr. Brown withdrew from the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Government, dissenting from his collea<lb break="no"/>gues mainly on account of the inefficiency of the <lb/>
policy pursued to effect the end in view. <lb/></p> 

<p>I feel that I have already occupied more time <lb/>
than belongs to me, but let me say before I re<lb break="no"/>sume my seat, that the events of the last few <lb/>
months-within the last few weeks—should ope<lb break="no"/>rate, asa powerful influence on the members of <lb/>
the House and on the people of the country. We <lb/>
have been told time and again that the British <lb/>
Government were anxious to have the scheme <lb/>
carried out, and were making its adoption one of <lb/>
the conditions on which our defence should be <lb/>
continued; but although a large number of sta<lb break="no"/>tesmen may be desirous, from mistaken <lb/>
views of the question, to have this union <lb/>
formed, yet there is justice and manli<lb break="no"/>ness enough in them to induce them <lb/>
to say on all occasions that they will not <lb/>
coerce us into it. They are telling us and have <lb/>
told us, that they are omitting Newfoundland and <lb/>
Prince Edward Island from the measure, because <lb/>
nothing can deceive them into the belief that the <lb/>
people of those Provinces are favorable to union. <lb/>
The Provincial Secretary said that Lord Car<lb break="no"/>narvon asked whom he was to accept as authori<lb break="no"/>ties on this question, it not the men who conduc<lb break="no"/>ted the Government; and he (Prov. Secy.) hav<lb break="no"/>ing claimed that a majority of the people were <lb/>
in favor of union, goes to the Colonial Office and <lb/>
states it for a. fact, The Colonial Secretary de<lb break="no"/>cides that he must accept the statement as au<lb break="noo"/>

<cb/> 

thoritative, and having obtained a majority in the <lb/>
Legislature, the measure received the support of <lb/>
the Imperial Government; but these who support <lb/>
it in the British Parliment say, all through their <lb/>
speeches, that if the people are unwilling,it should <lb/>
not be forced upon them. The men who know <lb/>
what the feelings of this country are, and who <lb/>
know that there is no desire on the art of the <lb/>
British Government to coerce us, should now, <lb/>
with this opportunity given, pay deference and <lb/>
respect to the wishes of the people. The Prov. <lb/>
Sec. tells us that the man would be an idiot who <lb/>
would dissolve Parliament as long as he could <lb/>
command a majority. If that doctrine were car<lb break="no"/>ried out, it would be found one of the most tyran<lb break="no"/>nical and monstrous that could bc uttered: men <lb/>
have lost their heads for putting in practice doc<lb break="no"/>trines less obnoxious. Does he mean that so long <lb/>
as a man can by any means, however corrupt, <lb/>
command . majority in Parliament, he may do <lb/>
what he pleases with the people and their pro<lb break="no"/>perty? No such doctrine can be maintained: <lb/>
there must be some limit, and the men whom the <lb/>
people have sent here to transact their business, <lb/>
and to go back to them with an account of their <lb/>
stewardship, should consider that this question <lb/>
affects the people and their posterity, and they <lb/>
should not assume the unnecessary responsibility <lb/>
of passing- it without their instructions, lest,when <lb/>
the evils of this union are realized, they live to <lb/>
be erpetually reproached for their action — live <lb/>
to be told that, members of Parliament though <lb/>
they were, they had no more right to force this <lb/>
measure upon their countrymen than they will <lb/>
have to enter Heaven with so great a crime <lb/>
against the manhood of Nova Scotia unrepent<lb break="no"/>ed of. <lb/></p>

<fw type="num">31</fw>

<p>I regret that it was not my good fortune <lb/>
to be present at the earlier part of the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion. I have not had the opportunity of <lb/>
hearing the learned mover of the amend<lb break="no"/>ment put his case before the House—nei<lb break="no"/>ther have I had the satisfaction of hearing <lb/>
the answer given to it by the Provmcial Se<lb break="no"/>cretary. All that I can gather as to the line <lb/>
of argument pursued by these gentlemen is <lb/>
what I can infer from the tenor of the <lb/>
speeches of my hon. friend, and one or two <lb/>
of those gentlemen who have preceded him <lb/>
—and therefore in what I have to say, I <lb/>
may be repeating what has already been <lb/>
said to the House, in which case I trust <lb/>
they will forgive me, as I may be misap<lb break="no"/>prehending the views propounded by gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the other side—and if I do I <lb/>
shall be glad to be put right, as I proceed. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, sir, as I understand the question be<lb break="no"/>fore the House, the resolution affirms the <lb/>
doctrine that all great questions ought to be <lb/>
first deliberately reviewed by a Legislature <lb/>
and then submitted to the polls before the <lb/>
Legislature is in a position to deal with <lb/>
them. This is the doctrine which the learn<lb break="no"/>ed mover calls on the House to sanction by <lb/>
a deliberate vote. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, sir, this question has been before <lb/>
the public since 1864. It is a question <lb/>
touching a fundamental doctrine of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Constitution. How are we to ascertain <lb/>
what is, or what is not constitutional? Is it <lb/>
not by examining practice and precedents <lb/>
of that august assembly on which our own <lb/>
is modelled? Is it not by consulting those <lb/>
writers on constitutional history who ex<lb break="no"/>pound and develop the principles of which <lb/>
these precedents and practices are the illus<lb break="no"/>trations? In the adjoining library are the <lb/>
records of the House of Commons since the <lb/>
earliest history of the empire. They are <lb/>
open to every gentleman who wishes to in<lb break="no"/>form himself, and doubtless have been re<lb break="no"/>sorted to for the purpose. There will be <lb/>
found every incident in the long history of <lb/>
legislation in the mother country. Can the <lb/>
learned mover of this resolution point out, <lb/>
in that vast treasury of constitutional usages, <lb/>
a single precedent for the doctrine he un<lb break="no"/>dertakes to preach? Or does he ask us to <lb/>
believe that, in these latter days, a new <lb/>
light has dawned on him, and that it is our <lb/>
duty to accept the fresh revelation? <lb/></p> 

<p>I think I may safely conclude from the <lb/>
speech of my hon. friend who has just sat <lb/>
down, that the mover of this resolution has <lb/>
been able to quote no authority for his <lb/>
views. When find my hon. friend desert<lb break="no"/>ing the records and the books—when I find <lb/>
he cannot quote even a text writer in his <lb/>

<cb/>

favour—when I find him driven to say that <lb/>
he has no other authority for his doctrine <lb/>
than the expression of the faces of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in his neighborhood—I ask myself if he <lb/>
thinks so poorly of the intelligence of this <lb/>
house as to suppose they will accept such <lb/>
an authority or a constitutional doctrine. <lb/>
My hon. friend's reasoning would be in place <lb/>
in a farce. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPBELL</persName>—It is a tragedy. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName>—Then it is a very com<lb break="no"/>ical kind of tragedy. Let my hon. friend ad<lb break="no"/>dress our reason or our judgement—let him <lb/>
quote authority or precedent. Let him give <lb/>
the opinions of lawyers, of historians, of <lb/>
philosophers, or of statesmen, and I listen to <lb/>
him with deference. But when he talks of <lb/>
measuring the length and the breadth of the <lb/>
faces of his neighbours, and asks us to ac<lb break="no"/>cept that as an argument, can he wonder <lb/>
that I consider such reasoning as bordering <lb/>
on farce. But my hon. friend has good <lb/>
grounds for not resorting to authority or pre<lb break="no"/>cedent; they are all the other way. The <lb/>
idea of a legislature having no power to de<lb break="no"/>cide except upon questions that have been <lb/>
sent to the polls for the opinion of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple is entirely un-English. A doctrine to <lb/>
that extent as never been propounded <lb/>
even in the republican institutions of our <lb/>
neighbours, but so far as there is any foun<lb break="no"/>dation at all for such a doctrine, it is repub<lb break="no"/>lican and American as opposed to British <lb/>
and constitutional principles. Do I wish <lb/>
the house to take my unsupported assertion <lb/>
on this subject? No. <lb/></p> 

<p>Let me turn to one or two British authori<lb break="no"/>ties on this subject. Hallam devoted a <lb/>
large portion of his life to the study of con<lb break="no"/>stitutional questions. He is accepted as an <lb/>
authority of great weight on these subjects. <lb/>
The learned member for Guysborough will <lb/>
admit that his authority is entitled to great <lb/>
deference. What does he say? In speak<lb break="no"/>ing of the Septennial Act passed in 1717, <lb/>
Hallam says:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"Nothing can be more extravagant than what is <lb/>
sometimes confidently pretended by the ignorant, <lb/>
that the Legislature exceeded its rights by this enact<lb break="no"/>ment, or, if that cannot be legally advanced, that it at <lb/>
least violated the trust of the people and broke in <lb/>
upon the ancient constitution." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Now, what was the character of that act? <lb/>
A Parliament had been elected in 1715, under <lb/>
a law which gave it a duration of three years. <lb/>
Under that law it would have expired in 1718; <lb/>
yet in the year before its expiration a bill was <lb/>
brought in and became law which extended it <lb/>
to 1722, giving it a duration more than double <lb/>
that for which it had been elected. Surely, if <lb/>
ever there was an act which illustrates the <lb/>
power of Parliament, this was one. They were <lb/>
elected for a term, and before that term was <lb/>
completed, without any appeal to the people, <lb/>

<pb n="32" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0032.jpg"/>
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">32</fw>

they step in and double, and more than double, <lb/>
the term for which they had been elected; and <lb/>
that act, so passed, has continued ever since <lb/>
and is the law of the land at this moment in <lb/>
England. I could quote Blackstone and Coke, <lb/>
and other legal writers, coinciding in these <lb/>
views with Mr. Hallam; but let me ask your <lb/>
attention to the declarations of British states<lb break="no"/>men on this subject. Surely, if any two men <lb/>
could be found in the long line of British public <lb/>
men who more than others could be considered <lb/>
practical statesmen, these men are Mr. Pitt and <lb/>
Sir Robert Peel—the men who guided the des<lb break="no"/>tinies of England in times of great peril, and <lb/>
whose reputations are a source of pride to the <lb/>
country to which they belonged. During Mr. <lb/>
Pitt's administration, some gentlemen in oppo<lb break="no"/>sition propounded the doctrine which is em<lb break="no"/>bodied in the resolution now before the House. <lb/>
Mr. Pitt took issue upon the doctrine in these <lb/>
emphatic words:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"This point, sir, is of so much importance that I <lb/>
think I ought not to suffer the opportunity to pass <lb/>
without illustrating more fully what I mean. lf this <lb/>
principle of the incompetency of Parliament to the <lb/>
decision of the measure be admitted, or if it be con<lb break="no"/>tended that Parliament has no legitimate authority <lb/>
to discuss and decide upon it, you will be driven to <lb/>
the necessity of recognizing a principle the most <lb/>
dangerous that can ever be adopted in any civilized <lb/>
state—I mean the principle that Parliament cannot <lb/>
adopt any measure new in its nature and of great im<lb break="no"/>portance without appealing to the constituent and <lb/>
delegating authority for direction. If that doctrine <lb/>
be true, look to what an extent it will carry you. If <lb/>
such an argument could be set up and maintained, <lb/>
you acted without legislative authority when you <lb/>
created the representation of the Principality of <lb/>
Wales or of either of the Counties Palatine of Eng<lb break="no"/>land. Every law that Parliament ever made without <lb/>
that appeal - either as to its own frame and constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, as to the qualification of the electors or the <lb/>
elected, as to the great and fundamental point of the <lb/>
succession to the Crown - was a breach of treaty and <lb/>
an act or usurpation." <lb/></p> 

<p>"What must be said by those who have at any <lb/>
time been friends to any plan of Parliamentary Re<lb break="no"/>form, and particularly such as have been most recent<lb break="no"/>ly brought forward either in Great Britain or Ire<lb break="no"/>land. Whatever may have been thought of the <lb/>
propriety of the measure, I never heard any doubt <lb/>
of the competency of Parliament to consider and <lb/>
discuss it. Yet I defy any man to maintain the <lb/>
principle of those plans without contending that, <lb/>
as a member of Parliament, he possesses a right <lb/>
to concur in disfranchising those who sent <lb/>
him to Parliament, and to select others by whom he <lb/>
was not elected in their stead. I am sure that no suf<lb break="no"/>ficient distinction in point of principle can be success<lb break="no"/>fully maintained for a single moment, nor should I <lb/>
deem it necessary to dwell on this point in the man<lb break="no"/>ner that I do, were I not convinced that it is con<lb break="no"/>nected in part with all these false and dangerous no<lb break="no"/>tions on the subject of government which have late<lb break="no"/>ly becomes to prevalent in the world." <lb/></p></quote> 

<p>In 1846 Sir Robert Peel was called upon to <lb/>
deal with the question of the Corn Law, in a <lb/>
Parliament which had been elected in 1841. The <lb/>
subject of this law had been before the people <lb/>
at the elections, and, as far as the returns in<lb break="no"/>dicated, the people had sustained the law. Yet <lb/>
Sir Robert Peel had no hesitation, in the very <lb/>
teeth of this verdict, of introducing a bill which <lb/>
he felt was required by the circumstances of the <lb/>
country, and when taunted with the position he <lb/>
had assumed, he adopted and approved the doc<lb break="no"/>

<cb/> 

trine of his predecessor in words equally em<lb break="no"/>phatic:- <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"That, I think would have been a ' dangerous pre<lb break="no"/>cedent' for a minister to admit that the existing Le<lb break="no"/>gislature was incompetent to the entertainment of <lb/>
any question. That is a precedent which I would <lb/>
not estblish. Whatever may have been the circum<lb break="no"/>stances that may have taken place at an election, I <lb/>
never would sanction the view that any House of <lb/>
Commons is incompetent to entertain a measure that <lb/>
is necessary to the well-being of the community. If <lb/>
you were to admit that doctrine, you would shake the <lb/>
foundation on which many of the best laws are <lb/>
placed." <lb/></p></quote> 

<p>When, therefore, I find the philosopher in <lb/>
his closet, and the statesman in the cabinet, <lb/>
combined to reject the doctrine propounded in <lb/>
this Resolution, as unsuited to the genius of <lb/>
the British constitution—when I find the op<lb break="no"/>posite doctrine proclaimed and acted on—when <lb/>
I find a parliament elected for three years <lb/>
extending its life to seven—when I find <lb/>
a parliament excluding from one of its <lb/>
branches at one time the entire body of bis<lb break="no"/>hops—when I find even the succession to the <lb/>
throne changed from one dynasty to another <lb/>
—and all these acts of sovereignty performed <lb/>
without any pretences that Parliament had no <lb/>
right to do them without first appealing to the <lb/>
polls, I ask myself on what grounds the mover <lb/>
of this resolution can expect this house to de<lb break="no"/>clare as a fundamental doctrine of the consti<lb break="no"/>tution, one entirely alien to its genius and cha<lb break="no"/>racter—no man knows better than himself <lb/>
that it is so. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, sir, while I entirely contest the doc<lb break="no"/>trine of my hon. friend as to the necessity of <lb/>
appealing to the people, I do not pretend to <lb/>
say that the responsibility which devolves <lb/>
upon a member of this House is not one <lb/>
which should be exercised with great discre<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>:—Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName>.—I am glad to find this <lb/>
sentiment meet with the approval of the hon. <lb/>
member. But when he cheers my declaration <lb/>
that the question is one of discretion he gives <lb/>
up his whole case. He admits, as the member <lb/>
for Halifax admitted, that the house had the <lb/>
full power and right, and that the only ques<lb break="no"/>tion for consideration is this: Is the measure <lb/>
submitted to the house of such a character as <lb/>
to challenge approval? Is the change propos<lb break="no"/>ed to be made, demanded by the circumstances <lb/>
in which we are placed? Is it a measure <lb/>
which will contribute, to the real welfare of the <lb/>
people? On this ground I am prepared to <lb/>
meet him, and on this ground the battle should <lb/>
be fought. <lb/></p> 

<p>Before adverting to some of the arguments <lb/>
of the member for East Halifax, I must notice <lb/>
one or two observations of my hon. friend from <lb/>
Londonderry. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. gentleman has referred to a speech <lb/>
of mine made in Canada, and has quoted an <lb/>
observation in it in reference to the change of <lb/>
relations which Confederation would make, <lb/>
with a view to create the impression that I <lb/>
contemplated a change in our connection with <lb/>
the Mother Country. But surely my hon. <lb/>
friend could hardly wish me to suppose he <lb/>
could misunderstand the purport of these ob<lb break="no"/>servations. The change to which I referred <lb/>
was in our relations to each other. The rela<lb break="no"/>tions of the Confederated Provinces to the <lb/>

<pb n="33" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0033.jpg"/>
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">33</fw>

Mother Country will be the same, ay more in<lb break="no"/>timate and secure, than those which the separ<lb break="no"/>ate Provinces now hold to her. <lb/></p> 

<p>I don't know that I fully comprehend the <lb/>
purport of my hon friend's quotation from the <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Standard</hi>, but I understood it to be a censure <lb/>
upon the British Government for allowing the <lb/>
Reciprocity Treaty to drop, with a view to <lb/>
create a feeling in favour of Confederation, and <lb/>
that no effort was made on their part or on the <lb/>
part of Canada to renew it. I am surprised <lb/>
at such a statement being quoted in this house, <lb/>
where the facts are so well known. The treaty <lb/>
was not dropped by Great Britain; it was ter<lb break="no"/>minated by the positive act of the United <lb/>
States; and so far from Canada not having ex<lb break="no"/>erted herself to obtain a renewal of it, her pub<lb break="no"/>lic men went further with that object than the <lb/>
people of this country could defend. They were <lb/>
willing to enter into arrangements not secured <lb/>
by treaty, but dependent upon reciprocal legis<lb break="no"/>lation; and I consider it as fortunate, and I be<lb break="no"/>lieve the people of this country consider it for<lb break="no"/>tunate, that we escaped a position which was <lb/>
one of degrading subservience to the caprices <lb/>
of American legislators. I apprehend that if <lb/>
there was a mistake at all in these negocia<lb break="no"/>tions, it was on the part of the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and on the part of the Canadians to ex<lb break="no"/>hibit an anxiety for the renewal of the treaty <lb/>
so great that the authorities of the Union were <lb/>
led to believe we could not exist without it, <lb/>
and, that to keep us without it would <lb/>
dragoon us into a closer connection with <lb/>
themselves. We have lived and we have pros<lb break="no"/>pered without it, and having shewn the United <lb/>
tates that their trade, however important it <lb/>
may be, is not indispensable to us, we have <lb/>
laid the foundation for a renewal of the treaty <lb/>
upon equitable and fair terms. <lb/></p> 

<p>My hon . friend seems to have a great horror <lb/>
of a future national existence. I should like <lb/>
to ask him what he looks forward to in the <lb/>
future. Does he imagine that for all time to <lb/>
come these Provinces, which in 20 years hence <lb/>
will count 8 millions of people, and which <lb/>
within the life-time of many now born, will <lb/>
comprise a population larger than that of the <lb/>
British Isles; does he suppose that this enor<lb break="no"/>mous population is for all time to come <lb/>
to be governed from Downing street? Eighty <lb/>
years ago a country with a population less than <lb/>
we now possess, irritated at what it consider<lb break="no"/>ed oppressive exactions on the part of the Mo<lb break="no"/>ther Country, asserted and achieved its inde<lb break="no"/>pendence. That country has added to its <lb/>
population in a century more than England <lb/>
has since the Norman conquest. Does my <lb/>
hon friend imagine that by any possibility these <lb/>
States could have continued to this moment <lb/>
dependencies upon the country, from which <lb/>
they sprung. No sir; there is an infancy and <lb/>
a youth and a maturity in nations as there is <lb/>
in men, and while I yield to no man in my de<lb break="no"/>sire to retain the connection which we have <lb/>
with the Parent State, while I trust and hope <lb/>
that the day may be far distant when the ties <lb/>
that unite us may be severed, I cannot shut <lb/>
my eyes to the fact that in the future—how<lb break="no"/>ever distant that future may be —we shall <lb/>
have to assume the responsibilities of a sepe<lb break="no"/>rate national existence. When that. time <lb/>
shall come, it is the interest of Great Britain <lb/>
as it is our interest, that we should enter up<lb break="yes"/>and youth. <lb/>

<cb/>

on this change of position with institutions <lb/>
adapted to the new attitude we shall have to <lb/>
assume. That we should be able to continue <lb/>
as the friend and ally of England, the exist<lb break="no"/>ence which we began as her dependency. And <lb/>
that we should illustrate in the affectionate <lb/>
attachment we shall bear to the parent state, <lb/>
the result of the liberal and generous treatment <lb/>
which she has dealt out to us in our infancy <lb/></p> 

<p>I have asserted that I do not consider it con<lb break="no"/>stitutionally necessary to send this question to <lb/>
the polls. I do not mean to assert that it <lb/>
would not be exceedingly desirable to know <lb/>
the opinion of the people on the subject. But I <lb/>
can see no certain way of ascertaining that <lb/>
opinion. If this were the only subject upon <lb/>
which the people were asked to express their <lb/>
views, their verdict might be considered as an <lb/>
answer: but if there were an election to-mor<lb break="no"/>row, and if the present Government should be <lb/>
overthrown by the result, who is to analyze <lb/>
this result—who is to define what portion of <lb/>
the vote is against Confederation—what por<lb break="no"/>tion against the school system—how much of <lb/>
the result may be due to personal or political <lb/>
unpopularity. entirely independent of this <lb/>
question. <lb/></p> 

<p>But I am at a loss to understand the argu<lb break="no"/>ments of the hon. member for East Halifax. <lb/>
He asks in one breath for an appeal to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and in another sneers at it as useless. In <lb/>
Nova Scotia there is no appeal—the act of the <lb/>
Legislature is with him the act of a tyrannical <lb/>
majority. In New Brunswick there is an ap<lb break="no"/>peal—and the verdict passed at the polls <lb/>
with him the result of corruption.' Thirty-<lb break="yes"/>three men are returned in favor of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion to eight against it. If any verdict could <lb/>
be considered to express the unmistakable <lb/>
convictions of the people this would be it, and <lb/>
yet the hon. gentleman treats it with contempt! <lb/>
He says he will not. stay to inquire how this <lb/>
result was effected. This is not a hasty ex<lb break="no"/>pression in the heat of debate. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber has put his hand to this slander of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of New Brunswick in a solemn document <lb/>
subscribed by him in London, addressed to the <lb/>
Earl of Carnarvon. In referring to the first <lb/>
decision in New Brunswick adverse to Con<lb break="no"/>federation he says;— . <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"On the methods by which that decision was re<lb break="no"/>versed it is painful for a lover of freedom to dwell; <lb/>
but Your Lordship is aware that in Jeffreys time <lb/>
many a jury were induced to reverse their decision <lb/>
when threatened and brow-beaten by the court." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>What does this mysterious allusion mean? <lb/>
Has the hon. gentleman any distinct idea in <lb/>
his own mind what he does mean? One thing <lb/>
is very certain—it is impossible to please him. <lb/>
We have to choose between the tyranny of a <lb/>
majority and the tyranny of a Jeffreys. If we <lb/>
carry the Confederation in the Legislature, no <lb/>
language is to strong to express his disappro<lb break="no"/>val; if we carry it by an appeal to people, my <lb/>
honorable friend has such a holy horror of the <lb/>
result, that he will not stay to inquire how it <lb/>
was brought about. My honorable friend from <lb/>
Halifax has a great dread of corruption. A <lb/>
gentleman of high position in Canada— a man <lb/>
who stands perhaps second to none on this <lb/>
continent for personal character and integrity <lb/>
—a gentleman who had been for many long <lb/>
years the friend and political ally of the hon. <lb/>
member, undertook a year ago to compliment <lb/>
him upon his talents, and to suggest the pro<lb break="no"/>

priety of his applying them on a broader field, <lb/>
and forthwith the hon. member comes down <lb/>
here and informs the house that an attack had <lb/>
been made on his virgin purity, but that he <lb/>
had manfully resisted the assailant. Now he <lb/>
tells us, establish this and you will have play<lb break="no"/>ed in the Confederation, by the Government of <lb/>
the United States, the same game that they <lb/>
have been playing in Mexico. Now, sir. does <lb/>
it not occur to him that, if the United States <lb/>
have a game of this kind to play, they could <lb/>
not take a hand at any time more effectively <lb/>
than at this moment? It is their game to keep <lb/>
us isolated and apart—to foment jealousies be<lb break="no"/>tween the different colonies—to separate them <lb/>
by hostile tariffs-to induce the public men of <lb/>
one colony to slander and abuse those of ano<lb break="no"/>ther—to suggest the advantages of American <lb/>
connection, and to foretell to the people of this <lb/>
country that in ten years they will have a Pre<lb break="no"/>sident-and be under the Stars and Stripes. I <lb/>
say that if the American Government have <lb/>
money to spend for the purpose to which the <lb/>
hon. Member refers, and have the sagacity for <lb/>
which he gives them credit, is it too much to <lb/>
suppose that at they may take a deep interest in <lb/>
what is going on at this moment? The hon <lb/>
member undertakes to say that Confederation <lb/>
will weaken us. Is that the doctrine proclaim<lb break="no"/>ed by his allies in the United States? Mr. <lb/>
Banks has lately taken a great interest in our <lb/>
affairs; he has introduced into Congress a bill <lb/>
to provide for our admission into the United <lb/>
States. The advantages which this bill offers <lb/>
us are spoken of in very favorable terms by <lb/>
the representatives in England of the Anti-<lb break="yes"/>Confederates. Mr. Banks has studied the <lb/>
question from his own point of view. Let us <lb/>
see what he thinks of Confederation. In <lb/>
speaking to a resolution recently introduced <lb/>
by him into Congress, he said:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"A Bill had recently come before the House <lb/>
of Lords in England contemplating the establishment <lb/>
of an empire in the British North American Provin<lb break="no"/>ces, which might hereafter surpass in power that of <lb/>
England herself, or might equal that ot the United <lb/>
States. or, as has been wall said by its mover, might <lb/>
be second only to that. of Russia. The Legislature of <lb/>
Maine. more interested in the movement than any <lb/>
other State, had. through its Committee on Federal <lb/>
relatlons, made a report adverse to that project which <lb/>
report he would ask to have read to the House. The <lb/>
stage into which that bill had passed in the House <lb/>
of Lords was the most important of any of the stages <lb/>
through which bills pass as all its fundamental prin<lb break="no"/>ciples were in consideration. He did not doubt that the <lb/>
peopleof this country would look with intense solici<lb break="no"/>tude upon the progress of this great movement in the <lb/>
British Provinces, which contemplated the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of an empire, formed on monarchial principles. <lb/>
so framed as to control public opinion. and which <lb/>
could <hi rendition="simple:italic">not fait to have in the future a material if not <lb/>
a controlling influence and power over the affairs of <lb/>
the American Continent.</hi>" <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Can anybody misunderstand this? Mr. <lb/>
Banks has the sagacity to perceive that Con<lb break="no"/>federation is to confirm and establish our posi<lb break="no"/>tion on this continent. He sees that the true <lb/>
policy of. the United States—as indicated by <lb/>
the report of the Maine Comittee on Federal <lb/>
Relations—is to do just what the hon. member <lb/>
for Halifax is doing; and nobody will deplore <lb/>
the hon. gentleman's failure more than those of <lb/>
his American allies who have the sagacity to <lb/>
see how much his success would promote the <lb/>
interests and the policy of the United States. <lb/></p>

<cb/>

<p>Is there any gentleman in this House that <lb/>
supposes Mr. Banks would assume this position <lb/>
—would protest against Confederation—would <lb/>
ask his government to interfere impertinently <lb/>
in matters with which they have nothing to do <lb/>
—if he believed, as the member for Halifax <lb/>
asks this House to believe, that in ten years <lb/>
Confederation will place us under the American <lb/>
flag. If Mr. Banks thought this, instead of <lb/>
protesting against Confederation, he would do <lb/>
all he could to encourage it—instead of aiding <lb/>
the hon. member in his efforts at isolation he <lb/>
would cheer on us who take the opposite view <lb/>
as his friends and allies. <lb/></p> 

<p>But the hon member has called the attention <lb/>
of the house to the pecuniary disadvantages un<lb break="no"/>der which we shall enter the Union. He says <lb/>
that since 1863 the revenue of Nova Scotia has <lb/>
increased $351,822 a year, and still all we get <lb/>
back under the arrangements recently agreed <lb/>
to in London in addition to that which was se<lb break="no"/>cured for us by the Quebec scheme is $60,000 <lb/>
a year. The financial arguments addressed to <lb/>
to this house can hardly impose upon the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and are probably not intended to have that <lb/>
effect. <lb/></p> 

<p>I have not time this morning to verify the <lb/>
hon. gentleman's figures as to the increase of <lb/>
the revenue of Nova Scotia. I will assume <lb/>
that he is correct. But if Nova Scotia has gone <lb/>
ahead, have the other Provinces stood still? In <lb/>
l863 the revenue of Canada was $9 760,316 In <lb/>
1866 it was $12,432 748. so that while our reve<lb break="no"/>nue has increased by $351 822, that of Canada <lb/>
has increased by $2 662,432 <lb/></p> 

<p>Even our weaker sister, New Brunswick, has <lb/>
increased in equal proportion. Her revenue in <lb/>
in 1863 was...<hi rendition="simple:right">$0 899 991</hi><lb/>
While in 1866 it was...<hi rendition="simple:right"><hi rendition="simple:underline">1,212,021</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p>Which shows an increase of...<hi rendition="simple:right">$312,030</hi><lb/>
So that great as has been the increase of our <lb/>
Province, and we may well be proud of the evi<lb break="no"/>dence it affords of our country's prosperity, the <lb/>
increase of Canada and New Brunswick has <lb/>
been quite equal to our own. <lb/></p> 

<p>But not only do their revenues bear to ours a <lb/>
fair proportionate increase, but both Canada <lb/>
and New Brunswick. shew a larger comparative <lb/>
surplus, There remains to the credit of Nova <lb/>
Scotia, after meeting the expenditure of the year. <lb/>
a surplus of $60,000, while that of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick is $122.000, a quantity twice as much, and <lb/>
that of Canada, after paying the extraordinary <lb/> 
disbursements connected with the Fenian inva<lb break="no"/>sion, is $710,000, or over ten times that of Nova <lb/>
Scotia. <lb/></p> 

<p>But what becomes of our $351,000? Why, <lb/>
it goes into the same chest with the 2 1/2 millions <lb/>
of Canada—with the one third of a million of <lb/>
New Brunswick. It goes to make a common <lb/>
purse for common objects, and we have the <lb/>
same right to our fair share of that contribution, <lb/>
after it goes in as we should have had if it had <lb/>
never gone there. <lb/></p> 

<p>Not only shall we have a right, but we shall <lb/>
be inapositlon to assert that right. Nothing <lb/>

can be more inconsistent and contradictory <lb/>
than the arguments we meet with on this point. <lb/>
One set of men undertakes to tell us that we <lb/>
are victims to the political necessities of the <lb/>
Canadians. It is said that two great counties <lb/>
were separated by dissensions so incurable—by <lb/>
antagonisms so permanent, that finding it im<lb break="no"/>possible any longer to carry on Responsible <lb/>
Government they came down and asked us to <lb/>
join them to get them out of their difficulty. <lb/>
Then another set of men say that the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the Maritime Provinces are a mere <lb/>
handful. What can 34 representatives do in an <lb/>
assembly of 181? We are at the mercy of the <lb/>
Canadians who can do with us just what they <lb/>
think fit. These views can't both be true, and <lb/>
yet they are urged by people in almost the same <lb/>
breath. The hon. member for Halifax adopts <lb/>
one of them when he tells us that we have been <lb/>
wheedled by the Canadians into this Union; he <lb/>
adopts the other when he tells us that we are <lb/>
surrendering our funds hopelessly to the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral treasury. <lb/></p> 

<p>Sir, there are strong grounds of difference be<lb break="no"/>tween the people of the two Canadas. They <lb/>
differ in race, in language, in religion. Upper <lb/>
Canada is mainly Protestant—Lower Canada <lb/>
mainly Catholic. Upper Canada is Anglo-Sax<lb break="no"/>on—Lower Canada chiefly French. You have <lb/>
therefore differences permanent in their nature, <lb/>
and such as to create the elements of opposing <lb/>
parties. In religion, in origin, and in laws we <lb/>
have interests and feelings in common with the <lb/>
people of the West, whilst our geographical po<lb break="no"/>sition, our commercial pursuits, our industries, <lb/>
largely identify us with the people of East. We <lb/>
are therefore in a position in which we may le<lb break="no"/>gitimately choose between the two political par<lb break="no"/>ties that divide Canada—that one which we <lb/>
shall consider the best exponent of those princi<lb break="no"/>ples which are for the interest of our own peo<lb break="no"/>ple and of the people of the whole Confederacy. <lb/>
Need we fear that in Confederation the party <lb/>
which shall be supported by the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—which shall owe its power very largely <lb/>
to their adhesion—will be in a position to re<lb break="no"/>fuse to the Provinces whose aid is so essential <lb/>
to them any fair advantage which they are en<lb break="no"/>titled to ask? No, sir, I have no fears on that <lb/>
point. If there is any portion of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eracy which may be in a position to ask more <lb/>
than its fair share from the public funds, that <lb/>
portion is not either of the Canadas,—and we <lb/>
may rest assured that the Maritime Provinces <lb/>
will receive, as they will be in a position to de<lb break="no"/>mand, the most ample justice. More than what <lb/>
is fair and right, it would be a reflection on our <lb/>
character to suppose we should ask. Less then <lb/>
that, it would be a reflection on our patriotism, <lb/>
if we did not obtain. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, sir, let us see if this is not the actual <lb/>
state of this question. At the present moment <lb/>
the people of the two sections are courting our <lb/>
allegiance. The grounds upon which the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Upper Canada seek it are explained in the <lb/>
daily press. In the Quebec <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chronicle</hi> of <lb/>
the 8th inst., in the leader of that paper it is <lb/>
said:— <lb/></p>

<cb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"Beyond the Province and in the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment our course is a clear one. First of all we must <lb/>
form alliances which will tend to strengthen and pro<lb break="no"/>tect us in our local relations; and secondly, our in<lb break="no"/>terests, commercial as well as political, will lead us <lb/>
to co-operate with those whose interests are the same <lb/>
as our own. The Maritime Provinces have been to <lb/>
us a sort of <hi rendition="simple:italic">terra incognita</hi>, as we have been to them <lb/>
the result in both instances of paralysis of enterprise <lb/>
which is a marvel to foreigners, and can only be ex<lb break="no"/>plained by the narrowing influence of provincial iso<lb break="no"/>lation. We are glad to observe some faint symptoms <lb/>
of recovery from this abject condition, the glimmer<lb break="no"/>ing of an idea that we have neighbors with whom it <lb/>
may be desirable to hold communication by the great <lb/>
highway which Providence has given us for nothing, <lb/>
as well as by that other highway which we are about <lb/>
to build at the expense of twenty million dollars. <lb/>
These neighbors, who will count for one third under <lb/>
the new political system, are our natural allies. All <lb/>
our interests are the same. Whatever act of general <lb/>
legislation benefits or injures them, will have a like <lb/>
effect on us. Our great staple interests are the same, <lb/>
namely lumbering, and maritime, and we have a com<lb break="no"/>mon interest with them in promoting a system of go<lb break="no"/>vernment which shall maintain the authority of the <lb/>
general Legislature with respect to matters, which if <lb/>
left under local control, are apt to be managed in a <lb/>
way most detrimental to the commercial interests of <lb/>
the country. Our motives for forming such an alli<lb break="no"/>ance are of the most practical kind, as reflection may <lb/>
suggest, and as we shall more fully explain. They <lb/>
are motives which do not exclusively pertain to the <lb/>
English section. French and English are equally <lb/>
concerned, seeing it is commercial interests that are <lb/>
chiefly at stake." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>With these views actuating the people of the <lb/>
East—with an equal desire for our support in<lb break="no"/>fluencing the people of the West, is there a man <lb/>
in this house or in this country, who does not <lb/>
believe that we shall exercise in the general Le<lb break="no"/>gislature a just and fair influence, or who does <lb/>
believe that any part of the Federation will be <lb/>
in a position to oppress or injure us. <lb/></p> 

<p>But I understood the hon. member to say <lb/>
that all the advantage we gain from the London <lb/>
agreement over that made at Quebec is $60 000 <lb/>
a year. This is not the fact. By the original <lb/>
agreement a subsidy of 80 cents a head was to <lb/>
be granted to each Province of the Federation, <lb/>
but that subsidy was based on the population as <lb/>
it existed at the time of the census of 1861. <lb/>
Many persons have thought it was an injudi<lb break="no"/>cious arrangement to restrict the subsidy to the <lb/>
population of that year, and that it would have <lb/>
been better to allow it to increase until the popu<lb break="no"/>lation was ascertained at each decennial cen<lb break="no"/>sus. There are, however, good reasons why <lb/>
that should not be so, and whether these rea<lb break="no"/>sons are valid or not the arrangement as agreed <lb/>
upon was not unfavorable to this Province. <lb/>
The population of Canada West increases much <lb/>
more rapidly than our own. Suppose it to <lb/>
double in 20 years from 1861—that Province <lb/>
will then receive but 40 cents a head. The ad<lb break="no"/>dition to our population in the same period may <lb/>
be 50 per cent, and in that case man for man <lb/>
we should receive a considerably larger amount <lb/>
than Canada. By the arrangement at London <lb/>
this is still further increased in our favor. The <lb/>
subsidy, as regards the Canadas, still remains <lb/>
based on the population of 1861, while as re<lb break="no"/>gards the Maritime Provinces it increases with <lb/>
their population until it reaches 400,000. As <lb/>
regards Nova Scotia our rate of increase during <lb/>

the last decade was over 2 per cent. per annum <lb/>
This will give us in 1833; a population of 400,<lb break="no"/>000. In other words, it entitles us to 80 cents <lb/>
ahead on the additional 70,000 increase of po<lb break="no"/>pulation.</p>

<p>a year in addition to the amount we agreed for <lb/>
at Quebec. <lb/></p>

<p>This is a large sum annually added to the <lb/>
means placed at the disposal of the Local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. This addition may well justify the sup<lb break="no"/>port the gentlemen who may have thought the <lb/>
Quebec scheme defective in that particular. <lb/>
There was not one of your delegates who was <lb/>
not anxious to obtain for the Province the most <lb/>
favourable terms in his power; and it is but <lb/>
fair to the representatives of the larger Province <lb/>
to say that they met us in a spirit of generous <lb/>
consideration for the wants, and even to some <lb/>
extent, for the prejudices of this Province. <lb/></p>

<p>We are told that the change is not for the <lb/>
better. A different line of argument is adopted <lb/>
in Canada. Will the house listen to what Mr. <lb/>
Brown, the editor of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, and late Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council, says on, the subject:— <lb/></p>

<quote><p>"It appears that the delegates have agreed to in<lb break="no"/>crease the grants to all the Local Governments and <lb/>

<p>To Upper Canada, 85 1/2 cents per head. <lb/></p>

<p>To Lower Canada, 88 1/4 cents per head. <lb/></p>

<p>To Nova Scotia, $1.19 cents per head! <lb/></p>

<p>To New Brunswick, $1.47 cents per head!! <lb/></p>

<p>"And let it not be forgotten that the Quebec <lb/>
scheme was framed in 1864, shortly after the census <lb/>

took the census as the basis of the arrangement. But <lb/>

the relative numbers of the several Provinces are <lb/>
greatly altered. According to the present estimated <lb/>

<p>Now, sir, add to the $134,000 which we have <lb/>
have obtained by the new arrangement, $264,<lb break="no"/>000 we had before, and we have the sum of <lb/>
$398,000, which, with the revenues of our mines <lb/>
and Crown lands, constitutes the fund at the dis<lb break="no"/>posal of the local Legislature. With this rev<lb break="no"/>enue we shall be able to provide in a creditable <lb/>
manner for every local want. <lb/></p>

<p>If anybody had undertaken to say a few years <lb/>

it, at a time when we had only ninety miles of <lb/>
railway, and when to meet the emergency we <lb/>
were obliged to raise our advalorem duties 2 1/2 <lb/>
per cent, that we should be able by an addition<lb break="no"/>al 2 1/2 per cent. to secure the construction of a <lb/>
railroad to Pictou at a cost of over two millions <lb/>
of dollars; to extend the railway from Windsor <lb/>
to Annapolis; to secure the great international <lb/>
highway for which we have been struggling for <lb/>
the last twenty years; and that with all these <lb/>
secured to our people, we should be in a position <lb/>
to give a road grant equal to that which we gave <lb/>
when we went to our elections in 1863; to de<lb break="no"/>vote to education a sum nearly three times that <lb/>
which we granted to it in that year,—is there <lb/>
a member of this Legislature who would not <lb/>

have felt happy if he could have been sure such <lb/>
prediction would be accomplished, who would <lb/>
not have felt that such a position is one he <lb/>
should be proud to occupy? And yet we are <lb/>
gravely told that with all these advantages se<lb break="no"/>cured to us, the country is ruined. If this be <lb/>
ruin, we might agree to be ruined every day of <lb/>
the week. <lb/></p> 

<p>It is difficult to understand exactly what views <lb/>
the hon. member for Halifax holds as to the " Or<lb break="no"/>ganization of the Empire." At one time he <lb/>
talks of it as if it was not his scheme—but in the <lb/>
next breath he tells us his idea is, that this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince should be treated as Kent or Surrey or any <lb/>
other English county, and be entitled to have the <lb/>
privileges and be subject to the burdens of the <lb/>
Empire. <lb/></p> 

<p>Suppose it were, it would according <lb/>
to its population be entitled to about the <lb/>
same number of representatives in the <lb/>
Imperial Parliament which the anti-Confede<lb break="no"/>rates had in England at the recent session. <lb/>
I will assume that it could not furnish three <lb/>
abler or better men. Those three gentlemen <lb/>
have spent nine months in the single object of <lb/>
endeavouring to enlighten the members of Par<lb break="no"/>liament on the subject of their mission. They <lb/>
deluged them with pamphlets and communica<lb break="no"/>tions and had, we suppose, a very considerable <lb/>
number of personal interviews with leading <lb/>
statesmen. Yet what does the hon. member <lb/>
himself say was the result? Why that so little <lb/>
could these three gentlemen—with all their ta<lb break="no"/>lents and assiduity—interest the Parliament of <lb/>
England in the object of their mission, that <lb/>
when the destinies of this country were to be <lb/>
disposed of in the House of Lords, he says that <lb/>
only nine peers could be found to listen to the <lb/>
proceedings—and in the House of Commons the <lb/>
most unaccountable ignorance of the whole <lb/>
question was exhibited. And yet it is to a Par<lb break="no"/>liament exhibiting such carelessness and igno<lb break="no"/>rance that the hon. member and his friend in <lb/>
London would be willing to entrust the dearest <lb/>
rights of the people of this country. <lb/></p> 

<p>But there is one feature of the hon. member's <lb/>
argument that would surprise me—if anything <lb/>
coming from him now could give me surprise. <lb/>
Be says we have not received a guarantee for a <lb/>
sufficient sum to build the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way. Three millions of pounds, he says, is too <lb/>
small a sum, it will only land you in the wilder<lb break="no"/>ness with a road unfinished—and he gives as <lb/>
the foundation of his assertion his belief in a <lb/>
survey made by Mr. Fleming. <lb/></p> 

<p>Will it be believed that not two months ago <lb/>
this same gentleman subscribed his name to a <lb/>
sole document submitted to Lord Carnarvon <lb/>
in which he makes a statement directly oppo<lb break="no"/>site? Then he supposed the delegates were <lb/>
asking for four millions of pounds on the basis <lb/>
of Mr. Fleming's report. He forthwith stigma<lb break="no"/>tizes the report by which he now professes to <lb/>
be guided as "a most imperfect Canadian sur<lb break="no"/>vey," and intimates that four million pounds is <lb/>
far too much. <lb/></p> 

<p>There is something in this document so curi<lb break="no"/>ous tha I can't refrain from calling the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the House to it:—<lb/></p>

<cb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"The framers of the Quebec scheme expect the <lb/>
Chancellor of the Exchequer to go down to Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and ask for an advance of £4 000 000 for the <lb/>
construction of this road. Mr. Gladstone promised <lb/>
but £8 000,000." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Mark this. The hon. member charges us that <lb/>
we have secured an advance of £8,000,000 only, <lb/>
and yet he himself hurries to point out to Lord <lb/>
Carnarvon that £3,000,000 was the limit of the <lb/>
Imperial pledge. He warns Lord Carnarvon <lb/>
not to go beyond that sum, and yet he has the <lb/>
assurance to come here and blame us for not <lb/>
getting more. But that is not all. Let me go <lb/>
on with this precious document:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"The sum has been increased one-third on the <lb/>
faith of a most imperfect Canadian survey, with <lb/>
which Her Majesty's Government, that is to give the <lb/>
money, or the Maritime Provinces which are to pay <lb/>
the interest, have had nothing whatever to do. Four <lb/>
millions of money would build 16 iron-clads, or <lb/>
would furnish a million of breech loaders, which <lb/>
distributed over the Empire, would greatly strength<lb break="no"/>en it in every part. Is it likely that Parliament will <lb/>
vote such a sum unless the case be clear. The Chan<lb break="no"/>cellor of the Exchequer may be reasonably expected <lb/>
to prove— <lb/></p> 

<p>1. That a large sum is actually required. <lb/></p> 

<p>2. That the security of a sinking fund, which Mr. <lb/>
Gladstone demanded, but which Canada refused in <lb/>
1862, is to be given. <lb/></p> 

<p>3. That the interest is to be paid in fair propor<lb break="no"/>tions by the three provinces, and not by the Mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces alone. <lb/></p> 

<p>4. That Canada is so secure from invasion that <lb/>
the money will not be lost even should she be ever <lb/>
so honestly disposed to repay it. <lb/></p> 

<p>5. That so large a sum may not, in the altered cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances which we have to face, be very much <lb/>
better employed in the defence of the whole empire, <lb/>
than in giving facilities to a province which may be <lb/>
utterly unable to repay the money, or to protect the <lb/>
road when it is built." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Sir. I have read the whole of this document that <lb/>
the House and the country may understand what <lb/>
these gentlemen who style themselves the " People's <lb/>
Delegates" have been doing in England. Not con<lb break="no"/>tent with warning the Chancellor of the Exchequer <lb/>
to confine himself within the limits of the origi<lb break="no"/>nal pledge, they do all they can to show that <lb/>
it is unsafe to go even that far. They urge that <lb/>
the money might be better spent elsewhere; <lb/>
and they do what they can to disparage and <lb/>
discredit the character and reputation of the <lb/>
country. <lb/></p> 

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, when we call to mind the <lb/>
addresses we have so often heard from one of <lb/>
these gentlemen on the floors of this House on <lb/>
the subject of the Intercolonial Railway—when <lb/>
we remember the fervid eloquence with which <lb/>
he described the value of such a road in open<lb break="yes"/>up the resources of the great country behind us <lb/>
and in constituting a means of defence—when <lb/>
we recollect the letters which in 1862 the same <lb/>
gentleman addressed to the Secretary for the <lb/>
Colonies, pointing out the enormous saving in <lb/>
time of war which would result from the con<lb break="no"/>struction of this great work—and then read the <lb/>
document to which the House has just listened, <lb/>
it is difficult to believe that both are the produc<lb break="no"/>tions of the same hand. But bad as as all this <lb/>
is, it is almost worse to come here as <lb/>
the hon. member does, and after using every <lb/>
effort to prevent us getting any advance at <lb/>
all, charge on us as an offence that we have <lb/>
not secured something more. If we have got <lb/>
an advance, it has been in spite of all that <lb/>

<pb n="38" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0038.jpg"/>
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</hi></fw>

he and Mr. Howe could do to prevent it. If we <lb/>
have secured the Intercolonial Railroad, it is be<lb break="no"/>cause all the efforts of these gentlemen to dis<lb break="no"/>parage and discredit us in the opinion of Eng<lb break="no"/>lish statesmen have been powerless. <lb/></p> 

<p>But, Sir, if little attention was paid to this <lb/>
question in the Imperial Parliament, it was not <lb/>
because that body was indifferent to the meas<lb break="no"/>ure, but because there was no member of it who <lb/>
felt an interest in the success of these Colonies <lb/>
who was not persuaded that this measure would <lb/>
promote that success. Any opposition that was <lb/>
offered came from gentlemen who were never <lb/>
friends of the Colonies and who only speak of <lb/>
them as a burden and incumbrance to <lb/>
the parent country. <lb/></p> 

<p>I am able to bear testimony—and I am glad <lb/>
to do so—to the patriotic and statesmanlike <lb/>
views of the noble Marquis who formerly presi<lb break="no"/>ded over the government of this Province. If <lb/>
there was any gentleman in either branch of the <lb/>
Imperial Parliament who might be supposed <lb/>
inclined to yield a favorable ear to Mr. Howe's <lb/>
suggestions, that person was the Marquis of <lb/>
Normanby. While he was governor of Nova <lb/>
Scotia, Mr. Howe was for years his Prime Mi<lb break="no"/>nister, and enjoyed largely his confidence; but <lb/>
the noble lord, in an emergency in which his <lb/>
fellow Peers might be supposed to defer large<lb break="no"/>ly to his local information and experience rose <lb/>
superior to any personal ties between him and <lb/>
his former minister and friend, and warmly ad<lb break="no"/>vocated this measure as one that was essential <lb/>
to our prosperity and safety. <lb/></p> 

<p>I believe that is only by means of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion that we can prevent our Provinces from be<lb break="no"/>ing absorbed in the American Union. I have <lb/>
more faith in the opinions of the ally of the hon. <lb/>
member for East Halifax than I have in his own. <lb/>
I believe that by the establishment of a large <lb/>
country on this continent, within which labor <lb/>
shall be free and untaxed, we shall present a field <lb/>
for industry which will contrast most favourably <lb/>
with that other field alongside of us in which <lb/>
labor is pressed down by enormous taxation. <lb/>
See how that contrast is already apparent in cer<lb break="no"/>tain branches of business. In a report to Con<lb break="no"/>gress made by the Secretary to the Treasury, no <lb/>
longer ago than December last, he dwells upon <lb/>
the condition of the shipping interest of the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States. "Twenty years ago," he says, "it <lb/>
was anticipated that ere this the United States <lb/>
would be the first naval power in the world." <lb/>
Up to the time when the war interfered with <lb/>
their industry and taxes crippled their resources, <lb/>
this anticipation was being realized. In five <lb/>
years, however, that interest has enormously <lb/>
declined. The United States tonnage employ<lb break="no"/>ed in their foreign trade in 1860 was 6 millions. <lb/>
In five years it fell to 3 millions; while during <lb/>
the same period the tonnage of foreign vessels <lb/>
employed in that trade has run up from 2,363,<lb break="no"/>000 to 4,410,000 tons. <lb/></p> 

<p>Is it any wonder that this should be the case <lb/>
when on one side of the boundary line a ton of <lb/>
shipping costs $100, while it only costs $50 on <lb/>
the other. Cheap ships, cheaply manned and <lb/>

<cb/>

sailed, will continue to absorb more and more <lb/>
of the foreign trade of the United States. With<lb break="no"/>in their own borders, where they enjoy the mono<lb break="no"/>poly of the coasting trade, they may impose upon <lb/>
industry the burden of enormous freights, but <lb/>
where they come into competition with the <lb/>
foreigner, they must compete with cheap ships <lb/>
or quit the trade. <lb/></p> 

<p>As it is with shipping, so it will be with other <lb/>
industries, and the new Confederation may look <lb/>
forward to a future in which the growth and in<lb break="no"/>crease of every industrial pursuit will bring into <lb/>
play the vast and varied resources which are <lb/>
scattered profusely over the country. <lb/></p> 

<p>A brilliant prospect is before us, and when we <lb/>
shall have become a country with our sister co<lb break="no"/>lonies in the West, and have fairly entered on <lb/>
our new course, I believe there will be nothing <lb/>
at which some of those who now view the pros<lb break="no"/>pect with timidity or apprehension will be more <lb/>
amazed than at the recollection of the doubts <lb/>
and fears that they honestly entertained at this <lb/>
crisis of our history. The men who sit around <lb/>
these benches have a deep stake in the country. <lb/>
They represent not only the intelligence and <lb/>
public spirit—but they fairly represent the <lb/>
wealth and prosperity of the country. If in <lb/>
what they are now about to do they mistake the <lb/>
true interests of the country, they will themselves <lb/>
be the sufferers from the mistake. But there is <lb/>
a feeling dearer to a public man than any con<lb break="no"/>siderations of a material interest. It is the de<lb break="no"/>sire to enjoy the esteem and respect of those <lb/>
among whom his life is to be spent. If in the <lb/>
course we are now taking, we have misappre<lb break="no"/>hended the true interests of the country, if it <lb/>
shall turn out that the Confederation we advo<lb break="no"/>cate shall be what its opponents declare it will, <lb/>
we shall pay the penalty of our rash act by a life <lb/>
long exclusion from the esteem and respect of <lb/>
our fellow coutrymen. But, if it be otherwise— <lb/>
and if it shall turn out that we saw what was not <lb/>
only for the interests and prosperity, but what was <lb/>
absolutely necessary for the safety of the people, <lb/>
then we shall see that we have done right to fix <lb/>
our eyes steadily on what was for the permanent <lb/>
benefit of our common country, and to pursue it <lb/>
regardless of the temporary passions and preju<lb break="no"/>dices which may beset us. <lb/></p>

mind had been somewhat excited by a rumor <lb/>
that, by a despatch from the war authorities, <lb/>

exertions made by the people of the colonies, <lb/>
and the admirable spirit displayed by their <lb/>

warranted in asking for an increase of the aid <lb/>
usually granted for colonial protection. On <lb/></p>

<p>hearing the rumor referred to he had put him<lb break="no"/>self in commuication with the Lieutenant Go<lb break="no"/>vernor, and was now in a position to state that <lb/>
the despatch causing this surmise had only re<lb break="no"/>ference to one of the fortifications, in which <lb/>
some alterations were contemplated. <lb/></p> 

<p>The adjourned debate was resumed. <lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:centre"><hi rendition="simple:bold">Speech of Hon. Mr. Shannon.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SHAN2">Hon. Mr. SHANNON</persName> said:—It is rather the <lb/>
turn of gentlemen opposite to take up the ar<lb break="no"/>gument, but as no one appears ready to speak <lb/>
on that side I would like to say a few words <lb/>
on this question. I have been so much pleased <lb/>
during yesterday and to-day in listening to <lb/>
the statements made by gentlemen connected <lb/>
with the delegations, that I could have re<lb break="no"/>mained here fer hours listening to their <lb/>
speeches, and have been satisfied if I heard <lb/>
nothing more. But I happen to be one of <lb/>
those to whom the epithet "dumb dogs" <lb/>
was applied last year. The debate on that <lb/>
occasion had continued to so late an hour of <lb/>
the evening, that I did not think it advisable <lb/>
to say anything, but I found shortly after<lb break="no"/>wards that the Morning Chronicle referred to <lb/>
me as one of those who had been expected to <lb/>
deliver my sentiments but had not done so. <lb/>
And Mr. Howe also, in his addresses in the <lb/>
country, referred to what he called the inde<lb break="no"/>cent haste with which the resolutions were <lb/>
carried, stating that some of those who had <lb/>
been expected to speak had not uttered a word. <lb/>
I thought that my sentiments on this subject <lb/>
had been too well known to require that I <lb/>
should say a word, and I do not feel that I can <lb/>
add anything of value to what has already <lb/>
been uttered; but I am willing to say a few <lb/>
words to show that I am still as strongly in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of this great measure as ever. This is not <lb/>
the first time that I have spoken in favour of <lb/>
Union. As long ago as 1861 my vote was <lb/>
pledged to its support. Mr. Howe, the then <lb/>
Premier, in that year came down with a reso<lb break="no"/>lution which received the sanction of the <lb/>
house. On a subsequent occasion, 1863, when <lb/>
we were debating the question of the Interco<lb break="no"/>onial Railway, though my views differed <lb/>
somewhat from the then Government as to the <lb/>
mode in which the guarantee should be raised, <lb/>
thinking that our Province had been asked to <lb/>
pay too much, still I was in favor of the rail<lb break="no"/>road, and when Mr. Howe detailed in such <lb/>
eloquent terms the prospects rising before us, <lb/>
and when the hon. member for Yarmouth was <lb/>
so carried away as to be willing to vote for the <lb/>
Picteu railway. I then made a few remarks re<lb break="no"/>ferring to the Intercolonial line as uniting all <lb/>
the Provinces, and expressing the hope that it <lb/>
would give birth to that new nationality of <lb/>
which gentlemen opposite have shown them<lb break="no"/>seves to be so afraid. I then referred to my <lb/>
experience in the old country where colonists <lb/>
were treated with indifference, and I said <lb/>
then as I feel now that if we had a larger <lb/>
field we would not be treated with such con<lb break="no"/>tempt on the other side of the Atlantic. <lb/>
Again, in 1864, when the Provincial Secretary <lb/>
moved the resolution in reference to the dele<lb break="no"/>gation to Prince Edward Island, I endeavored <lb/>
to express clearly my view on the question, <lb/>
expressing my regret that matters were not <lb/>
in progress for the larger Union. In 1865, <lb/>
when the matter was again before us, I de<lb break="no"/>ivered my sentiments as well as I was able <lb/>

<cb/>

and at length, so that I need not have been <lb/>
charged last year with want of deference to <lb/>
the house, or with want of expression in my <lb/>
opinions. <lb/></p> 

<p>As I have already said, I feel as strongly upon <lb/>
this question as I ever did, and am determined <lb/>
to support the clause in the speech and to op<lb break="no"/>pose the amendment. And now what are the <lb/>
arguments which have been advanced? First <lb/>
of all, it is said that the gentlemen who were <lb/>
sent on the delegation exceeded their authority. <lb/>
After the debates of last year in which the most <lb/>
frantic appeals were made to members not to <lb/>
support the resolution for the delegation, be<lb break="no"/>cause the action of the House would bind the <lb/>
people and their posterity forever, and on the re<lb break="no"/>solution being carried, after Mr. Howe had used <lb/>
the same language throughout the country. I <lb/>
supposed that it would be fully understood that <lb/>
the action of the House was final: and I was <lb/>
much surprised to hear gentlemen making use <lb/>
of such an argument on this occasion. Then <lb/>
the hon. member spoke of the tyrannical mode <lb/>
in which the measure had been carried out. and <lb/>
said he could find no precedent for it until he <lb/>
went back to the history of ancient Rome, and <lb/>
compared the act of that Legislature to which <lb/>
we must all how to the tyranny of Nero. I <lb/>
think that such a remark, made among sub<lb break="no"/>jects of Her Majesty, in reference to such a <lb/>
Parliament might have been spared; and I <lb/>
may here ask if it has not been shown that <lb/>
every pains were taken, on the part of those <lb/>
opposed to the measure, to make members of <lb/>
the British Parliament acquainted with the <lb/>
whole subject? We see that in the House of <lb/>
Lords the matter was carefully debated. It <lb/>
has been said that on the third reading, when <lb/>
some discussion had arisen, a number of <lb/>
Peers went away; but we all know what the <lb/>
third reading of a bill is; we all know that the <lb/>
principle is discussed on the second reading, <lb/>
and on the second reading of this bill the House <lb/>
was fuller than it had been for a long time be<lb break="no"/>fore. And was there not one present who was <lb/>
well acquainted with Nova Scotia? If there <lb/>
was one who might have been expected tolend <lb/>
his assistance to Mr. Howe and the so called <lb/>
people's delegates, it would have been our for<lb break="no"/>mer Lieut-Governor, who was so much attach<lb break="no"/>ed to his old Premier; but I do not think a bet<lb break="no"/>ter speech could have been given in favour of <lb/>
the bill than that which Lord Normanby utter<lb break="no"/>ed. He well knew how parties ran in this coun<lb break="no"/>try; he understood the whole organization of <lb/>
society here, and knew that this measure was <lb/>
calculated to advance the best interests of the <lb/>
Province. What did that nobleman say to those <lb/>
gentlemen who professed to represent the peo<lb break="no"/>ple? He had some knowledge of petitions, and <lb/>
had come to the conclusion that they were prin<lb break="no"/>cipally the expression of the opinions of those <lb/>
gentlemen who got them up. I am somewhat <lb/>
acquainted with the petitions which came from <lb/>
my own constituency; I am aware that there <lb/>
are a number of mercantile men in the city op<lb break="no"/>posed to Confederation. and they put their <lb/>
names to the petition as a matter of course; but <lb/>

when those opposed to the measure went into <lb/>
the interior of the western part of the county, <lb/>
the number of signatures was small indeed. <lb/>
Although every effort was made, and men were <lb/>
hired to go down and obtain the names even of <lb/>
boys, whole sections refused to sign. Lord <lb/>
Normanby must have told Mr. Howe that it <lb/>
was no use to come before Parliament with such <lb/>
petitions, when a. great public measure was <lb/>
under consideration. <lb/></p> 

<p>The main point upon which the amendment <lb/>
is b ing pressed is that an appeal should be <lb/>
made to the people. I need not trouble the <lb/>
House with many arguments upon the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional question, because that has been ably <lb/>
handled by gentlemen who preceded me, and <lb/>
because the member for East Halifax has. to a <lb/>
great extent, given up the point in admitting the <lb/>
precedents. Mr. Archibald showed that when <lb/>
the British Parliament found it necessary to <lb/>
change the arrangements connected with the <lb/>
succession to the Crown and to bring in a new <lb/>
dynasty—when those noble men who guarded <lb/>
the rights of the country, and were determined <lb/>
to get rid of the Stuart family, had induced <lb/>
Parliament to adopt their views; there was no <lb/>
appeal to the people, although the leading men <lb/>
in the movement knew that their action might <lb/>
be made a ground of impeachment There was <lb/>
a Union consummated in the history of Eng<lb break="no"/>land to which I may refer, although it is not; <lb/>
exactly a precedent. I refer to the union of <lb/>
Scotland with England. It was hardly to be <lb/>
expected in that case that the lesser nation would <lb/>
have concurred. We all know the spirit of <lb/>
Scotchmen—how the ancestors of the men of <lb/>
that day had, with their backs to the unconque<lb break="no"/>rable highlands and their faces to the foe, repel<lb break="no"/>led the English invader on every occasion—and <lb/>
the same spirit led them to oppose the union <lb/>
with England. They feared, as our opponents <lb/>
profess to do, that the smaller state would he <lb/>
swamped by the greater—but what was the re<lb break="no"/>sult? From that day Scotland went on in the <lb/>
path of improvement, and Scotchmen could <lb/>
take their place with Englishmen in any part of <lb/>
the world. One gentleman some time ago <lb/>
styled the Scotch a race of paupers, but if they <lb/>
were. they found their way down to rich Eng<lb break="no"/>land, and wherever there was an outlet for in<lb break="no"/>tellect or industry Scotchmen were to be found <lb/>
availing themselves of the noble education <lb/>
which they had received and of the opportuni<lb break="no"/>ties of advancement which appeared. From the <lb/>
date of the union there has. not been a ministry <lb/>
in England in which Seotland has been unre<lb break="no"/>presented. When the East Indies were open<lb break="no"/>ed to enterprise Scotchmen predominated there; <lb/>
and at the present day Scotland is one of the <lb/>
most prosperous parts of Great Britain. This <lb/>
is, to some extent, a parallel case with ours ex<lb break="no"/>cepting that we will have far greater influence <lb/>
in the United Parliament and a higher position <lb/>
in every respect; and I feel that the result will <lb/>
be in our case still more satisfactory. If we look <lb/>
at what an appeal to the people really is, we <lb/>
will see that it is not in all cases satisfactory. <lb/>
There were two such appeals in New Bruns<lb break="no"/>

<cb/> 

wick. and the one neutralised the other. Who <lb/>
could tell which exhibited the real feeling of the <lb/>
people? In ancient history there is an instance <lb/>
in which an individual appealed from his sove<lb break="no"/>reign drunk to the same authority sober. <lb/>
When was New Brunswick sober? Was <lb/>
it when the Frenchmen were told that <lb/>
they were to be sent to Canada, and the most <lb/>
inflammatory appeals made? Or was it when <lb/>
the real enemy was gathering on the frontier. <lb/>
and the people saw it was necessary to be no <lb/>
longer isolated? Then came the strong Eng<lb break="no"/>lish feeling and the strong desire to maintain <lb/>
British connection, and the result was that a <lb/>
majority was returned in favour of Union. I <lb/>
would hardly ask, in reference to the great lead<lb break="no"/>er of the Opposition to Union, when he was in <lb/>
his sober senses, but I would ask when he was <lb/>
exercising his best judgment? Was it when, <lb/>
on former occasions, he spoke so eloquently in <lb/>
favour of Union—when he said he wished to <lb/>
visit Canada every year; or was it when, a dis<lb break="no"/>appointed man, no longer Premier—disappoint<lb break="no"/>ed even in going to Quebec, when others, to use <lb/>
a common phrase, had stolen his thunder, he. <lb/>
endeavored to arose hostility to all his former <lb/>
teachings? We have had read to us a state pa<lb break="no"/>per. called the case of the people, and setting <lb/>
forth the sentiments of Mr. Howe and his col<lb break="no"/>leagues. Can it be possible that this patriot, <lb/>
who was once willing to pledge our revenues to <lb/>
any extent to build the Intercolonial Railway, <lb/>
after his ambition was disappointed, was unwil <lb/>
ling that we should receive that boon? I was <lb/>
trained to consider Mr. Howe an able man,but <lb/>
not one whom it was safe to follow; and I can<lb break="no"/>not see how those who have been accustomed <lb/>
formerly almost to idolize him could now follow <lb/>
his teachings . As regards the prospects held <lb/>
out to us by Union, perhaps it is hardly right to <lb/>
bring them before this House on the present <lb/>
question, but the subject has been gone into <lb/>
and one of the delegates gave us a financial view <lb/>
of the matter. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member for East Halifax told us <lb/>
that it was impossible to remain as we are, and <lb/>
he expressed his preference to see Nova. Scotia <lb/>
as a county of England, like Kent or Surrey. I <lb/>
would agree to a large extent with that if it were <lb/>
possible, but we know well what the reslt would <lb/>
be. We would be obliged to bear our share of <lb/>
the burdens falling upon us as portions of the <lb/>
Brittsh Empire, and neither the gentlemen com: <lb/>
posing this Legislature nor the community out<lb break="no"/>side would be willing to enter into such a union. <lb/>
It would utterly pro trate all our energies to ',be <lb/>
placed under such a burden as that would cause, <lb/>
But the hon. gentleman went further, and said; <lb/>
that if we could not become an integral part of <lb/>
the Empire. rather than go to Canada, he would <lb/>
prefer Annexation to the "United States". I <lb/>
should like the people to understand this senti<lb break="no"/>ment as I cannot think that they have made up <lb/>
their minds to such an alternative. I think. <lb/>
they would prefer the advantages of Confedera <lb/>
tion to all the temptations held out by Mr. Banks <lb/>
It is common for the proprietors of newspapers <lb/>
in the United States on the eve of elections to <lb/>

<fw type="num">41</fw>

put at the head of their columns the motto and <lb/>
flag which represent their sentiments. I would <lb/>
advise the hon. gentleman to put at the head of <lb/>
his paper the motto; "The United States rather <lb/>
than Canada," and to hoist the Stars and Stripes <lb/>
as his banner and let the people know what the <lb/>
true issue is: Canada or the United States I <lb/>
am for Canada. In connection with this subject <lb/>
I may say that the only thing which I regret is <lb/>
the name by which the United Provinces are to <lb/>
be designated. I would have preferred <lb/>
the name British America. I feel convinced <lb/>
that under Confederation we are to have such <lb/>
advantages that even gentlemen opposed to it <lb/>
will have to acknowledge as Scotchmen after<lb break="no"/>wards did in relation to the union with Eng<lb break="no"/>land, that it was the making of the country. <lb/>
I see no ground for the assertion that we are <lb/>
to lose our liberties,—our laws will be as well <lb/>
administered as ever,—the local legislatures <lb/>
will have sufficient funds to meet the local <lb/>
exigencies, and we will enjoy every privilege <lb/>
which we had before. I am convinced that in <lb/>
this respect our people will hardly know the <lb/>
difference. <lb/></p> 

<p>One of my constituents said to me the other <lb/>
day, "What about this Confederation?" I said <lb/>
to him, "You live in the country; you will get <lb/>
up in the morning and attend to your work; <lb/>
the same money will be expended on the roads <lb/>
and bridges, your children will be educated, <lb/>
and you will never know the difference, except <lb/>
when you bring your wares to market you will <lb/>
get a double price for them." Mr. Bourinot <lb/>
told us the other day what Confederation would <lb/>
do for Cape Breton—that the people of that is<lb break="no"/>land will have markets they never had before, <lb/>
and justice will be done to Cape Breton. I <lb/>
believe the statement, and further, next to the <lb/>
county of Halifax, I believe that the county <lb/>
of Pictou will receive the largest benefit <lb/>
What is the case in that county? I have been <lb/>
the instrument, to some small extent already <lb/>
in bringing Canadian capital into that county <lb/>
and I believe its towns will be the scenes <lb/>
of busy industry. New Glasgow may have <lb/>
its tall factory chimneys, and be the Bir<lb break="no"/>mingham of the future Confederation. And <lb/>
what about Halifax and the great railway? <lb/>
I have only to read Mr. Howe's speeches for <lb/>
a description of what we are to have then. <lb/>
You may take any of the labouring men <lb/>
upon the streets of our city, and you will <lb/>
find that they understand the benefits that <lb/>
are to ensue,—men who came here with no <lb/>
capital but their industry, and who have ac<lb break="no"/>quired a competency among us—men whose <lb/>
children are being educated for any position <lb/>
to which they may aspire, and who are wil<lb break="no"/>ling to exert themselves to increase the pros<lb break="no"/>perity of the country. And as to our young <lb/>
men, what great advantages will not they <lb/>
receive? The hon. member for London<lb break="no"/>derry said he wished that we should remain <lb/>
as we are. I think we cannot do so, neither <lb/>
politically nor socially. Does he not know <lb/>
that, notwithstanding our progress, there is <lb/>
a constant depletion of our population ow<lb break="no"/>ing to our young men leaving us—that they <lb/>

<cb/>

are abandoning their country and going to <lb/>
the United States, and that we cannot re<lb break="no"/>tain them until Confederation is accomplish<lb break="no"/>ed? I mentioned on a former occasion the <lb/>
number of Nova Scotians who had left us, <lb/>
probably never to return. I want to stop <lb/>
this, and to try to get some of our exiles <lb/>
back, and I think we can do it in no other <lb/>
way. Even those among us who have ac<lb break="no"/>quired fortunes and desire to keep their <lb/>
means to themselves will find that their <lb/>
securities will be far more valuable hereaf<lb break="no"/>ter than now. Having made these remarks <lb/>
from a feeling that I should not allow the <lb/>
opportunity to pass in silence, I will now <lb/>
resume my seat. <lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:centre"><hi rendition="simple:bold">Speech of Mr. Coffin.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:COFF1">Mr. COFFIN</persName> said:—I did not intend to make <lb/>
any remarks upon this subject, but there are two <lb/>
or three matters upon which I wish to make a <lb/>
few observations; The hon. gentleman who just <lb/>
spoke referred to New Brunswick as having had <lb/>
two elections before the consummation of this <lb/>
measure; the only thing we are complaining of <lb/>
is that our government are passing upon it with<lb break="no"/>out giving the people an opportunity of consider<lb break="no"/>ing it at the polls; for I contend that previous <lb/>
to the last election no mention of the question <lb/>
was made to the electors. When the delegates <lb/>
returned from Quebec the leading men of New <lb/>
Brunswick finding that they could not command <lb/>
a majority in the Legislature, dissolved the <lb/>
House and appealed to the people, when a large <lb/>
majority was returned against them. Subse<lb break="no"/>quently a majority was returned in their favour, <lb/>
but the people of that Province have no reason <lb/>
to complain. In Nova Scotia the case was quite <lb/>
different,—the delegates, although the majority <lb/>
was against them, had not the manliness to go to <lb/>
the country. We only ask that the measure may <lb/>
be postponed till the proper time arrives for an <lb/>
election. If the measure were not then sustain<lb break="no"/>ed it might at some future period be ratified by <lb/>
the people and could then be carried by their <lb/>
consent. As it is, you are depriving the people <lb/>
of their constitution without allowing them to <lb/>
speak for themselves;—you are saying to them, <lb/>
' you are not fit to judge, we will take away <lb/>
your privileges and consign you to the care of <lb/>
other men without asking your opinion." This <lb/>
makes the people go into the new government <lb/>
dissatisfied. <lb/></p> 

<p>It has been stated here that Mr. Watkins told <lb/>
the House of Commons that the question had <lb/>
been before thc people, and had been preached at <lb/>
every hustings throughout Nova Scotia,—com<lb break="no"/>ing from such authority the statement was no <lb/>
doubt believed. I need scarcely ask whether the <lb/>
statement was true or not. But I must say I <lb/>
felt relieved at hearing it. I thought it a most <lb/>
arbitrary act on the part of the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to pass the bill without giving us the privi<lb break="no"/>ege of being heard, but this piece of information <lb/>
throws new light on the proceeding. I know <lb/>
not whether this information was given by the <lb/>

<pb n="42" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0042.jpg"/>
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">42</fw>

delegates or not—that is for them to say, and <lb/>
the responsibility rests on them. It has been <lb/>
said that the delegates obtained better terms for <lb/>
Nova Scotia at the recent Conference than were <lb/>
allowed, us before,--if such be the case the Op<lb break="no"/>position are entitled to the credit; if there had <lb/>
been no opposition we would have had the <lb/>
Quebec scheme. That scheme, however, al<lb break="no"/>lowed us certain privileges which we do not <lb/>
now possess. We were to have been al<lb break="no"/>lowed to raise a revenue by some other <lb/>
means than direct taxation, and that privilege <lb/>
has been taken from us. Last winter we had <lb/>
before us bill. which was to have put our min<lb break="no"/>ing, operations in such; a positiori that we would <lb/>
lose the power from that time of levying a tax on <lb/>
coal, but it was a hard bill to get through the <lb/>
House. its passage was not accomplished; but <lb/>
the delegates have effected the same purpose in <lb/>
 the conference at the other side of the water. <lb/>
In this connection I could not help thinking of <lb/>
another bill pressed upon us last year by Mr. <lb/>
Archibald; the bill to .impose an income tax. <lb/>
Thefriends of this bill were likewise unsuccess<lb break="no"/>ful. but perhaps they mean to,accomplish their <lb/>
purpose. by. leaving us without sufficient revenue <lb/>
to carry on the local departments. and by tak<lb break="no"/>ing from us all other means of obtaining a supply <lb/>
for the' treasury. As regards the allowance to <lb/>
be made to usby the.general government it is <lb/>
true some advantagc has been gained. But the <lb/>
day'is'not far distant when we may have a po<lb break="no"/>pulation of 400,000, and that population will go <lb/>
on increasing until bye-and.bye it will reach <lb/>
double that number, and yet we will receive no <lb/>
more money.: <lb/></p> 

<p>It may be said that in this respect Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia is served as the other Provinces are; but I <lb/>
think it would have been wise to have arranged <lb/>
a sliding scale, _whereby- the revenues could be <lb/>
raised in accordance with the increasing neces <lb/>
sify, We will find the arrangement a poor one <lb/>
indeed when our people number 800.000 or 1. <lb/>
000,000 and have so paltry a sum out of which <lb/>
to' meet the public wants. One of the delegates <lb/>
gave us,this afternoon some observations upon <lb/>
{he prosperity of Nova Scotia as regards her <lb/>
shipping, and the decrease of that of the United-<lb break="yes"/>States. We know that from the beginning <lb/>
of the war the shipping of that. country de<lb break="no"/>creased not only from privateering. but by ves<lb break="no"/>sels. being transferred to the British flag. I <lb/>
do not think that in the statistics that <lb/>
were given allowance was made for the ship<lb break="no"/>ping under the flags of foreign nations that <lb/>
will go back as soon as circumstances are <lb/>
favorable. Taking all these circumstances into <lb/>
consideration, I think that the prosperity of <lb/>
the American marine is not so small as it <lb/>
would seem. It is true that we can build two <lb/>
ships in Nova Scotia for one in the United <lb/>
States, but one of their ships when built is <lb/>
worth, two of ours. Taking, everything into <lb/>
consideration, I think it is apparent that the <lb/>
Union will be consummated- that we are to <lb/>
try a new state of things; but as I have al<lb break="no"/>ready said, I feel relieved at hearing that the <lb/> 
British Parliament acted under false informa<lb break="no"/>tion, and I am convinced that if the truth had <lb/>

<cb/>

been known an opportunity would have been <lb/>
allowed us of saying whether we consented or <lb/>
not to unite our fortunes with those of the <lb/>
other Provinces. <lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:bold"><hi rendition="simple:centre">Speech of Mr. Tobin.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TOBI2">Mr. TOBIN</persName> said:—I have so often spoken on <lb/>
on this question that I feel it is quite unne<lb break="no"/>cessary for me to address the House to-night <lb/>
at any great length. It will be remembered <lb/>
that when this subject was under discussion <lb/>
during the last session of the legislature I was <lb/>
so indisposed that on the last night when the <lb/>
division was taken I was scarcely able to ut<lb break="no"/>ter a word. While that subject was under <lb/>
discussion. neither the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment nor any supporter of the government <lb/>
knew which way I was gomg to vote. I have <lb/>
advocated, however this Union since I first <lb/>
entered public life. Indeed I have advocated <lb/>
it even before I had the honour of a seat in <lb/>
this House. I believe that I was mainly in<lb break="no"/>strumental to the bringing forward of the re<lb break="no"/>solution which was moved by Mr. Howe in. <lb/>
1861. At public meetings in this city, in Wind<lb break="no"/>sor, in Kentville, in Truro I have addressed <lb/>
large audiences, and received from them the <lb/>
kindest attention. After a fair discussion of <lb/>
this question, I have invariably found. the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this country in favour of Union. On <lb/>
every occasion when I came before the elec<lb break="no"/>tors ofthe city of Halifax and of the Western <lb/>
division, I advocated a- Union of the British <lb/>
American Provinces. 'I have been sustained <lb/>
at three elections—at two by large majorities. <lb/>
and at the lost without opposition. So far as I <lb/>
am personally concerned I assume all the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility of my position, and I advocate this <lb/>
Union because I believe it is for the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of British America. I believe that the <lb/>
time has come when we must enter on a new <lb/>
state of political relations with each other. <lb/>
Look at this House, today are we not actu<lb break="no"/>ally bursting our shell? Is there room for the <lb/>
hon. gentlemen who come here from the differ<lb break="no"/>ent counties? See how the desks are crowded <lb/>
into the lobby. Therefore, I say, we have out<lb break="no"/>grown our condition. and require expansion, <lb/>
We must do like the Massachusetts man: when <lb/>
the village becomes too large he emigrates to <lb/>
the West. We must look to the great West <lb/>
which opens and cultivate trade and <lb/>
intercourse with its people. <lb/></p> 

<p>We are taunted with endeavoring to take <lb/>
away the privileges of the people, and transfer <lb/>
them to Canada. What is the fact? We give <lb/>
 19,000 square miles, and get in return 400,000) <lb/>
square miles; If we transfer our revenue to <lb/>
Canada, shall we not have a share in her re<lb break="no"/>venue? All the revenues of. the Provinces <lb/>
are to be put into a. common treasury for the <lb/>
benefit of all. Each county of Nova Scotia <lb/>
now contributes to, and gets a share of the <lb/>
treasury of Nova. Scotia... In the same way <lb/>
each Province will contribute to, and obtain a <lb/>
share of. the general treasury of the Confeder<lb break="no"/>acy. What is the. first object to which. our <lb/>
common funds are contribute? It is the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway, which is going to bring <lb/>
the whole of the great West immediately into <lb/>
connection with us—to distribute merchandize <lb/>
from one end of the Cenfederacy to the other. <lb/>
Let me turn your attention in another direc<lb break="no"/>tion. Who are the men in thishouse who have <lb/>
voted to refer this question to the British Go<lb break="no"/>

<pb n="43" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0043.jpg"/>
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">43</fw>

vernment? Let. me just look across the floor, <lb/>
and whom do I see? An hon. gentleman re<lb break="no"/>presenting the great agricultural county of <lb/>
Kings—representing in himself wealth, intel<lb break="no"/>ligence, and ability. Let me look at Annapo<lb break="no"/>lis, and I find two members of that fine agri<lb break="no"/>cultural county also in favor of union. When <lb/>
I cast my eye down the list, I see gentlemen <lb/>
representing the great coal as well as the fish<lb break="no"/>ing interests of this province, all of them ar<lb break="no"/>rayed in support of this great measure of pro<lb break="no"/>gress. I find that only two counties, through <lb/>
their representatives, voted unanimously <lb/>
against the resolution of last winter. I confess <lb/>
that at one time, in order to put down agita<lb break="no"/>tion on this question, my judgment inclined <lb/>
me to go to the polls; but when I come to look at <lb/>
the position of things in this house, I feel I <lb/>
would be worse than the infallible juryman if <lb/>
1 expected to bring over thirty gentlemen <lb/>
to my opinion. <lb/></p> 

<p>I have listened attentively to the arguments <lb/>
offered to the house since the debate com<lb break="no"/>menced,and especially to those advanced by <lb/>
my hon. friend the member for East Ha<lb break="no"/>lifax, who was one of the "eople's Dele<lb break="no"/>gates," in company with a gentleman whose <lb/>
talents I admire and for whom I entertain tho <lb/>
highest respect. What view did that hon. <lb/>
member present of the constitutional aspect of <lb/>
this question? I think that the pleasant time <lb/>
he spent in Kew Garden and Bushy Park, or <lb/>
perhaps the omnibuses rolling down Piccadil<lb break="no"/>ly, must have driven all arguments out of his <lb/>
head. I think that my hon. friend might have <lb/>
availed himself of the opportunities within his <lb/>
reach in the great English metropolis, and <lb/>
searched out some precedents and authority <lb/>
for the course he wishes us to pursue. As re<lb break="no"/>spects my hon friend from Yarmouth, he is <lb/>
true to his text. He has always been opposed <lb/>
to railwa ys and all measures of progress; in <lb/>
point of fact, he thinks Yarmouth the hub of <lb/>
the Province, and that we should always be <lb/>
tieed to the old stage coach and move to the <lb/>
musical notes of the wooden axle. Now I <lb/>
think that the time has come to give up such <lb/>
antiquated notions; and I hope and trust the <lb/>
gentlemen who will be sent to represent the <lb/>
people at Ottawa—if that is the seat of govern<lb break="no"/>ment—will reflect the intelligence and ability <lb/>
of the country, and be in every way qualified <lb/>
to promote its best interests. <lb/></p> 

<p>There was another question to which my <lb/>
hon.friend alluded, and that was the "Orga<lb break="no"/>nization of the Empire" according to the pro<lb break="no"/>gramme issued by Mr. Howe. However high<lb break="no"/>ly I value that gentleman's opinion-however <lb/>
much I may esteem him I cannot help believ<lb break="no"/>ing that it is a scheme of an entirely impracti<lb break="no"/>cable character. Such is the opinion, indeed, <lb/>
of every public man and publicist everywhere <lb/>
who has given the subject the least considera<lb break="no"/>tion <lb/></p> 

<p>If there is one section of this Province more <lb/>
likely than another to be benefited by this <lb/>
Confederation, it is the city of Halifax. This <lb/>
must be the emporium. whence will be distri<lb break="no"/>buted over the Confederacy all the merchan<lb break="no"/>dize brought is to our shores. Trade must be <lb/>
developed to an infinite degree, labour will be <lb/>
developed, in fact all classes and interests will <lb/>
receive a valuable impulse. Our port will be <lb/>
filled with shipping. and our wharves and <lb/>
warehouses groan with the merchandize that <lb/>

<cb/>

will be required for the Confederation. I never <lb/>
could understand how certain persons in Ha<lb break="no"/>lifax have opposed the scheme of. Union. Per<lb break="no"/>haps l may stand almost alone in the profes<lb break="no"/>sion to which I belong. There are, a great <lb/>
many intelligent- merchants I know opposed to <lb/>
it, but I cannot understand the reasons that in<lb break="no"/>fluence them. No man is infallible, and some <lb/>
may not, take that broad and generous view <lb/>
of questions which men in a different position <lb/>
of life can and do take on subjects of this kind. <lb/>
There is another question to which I have often <lb/>
referred, and that is, the position of our young <lb/>
men. What is there to excite ambition among <lb/>
our young men in the existing condition or <lb/>
things? The avenues to employment are nar<lb break="no"/>row and confined. I regret to say that I know <lb/>
of many young men belonging to the respec<lb break="no"/>tive professions whose energies are paralyzed <lb/>
for want of sufficient employment, and of those <lb/>
objects of ambition which are open to them in <lb/>
other countries. <lb/></p> 

<p>An allusion having been made to the fran<lb break="no"/>chise law, I must say that that was an act <lb/>
passed in this Legislature from which I strong<lb break="no"/>ly dissented. I have labored not so much per<lb break="no"/>haps in public as other ways to have this ob<lb break="no"/>noxious measure repealed. I am still <lb/>
ous as ever to see it struck off the statute <lb/>
book; for I want the men who sent me here to <lb/>
passs upon my public acts during the past four <lb/>
years. <lb/></p> 

<p>Since the house adjourned last year I have <lb/>
had an opportunity of visiting Canada. I was <lb/>
at Ottawa when the Legislature was opened <lb/>
and when the Fenian excitement prévailed. I <lb/>
was also at Malone and along the line; but <lb/>
nothing gave me greater pleasure during my <lb/>
visit than the manner in which the Ottawa <lb/>
Parliament was opened. - I passed through <lb/>
Canada and looked- upon its fertile fields, its <lb/>
vast resources, and its great commerce—its <lb/>
hardy and thrifty population—its noble cities <lb/>
replete with energy and enterprize. <lb/></p> 

<p>It is only requisite for any one-: to pass <lb/>
through Canada to see thatlt it is a country with <lb/>
which we ought to be proud to form a close <lb/>
alliance. I passed into the United States and <lb/>
on my return I had the honor of meeting at <lb/>
Portland the Provincial Secretary and Mr. <lb/>
Archibald, and we had a very pleasant time <lb/>
as far as St. John, and then we went up to <lb/>
Fredericton, and whilst they were in com<lb break="no"/>munication With the members of the New <lb/>
Brunswick Government, I drove around the <lb/>
little capital of the sister Province. I was de<lb break="no"/>lighted to see so fine a country, such fine resi<lb break="no"/>dences, and so highly an intelligent people. <lb/>
Previous to going to the United States, .I had <lb/>
taken my passage in . the Cunard steam<lb break="no"/>er for the 19th of July, but had no idea that I <lb/>
would have had the honor of travelling in <lb/>
company with the delegates to England. It <lb/>
appears, however, that when I got on board l <lb/>
found four or five gentlemen from Nova Scotia <lb/>
and my hon. friend from East Halifax as well. <lb/>
We had a very pleasant passage across the <lb/>
Atlantic. I we ashore at Cork and passed <lb/>

<p>As regards the present question, I will take <lb/>

the whole responsibility of voting against <lb/>
this resolution. I must confess that I have a <lb/>
very high respect for the hon. gentleman <lb/>
who moved this resolution, but we ought <lb/>
not to put ourselves in the position of the <lb/>
people of New Brunswick. Suppose we car<lb break="no"/>ried that resolution, what spectacle would the <lb/>
house present? Suppose the people, through <lb/>
mistaken notions, and by the influence of the <lb/>
press, undertook to turn out the majority of <lb/>
their present representatives that are in favor <lb/>
of union, and suppose that in the course of <lb/>
eleven months they reversed their verdict, <lb/>
and sent their old friends to the wall, what a <lb/>
spectacle we would present to the world! If <lb/>
we voted for the amendment we would only <lb/>
stultify ourselves—make an exhibition of our<lb break="no"/>selves, that I trust for the sake of our self-res<lb break="no"/>pect we will never be guilty of. After the very <lb/>
able speech delivered by the Provincial Sec<lb break="no"/>retary, in which he reviewed the whole subject <lb/>
from its inception up to the present time, and <lb/>
presented the constitutional aspect so clearly <lb/>
and forcibly, that no man can fail to under<lb break="no"/>stand it; after the able and elaborate address <lb/>
of the hon. member for South Colchester, (Mr. <lb/>
Archibald), who is so well qualified to speak <lb/>
on this matter, I feel that it is altogether su<lb break="no"/>perfluous for me to say much on this question. <lb/>
Indeed these speeches must have fully convin<lb break="no"/>ced the house of the unconstitutionality of the <lb/>
course proposed by the hon. member for <lb/>
Guysboro, and of the false position in which <lb/>
the majority would place this Legislature if <lb/>
they supported his amendment. <lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:centre"><hi rendition="simple:bold">Speech of Mr. Annand.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName> said—As no other gentleman <lb/>
seems inclined to continue the debate, and hav<lb break="no"/>ing been frequently referred to by hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers opposite, in terms inviting reply, I feel <lb/>
that I would ill discharge my duty to my con<lb break="no"/>stituents and myself if I did not at once <lb/>
meet some of the arguments addressed to the <lb/>
house. And in so doing, allow me to refer to <lb/>
the last speaker first. The hon. member for <lb/>
West Halifax, Mr. Tobin, alluded to my so<lb break="no"/>journ in the mother country, and playfully <lb/>
suggested that my visits to Kew Gardens and <lb/>
Park, and dinners at the Star and Garter, had <lb/>
made me insensible to the force of the argu<lb break="no"/>ments in favor of the change in our institu<lb break="no"/>tions which he and his associates are so anxi<lb break="no"/>ous to accomplish. And in the same spirit <lb/>
I reply that I had the pleasure, besides <lb/>
seeing my hon. friend at those celebrated <lb/>
localities of meeting nearly all the Delegates <lb/>
in those classic gardens of Cremorne, and of <lb/>
visiting the hon. member himself at "Half-<lb break="yes"/>moon street"—a very suggestive name, but I <lb/>
hope not an appropriate one in regard to the <lb/>
hallucinations with which he appears afflict<lb break="no"/>ed, as to the rights of the people of this <lb/>
country upon the question now under consi<lb break="no"/>deration. The hon. member seems to think <lb/>
that after seven months' sojourn in the me<lb break="no"/>tropolis of the world, surrounded by elevating <lb/>
objects, and enjoying the society of the fore<lb break="no"/>most people in the universe, I should have <lb/>
come back with larger views, and prepared <lb/>
to support this scheme of Confederation. Sir, <lb/>
I did not go to England to enlarge my views, in <lb/>
presence of which this Canadian scheme dwarfs <lb/>
into insignificance; I did not go there to learn <lb/>
the doctrines which 1 hold respecting the Or<lb break="no"/>

<cb/> 

ganization of the Empire—to make the nation <lb/>
to which we all acknowledge a common alle<lb break="no"/>giance fearless of aggression, and invulnera<lb break="no"/>ble in Britain's vast domain. I had read up <lb/>
to that point years before, and although the <lb/>
proposition to make the Empire one and in<lb break="no"/>divisible may be ridiculed here, the time may <lb/>
come, and I venture to predict will come, <lb/>
when justice will be done to the few, perhaps <lb/>
the very few, who preferred the organization <lb/>
to the dismemberment of the Empire. Sir, <lb/>
we now belong to the greatest nation of these <lb/>
modern times, and what more do we require? <lb/>
Union with Canada—an insignificant portion <lb/>
of a confederacy of four millions of people, un<lb break="no"/>able to protect themselves from aggression <lb/>
and conquest? No; what we should aim at is <lb/>
the consolidation of the Empire—the elevation <lb/>
of the colonist to the same status as an Eng<lb break="no"/>lishman; and by giving us a voice in the great <lb/>
assembly of the nation, make every Nova <lb/>
Scotian feel, and every Englishman feel, too, <lb/>
that we are not inferiors but equals, and <lb/>
equally entitled with themselves to the honors <lb/>
and distinctions of the Crown. <lb/></p> 

<p>These were my feelings when I went to <lb/>
England, and they are my feelings now. I be<lb break="no"/>long to the greatest Confederacy the world <lb/>
ever saw—to England, with her fifty Colo<lb break="no"/>nies in every part of the globe—to a nation <lb/>
with two hundred and fifty millions of peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and London for our capital. Gentlemen <lb/>
opposite talk of the expense, of the taxation <lb/>
for defence, that would result from represen<lb break="no"/>tation in the Imperial Parliament. But have <lb/>
they ever thought of the enormous taxes we <lb/>
will have to pay when we are Confederated, <lb/>
when we will have to provide means to erect <lb/>
fortifications and support our own army and <lb/>
navy? It is right, sir, that we should pay <lb/>
such reasonable sum as we can afford for our <lb/>
defence. We must pay to somebody, and the <lb/>
question for us to consider is to whom that <lb/>
contribution should be made. We might pay <lb/>
to the United States, which is able to protect <lb/>
us, but this could only be done at the sacri<lb break="no"/>fice of our allegiance, and is therefore out of <lb/>
the question. We pay to Canada, but it is evi<lb break="no"/>dent that, with her long and exposed frontier <lb/>
she is unable to defend herself, and therefore <lb/>
is in no condition, even after the most lavish <lb/>
expenditure of money, to protect us. But I <lb/>
would pay to neither. I would pay to Eng<lb break="no"/>land—not pound for pound with the people of <lb/>
the British Islands, with their vast accumu<lb break="no"/>lations of property and concentration of <lb/>
wealth—but such sum as a comparatively <lb/>
poor country, with a sparse population, could <lb/>
afford to pay. With these views I visited the <lb/>
mother country; I cherish them still, and will <lb/>
continue to do so until they are crushed out by <lb/>
tyranny and oppression, in preference to those <lb/>
which are said to animate some gentlemen on <lb/>
these benches who favor Confederation as the <lb/>
readiest mode of annexing these Colonies to <lb/>
the United States. <lb/></p> 

<p>Our merchants have been referred to—and <lb/>
who more competent to judge of the merits <lb/>
of such a measure? Who more acute and <lb/>
more likely to arrive at a sound judgment? <lb/>
These men, by patient industry, have built <lb/>
up fortunes in the community, and what posi<lb break="no"/>tion have they taken in reference to this ques<lb break="no"/>tion? On the seaboard line of Halifax, from the <lb/>
Dockyard to Moren's wharf, not more than <lb/>

half a dozen can be found to support the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the Provinces. The wealth, the <lb/>
stamina, the bone and sinew of the country are <lb/>
against this scheme of Union. One hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man amused me by asking what was there <lb/>
among us to satisfy the ambition of our young <lb/>
men. What more will there be when we are <lb/>
confederated? Gentlemen talk as if Canada was <lb/>
a foreign country, and as if, at present, we <lb/>
could not go there and embark in any branch <lb/>
of business whenever it may suit us to do so. <lb/>
Is it not notorious that the young men of <lb/>
Canada are crossing by hundreds and thou<lb break="no"/>sands to the United States, in much larger <lb/>
numbers than from the seaboard Provinces? <lb/>
Our Province is too small now for some peo<lb break="no"/>ple, but I would like to know the country <lb/>
under the sun where men, with steady indus<lb break="no"/>try and strict economy, can more readily ac<lb break="no"/>quire independence. My hon. friend from <lb/>
West Halifax was a young man himself when <lb/>
he first came here, and the country would <lb/>
appear to have been large enough for him to <lb/>
acquire, in a comparatively short time, a hand<lb break="no"/>some fortune and a position which we all hope <lb/>
he may live long to enjoy. And if disposed, I <lb/>
could point to dozens of that gentleman's fel<lb break="no"/>low-countrymen, who at no distant period <lb/>
landed upon our shores, poor but industrious <lb/>
men, who have become wealthy, and who, with <lb/>
my hon. colleague, have no reason to complain <lb/>
that the country in which it was made was too <lb/>
small. <lb/></p> 

<p>Reference has been made to the franchise <lb/>
law, and I am not sorry it was made. I was <lb/>
one of the Government that introduced the <lb/>
bill, and Mr. Archibald and the Provincial <lb/>
Secretary, now colleagues, were the two an<lb break="no"/>tagonists who fought out the question in this <lb/>
Assembly. The former gentleman was then <lb/>
Attorney General,—he was the father of the <lb/>
bill,:—he pressed its acceptance upon the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, but I am willing to take my share <lb/>
of the responsibility attaching to a measure, <lb/>
which if bad the majority opposite have it in <lb/>
their power to repeal. If the franchise act is, <lb/>
as they say, distasteful, why not bring in a <lb/>
bill to repeal it? If such a bill were intro<lb break="no"/>duced I would allow the gentleman who ori<lb break="no"/>ginated the term "gutter men" and his new <lb/>
friend the Provincial Secretary to fight it <lb/>
out and would not oppose it. I am willing <lb/>
to try out this question upon the old fran<lb break="no"/>chise, and see if the majority of the men who <lb/>
returned this Assembly are or are not in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of Confederation. The gentleman who <lb/>
preceded me took passage to England in the <lb/>
same steamer as that in which I went. I en<lb break="no"/>joyed his society during the voyage, but did <lb/>
he visit England as his position entitled him <lb/>
to. He is a prominent supporter of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, perhaps the most influential in their <lb/>
ranks. He is beside a merchant of standing <lb/>
in the community, and to the shame of the <lb/>
Government be it told that neither he nor <lb/>
any other merchant was appointed on the <lb/>
delegation. Five lawyers and a doctor were <lb/>
selected to change the constitution of the <lb/>
Province. No one identified with the com<lb break="no"/>merce of the country, its fisheries or agricul<lb break="no"/>ture need apply—and the lawyers and the <lb/>
doctor had it all to themselves. My hon. <lb/>
friend has fully earned his position—and <lb/>
why, I ask, was he treated, as I know he was, <lb/>
first by the Government who ignored his <lb/>

<cb/>

claims when here, and then by the Delgates <lb/>
on the other side. We have heard of the fes<lb break="no"/>tivities at Stowe and other places, but who <lb/>
ever heard of that gentleman being included <lb/>
in the invitations? And if not, why not? I <lb/>
think that those gentleman having secured <lb/>
his support, the least they could have done <lb/>
was to have paid him that attention to which <lb/>
his talents and position fully entitled him. It <lb/>
has been asked, what position will we be in if <lb/>
we carrv this amendment? We will be <lb/>
situated just in this way: that while the result <lb/>
is trembling in the balance, before the bill is <lb/>
assented to by the Commons, we can telegraph <lb/>
across the Atlantic to say: " The Parliament <lb/>
of Nova Scotia have declared the right of the <lb/>
people to speak on the subject." When that <lb/>
message arrived all action would he stayed and <lb/>
the Imperial Government would await the de<lb break="no"/>liberate opinion of the people of this country. <lb/>
We will then have done justice to the men <lb/>
who sent us here—who did not give us au<lb break="no"/>thority to change the constitution, but to <lb/>
make laws under the constitution which we <lb/>
now enjoy. The hon. gentleman who spoke <lb/>
first this evening (Mr. Shannon) alluded to <lb/>
the union of Scotland and England as a case <lb/>
analogous to ours;—but let me point out one <lb/>
or two distinctions. England and Scotland <lb/>
had been at war for centuries, and they <lb/>
formed parts of the same island. Scotland <lb/>
gave England a King, she was without colo<lb break="no"/>nies, and by the offer to share the trade of the <lb/>
larger kingdom had every inducement to <lb/>
union with England. These were the argu<lb break="no"/>ments addressed to the Scottish mind, and we <lb/>
must all admit their force; but what has Ca<lb break="no"/>nada to offer us? Does she offer us addition<lb break="no"/>al trade with colonies from which we were <lb/>
previously excluded? Have we ever been at <lb/>
war with her? Are we part of the same is<lb break="no"/>land? And instead of our giving her king <lb/>
will she not lord it over us? Is her geogra<lb break="no"/>phical position like ours? Nature evidently <lb/>
formed the island, now England and Scot<lb break="no"/>land to be under one government, but with <lb/>
a narrow strip of land connecting the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces with Canada, in many places <lb/>
not more than twenty-six to thirty miles <lb/>
wide, is it not evident that geography pro<lb break="no"/>tests against the union of Provinces, whose <lb/>
railways and telegraphs in time of war could <lb/>
be severed in fifty places, and all communica<lb break="no"/>tion intercepted. We are asked to be united <lb/>
to a country which is frozen up five months in <lb/>
the year, which has no trade to offer us of <lb/>
which we cannot avail ourselves now. More <lb/>
than that, Scotland went into the union with <lb/>
the advantage in a pecuniary point of view, <lb/>
and we go into Confederation with the money <lb/>
part of the arrangement all in favour of Cana<lb break="no"/>da—so that the cases instead of being parallel, <lb/>
are entirely opposite. We being a maritime <lb/>
and consuming people, will consume, man for <lb/>
man, $3 for every $1 consumed by Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nadians, and more than even the better class <lb/>
of Upper Canadians. In the face of these facts <lb/>
I think the hon. gentleman has not shown that <lb/>
the measure is desirable from a commercial <lb/>
point of view, nor yet in relation to defence. <lb/>
Reference was also made to the banner which <lb/>
I should hereafter display. I am not prepared <lb/>
to elevate any banner but the one we now <lb/>
have. I prefer to remain as I am until a <lb/>
change is forced upon me. I am opposed to <lb/>

annexation to the United States as well as to <lb/>
union with Canada; but I think it may be eas<lb break="no"/>ily shown that every argument that can be <lb/>
found in favour of the smaller Confederation <lb/>
would apply with greater force to the larger. <lb/>
Let me, while upon this branch of the subject, <lb/>
read an extract from the case of the Maritime <lb/>
Provinces, and I will not shrink from defend<lb break="no"/>ing every line and word that that document <lb/>
contains:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"The terms offered to the Maritime Provinces are <lb/>
far more liberal than those grudgingly yielded by the <lb/>
Canadians. Let us contrast them. By Gen. Banks's <lb/>
bill Nova Scotia would at once secure free trade with <lb/>
thirty-four millions of people, whose markets are ac<lb break="no"/>cessible at all seasons, instead of with three millions, <lb/>
who are frozen up for half the year, and in summer <lb/>
can only be got at by a long tedious river navigation. <lb/>
They would participate in the American fishing <lb/>
bounties so long as these last. They would secure <lb/>
protection abroad, which the Canadians cannot give <lb/>
them. Capital would flow in from Boston and New <lb/>
York to work their mines and employ their water<lb break="no"/>power. Canada has none to spare. Turning from <lb/>
material to political interests, how would matters <lb/>
stand? Nova Scotia would enter the Union as a <lb/>
State clothed with the accustomed rights, and guard<lb break="no"/>ed by recognized securities. She would select her <lb/>
own governors, judges and senators, uncontrolled by <lb/>
any Federal authority. All these, by the Quebec <lb/>
scheme, are to be selected for her by the ruling par<lb break="no"/>ties at Ottawa; and, while she elected all her own <lb/>
state legislators and officers, the Supreme Court <lb/>
should protect her in case of collision or encroach<lb break="no"/>ment." * * * * * * * * <lb/></p> 

<p>"With all the temptations offered us at Washing<lb break="no"/>ton, we ask simply to be let alone, or we ask to be <lb/>
folded to our mother's bosom, and not cast out into <lb/>
the wilderness of untried experiments and political <lb/>
speculation. Nova Scotia says to England, as Ruth <lb/>
said to Naomi, "Where you go we will go; your <lb/>
people shall be our people. " This love and affection <lb/>
spring from a thousand sources that we need not lin<lb break="no"/>ger to describe, but which it would be a fatal mistake <lb/>
to suppose can ever be transferred. You cannot en<lb break="no"/>dorse our hearts or our allegiance over to the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians as you would a note of hand, or invest a village <lb/>
on the Ottawa with the historic interest and associa<lb break="no"/>tions that cluster around London." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>These lines were penned in London,—I en<lb break="no"/>dorse every word of them here and continue to <lb/>
avow that every material advantage offered by <lb/>
Confederation with Canada is offered to us with <lb/>
much greater inducement by Confederation <lb/>
with the United States. But I am opposed to <lb/>
both. I have never sat down to calculate the <lb/>
advantages. which annexation would bring to <lb/>
us. I never had any desire to do so, but have <lb/>
deliberately shrunk from the task, because I am <lb/>
too much attached to British institutions. I <lb/>
prefer the British form of government and will <lb/>
not yield it up until I am compelled, but I can<lb break="no"/>not shut my eyes to the commercial advantages <lb/>
of closer connection with the United States <lb/>
while my sympathies are all with England.— <lb/>
Mr. Shannon said that he disliked the name Ca<lb break="no"/>nada as applied to the new Dominion. In that <lb/>
particular he and I entirely agree, but it would <lb/>
not have done to have called it <hi rendition="simple:italic">British</hi> America, <lb/>
for the time is coming, owing to the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation scheme, when we will not be British, when <lb/>
we will be nothing but Americans. The change <lb/>
of the names of the Provinces shews that we are <lb/>
to be made a Colony of Canada, and I should <lb/>
like to hear some gentleman rise and reply on <lb/>
that branch of the question. But the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has defended the scheme prepared in <lb/>

<cb/>

England as superior to the scheme laid before <lb/>
us by the delegates to Quebec. It will be re<lb break="no"/>membered that the Quebec scheme left the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces concurrent jurisdiction in reference to <lb/>
the fisheries, but by the London arrangement <lb/>
the matter has been removed from the control <lb/>
of the local legislatures so that an agricultural <lb/>
country having no immediate interest in the <lb/>
fisheries and possessing a tonnage only equal to <lb/>
half that of Nova Scotia, is to control an inter<lb break="no"/>est deeply affecting the people of the four Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces. The government of Canada, <lb/>
in the hope of conciliating the American go<lb break="no"/>vernment, last year compelled us to give up our <lb/>
fisheries for the paltry consideration of 50 cents <lb/>
per ton while a tax of $2 per barrel was imposed <lb/>
upon our mackerel. What security have we <lb/>
that they will not surrender our entire interests <lb/>
in this particular to the Americans? And who <lb/>
can doubt that the agricultural counties in the <lb/>
rear with their large representation in the Con<lb break="no"/>federate Commons, will receive far more con<lb break="no"/>sideration than the seaside Provinces with their <lb/>
handful of members? <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member for South Colchester, Mr. <lb/>
Archibald, with singular inconsistency, says in <lb/>
one breath we must be a new nation, and in the <lb/>
next that our relations with the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try will not be changed by Confederation. I<lb/>
join issue with him upon both points. We want <lb/>
no new nationality. We are well enough as <lb/>
we are, and although I think it would have been <lb/>
wise to have legislatively united the Maritime <lb/>
Provinces in one Government under the Crown, <lb/>
I cannot concur with those who wish to make <lb/>
these Provinces independent of the Mother <lb/>
Country. <lb/></p> 

<p>We all know how the American Colonies were <lb/>
lost to England, which probably never would <lb/>
have happened had the sage advice of such <lb/>
men as Adam Smith been taken, and a voice <lb/>
given to the old Colonies in the imposition of <lb/>
taxes and the making of laws. These States <lb/>
would now have been a part of the British Em<lb break="no"/>pire, and that Empire would now be invincible <lb/>
against the entire universe. What power would <lb/>
dare to assail the Empire if these, the now two <lb/>
greatest nations in the world, were one. Our <lb/>
true policy I contend, and our duty as British <lb/>
subjects are not to dissever the Empire, but to <lb/>
share the fortunes of England, to cling to, and, <lb/>
if need be, to defend her. I differ entirely from <lb/>
those who advocate the dismemberment of the <lb/>
Empire, and I believe this Confederation <lb/>
scheme to be the beginning of the decline and <lb/>
fall of that great country of which we are all so <lb/>
fond. How long will the West Indies be re<lb break="no"/>tained when we are gone? And will not the cry <lb/>
then come up for new nationalities and indepen<lb break="no"/>dence from the Australian Colonies and the <lb/>
Cape. New Zealand and the smaller Colonies <lb/>
will catch the infection, and when all is gone <lb/>
this now powerful and noble Empire will be re<lb break="no"/>duced to two small islands. Against this fatal <lb/>
policy, the inevitable result as I believe of this <lb/>
Confederation scheme, I sincerely and solemnly <lb/>
protest. It is said that in twenty years our <lb/>

<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">47</fw>

population will be eight or ten millions, enough <lb/>
to maintain our independence as a nation, but <lb/>
we may be assured that by that time the popu <lb/>
lation of the United States, recruited from the <lb/>
old world, most of whom prefer to go there, will <lb/>
more likely be sixty-eight or eighty million, <lb/>
making the discrepancy between that country <lb/>
and ours greater instead of less than now. I <lb/>
repeat whatI said last night, that these Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces must belong to either England <lb/>
or the United States,—we cannot belong to <lb/>
Canada, nor can we form a new nation. You <lb/>
may call the Confederation, that is to be, mon<lb break="no"/>archical, with a Governor-General at its head, <lb/>
but it must become a Republic <lb/></p> 

<p>Look at the clause of the bill which refers to <lb/>
the appointment of Senators: 72 of them are to <lb/>
be created in one batch for life,—and what more <lb/>
likely than a dead lock between them and the <lb/>
House of Commons? And if so how is it to be <lb/>
overcome? I never was in favour of the Upper <lb/>
House being elective, as far as regards Nova <lb/>
Scotia, while our institutions were monarchical; <lb/>
but under Confederation I should say, by all <lb/>
means let them go out in rotation, so that that <lb/>
branch may be influenced by public opinion. <lb/>
Is it not evident that when the embryo republic <lb/>
is fairly in operation, if the local Legislatures, <lb/>
pressed by their various constituencies, should <lb/>
for instance, propose that the Lieut. Governor, <lb/>
instead of being nominated by the Governor-<lb break="yes"/>General, should be elected by the people—and I <lb/>
can fancy that such a proposal might be made <lb/>
—at its first meeting here, the conflict that <lb/>
would in such a case ensue between the various <lb/>
legislative bodies would result in serious collis<lb break="no"/>ion—perhaps smash the whole confederacy into <lb/>
pieces. Suppose a resolution were adopted de<lb break="no"/>claring that the senators should be elected—and <lb/>
I may here say that such a change would be a <lb/>
misfortune to some persons who have stood for <lb/>
a day on the hustings and only secured a hand<lb break="no"/>ful of votes—you will then be creating not a <lb/>
monarchy, but a republic—a poor imitation of <lb/>
that of Mexico, to be crumpled up whenever <lb/>
the American eagle chooses to grasp it in its <lb/>
talons. <lb/></p> 

<p>Our relations with England will not, we are <lb/>
told, be changed by Confederation. Were that <lb/>
statement correct, half my objections would be <lb/>
removed. But what are the facts? At the <lb/>
present moment the humblest Nova Scotian, the <lb/>
poorest man in the land, if he has a grievance <lb/>
to redress, if he has received injustice at the <lb/>
hands of the local government, has the privi<lb break="no"/>lege of appeal and laying his complaint at the <lb/>
foot of the throne. That is the position now. <lb/>
But the moment the Confederation Bill becomes <lb/>
law, all communication between the people of <lb/>
Nova Scotia and the Home Government will be <lb/>
effectually cut off, and instead of appealing to <lb/>
his Queen at Windsor, he will have to go cap in <lb/>
hand to the Governor General at Ottawa. We <lb/>
are now a colony of Great Britain, but under <lb/>
Confederation we will be a dependency of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. And yet the learned member for Col<lb break="no"/>chester says our position in relation to England <lb/>
will be the same! <lb/>

<cb/>

The hon. gentleman referred to a remark <lb/>
made by me last evening, respecting a tyranni<lb break="no"/>cal majority, and commented on the apparent <lb/>
inconsistency of an observation in reference to <lb/>
the mode in which Confederation was carried <lb/>
in the neighbouring Province. How was the <lb/>
measure carried there? Mr. Tilley, man like <lb/>
as he always is, appealed to the people and was <lb/>
defeated. I give him credit for the ingenuity <lb/>
by which he converted a minority into a majo<lb break="no"/>rity, but I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that <lb/>
but for the unconstitutional action of the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor, who browbeat the Council by whom he was <lb/>
surrounded, using the Queen's name unfairly, <lb/>
taking advantage of Fenian threats, holding out <lb/>
the idea that Confederation was the only means <lb/>
of procuring the Intercolonial Railway, the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure on which would make everybody rich, <lb/>
and make New Brunswick a great country,— <lb/>
only for these influences, even Mr. Tilley's <lb/>
clever strategy and perseverance would have <lb/>
failed. The history of that period has yet to be <lb/>
written, but I do not hesitate to say that if New <lb/>
Brunswick had not been operated upon in a way <lb/>
anything but creditable to the chief actors in <lb/>
that Province, I do not believe that the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion of last session would have been adopted. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member for South Colchester re<lb break="no"/>marked that if ever there was a period when <lb/>
the Americans had an opportunity of coming <lb/>
in and buying up the Provinces it was the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time, when we are on the eve of an elec<lb break="no"/>tion. I can fancy an easier mode than by go<lb break="no"/>ing to the polls to corrupt the country. It <lb/>
might, perhaps, be easier to buy a majority of <lb/>
this House in favour of Confederation than to <lb/>
purchase a majority of the electors; and when <lb/>
the time comes, if it should ever come, for buy<lb break="no"/>ing up not only this Province, but the entire <lb/>
Confederacy a very different system will be <lb/>
pursued from that which the hon. gentleman <lb/>
suggests—it is so much easier buying wholesale <lb/>
than by retail. <lb/></p> 

<p>American diplomatists, with their ingenuity <lb/>
and with the large means of corruption in their <lb/>
hands, will say, "Come in and enjoy fellowship <lb/>
with us. You are only four millions of people, <lb/>
we are thirty-four millions. Come and have <lb/>
free trade with us; we are your natural custom<lb break="no"/>ers; there are no markets like ours. Our taxa<lb break="no"/>tion is enormous, but in ten years it will be re<lb break="no"/>duced one half; and the increase of our popula<lb break="no"/>tion in twenty years will extinguish it altoge<lb break="no"/>ther." That is the way in which these Colo<lb break="no"/>nies may be dealt with when confederated; and <lb/>
this may be a good reason why the name Cana<lb break="no"/>da has been substituted for that of British Ame<lb break="no"/>rica. Mr. Archibald referred to Governor <lb/>
Banks—our ally, as he is pleased to term him. <lb/>
Is Mr. Banks in favor of the organization of the <lb/>
Empire? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName>.—The hon. member is alone <lb/>
upon that question. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName>.—Even if I was, I would not be <lb/>
discouraged. It is not the first time I was in a <lb/>
minority of one, and I had not to wait long be<lb break="no"/>fore the friends who left me for the moment <lb/>
were forced to admit that I was right. I was in <lb/>

a minority of one—I stood alone—at a celebrat<lb break="no"/>ed meeting last winter at which that hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman was present, and if my advice had been <lb/>
taken, as it ought to have been, it would not <lb/>
have been in the power of the authorities on <lb/>
both sides of the water to say that the leaders of <lb/>
the Opposition, as well as the leaders of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment were all in favor of Confederation. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member took exception to my cal<lb break="no"/>culations and referred to the Hon. George Brown <lb/>
as a great authority. I admit the authority. <lb/>
That gentleman is one of the ablest public men <lb/>
in Canada, and is rarely wrong on questions of <lb/>
finance, nor is he far wrong in the figures refer<lb break="no"/>red to although there is an error of $13,829, the <lb/>
total amount we are to receive being $380,000 <lb/>
instead of $393,829 as stated in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, when <lb/>
our population reaches 400,000. But the hon. <lb/>
member for Colchester is, or was, a great autho<lb break="no"/>rity on finance. The Provincial Secretary, his <lb/>
former opponent, but now his leader, dubbed <lb/>
him the "Figure Man" of the late Government— <lb/>
that gentleman is very dexterous in boxing <lb/>
figures, to borrow an expression from the other <lb/>
side, but, somehow or other, he is rarely right <lb/>
in his calculations. The Financial Secretary <lb/>
will remember the gloomy forebodings of the <lb/>
hon. member for South Colchester in 1865 and <lb/>
1866,—that we were on the eve of a financial <lb/>
crisis —and his confident and reiterated predic<lb break="no"/>tions that there would be a large falling off in the <lb/>
revenue in both those years, notwithstanding <lb/>
which the revenue has largely increased in both <lb/>
of them and our financial position materially <lb/>
improved,—and I am glad of it. <lb/></p> 

<p>We hear a good deal about able financiers, <lb/>
but in most cases the men who earn that name <lb/>
are those who can convert a deficit into a sur<lb break="no"/>plus—the Galts and men of that stamp—who <lb/>
boast of an increase of revenue over expendi<lb break="no"/>ture when the credit of the country is at its lowest <lb/>
ebb, and the Government is forced to borrow <lb/>
money at ruinous rates of interest. The hon. <lb/>
member for Colchester has favored us with a <lb/>
long array of figures from the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, in <lb/>
which it is attempted to be shown that the Ma<lb break="no"/>ritime Provinces have received more than their <lb/>
share of money, and Canada far less, by the <lb/>
change in the financial arrangements. The <lb/>
calculation of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> is ingenious, and may <lb/>
have its effect in Canada, in incensing the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of that Province against the Government to <lb/>
which Mr. Brown is determinedly opposed, but <lb/>
it can hardly impose upon any one in this coun<lb break="no"/>try. The papers on the table show that our <lb/>
Customs revenue alone increased $372,000 since <lb/>
1863, the year selected as the basis of the <lb/>
amount to be paid for the support of the local <lb/>
Governments. That amount has been expend<lb break="no"/>ed in enlarging our humane establishments, <lb/>
upon education, roads and bridges, ferries, &amp;c. <lb/>
Where would the $372,000 have gone if we <lb/>
were that year confederated with Canada?— <lb/>
Where but into the Canadian treasury, and so <lb/>
with every increase of revenue in all time to <lb/>
come. I know it will be said that our surplus <lb/>
revenue will form a " common fund." True, <lb/>
the fund may be common, but the question for <lb/>

<cb/>

us to ask ourselves is: How much are we to <lb/>
get back when the money is in the Federal <lb/>
chest, for local purposes? It is vain to deceive <lb/>
ourselves on this point—the Confederation Bill <lb/>
settles the question. <lb/></p> 

<p>Whatever may be our wants and necessities, <lb/>
every farthing required for local purposes over <lb/>
and above the 80 cents a head and the $60,000 a <lb/>
year, must be raised by direct taxation, and by <lb/>
direct taxation alone. My hon friend from <lb/>
Shelburne referred this evening to the coal <lb/>
mines, upon which we might, if severely press<lb break="no"/>ed, have raised additional revenue, but even <lb/>
that privilege accorded by the Quebec scheme, <lb/>
of imposing an export duty, has been taken <lb/>
away from the local and handed over to the ge<lb break="no"/>neral government. We give Canada the power <lb/>
to tax one of our chief exports; and we are <lb/>
then asked to be thankful for a few cents addi<lb break="no"/>tional per head. Let me give the member for <lb/>
South Colchester another calculation, one to <lb/>
which I challenge a reply. I am now address<lb break="no"/>ing myself to the people of this country, who, if <lb/>
not familiar with the teachings of Hallam and <lb/>
Blackstone and other constitutional authorities, <lb/>
which have been quoted against their liberties, <lb/>
well understand transactions in money in which <lb/>
their pecuniary interests are involved. <lb/></p> 

<p>Last year we gave in round numbers $800,000 <lb/>
for local purposes—mark, for strictly local pur<lb break="no"/>poses. Now let us see what we are to receive <lb/>
under Confederation:— <lb/></p>

<row><cell>And first, there is the 80 cents a head,</cell><cell><hi rendition="simple:right">$264,686</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>And we have a total revenue of</cell><cell><hi rendition="simple:right">$535,000</hi></cell></row>

<p>with which to pay $800,000, the sum appropria<lb break="no"/>ted for local objects last year, showing a defi<lb break="no"/>ciency of $265,000 the very first year, and be<lb break="no"/>fore the high tariff of Canada, the stamp duties, <lb/>
the newspaper tax, and the other ingenious ex<lb break="no"/>pedients for raising money are brought into ope<lb break="no"/>ration. I have said that the total revenue from <lb/>
all sources will be $535,000. Let us see how <lb/>
far this would go towards the local expenses of <lb/>
the country. We last year granted— <lb/></p>

<p>Here, then, we have four items absorbing the <lb/>
entire revenue you will have under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, leaving unprovided for the following serv<lb break="no"/>ices, which were last year estimated to cost— <lb/>

$46,631; navigation securities, $80,000; mak<lb break="no"/>ing a total of $187,796, besides salaries, coroners <lb/>
inquests, public printing, &amp;c. This enormous <lb/>
deficiency can only be made up in one way—in <lb/>
the way pointed out in the bill—in the way des<lb break="no"/>cribed by the hon member's own authority—the <lb/>
Hon. George Brown himself—by direct taxation <lb/>
on the people of this country. In the face of <lb/>
these facts—and I challenge their investigation <lb/>
—an attempt is made to influence the house by <lb/>
quoting some paltry figures from an article in <lb/>
the Globe, which, after making a show of oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to the financial arrangements, finishes off <lb/>
with a declaration that "with all these faults we <lb/>
like the scheme." <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member has spoken in contemptu<lb break="no"/>ous terms of our "foreign allies ". Sir, we have <lb/>
no allies but the people of this country, whose <lb/>
"upturned faces" he has ridiculed, and whose <lb/>
wishes he has the hardihood to despise. But it <lb/>
ill becomes that gentleman, so lately in very <lb/>
questionable company, to lecture us upon our <lb/>
allies. Who, when in London a few weeks ago, <lb/>
were his friends and confreres? In what re<lb break="no"/>spect is Mr. Cartier, the Attorney General for <lb/>
Canada East, who shouldered his musket and <lb/>
afterwards ran away, when Lower Canada was <lb/>
in rebellion in 1838 a better man than Mr. <lb/>
Banks? Then there is D'Arcy McGee, of cab<lb break="no"/>bage garden notoriety; Galt, who headed an an<lb break="no"/>nexation movement in Montreal, when the Par<lb break="no"/>liament buildings were burnt down and the <lb/>
Queen's Representative was pelted through the <lb/>
streets. Another delegate is a born Yankee: <lb/>
the fourth is said to be looking to Washington; <lb/>
and the fifth, the chief scribe at the Quebec <lb/>
Conference, opposed the Union of the Provinces <lb/>
two or three years ago, because, in his then opi<lb break="no"/>nion, it would lead to separation from the mo<lb break="no"/>ther-country. These are the allies, the sworn <lb/>
bosom friends of the hon member, who has <lb/>
dared to more than insinuate that my friend <lb/>
Mr. Howe and myself were in league with for<lb break="no"/>eign allies and endeavouring to subvert British <lb/>
institutions. The hon. member has sneeringly <lb/>
said that my leader, Mr. Howe, and my follow<lb break="no"/>er, Mr. McDonald, spent months in London en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to convince the British public. I <lb/>
reply to that gentleman, who was once a re<lb break="no"/>spected leader himself, but is now the humble <lb/>
follower of the Provincial Secretary, that we <lb/>
did largely influence the public mind and shake <lb/>
confidence in the Confederation scheme; and I <lb/>
had it from the lips of gentlemen in England, <lb/>
who did not share our opinions, that we had <lb/>
done much to educate the British public in re<lb break="no"/>spect to the position, resources and rights of <lb/>
these Maritime Provinces. We may not have <lb/>
succeeded in reaching the hearts of the Lords, <lb/>
for it was not to be expected that we would to <lb/>
any large extent operate upon the sympathies <lb/>
of a body so far removed from popular influ<lb break="no"/>ences. We may not have succeeded in reach<lb break="no"/>ing the convictions of a majority of the Com<lb break="no"/>mons, but what opportunity had we? As every <lb/>
one knows, until Parliament meets, very few of <lb/>
the members are in town—they are scattered all <lb/>
over the country. We sent in our case to Earl <lb/> 

<cb/>

Carnarvon, but when the bill was read a first <lb/>
time the correspondence was not on the table, <lb/>
and the Queen only had the bill submitted to <lb/>
her the day before it was introduced. <lb/></p> 

<p>As I have said, on the third reading in the <lb/>
Lords, a large number of Peers withdrew, leav<lb break="no"/>ing only nine present, when one noble Lord <lb/>
had finished urging our case. Then it was sent <lb/>
to the Commons, and read a second time on the <lb/>
following day, contrary to the practice which <lb/>
has always prevailed there of giving at least a <lb/>
week between the first and second readings for <lb/>
the consideration of any important measure. So <lb/>
rapid was the action of the under Secretary for <lb/>
the Colonies, presed on by those who are now <lb/>
pressing it on us, that the papers on which the <lb/>
members could alone form the judgment were <lb/>
not in their hands until the second morning, and <lb/>
onc member stated that he had only time to read <lb/>
that clause of the bill, which refers to the Inter-<lb break="yes"/>colonial Railway before the division on the second <lb/>
reading was taken. This reminds me that the <lb/>
member for Colchester has turned my attention <lb/>
to the subject of the Intercolonial Railway. It <lb/>
is well known that a guarantee was obtained for <lb/>
that work in 1862 through the exertions of <lb/>
Messrs. Howe and Tilley, and but for the bad <lb/>
faith of the Canadians the railroad might have <lb/>
been finished to-day and working, as to whether <lb/>
working profitably or not, I will not undertake to <lb/>
say. He says I complained of the delegates get<lb break="no"/>ting only three millions instead of four, and fur<lb break="no"/>ther, that four millions were not asked for. If <lb/>
so then we were deceived by the press, by the <lb/>
Canadian <hi rendition="simple:italic">News</hi> among others, for it was plainly <lb/>
stated that that was the sum and the impression <lb/>
was confirmed by the fact that Mr. Fleming had <lb/>
estimated that amount as necessary, and our own <lb/>
experience of the estimates and cost of railways <lb/>
gave us no reason to think it could not be built <lb/>
for less. We are blamed for remonstrating <lb/>
against the guarantee,—we were willing to re<lb break="no"/>monstrate against anything and everything to <lb/>
save the interests which were entrusted to us. <lb/>
Would I sell the liberties of my country for a <lb/>
few miles of railroad, even if half the trade of the <lb/>
world were to come over it? Would I say to my <lb/>
constituents " you have elected me, I respect you <lb/>
for your intelligence, but you are not competent <lb/>
to express an opinion on a matter that will sweep <lb/>
away your revenues and place unlimited powers <lb/>
of taxation in a body which you cannot control?" I <lb/>
was going to say that for all the roads in the <lb/>
world I would not consent to that, and we there<lb break="no"/>fore thought it right to use every means to des<lb break="no"/>troy the scheme, and as the road is said to be an <lb/>
essential part of it, and a necessity for Cana<lb break="no"/>da, we could take the chances for the future un<lb break="no"/>til she came to her senses, and there is no doubt <lb/>
that ere long she would have had to come to us and <lb/>
asked us to build our share. There was another <lb/>
reason, for our suggesting that a guarantee for <lb/>
the larger sum should not be given,—one of the <lb/>
most powerful influences at work in favor of Con<lb break="no"/>federation is the organization known as the <lb/>
Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada, <lb/>
whose chairman, Watkins, made the statement in <lb/>
the House of Commons that the measure had <lb/>

<pb n="50" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0050.jpg"/>
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">50</fw>

been discussed at every polling booth in Nova <lb/>
Scotia. It is the interest of that company to in<lb break="no"/>crease the value of their road from Quebec to <lb/>
Riviere du Loup, and more especially to secure <lb/>
the expenditure of the three millions, and get the <lb/>
entire line into their hands. We were apprehen<lb break="no"/>sive that the same system of jobbing which ex<lb break="no"/>tracted ten millions of money from British capi<lb break="no"/>talists some years ago would be repeated over <lb/>
again, and we thought it only right and proper <lb/>
to give a word of caution to the British people <lb/></p> 

<p>There was another reason for my action also, <lb/>
and I mention it in the hearing of gentlemen who <lb/>
have known for years the opinions which I held <lb/>
in respect to this railway;—that was that the <lb/>
road, passing through a harsh and forbidding <lb/>
country, having grades too steep for a large and <lb/>
profitable traffic, would not bring to us the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages that have been promised. There was <lb/>
no reason to believe that a large amount of <lb/>
traffic would be brought to the harbor of Halifax <lb/>
and if we had had any doubts upon that point, <lb/>
Mr. Fleming's report, made after 10 or 12 routes <lb/>
had been explored, shows that the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway might be tapped at Danville and the <lb/>
traffic diverted by the North American and Eu<lb break="no"/>ropean line which could carry more cheaply, be<lb break="no"/>cause the snow does not fall so deeply on its <lb/>
track, while the grades were lighter, and the dis<lb break="no"/>tance between Montreal and Halifax considera<lb break="no"/>bly less. When I read that report, and found <lb/>
further that at St. John and not at Halifax the <lb/>
trade was likely to centre, I must confess that <lb/>
my interest in the Intercolonial Railway was <lb/>
largely abated. I trust therefore that I have an<lb break="no"/>swered the hon. gentleman's banter upon this <lb/>
point. <lb/></p> 

<p>I was in England for several months and had <lb/>
an opportunity during that time of discussing <lb/>
the measure with able and intelligent men, and <lb/>
down to the hour I left, whenever I had a chance <lb/>
of stating the actual state of affairs in Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, when I told them that at the only three elec<lb break="no"/>tions held since the scheme was mooted the mea<lb break="no"/>sure had been condemned, and when I claimed <lb/>
for our people the right to speak on it, I did not <lb/>
find one who did not say, "you are right and <lb/>
your people should have the privilege you claim <lb/>
for them." That I believe would have been the <lb/>
feeling of the House of Commons but for the mis-<lb break="yes"/>representations of such men as Mr. Watkins <lb/>
who knows the Colonies well, and who is almost <lb/>
as familiar with the state of public opinion in the <lb/>
Provinces as with the Grand Trunk Railway <lb/>
Company, of which he is the Chairman and <lb/>
Managing Director. <lb/></p> 

<p>I do not wonder, sir, when such men as Mr. <lb/>
Watkins and Sir John Pakington made the state<lb break="no"/>ments which came from their lips to a body of <lb/>
gentlemen utterly ignorant of the facts of the <lb/>
case, that the House was misled. But there is <lb/>
time enough yet to avert this great wrong if <lb/>
members would do their duty to-night, and claim <lb/>
for their constituencies the right they should <lb/>
possess. The tidings would be wafted across <lb/>
the Atlantic with lightning speed that the action <lb/>
of the gentlemen professing to represent Nova<lb/>
Scotia in the Delegation had been condemned,<lb/>

<cb/>

the measure would be postponed, and our coun<lb break="no"/>try would be saved. (Cheers.) <lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:bold"><hi rendition="simple:centre">Speech of Mr. Blanchard.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BLAN2">Mr. BLANCHARD</persName> said: The observations I <lb/>
have to make on this question will be com<lb break="no"/>pressed into a very small compass, and shall <lb/>
be chlefly confined to the point which has been <lb/>
brought before the house by the hon. member <lb/>
for Guysborough. I think the constitutional <lb/>
point connected with this amendment has been <lb/>
so thoroughly discussed by those who preceded <lb/>
me that I need not dwell on it at any length— <lb/>
in fact that I need not touch it all. I shall not <lb/>
refer to the remarks of the hon. member for <lb/>
East Halifax, except that when I heard the <lb/>
hon. member drop the unfortunate observa<lb break="no"/>tion "that it was easier to buy a majority of <lb/>
the members of this house than a majority of <lb/>
the electors" it grated harshly upon my ears. <lb/>
I am glad that the hon. member subsequently <lb/>
withdrew so unwarrantable an insinuation. I <lb/>
think it came with an exceedingly ill grace <lb/>
from the hon. member to make any insinuation <lb/>
against any member of this house of which he <lb/>
claims to be the father. I think it proper to <lb/>
state in my place that I look upon this Legis<lb break="no"/>lature as much above corruption as any Legis<lb break="no"/>lature that I have ever heard of, and every <lb/>
hon. member composing it as much above cor<lb break="no"/>ruption as the hon. gentleman himself; and it <lb/>
will not do for him to say to this house or any <lb/>
future one that it could be approached with <lb/>
bribes; or that there is any government who <lb/>
would dare to "buy" gentlemen with the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of effecting some purpose. Such a charge <lb/>
could not be supported for an instant in this <lb/>
house. Gentlemen in it, I am glad to say, have <lb/>
proved themselves above the influence of <lb/>
party. I remember when several gentlemen <lb/>
on this side of the house supported the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment on the question of Education against <lb/>
the opinions of a majority of their friends, and <lb/>
I am glad to be able to say that the people now <lb/>
endorse the action we then took. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LOCK1">Mr. LOCKE</persName>—No! <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BLAN2">Mr. BLANCHARD</persName>.—Let the hon. member for <lb/>
Shelburne with his ten thousand people say <lb/>
"no," but I ask him to come to Inverness with <lb/>
its twenty thousand souls, and he will hear a <lb/>
very different story. They will tell him that <lb/>
we gave them a great boon when we gave them <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">free</hi> schools—a system of Education above that <lb/>
enjoyed by the people of England, and which <lb/>
has obtained the encomiums of the publicists <lb/>
of that country. (Hear, hear.) <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member for East Halifax seemed <lb/>
to be remarkably well acquainted with the <lb/>
means used by the American diplomatists, to <lb/>
purchase support in Legislatures. For my <lb/>
part I do not know anything about the matter, <lb/>
but I think that American diplomatists who <lb/>
should attempt to approach the Parliament at <lb/>
Ottawa, would be met in the same manner <lb/>
they would be in this Legislature. <lb/></p> 

<p>When we are told that we ought to have an <lb/>
appeal to the people I contend this is an Ame<lb break="no"/>rican doctrine. But even in the United States <lb/>
what is the practice? Conventions are elected <lb/>
and held for the purpose in view. But does <lb/>
the convention finally settle the question? No. <lb/>
It goes from that convention to the polls to be <lb/>
reaffirmed. by the people. The votes are given, <lb/>
and the whole are counted, and if there is a <lb/>
majority of "ayes," the "ayes" carry it, and <lb/>

<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">51</fw>

if the majority is in the negative, the "nays" <lb/>
carry it. Can we have a plebiscite under such<lb/>
circumstances? I take Hants, Kings, Queens,<lb/>
Shelburne, and Victoria, the united population<lb/>
of which amounts to 65,000 having 16 represen<lb break="no"/>tatives. Now, on the other hand, take Cumber<lb break="no"/>land, Inverness, Annapolis, Lunenburg and<lb/>
Cape Breton, having unitedly a population of<lb/>
97,500 and only 14 members. How, under such a<lb/>
system of representation, can we expect to get<lb/>
a fair verdict from the people? It takes two<lb/>
men in Inverness to be equal to one man in<lb/>
Shelburne. Pictou has 35,000 people, and <lb/>
four members - or the same number that<lb/>
Kings has with half the population. How,<lb/>
then, could any house returned after an elec<lb break="no"/>tion fairly and unmistakably represent the<lb/>
wish of the people? I recollect when there<lb/>
was a majority of two in favor of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in this House - this was in the first ses<lb break="no"/>sion of the house elected in 1859 - and the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary proed to his own satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion that he had a majority of 15.000 in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. Suppose we should come back here with<lb/>
small majority on one side or the other, yet it<lb/>
might be that the counties having the least<lb/>
votes would carry the day. The party of<lb/>
Union might actually have the majority of<lb/>
people on their side, and yet be outoted in<lb/>
this house under our system of representation.<lb/>
I say to the people of the country that I repre<lb break="no"/>sent - I voted for the general principle of as<lb break="no"/>sessment for schools on the ground that it<lb/>
would be found in time a great boon to the <lb/>
country. I did so in the face of a strong popu<lb break="no"/>lar feeling against the measure, and yet to<lb break="no"/>morrow I could go back to the people and take<lb/>
a two-thirds majority on that question. But<lb/>
even were it otherwise, I would have been<lb/>
quite satisfied with the knowledge that I had<lb/>
been defeated on a great general principle<lb/>
which must prove in time of great advantage<lb/>
to the country. On the present question I am<lb/>
influenced by the same feelings. A majority <lb/>
of the people may be opposed to the measure<lb/>
but I know nevertheless that the time is not<lb/>
far distant when they will warmly thank me<lb/>
for having supported it.<lb/></p> 

<p>We are told that this is an arbitrary exer<lb break="no"/>cise of power - that it is going to prevent us<lb/>
going into a better place after we die. May<lb/>
we ventue to hope that the good we did in<lb/>
carrying the education measure will be ac<lb break="no"/>cepted as a set-off to the wickedness we are<lb/>
about to commit?<lb/></p> 

<p>There are some members in this house who <lb/>
will remember when Cape Breton was an in<lb break="no"/>dependent province - when it had a govern<lb break="no"/>ment of its own and managed its own affairs.<lb/>
The British House of Commons did not ask<lb/>
the opinion of the people at Cape Breton, or<lb/>
even of Nova Scotia, on the subject, but by an<lb/>
act of a few lines annexed the island to Nova<lb/>
Scotia, with only two members. The union<lb/>
was effected, and for a long while you could<lb/>
find hardly a dozen men in the whole island<lb/>
who did not express themselves against the<lb/>
annexation. There was an old gentlemen who<lb/>
was Attorney General of Cape Breton pre<lb break="no"/>vious to the Union, and he spent all his time<lb/>
and energies in endeavouring to bring about a<lb/>
separation, until he finally found himself all<lb/>
alone. When he died, a few years ago, he was<lb/>
the last man who could say that the union was<lb/>
an injury to the island. Cape Breton went in<lb break="no"/>

<cb/> 

to the union with only two members, but in <lb/>
the course of time the number increased, and <lb/>
now she has nine representatives in a house of <lb/>
fifty-five. If Cape Breton gets justice it is be<lb break="no"/>cause we are bound to have it - because there<lb/>
is not a government in this county that would<lb/>
dare to ignore the claims of that island for a <lb/>
single year. I would like to see the govern<lb break="no"/>ment that would do gross injustice to Cape <lb/>
Breton.<lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon PROVINCIAL SECRETARY</persName>-- You would<lb/>
not <hi rendition="simple:italic">like</hi> to see it.<lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BLAN2">Mr. BLANCHARD</persName>- I would like to see<lb/>

<p>Predictions are the order of the day. We <lb/>
have the hon member from East Halifax in<lb/>
one breath say this country- that is to say<lb/>
the Confederacy-is to be a monarchy exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly like Mexico. Another prediction, in the <lb/>
next breath, from the same source, is what we <lb/>
are to have a President and be a republic.<lb/>
These two predictions do not agree with each<lb/>
other. Again he says that he will spend the <lb/>
remainder of his days in endeavouring to des<lb break="no"/>troy this Confederation. I make no pretensions<lb/>
to being a prophet, or the son of a prophet, but I<lb/>
venture to prodict that ere many years pass<lb/>
by he will be found very like old Gibbons, of<lb/>
Cape Breton, solitary and alone, and grey in<lb/>
harness, the only surviving exponent of anti<lb break="no"/>union principles. He will be found for the re<lb break="no"/>mainder of his days fretting and frowning <lb/>
against a union which has been carried in<lb/>
spite of all his efforts, and has proved to be <lb/>
the greatest blessing ever conferred upon this<lb/>
country.<lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:centre"><hi rendition="simple:bold">Speech of Hon. Prov. Secretary.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Dr. TUPPER</persName> then rose and said:- I under<lb break="no"/>took to show the House that every possible<lb/>
means had beeen taken to familiarize the coun<lb break="no"/>try with the question under discussion, and to<lb/>

people, and in making that statement I was met<lb/>
by the rejoinder from the hon. member from<lb/>
East Halifax, that although I had discussed in<lb/>
general terms the principle of union in the ad<lb break="no"/>joining Province, and in various places in this <lb/>
Province, I had not proposed such a plan of <lb/>
union as that devised at Quebec. If the hon.<lb/>

and to the same address which was delivered by<lb/>

he would find that I propounded just such a <lb/>
scheme of union as was arranged at Quebec and<lb/>
in Westminster Palace Hotel. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber then challenged me to produce one tittle of<lb/>
evidence that Mr. Howe had ever committed<lb/>
himself to the question of Confederation. I do <lb/>
not intend to wander over the two volumes con<lb break="no"/>taining the name of the hon. member for East<lb/>

leaf of which the reader will find that Mr. Howe's <lb/>
claim to position in this country has been large <lb/>
ly rested upon the fact that at all times and on <lb/>
all occasions he advocated the great question of <lb/>
union; but I may trouble the House to read two <lb/>
passages, which, I am sure, will convince the <lb/>
intelligent people of this country that Mr. Howe <lb/>
has pledged himself to the Confederation of the <lb/>
Provinces. I shall refer to a public let<lb break="no"/>ter written by him as far back as <lb/>
1849, when the British American League, <lb/>
of which Hon. George Moffat was Chair<lb break="no"/>man, undertook to suggest important con<lb break="no"/>stitutional changes. Mr. Moffat was under the <lb/>
impression that it was a legitimate course of <lb/>
dealing with questions of great public import for <lb/>
public assemblages to he called together, and <lb/>
for the people at public meetings to express their <lb/>
sentiments; but what did the present champion <lb/>
of the people's rights say—the man who has <lb/>
presented himself in London as the exponent of <lb/>
the public sentiment of this country because he <lb/>
has held some public meetingsand got up a few <lb/>
petitions? He wrote a letter in 1849 to the Pre<lb break="no"/>sident of the League, in which he dilated on the <lb/>
impropriety of any public man undertaking to <lb/>
deal with great public questions in any other <lb/>
place except in the legislature of his country, <lb/>
and when he was clothed with constitutional au<lb break="no"/>thority. Here is the letter written under his <lb/>
own hand in which he condemns such public as<lb break="no"/>semblages as he has held in this Provinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>"A Confederation of the Colonies may be the <lb/>
desire of your Convention. If so. the object is <lb/>
legitimate; but it must be pursued by <hi rendition="simple:italic">legitimate <lb/>
means</hi>. Believe me, <hi rendition="simple:italic">it can only be wisely attained <lb/>
by and through the Provincial Legislatures, not by <lb/>
self elected societies acting independently and in de<lb break="no"/>fiance of them.</hi> Suppose to-morrow propositions <lb/>
were submitted to the Lower Colonies for a Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Union or general Confederation. If <lb/>
made by the Government and Parliament of <lb/>
Canada, they would he treated with deference <lb/>
and respect. If made by a party in opposition, <lb/>
they would not be for a moment entertained." <lb/></p> 

<p>Here you find Mr. Howe telling the Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of one of the most important conventions <lb/>
that ever assembled in Canada, that the course <lb/>
he was pursuing was improper—that he had no <lb/>
right to deal with such matters outside of Par <lb/>
liament. This is the same man Who has been <lb/>
perambulating the Province, and undertaking <lb/>
to say that in this free country, where we have <lb/>
been entrusted with British institutions by <lb/>
which the public sentiment can be legitimately <lb/>
expressed, what was the legitimate mode in <lb/>
1849 should no longer be pursued in 1867. In <lb/>
the paragraph I have read youfind the most <lb/>
unqualified contempt heaped upon the course <lb/>
which himself an the gentlemen associated <lb/>
with him have pursued. Having shown you <lb/>
his opinion. as to the mode in which this mea<lb break="no"/>sure should be treated, let me now explain to <lb/>
you the origin of the phrase " new nationality," <lb/>
so often quoted in the discussion of this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. If we go, back to 1849, we actually find <lb/>
that the phrase originated with no less a person <lb/>
than Joseph Howe. In the same letter to the <lb/>

<cb/> 

President of the British American League, he <lb/>
said: <lb/></p> 

<p>"We desire free trade among all the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, under <hi rendition="simple:italic">one national flag</hi>, with one coin, <lb/>
one measure, one tariff, one post office. We <lb/>
feel that the courts, the press, the educational <lb/>
institutions of North America would be elevated <lb/>
by union; that intercommuuication by rail<lb break="no"/>roads, telegraphs and steamboats would be pro-. <lb/>
moted; and that if such a combination of inter<lb break="no"/>ests were achieved wisely, and with proper <lb/>
guards, the foundations of a <hi rendition="simple:italic">great nation</hi> in friend<lb break="no"/>ly connection with the mother country would be <lb/>
laid on an indestructible basis " <lb/></p> 

<p>If in 1849 British America could aspire to a <lb/>
national flag are not these Provinces at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent day equally qualified to have a common <lb/>
flag? Sir, in this year of 1867 his successors <lb/>
have accomplished that, which with him was <lb/>
only an idea and a dream, and instead of receiv<lb break="no"/>ing from himself and his friends that praise and <lb/>
encouragement to which we are entitled, we are <lb/>
attacked for having adopted those principles <lb/>
thus early propounded and thus strongly ad<lb break="no"/>vocated through his entire life, as traitors to the <lb/>
constitution of our country, and as having for<lb break="no"/>gotten what we owe to our own people. Let <lb/>
me turn again to his statement in 1854 when <lb/>
the question of union came before the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture on a resolution moved by Mr. Johnston, <lb/>
his public opponent, and when, with his inca<lb break="no"/>pacity to follow any one but himself, he pro <lb/>
pounded his views on the organization of the <lb/>
Empire; but did he say anything ln favour of <lb/>
a Confederation? Read his speech, and you <lb/>
will find him dealing with the question in terms <lb/>
of the most fervid eloquence He then pro<lb break="no"/>pounded what he considered the best scheme <lb/>
viz., representation in the lmperial Parliament; <lb/>
but if he could not get that, then he would <lb/>
propose this:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"By a Federal Union of the Colonies we should <lb/>
have something like the neighboring republic; and <lb/>
if I saw nothing better, I should say at once, let in <lb/>
keep our local Legislatures, and have a President <lb/>
and central Congress for all the higher and more ex<lb break="no"/>ternal) relations of the united Provinces. * * * * <lb/>
Under a <hi rendition="simple:italic">Federal Union</hi> we should form a large and <lb/>
prosperous nation, lying betwen the other two <lb/>
branches ofthe British family, and our duty would <lb/>
evidently be to keep them both at peace." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Now I ask the hon. member opposite if with <lb/>
these documents published to the world under <lb/>
his own signature he is still ready to tell the <lb/>
people of Nova Scotia that Mr. Howe has <lb/>
never advocated a Federal Union of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>But the hon. member for North Colchester <lb/>
(Mr McLelan) undertook to prove to this House <lb/>
the extraordinary proposition that, when Mr. <lb/>
Howe, as a public man, moved a resolution in <lb/>
this Legislature declaring that so great were the <lb/>
advantages of Union between this Province and <lb/>
Canada, that he asked for authority to hold a. <lb/>
conference on the subject, all he really desired <lb/>
was to get rid of the'question altogether—that <lb/>
at the conference the matter was found entirely <lb/>
impracticable, and was accordingly set at rest <lb/>
as it was intended to be. I have heard a good <lb/>

<pb n="53" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0053.jpg"/>
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">53</fw>

many extraordinary statements fall from the <lb/>
mouths of gentlemen, but when the hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber tells you that a public man would pursue <lb/>
such a deceitful course, then he has placed the <lb/>
person whom he professes to follow in a position <lb/>
so abject as to excite the pity and contempt of <lb/>
every respectable and intelligent man. But I <lb/>
have under my hand that which will give the <lb/>
refutation of the charge which the hon. member <lb/>
has brought against Mr. Howe. When Mr. <lb/>
Howe propounded this resolution he believed in <lb/>
it, and was sincere if ever a public man was in <lb/>
relation to any measure. After this conference <lb/>
was held in Canada what do we find? At Port <lb/>
Robinson, he addressed a large body of Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, and among other things said: <lb/></p> 

<p>"He looked forward hopefully to the time <lb/>
when the great Provinces of Canada would be <lb/>
connected with the Provinces below, and when <lb/>
a man would feel that to be a British American <lb/>
was to be the citizen of a country which includ<lb break="no"/>ed all those fertile lands, all those inexhaustible <lb/>
fisheries, all this immense marine,—carrying to <lb/>
all seas the flag of Old England, if they would <lb/>
let us; if not, the flag of British America. " <lb/></p> 

<p>Can the hon. member for North Colchester, <lb/>
when he hears such language as that, still as<lb break="no"/>sert that Mr. Howe was desirous of defeating <lb/>
Union? In that speech from which I have quot<lb break="no"/>ed we find him eloquently and forcibly urging <lb/>
the same view he had so often previously advo<lb break="no"/>cated with all the energy and talents he possess<lb break="no"/>ed. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member for Yarmouth made an ob<lb break="no"/>servation yesterday which I forgot: to notice at <lb/>
the time. He said that no person in this coun<lb break="no"/>try desired this union of the colonies except a <lb/>
few politicians who wanted office. I have given <lb/>
the House some evidence in dealing not only <lb/>
with this, but other public questions, that I have <lb/>
a higher ambition than of consulting my own <lb/>
individual interest or of holding office. So far <lb/>
from looking upon this question in this light, <lb/>
from the first hour I felt it my duty to deal with <lb/>
it I have reposed that trust and confidence in <lb/>
the people which I felt they deserved at my <lb/>
hands. I have put my hands to this work, not <lb/>
with the conviction that it was a question upon <lb/>
which a minister should peril any majority he <lb/>
might have by a reckless procedure—that he <lb/>
should make an unnecessary and unconstitu<lb break="no"/>tional appeal to the people. I have never said <lb/>
that the influences of party passions and preju<lb break="no"/>dices, and the introduction of other questions <lb/>
which are inseparable from an appeal to the <lb/>
people, might not jeopardize this question if <lb/>
submitted hastily to the country; but at the same <lb/>
time I have felt that this question, discussed as <lb/>
it has been down to a recent period by all classes <lb/>
and parties, has taken a deep hold upon the pub<lb break="no"/>lic sentiment—that the public opinion of the <lb/>
country had always been in favor of this mea<lb break="no"/>sure. Instead of seeking office for myself—in<lb break="no"/>stead of looking forward to an escape from the <lb/>
verdict of the people at the polls, there is no<lb break="no"/>thing I shall await with greater pride than hav<lb break="no"/>ing accomplished this union by the aid of my<lb/>
own colleagues and the patriotic gentlemen who<lb/>

<cb/>

have regarded patriotism more highly than par<lb break="no"/>tizanship—there is nothing that will give me <lb/>
greater pleasure than to place myself, my public <lb/>
character, and my future career in the hands of <lb/>
the electors of Nova Scotia. I have no hesita<lb break="no"/>tion in saying that there is no position, however <lb/>
exalted, that would prevent me for a single <lb/>
instant, asking that verdict from the people <lb/>
which I have a right to demand at their hands. <lb/>
(Cheers) <lb/></p> 

<p>The system of government for British Ame<lb break="no"/>rica is the system that now prevails in this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince; it is the responsible system by which <lb/>
we can only retain office by the continuance of <lb/>
public confidence. When did I ever shrink <lb/>
from ascertaining the opinions of my fellow <lb/>
countrymen? I am unwilling to make a rash <lb/>
and irrational appeal to the people at the polls; <lb/>
but when I came back from Canada—having <lb/>
previously to the general election committed <lb/>
myself to this question of Confederation—hav<lb break="no"/>ing obtained the most cordial approval of the <lb/>
sentiments which I entertained—the first thing <lb/>
I did was to court public discussion. At the <lb/>
first moment at Charlottetown it was decided <lb/>
we should take up this question, a public meet<lb break="no"/>ing was held at which we proclaimed at once <lb/>
what our intentions were. I brought the Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, New Brunswick and P E. Island dele<lb break="no"/>gates to this city, and instead of concealing our <lb/>
views from the world, at a table surrounded <lb/>
by the leading men of every profession in the <lb/>
community, we stated freely to the people of <lb/>
the Province and of British America the whole <lb/>
scheme which we proposed to carry out.— <lb/>
As far as could be judged, the sentiments of <lb/>
the leading merchants and others were una<lb break="no"/>nimously in favour of the question when it <lb/>
was laid before them. When it was stated <lb/>
that there was a probability of accomplishing <lb/>
the union loud cheers rang through the hall. <lb/></p> 

<p>But there was a little clause in the Quebec <lb/>
scheme that chanced the tone of certain gentle<lb break="no"/>men. It was considered necessary to place bank<lb break="no"/>ing under the General Government. I had no <lb/>
doubt that it was of great importance to the <lb/>
business of the whole country that the question <lb/>
of banking should be placed as it is. The re<lb break="no"/>sult, however, was that, with a few honorable <lb/>
exceptions, the bankers and capitalists ranged <lb/>
themselves against this scheme. The men who <lb/>
had been cheering this question to the very echo <lb/>
—who had invited the Canadian Parliament to <lb/>
come down and feted them with "exhaustive <lb/>
festivities,"—when they found that the tight <lb/>
grasp which a few capitalists have over the <lb/>
whole monetary affairs of this country was to <lb/>
be unclasped, then they came out in violent op<lb break="no"/>position to the measure. These men came and <lb/>
told me that I must back down—that I must fall <lb/>
back from my duty at the dictation of a few <lb/>
capitalists. A merchant of this city—one of <lb/>
those who thought that they might be obliged to <lb/>
compete with the capital and enterprize of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada—met me in the street, and told me that if I <lb/>
attempted to address a public meeting in this <lb/>
city I would be hissed from the platform. Well, <lb/>
I replied, I have never shrank from meeting <lb/>

<pb n="54" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0054.jpg"/>
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</hi></fw>

the public; I have looked at no one man's inter<lb break="no"/>ests, but I have looked broadly at what I be<lb break="no"/>lieve will elevate our common country; but if <lb/>
the public sentiment is such as you say it is, the <lb/>
sooner I know it the better. What was the re<lb break="no"/>sult? These bankers and capitalists brought up <lb/>
their Goliaths, and we met them with the same <lb/>
readiness that I have ever met my public op<lb break="no"/>ponents. After several meetings with the ablest <lb/>
men they could bring on the platform what was <lb/>
the result? They say this has been a delegation <lb/>
of lawyers with a doctor to look after them, but <lb/>
when the ablest merchants had an opportunity <lb/>
of confronting these lawyers and doctors, they <lb/>
were silenced in the presence of the largest <lb/>
assemblages that ever met in a public hall <lb/>
in Halifax. Why, my hon. friend (Mr. Tobin) <lb/>
could not get any of these merchants to come <lb/>
on the hustings with himself, and give their <lb/>
time and attention to public affairs, when it <lb/>
was only little Nova Scotia that required their <lb/>
care; but the moment they thought their own <lb/>
interests were in jeopardy they were all up in <lb/>
arms. Then they came out with the politicians <lb/>
who have given all their time and talents to <lb/>
the advancement of the public interests, and <lb/>
after the most deliberate and ample discussion, <lb/>
the hon. member himself in the press admitted <lb/>
that Halifax was against him. The night the <lb/>
discussion was closed—the last night they could <lb/>
be induced to meet us—Temperance Hall rang <lb/>
with enthusiastic cheers in favour of Union. <lb/>
Then I went up into Hants, Kings, Cumber<lb break="no"/>land, Annapolis, and Colchester, and in every <lb/>
place where this question was fully discussed, <lb/>
there was not one of these public meetings at <lb/>
which a single resolution hostile to union could <lb/>
be carried. Under these circumstances, then, <lb/>
am I chargeable with a desire to force this mea<lb break="no"/>sure upon the people, without learning the <lb/>
public sentiment? I made a mistake last <lb/>
night, it appears, in respect to the number of <lb/>
names in the petitions presented to this House. <lb/>
I have asked the clerk to count them up, and I <lb/>
find, after all the excitement and agitation, and <lb/>
all the public lectures that have been given— <lb/>
after all the misrepresentation that has appear<lb break="no"/>ed on this subject, the whole number of names <lb/>
only amounts to 6,267. In a fortnight, on a <lb/>
previous occasion, when the public sentiment <lb/>
was agitated, spontaneously 26,000 electors sent <lb/>
down their petitions here, because they really <lb/>
felt opposed to a measure which the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had in contemplation. I ask the people <lb/>
of Nova Scotia if, under such circumstances, I <lb/>
had not the right to believe that I was sus<lb break="no"/>tained by the public sentiment of the country. <lb/></p> 

<p>In opposition to this measure may be found a <lb/>
few politicians, some political partizans, who are <lb/>
ready to abase their country and themselves for <lb/>
the support of a few capitalists who could not <lb/>
make me their tool; but I will go into every coun<lb break="no"/>ty and I shall find the best men there at my back, <lb/>
who have been the standard bearers of the Libe<lb break="no"/>ral party in Nova Scotia—the men who have<lb/>
given Mr. Howe in the past the more cordial sup<lb break="no"/>port. But what more do I find? The clergy of<lb/>
this country, from the highest to the lowest—<lb/>

<cb/>

Catholics, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists, <lb/>
Methodists—of all denominations, and I stake <lb/>
my public character upon the assertion, display <lb/>
the most remarkable unanimity upon this sub<lb break="no"/>ject. Representing, as these gentlemen do, the <lb/>
education, refinement, and intelligence of a com<lb break="no"/>munity—influencing, as they do largely, the peo<lb break="no"/>ple among whom they live—can I have any <lb/>
doubts as to the sentiments of the best informed <lb/>
of the people on this question? <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member has complained of the man<lb break="no"/>ner in which the subject has been discussed in <lb/>
England. When, a year ago, I ventured to say <lb/>
to the House that the press, the public men, the <lb/>
statesmen, and the Parliament of England were <lb/>
favorable to this question, how were we met? <lb/>
With the sneers and inuendoes that have now <lb/>
been heaped upon the august Parliament of <lb/>
Great Britain? No; we were told that all that <lb/>
was necessary was to explain the whole question <lb/>
in England in order to set the matter right. <lb/>
When that was done, they would obtain all they <lb/>
wished for. Now this measure has been discuss<lb break="no"/>ed in the Parliament and press, in a manner that <lb/>
few questions were ever discussed before. The <lb/>
ablest men that could be found to oppose the <lb/>
union have done all they could to make their <lb/>
views and opinions known. What is the reason <lb/>
that when this question came to be discussed in <lb/>
Parliament it was treated as it was? This bill <lb/>
was first introduced into the House of Lords be<lb break="no"/>cause the Earl of Carnarvon wished to have the <lb/>
honour of introducing it. In a very full House, <lb/>
when he introduced the bill, he met with the <lb/>
most astonishing support. Noble lords in oppo<lb break="no"/>sition rose in rapid succession to support the <lb/>
Government. Lord John Russell gave it his <lb/>
warm approval; and the last man I could be ex<lb break="no"/>pected to influence, the Marquis of Normanby—a <lb/>
gentleman whom political conflict has made my <lb/>
opponent—in the discharge of his high duties as <lb/>
a peer of the realm, gave that question the most <lb/>
unequivocal and emphatic support; and having <lb/>
had a better opportunity than any man in the <lb/>
British Parliament of understanding the state of <lb/>
affairs in these Colonies, he told the House of <lb/>
Peers that he did not believe that the public senti<lb break="no"/>ment of this country was opposed to the union. <lb/>
Lord Carnarvon explained that there had been <lb/>
no election here on this question—that the con<lb break="no"/>stitution did not require such an appeal; and the <lb/>
whole facts having been explained to the House <lb/>
with the greatest accuracy, there was not a single <lb/>
man to oppose the bill. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> of the next <lb/>
morning placed in the hands of every member a <lb/>
clear statement of the position of this Province, <lb/>
and of everything in relation to this matter. <lb/>
When the Peers found that Lord Stratheden had <lb/>
lent himself to statements they could not sustaîn, <lb/>
they got up, one after the other, and left the <lb/>
House. Mr. Howe heard Mr. Watkins' state<lb break="no"/>ment to which reference has been made, and he <lb/>
was in constant communication with Mr. Bright <lb/>
and if any incorrect statement was made, Mr. <lb/>
Howe is responsible for not having corrected it. <lb/>
Therefore I say, if the House of Commons was <lb/>
misled by a single remark—Mr. Watkins having <lb/>
misunderstood the time at which the Union dis<lb break="no"/>

cussion took place—Mr. Howe and his friends <lb/>
are themselves to blame if they did not correct <lb/>
him. <lb/></p> 

<p>Under the Quebec scheme the power to levy <lb/>
an export duty on coal was left in the hands of <lb/>
the Local Governments. We have changed that <lb/>
ourselves. The House well knows the policy <lb/>
that I propounded on the question of the coal <lb/>
mines last year. I regard them as the great <lb/>
source of Provincial wealth and prosperity—not <lb/>
for the royalty which goes into the treasury, but <lb/>
because of their intimate connection with the de<lb break="no"/>velopment of new branches of industry in this <lb/>
country—of the impulse they must give to manu<lb break="no"/>factures in the Province. In fact, the possession <lb/>
of coal mines, together with other natural advan<lb break="no"/>tages, must, in the course of time, make Nova <lb/>
Scotia the great emporium for manufactures in <lb/>
British America. We felt that in taking it out <lb/>
of the power of any Legislature to double the <lb/>
amount of royalty, we were giving a guarantee <lb/>
to capitalists who might come in and invest their <lb/>
money in these coal mines, that the Legislature <lb/>
could not come down and say they must pay one <lb/>
or two shillings upon every ton of coal raised. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member has said that we sacrificed <lb/>
the fisheries. Would it have been desirable to <lb/>
have left the protection of the fisheries in the <lb/>
hands of the Local Government? But there is <lb/>
really no alteration made in this respect. In the <lb/>
Quebec scheme the power of legislation in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the deep sea fisheries was given to the <lb/>
General and Local Governments in common, but <lb/>
there was a clause which provided that regula<lb break="no"/>tions of the General Government should over<lb break="no"/>ride those of the Local Government. Now the <lb/>
only difference is that the entire responsibility is <lb/>
thrown upon the General Government. When <lb/>
the House receives the public despatches on the <lb/>
question of the fisheries they will see that the <lb/>
course taken by the Government of this Province <lb/>
was rendered imperative by the action of the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government. It was a compromise sug<lb break="no"/>gested to the British Government by Canada. <lb/>
The Canadians were ready to license the fish<lb break="no"/>eries, and standing as we do to-day we are at the <lb/>
mercy of Canada. If Canada falls we must fall. <lb/>
We have no status by ourselves; we have no <lb/>
standing in relation to the Empire apart from <lb/>
Canada. As respects this question, it is well <lb/>
known that the policy of Canada has always been <lb/>
supreme, although we have the largest interest in <lb/>
the fisheries. Now, however, the Canadians will <lb/>
be interested in them equally with ourselves, and <lb/>
we shall have such a. voice in the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment as will enable us in all probability to large<lb break="no"/>ly influence that body, for we shall, as shown by <lb/>
the hon. member for South Colchester, hold the <lb/>
balance of power between the two rival sections <lb/>
of Canada. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member has taunted me with <lb/>
having made use of the Queen,s name, and <lb/>
he and his friends have stated in state pa<lb break="no"/>per which they sent to the Colonial Office <lb/>
that this measure had been carried by the <lb/>
abuse of our Sovereign's name. The re<lb break="no"/>erence was clearly within the constitution <lb/>

<cb/>

and such as is made within the Parliament <lb/>
of England. From the lips of our Royal <lb/>
Sovereign I have heard the warmest ap<lb break="no"/>proval of union. The Province I represent<lb break="no"/>ed, had the great honor and distinction of <lb/>
my receiving Her Majesty's command to <lb/>
wait upon her at Buckingham Palace, and <lb/>
upon that occasion Her Majesty congratu<lb break="no"/>lated me upon the success which had at<lb break="no"/>tended our efforts; and when I expressed <lb/>
the gratification with which her loyal sub<lb break="no"/>jects would learn the deep interest she had <lb/>
evinced in this measure, she replied: " I <lb/>
take the deepest interest in it, for I believe <lb/>
it will make them great and prosperous." <lb/>
(Cheers) <lb/></p> 

<p>I am glad that on the present occasion <lb/>
the hon. member for Halifax has had the <lb/>
manliness— <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PRYO1">Mr. PRYOR</persName>—The hon. member for East <lb/>
Halifax? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Dr. TUPPER</persName>—I do not wonder that my <lb/>
hon. friend should be anxious that there <lb/>
should be no misapprehension as to who <lb/>
is meant. The hon. member for East Hali<lb break="no"/>fax has to-night openly avowed his senti<lb break="no"/>ments upon this question. I have always <lb/>
felt that hon. gentleman was serving the <lb/>
United States rather than his own country: <lb/>
I do not refer to any hasty expression that <lb/>
may have fallen from his lips; but I have <lb/>
been painfully impressed with the fact that <lb/>
from the moment he took his present posi<lb break="no"/>tion he would use every effort to transfer this <lb/>
Province from under the British Crown to <lb/>
the Stars and Stripes. We are told by him <lb/>
to-night that he is ready to sacrifice the <lb/>
best interests of his country in order to sa<lb break="no"/>tisfy his yearning after connection with the <lb/>
United States—that he is prepared to <lb/>
choose, as between a union with Canada <lb/>
and a union with the American Republic, <lb/>
in favor of the latter. We have heard him <lb/>
characterizing the Parliament of Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain as ignorant and imbecile—heaping ob<lb break="no"/>loquy upon the grandest institutions that <lb/>
are the pride and glory of the world. He <lb/>
has declared that a preference for a closer <lb/>
uuion wit the Empire would be a weak <lb/>
and foolish prejudice. He has not left the <lb/>
people of this country in any doubt as to <lb/>
his sentiments; and the reason why I con<lb break="no"/>gratulate the House and country upon this <lb/>
fact is, that his position is now clearly de<lb break="no"/>fined, and he has disarmed himself. In a <lb/>
loyal country like this, when his senti<lb break="no"/>ments are clearly revealed, he must be <lb/>
perfectly impotent to effect any harm what<lb break="no"/>ever. <lb/></p> 

<p>But is this the time when any man in <lb/>
British America can be ready to give up the <lb/>

admirable institutions of Great Britain for <lb/>
those of the United States. Let me read to <lb/>
you the picture presented of the latter coun<lb break="no"/>try by Mr. Howe himself: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"Railroads, canals, steamers and telegraphs then <lb/>
came in and assisted to bind the country together; <lb/>
but in eighty years, with all their aids and applian<lb break="no"/>ces, the game was played out; and the same causes <lb/>
which in every quarter of the old world, and in al<lb break="no"/>most every age, have asserted themselves, came dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly into view, marking the subjection even of the <lb/>
great Republic to the laws which the Creator, for <lb/>
some wise purpose, has established for the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the universe. It is true that by the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of a million of lives, and of nearly four hundred <lb/>
thousand millions of dollars, the country is still <lb/>
nominally held together; but when hearts are es<lb break="no"/>stranged and interests are adverse, when communities <lb/>
baptized in blood and tears, find in a great calamity <lb/>
ever recurring elements of discord and reproach, the <lb/>
time is rapidly drawing on when separation is inevit<lb break="no"/>able, and when new combinations will grow out of <lb/>
the play of the passionate ambitions which the wit <lb/>
of men has hitherto been found harmless to control," <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>That is the condition in which the United <lb/>
States is now, as drawn by the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's leader and co-delegate; and yet this <lb/>
country which has sacrificed a million of <lb/>
lives in a recent struggle—which has in<lb break="no"/>curred a debt greater than that of England <lb/>
—this country riven by discord and strife, <lb/>
in which the Parliament is arrayed against <lb/>
the President, is held up to our admiration <lb/>
as the one to which we ought to be united. <lb/>
These gentlemen having failed to fasten <lb/>
the tyrannical scheme proposed for the or<lb break="no"/>ganization of the Empire upon us, turn <lb/>
round and say: Instead of allowing you to <lb/>
form part of a great and free community, <lb/>
with an amount of power and influence <lb/>
such as no other people ever possessed, we <lb/>
shall endeavour to drag you under the Stars <lb/>
and Stripes—into that country which Mr. <lb/>
Howe has described as so riven and dis<lb break="no"/>tracted that neither life nor property is <lb/>
safe. May I not congratulate the House <lb/>
that the mask is at last removed, and that <lb/>
the hon member has shown himself in his <lb/>
true colours? He has presumed to hurl <lb/>
charges of corruption against the loyal and <lb/>
patriotic members of this house. Is it in <lb/>
his own heart that he finds the ground of <lb/>
these charges? Let me ask him if, having <lb/>
found him standing in the presence of the <lb/>
Parliament and daring to disparage the glo<lb break="no"/>rious British institutions under which we <lb/>
live, and if, in addition to this, we find him <lb/>
advocating a union with the United States, <lb/>
instead of a union of British America, might <lb/>
not the charge be made that the money of <lb/>
the United States had been used to influ<lb break="no"/>ence him? He talk to me of corruption!— <lb/>
the man who has taken back every princi<lb break="no"/>ple that he has ever propounded in this <lb/>
house—the man who goes to England and <lb/>
says to the Imperial Parliament, " Be care<lb break="no"/>ful of your money—do not give a guarantee <lb/>

<cb/>

for a loan of three millions of pounds for the <lb/>
construction of a railway which is going to <lb/>
make Halifax a city of 100,000 souls—give <lb/>
us connection with the United States and <lb/>
Canadas"—who says, " I am aware that I <lb/>
have claimed the confidence of the consti<lb break="no"/>tuency of Halifax on the ground that I was <lb/>
an advocate of an Intercolonial Railway, <lb/>
but never mind that: I am determined to <lb/>
use every effort I can to prevent the con<lb break="no"/>summation of that work!" <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member tells us that the Ame<lb break="no"/>rican Government are so anxious to obtain <lb/>
possession of us, that they may come in <lb/>
and buy up the Confederate Parliament. Is <lb/>
it or is it not an unjust suspicion to suppose <lb/>
that if the American Government are so <lb/>
corrupt that they would buy up the <lb/>
Confederate Parliament of British <lb/>
America, they have found means to buy up <lb/>
one or two individuals in the Legislature <lb/>
of Nova Scotia? Is it because we have al<lb break="no"/>ways held one view on this question that <lb/>
we are to be taunted by gentlemen who <lb/>
have taken back the declarations of a life<lb break="no"/>time with corruption? lf this Parliament <lb/>
could be so degraded as that men could be <lb/>
influenced by corrupt means to trifle with <lb/>
the best interests of this country, then I say <lb/>
he has given the best evidence in the world <lb/>
why the confederation should take place. <lb/>
If legislators, second to none that ever sat <lb/>
within these walls for probity, intelligence, <lb/>
education, and everything that constitutes <lb/>
able and valuable men, are of that cha<lb break="no"/>racter he would have us suppose they are, <lb/>
then he has given us the best evidence that <lb/>
Nova Scotia is unworthy of British institu<lb break="no"/>tions, and the sooner some other country <lb/>
governs us the better. But I feel I am in<lb break="no"/>sulting the intelligence of the country when <lb/>
I suppose for an instance that it would do <lb/>
aught than treat with contempt the un<lb break="no"/>founded insinuations of the hon. gentleman <lb/>
whose own openly avowed sentiments this <lb/>
evening have placed him in so unenviable <lb/>
a position. I feel that the question can be <lb/>
safely left to the patriotism and intelligence <lb/>
of this deliberative Assembly who have al<lb break="no"/>ways approached it in a spirit that proves <lb/>
them worthy of the free institutions they <lb/>
enjoy, and that an intelligent and loyal popu<lb break="no"/>lation will cordially sustain them thus seek<lb break="no"/>ing to elevate and advance our common <lb/>
country. (Cheers). <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:FRAS4">MR. JAMES FRASER</persName>.—I feel it due to myself, <lb/>
as well as to the people I represent, that I should <lb/>
made a few remarks concerning the course which <lb/>
I intend to pursue upon this question. This <lb/>
subject was before us last year, and when the <lb/>

ment of delegates to see if a better scheme than <lb/>
the Quebec scheme could be devised, I felt it my <lb/>
duty to oppose them, not because I was averse <lb/>
to the principle of union—for it is not merely <lb/>
since I occupied a seat here that I felt the con<lb break="no"/>viction that we could not long occupy our pre<lb break="no"/>sent position—but because of these two reasons: <lb/>
first, I did not know what kind of a bargain the <lb/>
delegates might make when they went thousands <lb/>
of miles away, and I thought it wrong that we <lb/>
should not have the opportunity of saying whe<lb break="no"/>ther we approved of their arrangements or not; <lb/>
and second, because I knew that a great many <lb/>
of the people were opposed to union. From cau<lb break="no"/>ses that cannot very well be explained, the peo<lb break="no"/>ple are afraid of change. The first reason for <lb/>
my opposition has now been done away; and, <lb/>
as far as I am able to judge, I am disposed to <lb/>
think that the bargain which the delegates have <lb/>
made is a great deal better than the Quebec <lb/>
scheme, though even that I was not afraid of. <lb/>
I had intended last year to go further than I did; <lb/>
I intended not only to have opposed the resolution <lb/>
but to have supported the amendment, but be<lb break="no"/>fore the discussion was over I discovered some<lb break="no"/>thing I did not like—I discovered among some <lb/>
gentleman a strong desire for annexation to the <lb/>
United States. I was brought up in loyal princi<lb break="no"/>ples, and taught to cherish British institutions, <lb/>
and while I wished to give our people time for <lb/>
consideration, I could not and never will consent <lb/>
to make a change from the English flag to a flag <lb/>
which I never wish to wave over my head or the <lb/>
heads of my children. And now, although con<lb break="no"/>tinued opposition might be consistent, I consider <lb/>
the question has come to be in that state in which <lb/>
further opposition would not only be useless, but <lb/>
dangerous. We are all proud of the eloquence <lb/>
and abilities of Mr. Howe, and when he went to <lb/>
England I waited with great anxiety to see if <lb/>
he was going to give us something which we <lb/>
would consider better than the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation; but when I found him propounding <lb/>
a scheme which was long ago condemned by <lb/>
himself as impracticable, I began to think if he <lb/>
had nothing better to propound, there was no<lb break="no"/>thing better to be expected than the scheme <lb/>
which had been before us. If the Quebec scheme <lb/>
would bring taxation to the value of one cent, <lb/>
Mr. Howe's would bring taxation to hundreds <lb/>
of times that amount. <lb/></p> 

<p>Another matter which operated strongly on <lb/>
my mind was the fact that our American neigh<lb break="no"/>bors opposed Confederation. Is that on account <lb/>
of their love for us? No, but because they do <lb/>
not want to see the British power grow up <lb/>
alongside of them. If then I have been sin<lb break="no"/>cerely and honestly opposed to the measure <lb/>
hitherto, after viewing these facts and finding <lb/>
that the British Parliament and people, and <lb/>
our honoured Sovereign herself have given <lb/>
their approval of it, I feel that I should be no <lb/>
longer so. I will not deny that among the peo<lb break="no"/>ple opposition still exists, but while no man <lb/>
attaches more value to the wishes of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, or is more willing to defer to their wishes, <lb/>
I am constrained to take the responsibility of <lb/>
doing what I believe to be right whether I gain <lb/>
popularity by the act or not. I am convinced <lb/> 

<cb/>

the day is not far distant when the people will <lb/>
acknowledge that I have done the best thing <lb/>
for them, and surely they cannot think that I <lb/>
would do more for them than for myself and <lb/>
children—I will take my chance under the new <lb/>
system, and I have as much at stake as many <lb/>
who are less willing. I regretted to hear an <lb/>
hon. gentleman state that if the measure passed <lb/>
he would still do all in his power to oppose it, <lb/>
—I cannot agree in that, and if the bill passes, <lb/>
as I believe it will, I will use my humble en<lb break="no"/>deavors to make it a blessing to our peo<lb break="no"/>ple and to the great Empire to which we be<lb break="no"/>long. <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:BROW3">DR. BROWN</persName> said that he was sorry to hear <lb/>
the hon. Provincial Secretary bear so hard on <lb/>
Mr. Howe in his absence. He was not Mr. <lb/>
Howe's apologist. He had not approved of <lb/>
many of that gentleman's acts when at the <lb/>
head of public affairs, but he entirely con<lb break="no"/>curred in the object of the mission in which he <lb/>
was now engaged on the part of the people of <lb/>
Nova Scotia. He thought that it would have <lb/>
been more manly and generous in the leader <lb/>
of the government if he had waited for an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of conducting the discussions face to <lb/>
face. As to the question before the House, at <lb/>
that hour of the night he had but few words to <lb/>
say. He did not care whether the course pur<lb break="no"/>sued by the Government was constitutional or <lb/>
not—he would not enter into the legality of the <lb/>
case; the only question was, was it right, was <lb/>
it just, was it expedient to pass a measure so <lb/>
vitally affecting the rights of the people, as it <lb/>
were by stealth and without their consent? It <lb/>
could not be argued that an appeal to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple would be inconvenient, because an election <lb/>
must necessarily take place in a few weeks, or <lb/>
months at the furthest. He had heard much <lb/>
talk about loyalty. He thought that loyalty <lb/>
like charity began at home. He thought if the <lb/>
British people and Government passed this <lb/>
bill, compelling our people into a union highly <lb/>
distasteful to a large majority, they might <lb/>
be justly accused of disloyalty towards us. <lb/>
The best loyalty was to take care of ourselves, <lb/>
and if Great Britain was weary of the connec<lb break="no"/>tion, we must only look elsewhere for friends <lb/>
and allies. It was clear that free trade with <lb/>
the United States was the greatest boon we <lb/>
could now enjoy. The trade with Canada <lb/>
could never be large, and we could encourage <lb/>
it as well without union as with it. But free <lb/>
trade with our republican neighbors would be <lb/>
our salvation, in a commercial sense. He hop<lb break="no"/>ed the Government would pause before they <lb/>
passed an act so arbitrary and so unjust to the <lb/>
people. <lb/></p>

Cape Breton are proud of their connection with <lb/>
Nova Scotia, and that the only man opposed <lb/>
to the union has passed away. I think I am <lb/>
as fully acquainted with the feelings of that <lb/>
people as he is, and I therefore feel justified in <lb/>
contradicting the impression which his remarks <lb/>
would leave. The case of Cape Breton is not <lb/>
at all parallel with the case now before us,—the <lb/>
union was effected without the consent of the <lb/>
people, and indeed without their knowledge. <lb/>

The island was at first only represented by <lb/>
two members out of all proportion to the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of Nova Scotia. We afterwards pe<lb break="no"/>titioned for a repeal, and two out of the four <lb/>
members then representing Cape Breton voted <lb/>
against it. About twenty years ago a large pe<lb break="no"/>tition was sent to England, and a legal gentle<lb break="no"/>man employed on the subject in London, so <lb/>
that the statement made is inaccurate. Even <lb/>
now Cape Breton can scarcely get justice at <lb/>
the hands of Nova Scotia, and session after <lb/>
session we are sneered at by even leading poli<lb break="no"/>ticians. I attribute the strong feeling of the <lb/>
people of Cape Breton on the subject of Confe<lb break="no"/>deration to the treatment they have received <lb/>
at the hands of Nova Scotia. We have not yet <lb/>
a fair share of representation. In the case of <lb/>
the present union, however, we enter on more <lb/>
favourable terms even than either of the Cana<lb break="no"/>das, both as regards representation and the <lb/>
funds to be placed at our disposal. <lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:centre"><hi rendition="simple:bold">Mr. Blackwood's Speech.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BLAC7">Mr. BLACKWOOD</persName>:— As I intend to support <lb/>
the amendment, I feel that I should like to say <lb/>
a few words before the vote is taken. I sup<lb break="no"/>port it on the principle that however finely <lb/>
argued the case may be in reference to consti<lb break="no"/>tutional authority, there is a sense of right and <lb/>
wrong which tells us that this privilege be<lb break="no"/>longs to the people, and if there be no prece<lb break="no"/>dent in favour of the course, we urge it is time <lb/>
we made one when the constitution is to be <lb/>
changed, and when the eyes of the world are <lb/>
on us. If ever there was a time when the <lb/>
feelings of the people should be consulted it is <lb/>
the present. The time of the house will short<lb break="no"/>ly expire, and if an election were held the <lb/>
measure could be completed shortly after<lb break="no"/>wards. I do not consider that within this <lb/>
house is concentrated all the wisdom of the <lb/>
country. We have had Mr. Howe's opinions <lb/>
quoted to us but I do not see that we should <lb/>
consider his views as the subject of discussion <lb/>
now, or the views of any man, but the posi<lb break="no"/>tion and interests and feelings of the people of <lb/>
Nova Scotia. I do not entertain an opinion <lb/>
favourable to the scheme for the organization <lb/>
of the Empire because I think its features <lb/>
could not be carried out with satisfaction to <lb/>
all the Colonies. <lb/></p> 

<p>With reference to annexation, I may say <lb/>
that I never could feel otherwise than de<lb break="no"/>graded by being subjected to the Stars and <lb/>
Stripes; but in making the charges of disloy<lb break="no"/>alty which have been made, I think that jus<lb break="no"/>tice has not been done to those expressing <lb/>
their opinions on this side of the house. They <lb/>
have not said, or sought to convey the impres<lb break="no"/>sion, that they favour annexation, but that <lb/>
they are opposed to any union, and desire to <lb/>
progress as we have been progressing. The <lb/>
people of Nova Scotia have no idea of joining <lb/>
the United States unless they are driven to it; <lb/>
but if you stir up hostility by such legislation <lb/>
as will embitter their minds, and for that pur<lb break="no"/>pose take advantage of the position which the <lb/>
Government occupy, the British feeling will be <lb/>
driven out of their British hearts. I feel it <lb/>
due the people to speak out boldly, for if ever <lb/>
there was a time when their feelings should be <lb/>
consulted, it is the present. Let us not take <lb/>
the opinion of this or that individual, but the <lb/>
opinion of the entire country, and by that de<lb break="no"/>cision I am content to stand or fall. <lb/></p>

<p><hi rendition="simple:bold"><hi rendition="simple:centre">Mr. Churchill's Speech.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHUR2">Mr. CHURCHILL</persName>—In the discussion of a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of such vital importance it appears to me <lb/>
that it would have been wise to have allowed <lb/>
more time for consideration than has been gi<lb break="no"/>ven us. From the very moment this subject <lb/>
claimed my thoughts, the responsibilities con<lb break="no"/>nected with it have pressed upon my mind <lb/>
with a weight beyond anything that I can ex<lb break="no"/>press. I have never given to any individual <lb/>
my opinion, and when asked what my opinion <lb/>
was about this great question of Confederation, <lb/>
I have replied that it was not one of so small <lb/>
moment that an opinion could be given has<lb break="no"/>tily. I have not consulted my constituents on <lb/>
the subject, nor they me, but I have viewed <lb/>
the matter in its broadest aspect, and <lb/>
nothing has occurred to shake the opinion <lb/>
which l have formed, although in some res<lb break="no"/>pects I have been delighted with the speeches <lb/>
to which I have listened. It is not in the pow<lb break="no"/>er of any living man to comprehend and grasp <lb/>
the entire subject,—the results lie in the fu<lb break="no"/>ture, and will reveal themselves only after <lb/>
years have rolled round. Therefore when my <lb/>
opinion has been asked I have felt disinclined <lb/>
to give it. Suppose gentlemen were about <lb/>
purchasing Canada. Would they use many <lb/>
words about it? Would they not rather pon<lb break="no"/>der deeply and say but little, and measure the <lb/>
language they used rather than make lengthy <lb/>
speeches? Last session I intended to have <lb/>
been present and to have recorded my vote, but <lb/>
I was unavoidably detained—my mind was <lb/>
made up then as it is to—night. The question <lb/>
now before us is not whether we shall have <lb/>
this union or not—that was decided last win<lb break="no"/>ter by an unexpected and sweeping majority. <lb/>
The house then delegated a number of gentle<lb break="no"/>men to proceed to England, and to make a <lb/>
contract on our behalf, and we all know' <lb/>
the result, and every man in Nova <lb/>
Scotia might have known what the result <lb/>
would be with England anxious, Canada anx<lb break="no"/>ious, and Nova Scotia willing, constitutionally <lb/>
willing. <lb/></p> 

<p>It is not fair to ask the legislature to undo <lb/>
what it did last winter when it fixed the des<lb break="no"/>tiny of the Province and clothed those gentle<lb break="no"/>men with the authority of delegates. The pe<lb break="no"/>titions sent across the water could not be ex<lb break="no"/>pected to have had any effect—on any public <lb/>
question of interest a cartload of them could <lb/>
be obtained without any result. One benefit <lb/>
that will accrue from Confederation is that the <lb/>
General Government will control the currency. <lb/>
I look upon the mode in which our Provincial <lb/>
currency has been managed as imprudent and <lb/>
selfish; a number of bankers, by combining, <lb/>
have controlled the currency completely. In<lb break="no"/>stead of £140,000 in Province notes we should <lb/>
have had half a million years ago afloat, and the <lb/>
condition of our finances would have been far <lb/>
better. Another advantage is the construction <lb/>
of the Intercolonial Railroad, and the extension <lb/>
of our other roads, which I believe we could <lb/>
not have without the union. In view of these <lb/>
questions I have felt that if my last hour had <lb/>
come and my opinion were asked, I would <lb/>
say: do not be afraid to venture on the great <lb/>
realities that will break forth on a combined <lb/>
people. Isolated, there is no safety; combined <lb/>
there is wisdom and security. Mr. Howe has <lb/>
been much referred to. I was sorry when he <lb/>
left us, and I can well remember receiving <lb/>

from his addresses the conviction that union <lb/>
must be the order of the day. What could in<lb break="no"/>duce me at my advanced stage of life, to ad<lb break="no"/>vocate a measure if I did not believe it would <lb/>
be for the advantage of those who are to come <lb/>
after me? The proposal made to us is to sub<lb break="no"/>mit the matter to the polls. Suppose you <lb/>
could do so would that be the proper way to <lb/>
try it? Does not every man acquainted with <lb/>
the condition of our Province know that at the <lb/>
polls party feelings would override every<lb break="no"/>thing? You never could ascertain the real <lb/>
opinions of the people by an election, and the <lb/>
great measure would be almost lost sight of. <lb/></p> 

<p>I therefore feel no doubt upon that ground. <lb/>
I am now probably in the last year of my poli<lb break="no"/>tical life, and I would have been glad could I <lb/>
have escaped the responsibility now resting <lb/>
upon me; but that responsibility must rest up<lb break="no"/>on some one, and I am here to discharge it. I <lb/>
believe there are hundreds and hundreds of <lb/>
able and deep-thinking men in this Province <lb/>
who are glad to get rid of this responsibity, as <lb/>
I would be, if I could. <lb/></p> 

<p>I was amused last evening to hear the re<lb break="no"/>marks about annexation. I would ask hon. <lb/>
gentlemen what part of the States would we <lb/>
be annexed to—the North or the South? I al<lb break="no"/>ways regretted that Halifax, as well as New <lb/>
Brunswick, gave its sympathy to the South <lb/>
—that mistaken people who are wasted like <lb/>
the ranks upon the other side of the House. <lb/>
If war had not occurred, the subject of annex<lb break="no"/>ation might have been broached, but after that <lb/>
I hoped never to hear of the proposition. I <lb/>
doubt that the United States would be anxious <lb/>
to have us; they will get our coals and fish, <lb/>
and give us what they please, as they always <lb/>
have done. I would like to have dwelt more <lb/>
largely on the subject, but time will not per<lb break="no"/>mit at this late hour of the night; and I would <lb/>
merely say, in conclusion, that I am willing, <lb/>
with my hon. friend from Pictou, who spoke a <lb/>
short time ago, to fall into the ranks of those <lb/>
who seek to unite the Provinces. <lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:centre"><hi rendition="simple:bold">Speech of Mr. Hebb.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. HEBB</persName> said:—I rise not to make a long <lb/>
speech, but to give a few views which I enter<lb break="no"/>tain upon this question. Last winter, as well <lb/>
as in this session, a great deal was said about <lb/>
loyalty and about the intelligence of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and it has been repeatedly said that all <lb/>
the intelligence and all the loyal feeling of this <lb/>
country were favorable to union. Now I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that not one member of this house desires <lb/>
annexation to the United States; but suppo<lb break="no"/>sing a faithful son asked his father for the <lb/>
portion of the inheritance which fell to his <lb/>
share, and the father said, "I will give you <lb/>
nothing," would it not be expected that the <lb/>
son would leave him? Again, if a young man <lb/>
desired a wife, and after seeing many young <lb/>
women of the neighboring Provinces, should <lb/>
find one better suited to him in the States, is <lb/>
it not natural that he should follow his choice? <lb/>
But, as I have said, no member here desires <lb/>
annexation; and if such an impression has <lb/>
been derived from any remarks that have <lb/>
been made, it is no doubt from the haste of <lb/>
expression. There are men here who could <lb/>
talk from now until next September, because <lb/>
it is their business; but it is not to be expect<lb break="no"/>ed that some of us should be so well trained <lb/>
in expression as those lawyers and doctors. <lb/>

<cb/>

The blood boils in my veins when I hear <lb/>
some of these gentlemen despising their con<lb break="no"/>stituents. There are good and loyal men in <lb/>
this country who will not come to the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and their opinions should he heard. It <lb/>
has been intimated that the people are not <lb/>
able to judge—that they are too ignorant; but <lb/>
I ask who has made the country but the peo<lb break="no"/>ple to whom this language is applied? Did <lb/>
the handful of members around me make the <lb/>
country? No, but the men who are catching <lb/>
the fish, who are taking the lumber from the <lb/>
forests and the stones from the soil. The la<lb break="no"/>borers of the country should he heard, and I <lb/>
speak thus because I am one of them, and <lb/>
know how wrong it is for men of position and <lb/>
education to look down on the working classes. <lb/>
I should like to see our public men when they <lb/>
are passing through the Province, greeted <lb/>
everywhere with a pleasant countenance and <lb/>
receiving the ready grasp of the hand. <lb/></p> 

<p>There is an old saying which forbids us to <lb/>
compare men and beasts together, but some<lb break="no"/>times the comparison is necessary, and I wish <lb/>
to make one: I know that if you put on a horse <lb/>
a collar that chafes his neck and makes the <lb/>
blood trickle down his breast you will see his <lb/>
eyes become dim and his ears droop,—and <lb/>
what can you expect from human beings if <lb/>
you force on them a measure which they dislike. <lb/>
I am not so much opposed to union as to over<lb break="no"/>riding the opinions of the people. They might <lb/>
at some future time express a desire for Con<lb break="no"/>federation, but if you force it on them now, I <lb/>
can only say that I should not like to be one <lb/>
of those whose names are attached to the re<lb break="no"/>cords of the country as favoring the measure. <lb/>
The arrangements between the Provinces re<lb break="no"/>minds me of an anecdote which I heard some <lb/>
years ago: A cat and a monkey went to mar<lb break="no"/>ket to buy cheese, they did so, and on return<lb break="no"/>ing home, in order to make a division procured <lb/>
a pair of scales;—the monkey was careful to <lb/>
cut one piece larger than the other, and when <lb/>
it did not weigh evenly he got permission to <lb/>
taste, and so went on cutting and tasting until <lb/>
the cheese had nearly disappeared, and when <lb/>
the cat remonstrated she was threatened with <lb/>
a hiding. <lb/></p> 

<p>That is pretty much the position of our af<lb break="no"/>fairs; we are the small Colonies, and if we <lb/>
complain, Canada will threaten to chastise us. <lb/>
It would seem that no one can speak upon <lb/>
this question without referring to Mr. Howe; <lb/>
but supposing that gentleman did at one time <lb/>
speak of union. It is too much the practice for <lb/>
men to stick to the principle they have avow<lb break="no"/>ed, whether right or wrong; and the man who <lb/>
acknowledges an error is entitled to credit. <lb/>
As is well known, I am not much of a speaker, <lb/>
and will not therefore long detain the house. I <lb/>
cannot understand how any set of gentlemen <lb/>
dare to impose such a measure upon the coun<lb break="no"/>try, against the wishes of the people. If the <lb/>
people are favorable to it, why be afraid to <lb/>
come out among them and abide the conse<lb break="no"/>quences? For my part, I will stand by the <lb/>
people, and if I fall, I will fall by them. <lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:bold"><hi rendition="simple:centre">Remarks of Hon. Financial Secretary.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. JAMES MACDONALD</persName> said:—I would <lb/>
not address the House at this late hour were <lb/>
it not for some of the observations which <lb/>
fell from the hon. member for East Halifax <lb/></p>

<pb n="60" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0060.jpg"/> 
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">60</fw>

<p>as to the financial aspect of the question, <lb/>
and which it is desirable that the country <lb/>
should fully understand. The House knows <lb/>
that the opponents of union have argued <lb/>
that the revenues of this country are to be <lb/>
dissipated by Canada—that the hardly <lb/>
earned revenues of the peeple are to go to <lb/>
enrich the Canadian treasury. I undertake <lb/>
to tell the hon. member, and I challenge <lb/>
him to contradict me, by reference to the <lb/>
figures open to every one, and which I shall <lb/>
adduce to the House, that so far from the <lb/>
revenues of this country going to enrich the <lb/>
Canadas, the fact is the very reverse. The <lb/>
hon. member has taken the figures furnish<lb break="no"/>ed in the estimates for the past year laid on <lb/>
the table by the government. I will take <lb/>
the figures from the same source, and <lb/>
will undertake to show that instead of the <lb/>
revenues of Nova Scotia going to pay the <lb/>
debts of Canada, we shall have almost the <lb/>
entire revenue derived from this portion of <lb/>
the confederacy spent within the limits of <lb/>
this Province, in payment of the same ser<lb break="no"/>vices to which our revenue is now applied; <lb/>
for it must be remembered that although <lb/>
the management of these departments—the <lb/>
revenue and post office departments for in<lb break="no"/>stance—is transferred to the general govern<lb break="no"/>ment, the services must still be performed <lb/>
by men residing and spending their income <lb/>
in this country. We shall receive, then, <lb/>
first the contribution fixed by the act of un<lb break="no"/>ion, to be paid by the general government <lb/>
in aid of our local expenditure, amounting <lb/>
to $324,000 in the first instance, and shall <lb/>
continue to receive in proportion to our po<lb break="no"/>pulation till we number 400,000. Let me see <lb/>
then, how the matter will stand, and I may <lb/>
say that I am entitled to no credit for the <lb/>
statement shewing this view of the matter, <lb/>
as I avail myself of the figures as arranged <lb/>
in a most satisfactory and lucid manner by <lb/>
a recent writer on the subject. <lb/></p> 

<p>The estimated revenue for 1866 amount<lb break="no"/>ed to $1,631,500; from that amount must be <lb/>
deducted the sum of $155,000, being the <lb/>
amount included in the estimate as revenue <lb/>
derivable from the departments of mines, <lb/>
casual revenue, gold fields, and <lb/>
the Hospital of the Insane which remain <lb/>
under the management of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and contribute to the local fund. <lb/>
That would leave the balance of the estima<lb break="no"/>ted revenue which will pass under the con<lb break="no"/>trol of the general government at $1,476,<lb break="no"/>500—from this must be deducted the con<lb break="no"/>tribution as above stated to be made to our <lb/>
local revenues $324,000, which will leave to <lb/>
be disbursed by this government $1,152,000. <lb/>
We have, therefore, for general and <lb/>

<cb/>

local revenue taking the estimate as<lb/>
selected by the hon. gentleman himself as <lb/>
a basis, the following sums <lb/></p>

<p>Now, sir, let us see how these sums are <lb/>

is the $1,152,000 transferred to the control of <lb/>
the General Government paid? Is it in Ca<lb break="no"/>nada or to Canadian people? No, sir, but in <lb/>
Nova Scotia and to Nova Scotians. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman will admit, indeed it is the <lb/>

transferred to the General Government <lb/>
would be sustained as now. These servi<lb break="no"/>ces then are as follows: <lb/></p>

leaving a balance of merely $50,000 as the <lb/>
only contribution by this Province towards <lb/>
the construction of the Intercolonial Road— <lb/>
a work which the hon. gentleman and the <lb/>
Government of which he was a member <lb/>
considered so essential to the interest of <lb/>
this country, that they were willing to mort<lb break="no"/>gage a very large proportion of the revenues <lb/>
of the country forever to construct not our <lb/>
own fair proportion of the road, but 50 or 100 <lb/>
miles with New Brunswick. <lb/></p> 

<p>But if we take the actual expenditure of <lb/>
this year in some of the servicys named, in<lb break="no"/>stead of the estimated amount, what do we <lb/>
find? We find, sir, that the amount paid <lb/>
greatly exceeds the estimate, and that in <lb/>
reality, instead of a balance of $50,000, there <lb/>
would be a deficiency on the side of the Ge<lb break="no"/>

neral Government. Let us compare some <lb/>
of these. The militia service was estima<lb break="no"/>ted to cost $80,000; it cost in reality <lb/>
about $138,000, or $58,000 in excess <lb/>
of the estimate. The several ser<lb break="no"/>vices under the Board of Works, <lb/>
including St. Peter's Canal, were esti<lb break="no"/>mated to cost $180,320: the expenditure of <lb/>
the year was $284,017, being an excess of <lb/>
$93,697. I need not compare the estimate <lb/>
and expenditure on the other items, but the <lb/>
House will see that on these two services <lb/>
alone there is over $151,000, or three times <lb/>
the sum which by the first calculation ap<lb break="no"/>peared to go into the general treasury with<lb break="no"/>out an equivalent. Nor is this all, for it <lb/>
must be remembered that the cost of the <lb/>
construction of the Intercolonial Railway <lb/>
must come out of the general revenue. It <lb/>
will be therefore seen that the Province ac<lb break="no"/>tually receives more than she puts into the <lb/>
general fund, and sufficient besides to pay <lb/>
her proportion of the Intercolonial Railway <lb/>
debt. I challenge the hon. gentleman to <lb/>
refute a single statement 1 have made. If <lb/>
he is unable to do so, and he knows he is, <lb/>
what becomes of the whole fabric he has <lb/>
built upon his financial argument, on which <lb/>
he is now content to rest his opposition? <lb/></p> 

<p><hi rendition="simple:centre"><hi rendition="simple:bold">Speech of Mr. S. Campbell.</hi></hi><lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPELL</persName>:—At this late hour, and <lb/>
after the fatigues of a long day, and in an <lb/>
atmosphere to say the least of it oppressive <lb/>
I proceed to perform the duty accorded to <lb/>
me by my friends and by the courtesy of <lb/>
the House to conclude this debate, and I <lb/>
feel upon the present occasion as I felt in <lb/>
my previous address, that my present office <lb/>
and responsibility place me in conflict with <lb/>
great odds. I feel that I have great anta<lb break="no"/>gonists both within and without these walls, <lb/>
but I am at the same time assured that I <lb/>
have the warm and hearty concurrence of <lb/>
the people to sustain me. I believe I have <lb/>
a righteous cause and I know that— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>"Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just, <lb/>
And he but naked, though locked up in steel, <lb/>
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Hence, sir, I feel emboldened in proceed<lb break="no"/>ing in my present task, and I shall take the <lb/>
liberty at starting to review some of the ob<lb break="no"/>servations which have been made by gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who have preceded me before I <lb/>
remark upon the main question which this <lb/>
amendment discloses. The first name I <lb/>
find on my notes is that of a gentleman who <lb/>
stands high in this country in point of rank <lb/>
and talent; I mean the Prov. Sec'y, and I <lb/>
may say I think it would have become <lb/>
that gentleman to have pursued a different <lb/>
course in reference to an absent rival. I <lb/>

<cb/>

am not the apologist or champion of Mr. <lb/>
Howe but I claim the honor of his personal <lb/>
friendship. I am an admirer of his because <lb/>
I believe him to be a valuable public man <lb/>
and a pure-souled patriot. I deprecate the <lb/>
course taken by the Prov. Sec'y., in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to Mr. Howe because he is absent. <lb/>
There are those among us who have met <lb/>
him in conflict, and I wish heartily that he <lb/>
was here to repel the charges which have <lb/>
been made against his consistency and <lb/>
patriotism. We would not try the meanest <lb/>
criminal at the bar of justice in his absence; <lb/>
common decency would repudiate such a <lb/>
monstrous procedure, but here, in reference <lb/>
to that gentleman who is absent from his <lb/>
native land on a mission connected with <lb/>
its best interest, who Curtius like has cast <lb/>
himself into a wide and deep chasm for his <lb/>
country's sake, it is thought not indecorous <lb/>
to put him on trial and to ask the country to <lb/>
condemn him. <lb/></p> 

<p>Sir, this is entirely wrong. But not con<lb break="no"/>tent with pouring the vials of his wrath <lb/>
upon Mr. Howe, the Prov. Sec'y., went on <lb/>
to refer to the capitalists of the city in terms <lb/>
which cannot be justified by their character <lb/>
or their conduct. And who, sir, are these <lb/>
capitalists? Are they not the men who <lb/>
have been at the back of the hon. gentleman <lb/>
in many a fierce political encounter, and <lb/>
who, on such occasions, have rendered him <lb/>
effectual service? He was therefore guilty <lb/>
of ingratitude of the blackest dye in endea<lb break="no"/>voring to make them the objects of odium <lb/>
and scandal before the country. The capi<lb break="no"/>talists of this city, sir, have a deep stake in <lb/>
the interest of Nova Scotia; their lot is cast <lb/>
here for all time; and if the city or province <lb/>
prosper, their means must be correspondingly <lb/>
enlarged. To say that they are actuated by <lb/>
the sordid motives that were asserted, is a <lb/>
libel on them which I feel called on to <lb/>
throw back in the teeth of the man who <lb/>
made it. I am not bound to them by any <lb/>
considerations or connection, but as they <lb/>
have no one here willing, although bound, <lb/>
to answer in their name, l cannot but take <lb/>
notice and vindicate them from the gross <lb/>
calumny which we have heard. <lb/></p> 

<p>Next we were told that the petitions pre<lb break="no"/>sented here at the last Session numbered <lb/>
but a few thousands. I well recollect the <lb/>
circumstances under which those petitions <lb/>
were withdrawn from general signature. <lb/>
While they were being circulated for that <lb/>
purpose the country was told by members <lb/>
of this House, and their partizans elsewhere, <lb/>
that Confederation would not be brought <lb/>
here; that the Government dare not bring <lb/>
it here; and I think I might bring it to the <lb/>

recollection of one of the delegates that he <lb/>
proclaimed the opinion that the subject <lb/>
would not be presented to us for many <lb/>
years. It was under these and other cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances that the people ceased petition<lb break="no"/>ing, and but for the representations I have <lb/>
referred to, the number would have reached <lb/>
that of those which were sent across the <lb/>
water. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Provincial Secretary, in referring to <lb/>
the scheme, touched upon one important <lb/>
topic—the fisheries. My constituents, Sir, <lb/>
are deeply interested in that branch of in<lb break="no"/>dustry—none more so, perhaps, except those <lb/>
of the county of Halifax, and what is the <lb/>
history of Confederation in that aspect? <lb/>
How damagingly has Canadian influence <lb/>
operated on those engaged in the fisheries <lb/>
of the country? Every one knows that they <lb/>
have been sold and sacrificed; and wheth<lb break="no"/>er it be Canadian or Imperial agency that <lb/>
has been at work, I care not—the melan<lb break="no"/>choly fact remains: our fisheries and our <lb/>
fishermen have been sold. This, Sir, is a <lb/>
foretaste of the fruits of Confederation—this <lb/>
is a specimen of the policy that will be pur<lb break="no"/>sued in reference to the many other inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the Maritime Provinces when it suits <lb/>
the objects of the new " Dominion." There <lb/>
is no man, young or old, engaged in the <lb/>
prosecution of the fisheries, and dependent <lb/>
upon them for his support, but has this mel<lb break="no"/>ancholy conviction forced upon his mind— <lb/>
that to be a British subject is to occupy a <lb/>
position inferior to that of an American. All <lb/>
that valuable property which the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture has been from year to year declaring <lb/>
to be the peculiar possesion of the country <lb/>
has been transferred for a consideration too <lb/>
paltry and contemptible to mention. Every <lb/>
member here who has fishermen for his <lb/>
constituents must feel that this Canadian <lb/>
policy should induce him to pause a long <lb/>
time before giving his assent to this Union. <lb/></p> 

<p>I now come to that part of the Provincial <lb/>
Secretary's observations which relate to a <lb/>
gentleman who, though he is here, is de<lb break="no"/>barred from answering for himself, inas<lb break="no"/>much as he has exhausted the privileges <lb/>
which the rules accord to him. The so<lb break="yes"/>called annexation sentiments of the hon. <lb/>
member for East Halifax have been pro<lb break="no"/>claimed by the Provincial Secretary. I un<lb break="no"/>derstood my hon. friend to say this: " I do <lb/>
not wish to be an American, I wish to be <lb/>
a British subject—I wish to remain a Nova <lb/>
Scotian, and to enjoy my birthright and my <lb/>
constitutional freedom as such; I do not <lb/>
wish to be a Canadian." That is the whole <lb/>
extent of the ground on which this charge <lb/>
of annexation sentiments has been founded <lb/>

<cb/>

and sought to be fastened upon the hon. <lb/>
member. The next name on my list is the <lb/>
hon. member for Inverness, who referred to <lb/>
a topic that is very distasteful to me, be<lb break="no"/>cause it refers to a state of mind and inten<lb break="no"/>tion which it is derogatory to the honor of <lb/>
this House to suppose that any member of <lb/>
the House is moved by—that is, the matter <lb/>
of corruption. As I have said, the topic is <lb/>
derogatory to us, it is distasteful to me, and <lb/>
I will pass it by with only this remark—let <lb/>
the people be our judge. But the hon. <lb/>
member thought he had made a great point <lb/>
when he asked it we had the machinery <lb/>
for testing this question at the polls, taking <lb/>
into consideration the population of the va<lb break="no"/>rious counties, and the number of members <lb/>
returned. But he forgot that that is the ma<lb break="no"/>chinery by which this House is constituted, <lb/>
under any and all circumstances and in re<lb break="no"/>lation to every question, and therefore l <lb/>
consider that his analysis of the population <lb/>
and representation of the several constitu<lb break="no"/>encies was no proof in support of his posi<lb break="no"/>tion. Then the hon. member spoke of the <lb/>
union of Cape Breton with this Province; <lb/>
but he forgot to tell us, as he should have <lb/>
done, that at that time the island had no re<lb break="no"/>presentative institutions; its affairs were <lb/>
managed by the Governor and Council, and <lb/>
its people were not represented at all. The <lb/>
people of the island were therefore elevated <lb/>
in the scale of constitutional freedom when <lb/>
their interests were placed under the protec<lb break="no"/>tion of representatives duly elected by them. <lb/>
I now come to the hon. member for Halifax <lb/>
(Mr. Shannon). He greatly mistook the re<lb break="no"/>ference which I made to the period and the <lb/>
doings of Nero. I meant and made no al<lb break="no"/>lusion at all to the proceedings of the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament, in connection with the <lb/>
merry-making in which the "speech" call<lb break="no"/>ed us to join, but my remarks were aimed <lb/>
at the concocters of that speech. It was in <lb/>
connection with the proposed rejoicings that <lb/>
I made the reference to the tyrant who, in <lb/>
the midst of a calamity such as never af<lb break="no"/>flicted this Province, saw such great reason <lb/>
for merriment. The hon. gentleman then <lb/>
went on to give us a glowing picture of the <lb/>
period when Confederation was consum<lb break="no"/>mated in this Province. He told his con<lb break="no"/>stituents through this House: " You farm<lb break="no"/>ers, you fishermen, you artizans, all of you <lb/>
are to get a double price for all the wares <lb/>
and commodities you bring to market." On <lb/>
what grounds has he made such an asser<lb break="no"/>tion? Has he offered us any grounds for <lb/>
it? Am I to suppose that this is all clap<lb break="no"/>trap intended to influence a constituency <lb/>
on the approach of an election? I cannot <lb/></p>

<pb n="63" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0063.jpg"/> 
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">63</fw>

<p>imagine any other reason for such a state<lb break="no"/>ment. Then, again, he told us that the la<lb break="no"/>boring men of the city of Halifax under<lb break="no"/>stand this question well, and are going to <lb/>
be greatly benefited by Confederation. I <lb/>
ask, do not the merchants who give these <lb/>
men their living understand the question at <lb/>
least as well? Is it not the interest of the <lb/>
merchants to advance the general prosperi<lb break="no"/>ty, and how is it that they are opposed to <lb/>
the scheme? Do men generally act in op<lb break="no"/>position to their interests? No; they are <lb/>
men of intelligence, and from north to south <lb/>
of this city they in a very large proportion <lb/>
reject the measure. <lb/></p> 

<p>Then we were told that Confederation <lb/>
would keep all the young men in the coun<lb break="no"/>try; if the hon. member's expectations are <lb/>
realized the young men will be too nume<lb break="no"/>rous, and Nova Scotia will be too small a <lb/>
field for them. To this I answer the world <lb/>
is wide enough. There is the neighboring <lb/>
Republic, to which many of them have al<lb break="no"/>ready repaired, and in which they have <lb/>
raised themselves to positions of eminence <lb/>
and wealth. I am reminded in this con<lb break="no"/>nection of one who has become one of the <lb/>
most eminent shipbuilders in the world. <lb/>
He went from one of our western counties. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHUR2">MR. CHURCHILL</persName>.—He failed at last. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPBELL</persName>.—Perhaps so; but has <lb/>
he not benefitted the world in the mean<lb break="no"/>time? It would seem from the speech of <lb/>
the. hon. member for Halifax (Mr. Tobin) <lb/>
that he, too, is impressed with the same <lb/>
notion that Nova Scotia is not large enough <lb/>
for our young men. The Dominion is to <lb/>
enlarge the field, but they can go to any <lb/>
part of the new Dominion now. I come <lb/>
now to the Financial Secretary, who has <lb/>
entitled himself to special notice at my <lb/>
hands, having extended to me a certain <lb/>
class of civilities rendering such recognition <lb/>
necessary. He termed me " a mere colo<lb break="no"/>nial lawyer." Let me ask what he is? Is <lb/>
he so puffed up by being placed in his pre<lb break="no"/>sent position, and by having been sent on <lb/>
an unnecessary and expensive delegation <lb/>
abroad, and having so little to do at home <lb/>
that he can afford to sneer at members of <lb/>
his own profession, and endeavour to dero<lb break="no"/>gate from their position by the contemptible <lb/>
epithet he has used? Sir, let him bear in <lb/>
mind that his position is but for a day. He <lb/>
also charged me with recklessness and <lb/>
audacity in my views and expressions. <lb/>
Sir, as a British subject, and a British free<lb break="no"/>man, I shall entertain any opinion that may <lb/>
commend itself to my judgment, and will <lb/>
express that opinion as freely as I please. <lb/></p> 

<p>Annexation to the United States, says the <lb/>

<cb/>

hon member, is the object of gentlemen on <lb/>
his side. The hon. gentleman, in so saying <lb/>
ventured on a statement as untrue as it was <lb/>
bold. No man shall venture with impunity to <lb/>
hurl that charge at us, or convey without <lb/>
challenge the imputation of disloyalty. Dis<lb break="no"/>loyalty is no part of my nature—it has marked <lb/>
no act of my public career. I am willing <lb/>
to lay down my life—to shed the last drop of <lb/>
my blood, on behalf of the country in which my <lb/>
lot is cast, and with whose fortunes my best af<lb break="no"/>fections are entwined; but at the same time I <lb/>
know my rights, and shall take every constitu<lb break="no"/>tional means to vindicate them. And, sir, let <lb/>
me remind the hon. member that I am not paid <lb/>
for my loyalty—it is an inborn principle; it is <lb/>
not of that spurious kind which is fed upon and <lb/>
fattened by the sweets and solids of the public <lb/>
treasury. <lb/></p> 

<p>Again, the hon. member says, "If the people <lb/>
feel any embarrassment in the consideration of <lb/>
the question, would it not be wise in them to <lb/>
take the opinion and to act upon the conclusion <lb/>
of those standing at the head of affairs on the <lb/>
other side of the water?" Sir, I do not admit <lb/>
that he has the right to call on a free people liv<lb break="no"/>ing under constitutional government to forego <lb/>
their own indubitable privilege and to commit <lb/>
the decision of any question, much less the pre<lb break="no"/>sent one, to any other than themselves. They <lb/>
are clothed from their very birth, with the pri<lb break="no"/>vilege of deciding upon every question that can <lb/>
possibly arise; and though it has been not only <lb/>
insinuatcd but asserted that they are ignorant, I <lb/>
know well this fact, that in every county in the <lb/>
Province there are fifty-five men to be found <lb/>
quite as capable of giving a righteous decision on <lb/>
the present question as the fifty-five members <lb/>
who compose this house. I insist, therefore, <lb/>
that the people ought not to be content to leave <lb/>
this question to any arbitrament in which their <lb/>
voices are not heard. <lb/></p> 

<p>Before passing from this portion of the hon. <lb/>
member's remarks, let me present to the house <lb/>
my idea of some of the hon. gentleman's reasons <lb/>
for raking up these phantom charges about an<lb break="no"/>nexation and disloyalty. The hon. member <lb/>
knew what was the inborn, ordinary and natural <lb/>
feeling of a great portion of the people of the <lb/>
county that he nominally represents. Scotch<lb break="no"/>men, he knew, were distinguished for their pat<lb break="no"/>riotism, and he thought it might be advantage<lb break="no"/>ous, in view of his own dubious position, to <lb/>
excite the hostile feelings of the men of that <lb/>
nationality by charging upon the opponents of <lb/>
Confederation the aims and sentiments to which <lb/>
I have referred. But, sir, to retort upon the hon. <lb/>
member, let me ask, not what have been his views <lb/>
or his sentiments, but what has been his conduct? <lb/>
He has done his utmost to denude his Scot<lb break="no"/>tish friends and constituents of the inconstitution<lb break="no"/>al liberties. When I think of this, I feel bound <lb/>
to tell him, though it may not be a very com<lb break="no"/>fortable piece of information for him to bear <lb/>
in his remembrance, that, Scotchmen every<lb break="no"/>where are like the guarded emblem of their <lb/>
never-conquered land, and are ever ready to <lb/>

<pb n="64" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1867-03-19_Page_0064.jpg"/>
<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:centre">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</hi></fw>
<fw type="num">64</fw>

meet the foe who wantonly would tread upon or <lb/>
rudely touch the foliage or the flower of their <lb/>
freedom. (Hear.) They will not be Scotchmen <lb/>
if, when he again ventures to approach them, <lb/>
he does not feel the thrust of their indignation <lb/>
piercing the very marrow of his political ex<lb break="no"/>istence. <lb/></p> 

<p>I now come, sir, to the gist of the amend<lb break="no"/>ment—the constitutional question, as it has <lb/>
been called; and let me ask if this is a subject <lb/>
in the consideration of which we are to be met <lb/>
with an objection, what I cannot but call a <lb/>
constitutional quibble? We have been repea<lb break="no"/>tedly and vauntingly told that we have shown <lb/>
no precedent that would justify the House in <lb/>
adopting the amendment I have had the honor <lb/>
to propose. To this quibble, sir, I offer in re<lb break="no"/>ply the sustantial precedent of common sense. <lb/>
It will be time enough when these expounders <lb/>
of constitutional law furnish me with a state <lb/>
of things similar to that existing in relation <lb/>
to this question—it will, I, say be time enough <lb/>
to produce the now impossible precedent. Sir, <lb/>
the question of Confederation is upon us—it is <lb/>
widely regarded as a new and unprecedented <lb/>
malady, endangering the entire body politic,— <lb/>
and how is it to be met? It must be dealt with <lb/>
out of the usual course,—no ordinary applica<lb break="no"/>tions would be reasonable or wise; it urgently <lb/>
demands the freest treatment, and no treat<lb break="no"/>ment seems to me more prudent or consonant <lb/>
with wisdom than the one which I propose in <lb/>
the amendment. This branch of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture must, according to the principles of its con<lb break="no"/>stitution, terminate its existence in the course <lb/>
of a very few weeks. Every member of this <lb/>
House will then be called on to meet his con<lb break="no"/>stituents face to face. What, I ask, even in re<lb break="no"/>ference to the position and prospects of the Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration itself, can possibly transpire be<lb break="no"/>tween the present period and the period of <lb/>
that inevitable election to induce the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to oppose the postponement of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion until then? <lb/></p> 

<p>I must not be understood as wishing to <lb/>
take the final decision of the question out of <lb/>
the hands of the Legislature, but let the mat<lb break="no"/>ter remain as it is, let the public business go <lb/>
on to completion, and after that is done let the <lb/>
people as is customary and constitutional re<lb break="no"/>cord their votes, and let the result of that elec<lb break="no"/>tion be their decision of this question. If fa<lb break="no"/>vorable let it finaliy incorporated into law <lb/>
when our successors come here. There is and <lb/>
there can be no other question pending in the <lb/>
country of greater importance than this, and I <lb/>
assert that the electors are intelligent enough <lb/>
to decide it on its own merits. With their ver<lb break="no"/>dict I shall be satisfied. This is no sudden im<lb break="no"/>pulse with me—this is no factious view. From <lb/>
the first moment that the question of union <lb/>
was mooted I have given expression to the <lb/>
same unchangeable sentiment—and in doing <lb/>
so I of course advocated a proceeding that <lb/>
would have the effect, if adopted, of abridging <lb/>
the term of my own parliamentary existence. <lb/>
Particularly do I consider it as disonourable <lb/>
in the extreme to adopt any other course than <lb/>
the one I advocate inasmuch as gentlemen <lb/>
here in favor of this measure well know that <lb/>
they are acting in opposition to their own con<lb break="no"/>victions of the existing feeling throughout the <lb/>
Province. In several counties public meet<lb break="no"/>ings have been held which have been attended, <lb/>

<cb/>

not by men of one party, but by men repre<lb break="no"/>senting every political class; and no man can <lb/>
be ignorant of the sentiment which those gen<lb break="no"/>eral gatherings enunciated. The opinions and <lb/>
wishes of other counties have also in other <lb/>
modes been unmistakeably expressed. It is, <lb/>
therefore, tyrannical, wrong and unjust in the <lb/>
extreme, with that conviction on the minds of <lb/>
members, to refuse the people the ordinary <lb/>
right of passing on a measure that is to affect <lb/>
them and children forever. What is the end <lb/>
and object of government but the happiness <lb/>
and welfare of the people? Governments are <lb/>
not institutions created for the purpose of ham<lb break="no"/>pering a few officials, but to enlarge the inter<lb break="no"/>ests and promote the prosperity of the coun<lb break="no"/>try in entire subordination to the well under<lb break="no"/>stood wishes of the people. Is this measure, <lb/>
regarded in that aspect, in the least degree <lb/>
likely to secure that much desired end? Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, I have from the outset of this debate <lb/>
purposely abstained from going into the gener<lb break="no"/>al question of Confederation, the resolution I <lb/>
have submitted affirms the one grand princi<lb break="no"/>ple that the question should not be decided <lb/>
until the people are heard upon it at the polls. <lb/></p> 

<p>I might have pointed out many incongrui<lb break="no"/>ties and unsound and unjust provisions, and <lb/>
many others likely to produce dissentions in <lb/>
the dominion about to be erected, but <lb/>
I have preferred confining myself to the simple <lb/>
but sound principle of appealing first to the <lb/>
people of this country to ask them, the sov<lb break="no"/>ereign people as I will call them, whether they <lb/>
will have this Union—this Dominion—or not? <lb/>
I cannot close, however, and resume my seat <lb/>
without this single observation. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment are about to pass, or expect ere long to <lb/>
see enacted this measure of Union. When <lb/>
passed and enacted will it be worth the paper <lb/>
on which it is printed if the minds and the <lb/>
hearts of the people do not endorse it. Is it <lb/>
merely a stretch of the imagination to fancy <lb/>
a majority returned in opposition to the <lb/>
principles of the bill,—may we not justly an<lb break="no"/>ticipate that contingency? And what then? <lb/>
Why of course that there will be an agitation <lb/>
wide and violent for the repeal of this union. <lb/>
In what temper and under what pledge will <lb/>
the representatives of the people come from <lb/>
the polls? by a large majority this house, <lb/>
or the house to succeed it, will be composed <lb/>
of the men opposed to Confederation. Do <lb/>
you suppose, sir, that the sense of wrong <lb/>
and injustice will so soon be effaced from <lb/>
their hearts and memories? No the same con<lb break="no"/>victions that operate now will operate then <lb/>
with tenfold force, and lamentable will be the <lb/>
condition of disorder and confusion in which <lb/>
public matters will then be involved. It is <lb/>
surely more than wise to avoid this almost <lb/>
certain consummation. I ask the house to <lb/>
consider its position and its duty in that view. <lb/>
This argument I feel should operate favorably <lb/>
upon the vote to-night. I conclude, sir, with <lb/>
the hope, sincere and ardent, that the course <lb/>
taken on this occasion may not produce any <lb/>
such fatal result. At all events, if it should, I <lb/>
shall have the consolation that I have done <lb/>
my best to avert it by submitting the amend<lb break="no"/>ment I have the honor to pro pose. <lb/></p>

<!-- DL 2018-05-03 commented out below as it is not part of this debate day -->

<!--<p>WEDNESDAY, March 20. <lb/></p> 

<p>The House met at 3 p. m. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. PROV. SECRETARY moved the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of committee for the nomination <lb/>
of standing committees. <lb/></p> 

<p>MONEY VOTES. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. COLIN CAMPBELL said he had a num<lb break="no"/>ber of petitions to present in relation to mo<lb break="no"/>ney grants; the practice, he said, had been <lb/>
for gentlemen to hand them to the Financial <lb/>
Secretary in the House, stating the object; <lb/>
he enquired whether that course was to be <lb/>
pursued this season. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. FIN. SEC'Y said that the rule requir<lb break="no"/>ed that such petitions should go to the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, but members had been in the <lb/>
practice of presenting them in the House, <lb/>
so that the petitioners might see that they <lb/>
had not been neglected. The same end <lb/>
would be answered if gentlemen sent them <lb/>
in privately, and a weekly list could be <lb/>
laid on the table. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. PROV. SEC'Y and Mr. LOCKE urged <lb/>
the adoption of a uniform course in such <lb/>
matters. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. FIN. SEC'Y stated that the course <lb/>
which he proposed would be expected to <lb/>
be adopted by members of the House, and <lb/>
he would prepare such a list as he had <lb/>
mentioned. <lb/></p> 

<p>ANSWER TO THE ADDRESS PRESENTED. <lb/></p> 

<p>The House then proceeded to Govern<lb break="no"/>ment House to present the Answer to the <lb/>
Address of his Excellency at the opening <lb/>
of the session. The Speaker, upon their <lb/>
return, announced that his Excellency had <lb/>
been pleased to make reply, thanking the <lb/>
House for their Address, and stating that <lb/>
the important matters mentioned therein <lb/>
would receive the most careful consider<lb break="no"/>ation. <lb/></p> 

<p>FINANCIAL STATEMENT. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. FIN. SECRETARY said: In laying <lb/>
upon the table the Trade Returns for the <lb/>
year ending 30th September, 1866, I feel <lb/>
pleased at being able to congratulate the <lb/>
House upon the prosperity of the country. <lb/>
That prosperity, it was at one time feared, <lb/>
would have been largely affected by the <lb/></p> 

<p>10 <lb/>

<cb/>

diminution of commercial intercourse from <lb/>
the abrogation of the Reciprocity treaty, but <lb/>
an examination will shew that our commer<lb break="no"/>cial relations present an aspect of prosperi<lb break="no"/>ty truly gratifying to every friend of his <lb/>
country. The returns, I may here state, <lb/>
exhibit an increase of revenue during the <lb/>
last year as compared with 1865 of $185,815. <lb/>
The revenue of 1865 produced $1,040,583, <lb/>
the total receipts of last year being $1,226.-<lb break="maybe"/>198, shewing an increase to the amount <lb/>
mentioned, and embracing all duties from <lb/>
customs and excise, with exception of ex<lb break="no"/>cise on the two items of tobacco and ale, <lb/>
the one being $3178 and the other $2324. <lb/>
Therefore the whole duty of customs under <lb/>
the existing law was $1,226,398, and of ex<lb break="no"/>cise $5,402, being altogether $1,231,902. <lb/>
The next question of importance is the <lb/>
source from which the revenue has been <lb/>
derived; and the House will permit me as <lb/>
a matter of curiosity, if not of profit, to re<lb break="no"/>view the progress which the country has <lb/>
made, and the regular expansion of its trade <lb/>
in the last few years, as is indicated by the <lb/>
consumption of dutiable goods. This is <lb/>
shewn by a short review of the gradually <lb/>
increasing receipts, because I need not tell <lb/>
gentlemen accustomed to deal with trade <lb/>
that there can be no safer indication of the <lb/>
prosperity of a country—no surer index of <lb/>
the progress that a people are making than <lb/>
a gradually increasing ability to buy large<lb break="no"/>ly those necessaries and luxuries which go <lb/>
into the general consumption of the people. <lb/></p> 

<p>The amount of revenue receivable depends<lb/>
on the population which is to buy, and the<lb/>
ability of that population to pay. In some<lb/>
countries of the same population a smaller <lb/>
revenue would have been obtained, and the <lb/>
increase of the latter, as compared with the <lb/>
increase of the former, shewed most clearly <lb/>
that the country was increasing and expand<lb break="no"/>ing in wealth and prosperity. In 1850 the <lb/>
revenue derived from customs and excise was <lb/>
only $322,778—not quite a fourth of the re<lb break="no"/>venue of to-day. In 1851 the amount receiv<lb break="no"/>ed was $375,052 from the same source. A <lb/>
fairer comparison perhaps will be to take the <lb/>
customs duties of a more recent period, when <lb/>
the circumstances of the country had been <lb/>
affected by the commencement of our rail<lb break="no"/>ways. In 1856 the receipts from customs <lb/>
were $571,588—somewhat more than one third <lb/>
of our present revenue from the same source. <lb/>
This indicates, as I have said, a rapid and <lb/>
sure progress in trade and prosperity. The <lb/>
next features presented by these returns are <lb/>
the sources from which this revenue in de<lb break="no"/>rived, and undoubtedly the accounts shew a <lb/>
peculiarity which at first might strike the <lb/>
house as requiring explanation, and the ex<lb break="no"/>planation for which will appear to every <lb/>
gentleman acquainted with commercial trans<lb break="no"/>actions. The increase in the revenue is, as I <lb/>
have said, $185,000—a large per centage over <lb/>
last year—while the returns shew that the <lb/></p>-->
