A majority of the Press, for<br />

some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasons, are</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> us, and abu-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sing us. We have men of character</span>
<br />
goi<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ng</span> about the country as
lecturers<br />
prejudicing the minds of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span><br />
against us. The Press is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stating</span>
that<br />
this Government has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been guilty</span>
of <br />
fraud, and is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carrying</span> abuse and
slander <br />
to every hamlet. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W</span>e <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">challenge</span> them <br />
to prove it ; and we challenge this <br />
House to put their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">finger</span> upon
an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">act</span> <br />
of fraud, or an act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mal-administra-</span>
<br />
tion, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> dare. Let us bring
in our <br />
accounts before this House. We shrink <br />
from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no</span> responsibility, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> we are glad <br />
to acknowledge our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accountability</span>
to <br />
this House. We are told by my hon. <br />
friend that the Surveyor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span>
has <br />
been here but a few days. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reason</span>
<br />
is, that affection for an indisposed <br />
daughter has called him to his home.<br />
It may be well for my learned<br />
friend, who resides at Fredericton upon<br />
the uncertain tenure of an office in the<br />
Government. My hon. friend had bet-<br />
ter wait and see whether my colleague<br />
has done his duty in that office, and not<br />
condemn him before you know what he<br />
has done. It is an attribute of a just<br />
Judge, that he does not condemn a man<br />
before he is heard. The hon. mover<br />
stands in that position, and he professes<br />
to be entirely unselfish, but I charge<br />
him with wishing to prejudge the Go- <br />
vernment. The Commissioner of the <br />
Board of Works <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occupied</span> that posi-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
tion for many years and is ready, at<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
any time, to resign the office up to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the<br />
</span> people, and has done it ; and he is pre-<br />
pared to show that he has discharged<br />
his duty too. I think we have been<br />
treated unfairly. My hon. friend has<br />
said many offensive things to us, which<br />
I will not to him. When he talks about<br />
mean, low, and decency, I do not wish<br />
to set that gentleman up as a standard<br />
of decency, propriety, and honesty.<br />
His conduct and my conduct are before<br />
the people of the country, and let them<br />
judge, for it is not for us to sound our <br />
own trumpets. A great part of his <br />
speech is made up in setting forth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
<br />
our Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> tremen- <br />
dous attack upon Her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Majesty,</span>
the <br />
Queen. I cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tell whether</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tear</span> <br />
dropped from his eye or not. Some- <br />
thing had been said by the Government. <br />
insulting to Her Majesty. He spoke of <br />
Her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Majesty‘s</span> Ministers as if
they were <br />
superior to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men</span> of this
country. I <br />
respect a man <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occupying</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> high posi- <br />
tion ; but we must not forget, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in our</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admiration</span> for a great name <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> high <br />
sounding titles, that the holders of those <br />
titles are but men. I have, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span>
the <br />
kindness of the people, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> in
commu- <br />
nication with these men, and, while I <br />
paid them every respect, I never <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forgot</span>
<br />
that I was a man myself. A <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man is</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> <br />
a man who forgets himself, and will <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fall</span> down <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worship</span>
any man. In <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minute</span> of Council <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which,</span><br />
he says, is insulting to the Queen.<br />
When a man stands up in his place and<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charges</span> the Government with
delibe-<br />
rately <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">insulting</span> the Queen, we
throw it <br />
back upon him. I can speak more <br />
freely about this, because I was no<br />
party to it. The Attorney General and<br />
myself were in England, where we first<br />
saw it, and we approved of every line<br />
in it, and told, at the office of the Colo-<br />
nial Secretary, that it met our entire<br />

the responsibility of it. Mr. Smith then<br />
read the document, which was an an-<br />
swer to a despatch received from Eng-<br />
land, and which he said he did not see<br />
until it was answered. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">In regard to the charge made against<br />
us of not having published the despatch.<br />
We were commanded to communicate it<br />
to the Legislature at their next meeting.<br />
We did not wait for the next meeting of<br />
the Legislature before communicating it<br />
to the public. I was surprised to hear<br />
the hon. gentleman charge this Govern-<br />
ment will not having given information.<br />
I should like to have him point out to me<br />
how many despatches had been given to<br />
the public when he was a member of the<br />
Government before the Legislature as-<br />
sembled. Despatch after despatch was<br />
was never communicated to the people at<br />
all. This despatch was written on the<br />
24th of June, and published in July. This<br />
despatch was the opinion of Her Majes-<br />
ty's Government upon the Union of the<br />
Colonies, and it was our duty to respect-<br />
fully consider any opinion or suggestion<br />
emanating from so high a source, but at<br />
the same time we must not forget that we<br />
have a country here whose interests are<br />
not identical with those of England. I<br />
told Mr. Cardwell that the people of this<br />
country felt they were better able to judge<br />
this question than the people of England ;<br />
we felt, with all the deference we had for<br />
their opinion, that we ourselves were<br />
more competent to judge in regard to this<br />
matter, for our people had grown up with<br />
the country, and we knew best what would<br />
promote our welfare. There is not a<br />
member of the Cabinet of England that<br />
has ever been to this country, and it is<br />
no disrespect for the people here to say<br />
they understand their own interests beat.<br />
Mr. Cardwell said the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span>
<br />
favored the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme ;</span> we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">replied</span> we had <br />
only found two persons outside the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gov-</span>
<br />
ernment that had ever read the Scheme; <br />
and we attribute a great deal of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feel-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> of the people of England to
the fact <br />
that they assume that after Confedera- <br />
tion is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carr</span>ied they will be
relieved from <br />
some of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ir</span> taxes ; but Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cardwell</span> <br />
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared</span> to admit that was the <br />
only reason for their opinion. Intelli- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gent</span> men out of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sup-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posed</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span>
Union, pure and <br />
simple, was contemplated, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
they ex- <br />
pressed astonishment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> men
could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span><br />
to such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> Scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> the one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">propos-</span> <br />
ed. Mr. Cardwell himself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acknowledged</span>
<br />
that there were many objections to the <br />
scheme ; but said it was the best scheme <br />
which could be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">got now.</span> We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> we <br />
did not think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> right to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accept a</span> thing <br />
we did not want, because it is the best <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> that could be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">got ;</span> we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wanted</span> to <br />
be let alone. No man denied that it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">originated</span> in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessities</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> <br />
The people of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> no <br />
right to be made subservient to <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessities</span> of Canada. <br />
If we could get a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> union upo<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">n <br />
such terms as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fair,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">end</span>

such terms as would be promotive of the <br />
welfare land <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosperity</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this country.,<br />
I would be in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor</span> of it, but I
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will not</span> <br />
consent to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ignore the</span> prosperity
of my <br />
country for the sake of relieving the po- <br />

Mr. Card- <br />
well said the scheme emanated from us. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W</span>e said no. A delegation went to<br />
Canada, but we gave them no authori-<br />

<br />
when the were assailed by him, and <br />
were charged with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> guilty
of a vio- <br />

had no more right to go to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> and <br />

away their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> The people <br />
decided that they had proved <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recreant</span>

power. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman talks</span> about <br />

<br />was a noise and not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">silent.</span> He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span> <br />
silent grumbling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> going on, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> in- <br />
creasing in power, and would hurl this <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span> this House could not be

not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> be, but I think the Gover- <br />
nor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> a right to appeal to the
people <br />
under the Constitution. We are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre-</span>
<br />
pared to go before the people of this <br />
country and let them decide whether our <br />
administration has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not been</span> in
accord- <br />
ance with their interests : and if they <br />
decide against us we will resume our <br />
occupations. We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will not</span> circle this <br />
country and hold meetings in every <br />
school-house. We are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">professional</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">less </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">professional</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politicians</span> we have in<br />
this country the better for its welfare. <br />
It is put forth in the Times that not only<br />
the Cabinet are in favor of the scheme,<br />

and thus this eroneous information is <br />
disseminated to the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England.</span>
<br />
They suppose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadas</span> are <br />
now about to be united for the first time, <br />
forgetting that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> formerly
been <br />
under one Legislature. We are charged <br />
with being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> Government of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">traitors,</span> <br />
with no spirit of loyalty, that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are will-</span>
