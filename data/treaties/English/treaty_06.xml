                  <head>Treaty No. 6</head>
          

                     <p>ARTICLES OF A TREATY made and concluded near Carlton on the 23rd
day of August and on the 28th day of said month, respectively, and
near Fort Pitt on the 9th day of September, in the year of Our Lord
one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, between Her Most
Gracious Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, by Her
Commissioners, the Honourable Alexander Morris, Lieutenant-Governor
of the Province of Manitoba and the North-west Territories, and the
Honourable James McKay, and the Honourable William Joseph Christie,
of the one part, and the Plain and Wood Cree and the other Tribes
of Indians, inhabitants of the country within the limits
hereinafter defined and described by their Chiefs, chosen and named
as hereinafter mentioned, of the other part.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Indians inhabiting the said country have, pursuant
to an appointment made by the said Commissioners, been convened at
meetings at Fort Carlton, Fort Pitt and Battle River, to deliberate
upon certain matters of interest to Her Most Gracious Majesty, of
the one part, and the said Indians of the other.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the said Indians have been notified and informed by
Her Majesty's said Commissioners that it is the desire of Her
Majesty to open up for settlement, immigration and such other
purposes as to Her Majesty may seem meet, a tract of country
bounded and described as hereinafter mentioned, and to obtain the
consent thereto of Her Indian subjects inhabiting the said tract,
and to make a treaty and arrange with them, so that there may be
peace and good will between them and Her Majesty, and that they may
know and be assured of what allowance they are to count upon and
receive from Her Majesty's bounty and benevolence.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the Indians of the said tract, duly convened in
council, as aforesaid, and being requested by Her Majesty's said
Commissioners to name certain Chiefs and Headmen, who should be
authorized on their behalf to conduct such negotiations and sign
any treaty to be founded thereon, and to become responsible to Her
Majesty for their faithful performance by their respective Bands of
such obligations as shall be assumed by them, the said Indians have
thereupon named for that purpose, that is to say, representing the
Indians who make the treaty at Carlton, the several Chiefs and
Councillors who have subscribed hereto, and representing the
Indians who make the treaty at Fort Pitt, the several Chiefs and
Councillors who have subscribed hereto.</p>
                     <p>And thereupon, in open council, the different Bands having
presented their Chiefs to the said Commissioners as the Chiefs and
Headmen, for the purposes aforesaid, of the respective Bands of
Indians inhabiting the said district hereinafter described.</p>
                     <p>And whereas, the said Commissioners then and there received and
acknowledged the persons so presented as Chiefs and Headmen, for
the purposes aforesaid, of the respective Bands of Indians
inhabiting the said district hereinafter described.</p>
                     <p>And whereas, the said Commissioners have proceeded to negotiate
a treaty with the said Indians, and the same has been finally
agreed upon and concluded, as follows, that is to say:</p>
                     <p>The Plain and Wood Cree Tribes of Indians, and all other the
Indians inhabiting the district hereinafter described and defined,
do hereby cede, release, surrender and yield up to the Government
of the Dominion of Canada, for Her Majesty the Queen and Her
successors forever, all their rights, titles and privileges,
whatsoever, to the lands included within the following limits, that
is to say:</p>
                     <p>Commencing at the mouth of the river emptying into the
north-west angle of Cumberland Lake; thence westerly up the said
river to its source; thence on a straight line in a westerly
direction to the head of Green Lake; thence northerly to the elbow
in the Beaver River; thence down the said river northerly to a
point twenty miles from the said elbow; thence in a westerly
direction, keeping on a line generally parallel with the said
Beaver River (above the elbow), and about twenty miles distant
therefrom, to the source of the said river; thence northerly to the
north-easterly point of the south shore of Red Deer Lake,
continuing westerly along the said shore to the western limit
thereof; and thence due west to the Athabasca River; thence up the
said river, against the stream, to the Jaspar House, in the Rocky
Mountains; thence on a course south-easterly, following the
easterly range of the mountains, to the source of the main branch
of the Red Deer River; thence down the said river, with the stream,
to the junction therewith of the outlet of the river, being the
outlet of the Buffalo Lake; thence due east twenty miles; thence on
a straight line south-eastwardly to the mouth of the said Red Deer
River on the south branch of the Saskatchewan River; thence
eastwardly and northwardly, following on the boundaries of the
tracts conceded by the several treaties numbered four and five to
the place of beginning.</p>
                     <p>And also, all their rights, titles and privileges whatsoever to
all other lands wherever situated in the North-west Territories, or
in any other Province or portion of Her Majesty's Dominions,
situated and being within the Dominion of Canada.</p>
                     <p>The tract comprised within the lines above described embracing
an area of 121,000 square miles, be the same more or less.</p>
                     <p>To have and to hold the same to Her Majesty the Queen and Her
successors forever.</p>
                     <p>And Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees and undertakes to lay
aside reserves for farming lands, due respect being had to lands at
present cultivated by the said Indians, and other reserves for the
benefit of the said Indians, to be administered and dealt with for
them by Her Majesty's Government of the Dominion of Canada;
provided, all such reserves shall not exceed in all one square mile
for each family of five, or in that proportion for larger or
smaller families, in manner following, that is to say: that the
Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs shall depute and send a
suitable person to determine and set apart the reserves for each
band, after consulting with the Indians thereof as to the locality
which may be found to be most suitable for them.</p>
                     <p>Provided, however, that Her Majesty reserves the right to deal
with any settlers within the bounds of any lands reserved for any
Band as She shall deem fit, and also that the aforesaid reserves of
land, or any interest therein, may be sold or otherwise disposed of
by Her Majesty's Government for the use and benefit of the said
Indians entitled thereto, with their consent first had and
obtained; and with a view to show the satisfaction of Her Majesty
with the behaviour and good conduct of Her Indians, She hereby,
through Her Commissioners, makes them a present of twelve dollars
for each man, woman and child belonging to the Bands here
represented, in extinguishment of all claims heretofore
preferred.</p>
                     <p>And further, Her Majesty agrees to maintain schools for
instruction in such reserves hereby made as to Her Government of
the Dominion of Canada may seem advisable, whenever the Indians of
the reserve shall desire it.</p>
                     <p>Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians that within the
boundary of Indian reserves, until otherwise determined by Her
Government of the Dominion of Canada, no intoxicating liquor shall
be allowed to be introduced or sold, and all laws now in force, or
hereafter to be enacted, to preserve Her Indian subjects inhabiting
the reserves or living elsewhere within Her North-west Territories
from the evil influence of the use of intoxicating liquors, shall
be strictly enforced.</p>
                     <p>Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians that they, the
said Indians, shall have right to pursue their avocations of
hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as
hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from
time to time be made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada,
and saving and excepting such tracts as may from time to time be
required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other
purposes by Her said Government of the Dominion of Canada, or by
any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the said
Government.</p>
                     <p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and Her said Indians,
that such sections of the reserves above indicated as may at any
time be required for public works or buildings, of what nature
soever, may be appropriated for that purpose by Her Majesty's
Government of the Dominion of Canada, due compensation being made
for the value of any improvements thereon.</p>
                     <p>And further, that Her Majesty's Commissioners shall, as soon as
possible after the execution of this treaty, cause to be taken an
accurate census of all the Indians inhabiting the tract above
described, distributing them in families, and shall, in every year
ensuing the date hereof, at some period in each year, to be duly
notified to the Indians, and at a place or places to be appointed
for that purpose within the territory ceded, pay to each Indian
person the sum of $5 per head yearly.</p>
                     <p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians,
that the sum of $1,500.00 per annum shall be yearly and every year
expended by Her Majesty in the purchase of ammunition, and twine
for nets, for the use of the said Indians, in manner following,
that is to say: In the reasonable discretion, as regards the
distribution thereof among the Indians inhabiting the several
reserves, or otherwise, included herein, of Her Majesty's Indian
Agent having the supervision of this treaty.</p>
                     <p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians,
that the following articles shall be supplied to any Band of the
said Indians who are now cultivating the soil, or who shall
hereafter commence to cultivate the land, that is to say: Four hoes
for every family actually cultivating; also, two spades per family
as aforesaid: one plough for every three families, as aforesaid;
one harrow for every three families, as aforesaid; two scythes and
one whetstone, and two hay forks and two reaping hooks, for every
family as aforesaid, and also two axes; and also one cross-cut saw,
one hand-saw, one pit-saw, the necessary files, one grindstone and
one auger for each Band; and also for each Chief for the use of his
Band, one chest of ordinary carpenter's tools; also, for each Band,
enough of wheat, barley, potatoes and oats to plant the land
actually broken up for cultivation by such Band; also for each Band
four oxen, one bull and six cows; also, one boar and two sows, and
one hand-mill when any Band shall raise sufficient grain therefor.
All the aforesaid articles to be given once and for all for the
encouragement of the practice of agriculture among the Indians.</p>
                     <p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians,
that each Chief, duly recognized as such, shall receive an annual
salary of twenty-five dollars per annum; and each subordinate
officer, not exceeding four for each Band, shall receive fifteen
dollars per annum; and each such Chief and subordinate officer, as
aforesaid, shall also receive once every three years, a suitable
suit of clothing, and each Chief shall receive, in recognition of
the closing of the treaty, a suitable flag and medal, and also as
soon as convenient, one horse, harness and waggon.</p>
                     <p>That in the event hereafter of the Indians comprised within this
treaty being overtaken by any pestilence, or by a general famine,
the Queen, on being satisfied and certified thereof by Her Indian
Agent or Agents, will grant to the Indians assistance of such
character and to such extent as Her Chief Superintendent of Indian
Affairs shall deem necessary and sufficient to relieve the Indians
from the calamity that shall have befallen them.</p>
                     <p>That during the next three years, after two or more of the
reserves hereby agreed to be set apart to the Indians shall have
been agreed upon and surveyed, there shall be granted to the
Indians included under the Chiefs adhering to the treaty at
Carlton, each spring, the sum of one thousand dollars, to be
expended for them by Her Majesty's Indian Agents, in the purchase
of provisions for the use of such of the Band as are actually
settled on the reserves and are engaged in cultivating the soil, to
assist them in such cultivation.</p>
                     <p>That a medicine chest shall be kept at the house of each Indian
Agent for the use and benefit of the Indians at the direction of
such agent.</p>
                     <p>That with regard to the Indians included under the Chiefs
adhering to the treaty at Fort Pitt, and to those under Chiefs
within the treaty limits who may hereafter give their adhesion

region), there shall, during three years, after two or more
reserves shall have been agreed upon and surveyed be distributed
each spring among the Bands cultivating the soil on such reserves,
by Her Majesty's Chief Indian Agent for this treaty, in his
discretion, a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars, in the
purchase of provisions for the use of such members of the Band as
are actually settled on the reserves and engaged in the cultivation
of the soil, to assist and encourage them in such cultivation.</p>
                     <p>That in lieu of waggons, if they desire it and declare their
option to that effect, there shall be given to each of the Chiefs
adhering hereto at Fort Pitt or elsewhere hereafter (exclusively of
those in the Carlton district), in recognition of this treaty, as
soon as the same can be conveniently transported, two carts with
iron bushings and tires.</p>
                     <p>And the undersigned Chiefs on their own behalf and on behalf of
all other Indians inhabiting the tract within ceded, do hereby
solemnly promise and engage to strictly observe this treaty, and

of, in and to the territory included within the following limits:
All and singular that portion or tract of land being the north part
of the Land District of Prince Albert, as shown on the maps
published by the Honourable the Minister of the Interior, dated at
Ottawa on the 31st day of August, 1885; the same tract being north

the use of such Indians as are settled on reserves and are engaged
in cultivating the soil, to assist them in such cultivation, that
the expenditure on both of these items shall bear the same
proportion to the number of Indians now treated with as the amounts
for those two items as mentioned in Treaty No. 6 bore to the number
of Indians then treated with. And we solemnly engage to abide by,
carry out and fulfil all the stipulations, obligations and
