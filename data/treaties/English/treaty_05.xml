Government of the Dominion of Canada, for Her Majesty the Queen and
Her successors for ever, all their rights, titles and privileges
whatsoever to the lands included within the following limits, that
is to say:</p>
                  <p>Commencing at the north corner or junction of Treaties Nos. 1
and 3; then easterly along the boundary of Treaty No. 3 to the
"Height of Land," at the northeast corner of the said treaty
limits, a point dividing the waters of the Albany and Winnipeg
Rivers; thence due north along the said "Height of Land " to a
point intersected by the 53Â° of north latitude; and thence
north-westerly to "Favourable Lake"; thence following the east
shore of said lake to its northern limit; thence north-westerly to
the north end of Lake Winnipegoosis; then westerly to the "Height
of Land" called "Robinson's Portage"; thence north-westerly to the
east end of "Cross Lake"; thence north-westerly crossing "Foxes
Lake"; thence north-westerly to the north end of "Split Lake";
thence south-westerly to "Pipestone Lake," on "Burntwood River ";

all territory within the said limits, and all islands on all lakes
within the said limits, as above described; and it being also
understood that in all cases where lakes form the treaty limits,
ten miles from the shore of the lake should be included in the
treaty.</p>
                  <p>And also all their rights, titles and privileges whatsoever to
all other lands wherever situated in the North-west Territories or
in any other Province or portion of Her Majesty's dominions
situated and being within the Dominion of Canada;</p>
                  <p>The tract comprised within the lines above described, embracing
an area of one hundred thousand square miles, be the same more or
less;</p>
                  <p>To have and to hold the same to Her Majesty the Queen, and Her
successors forever;</p>
                  <p>And Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees and undertakes to lay
aside reserves for farming lands, due respect being had to lands at
present cultivated by the said Indians, and other reserves for the
benefit of the said Indians, to be administered and dealt with for
them by Her Majesty's Government of the Dominion of Canada,
provided all such reserves shall not exceed in all one hundred and
sixty acres for each family of five, or in that proportion for
larger or smaller families-in manner following, that is to say: For
the Band of "Saulteaux, in the Beren's River" region, now settled
or who may within two years settle therein, a reserve commencing at
the outlet of Beren's River into Lake Winnipeg, and extending along
the shores of said lake, and up said river and into the interior
behind said lake and river, so as to comprehend one hundred and
sixty acres for each family of five, a reasonable addition being,
however, to be made by Her Majesty to the extent of the said
reserve for the inclusion in the tract so reserved of swamp, but
reserving the free navigation of the said lake and river, and free
access to the shores and waters thereof, for Her Majesty and all
Her subjects, and expecting thereout such land as may have been
granted to or stipulated to be held by the "Hudson Bay Company,"
and also such land as Her Majesty or Her successors, may in Her
good pleasure, see fit to grant to the Mission established at or
near Beren's River by the Methodist Church of Canada, for a church,
school-house, parsonage, burial ground and farm, or other mission
purposes; and to the Indians residing at Poplar River, falling into
Lake Winnipeg north of Beren's River, a reserve not exceeding one
hundred and sixty acres to each family of five, respecting, as much
as possible, their present improvements:</p>
                  <p>And inasmuch as a number of the Indians now residing in and
about Norway House of the band of whom David Rundle is Chief are
desirous of removing to a locality where they can cultivate the
soil, Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees to lay aside a reserve on
the west side of Lake Winnipeg, in the vicinity of Fisher River, so
as to give one hundred acres to each family of five, or in that
proportion for larger or smaller families, who shall remove to the
said locality within "three years," it being estimated that ninety
families or thereabout will remove within the said period, and that
a reserve will be laid aside sufficient for that or the actual
number; and it is further agreed that those of the band who remain
in the vicinity of "Norway House" shall retain for their own use
their present gardens, buildings and improvements, until the same
be departed with by the Queen's Government, with their consent
first had and obtained, for their individual benefit, if any value
can be realized therefore:</p>
                  <p>And with regard to the Band of Wood Indians, of whom
Ta-pas-ta-num, or Donald William Sinclair Ross, is Chief, a reserve
at Otter Island, on the west side of Cross Lake, of one hundred and
sixty acres for each family of five or in that proportion for
smaller families-reserving, however, to Her Majesty, Her successors
and Her subjects the free navigation of all lakes and rivers and
free access to the shores thereof; Provided, however, that Her
Majesty reserves the right to deal with any settlers within the
bounds of any lands reserved for any band as She shall deem fit,
and also that the aforesaid reserves of land or any interest
therein may be sold or otherwise disposed of by Her Majesty's
Government for the use and benefit of the said Indians entitled
thereto, with their consent first had and obtained.</p>
                  <p>And with a view to show the satisfaction of Her Majesty with the
behaviour and good conduct of Her Indians, She hereby, through Her
Commissioners, makes them a present of five dollars for each man,
woman and child belonging to the bands here represented, in
extinguishment of all claims heretofore preferred.</p>
                  <p>And further, Her Majesty agrees to maintain schools for
instruction in such reserves hereby made as to Her Government of
the Dominion of Canada may seem advisable, whenever the Indians of
the reserve shall desire it.</p>
                  <p>Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians, that within
the boundary of Indian reserves, until otherwise determined by Her
Government of the Dominion of Canada, no intoxicating liquor shall
be allowed to be introduced or sold, and all laws now in force, or
hereafter to be enacted, to preserve Her Indian subjects inhabiting
the reserves, or living elsewhere within Her North-west
Territories, from the evil influence of the use of intoxicating
liquors, shall be strictly enforced.</p>
                  <p>Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians, that they, the
said Indians, shall have right to pursue their avocations of
hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as
hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from
time to time be made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada,
and saving and excepting such tracts as may from time to time be
required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other
purposes, by Her said Government of the Dominion of Canada, or by
any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the said
Government.</p>
                  <p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and Her said Indians
that such sections of the reserves above indicated as may at any
time be required for public works or buildings, of what nature
soever, may be appropriated for that purpose by Her Majesty's
Government of the Dominion of Canada, due compensation being made
for the value of any improvements thereon.</p>
                  <p>And further, that Her Majesty's Commissioners shall, as soon as
possible after the execution of this treaty, cause to be taken an
accurate census of all the Indians inhabiting the tract above
described, distributing them in families, and shall in every year
ensuing the date hereof, at some period in each year to be duly
notified to the Indians, and at a place or places to be appointed
for that purpose within the territory ceded, pay to each Indian
person the sum of five dollars per head yearly.</p>
                  <p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians
that the sum of five hundred dollars per annum shall be yearly and
every year expended by Her Majesty in the purchase of ammunition,
and twine for nets, for the use of the said Indians, in manner
following, that is to say: in the reasonable discretion as regards
the distribution thereof among the Indians inhabiting the several
reserves or otherwise included therein of Her Majesty's Indian
Agent have the supervision of this treaty.</p>
                  <p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians
that the following articles shall be supplied to any band of the
said Indians who are now cultivating the soil, or who shall
hereafter commence to cultivate the land, that is to say: Two hoes
for every family actually cultivating; also one spade per family as
aforesaid; one plough for every ten families as aforesaid; five
harrows for every twenty families as aforesaid; one scythe for
every family as aforesaid, and also one axe; and also one cross-cut
saw, one hand-saw, one pit-saw, the necessary files, one
grindstone, and one auger for each band; and also for each Chief,
for the use of his band, one chest of ordinary carpenter's tools;
also for each band enough of wheat, barley, potatoes and oats to
plant the land actually broken up for cultivation by such band;
also for each band one yoke of oxen, one bull and four cows all the
aforesaid articles to be given once for all for the encouragement
of the practice of agriculture among the Indians.</p>
                  <p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians
that each Chief duly recognized as such shall receive an annual
salary of twenty-five dollars per annum, and each subordinate
officer, not exceeding three for each band, shall receive fifteen
dollars per annum; and each such Chief and subordinate officer as
aforesaid shall also receive, once every three years, a suitable
suit of clothing; and each Chief shall receive, in recognition of
the closing of the treaty, a suitable flag and medal.</p>
                  <p>And the undersigned Chiefs, on their own behalf and on behalf of
all other Indians inhabiting the tract within ceded, do hereby
solemnly promise and engage to strictly observe this treaty, and
also to conduct and behave themselves as good and loyal subjects of
Her Majesty the Queen. They promise and engage that they will, in
all respects, obey and abide by the law, and they will maintain
peace and good order between each other, and also between
themselves and other Tribes of Indians, and between themselves and
others of Her Majesty's subjects, whether Indians or whites, now
inhabiting or hereafter to inhabit any part of the said ceded
tracts, and that they will not molest the person or property of any
inhabitant of such ceded tracts, or the property of Her Majesty the
Queen, or interfere with or trouble any person passing or
travelling through the said tracts, or any part thereof; and that
they will aid and assist the officers of Her Majesty in bringing to
justice and punishment any Indian offending against the
stipulations of this treaty, or infringing the laws in force in the
country so ceded.</p>
                  <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Her Majesty's said Commissioners and the
said Indian Chiefs have hereunto subscribed and set their hands at
"Beren's River" this twentieth day of September, A.D. 1875, and at
Norway House on the twenty-fourth day of the month and year herein

                  <p>We, the Band of the Saulteaux Tribe of Indians residing at the
mouth of the Saskatchewan River, on both sides thereof, having had
communication of the foregoing treaty, hereby, and in consideration
of the provisions of the said treaty being extended to us,
transfer, surrender and relinquish to Her Majesty the Queen, Her
heirs and successors, to and for the use of the Government of
Canada, all our right, title and privileges whatsoever, which we
have or enjoy in the territory described in the said treaty, and
every part thereof, to have and to hold to the use of Her Majesty
the Queen and Her heirs and successors for ever. And Her Majesty
agrees, through the said Commissioners, to assign a reserve of
sufficient area to allow one hundred and sixty acres to each family
of five, or in that proportion for larger or smaller families-such
reserve to be laid off and surveyed next year on the south side of
the River Saskatchewan.</p>
                  <p>And having regard to the importance of the land where the said
Indians are now settled in respect of the purposes of the
navigation of the said river and transport in connection therewith,
and otherwise, and in view of the fact that many of the said
Indians have now houses and gardens on the other side of the river
and elsewhere which they will abandon, Her Majesty agrees, through
Her said Commissioners, to grant a sum of five hundred dollars to
the said Band to be paid in equitable proportions to such of them
as have houses, to assist them in removing their houses to the said
reserve or building others.</p>
                  <p>And the said Indians, represented herein by their Chiefs and
Councillors, presented as such by the Band, do hereby agree to
accept the several provisions, payments and other benefits as
stated in the said treaty, and solemnly promise and engage to abide
by, carry out and fulfil all the stipulations, obligations and
conditions therein contained, on the part of the said Chiefs and
Indians therein named, to be observed and performed, and in all
things to conform to the articles of the said treaty as if we
ourselves had been originally contracting parties thereto.</p>
                  <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Her Majesty's said Commissioners and the
said Indian Chief and Councillors have hereunto subscribed and set
their hands, at the Grand Rapids, this twenty-seventh day of
September, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and
seventy-five.</p>

AND CREE INDIANS</head>

                  <p>ARTICLE OF AGREEMENT AND ADHESION TO A TREATY made and concluded
at Beren's River on the 20th day of September and at Norway House
the 24th day of September, in the year of Our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and seventy-five, between Her Most Gracious Majesty
the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, by Her Commissioners, the
Honourable Alexander Morris, Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of
Manitoba and the North-west Territories, and the Honourable James
McKay, of the one part, and the Saulteaux and Swampy Cree Tribes of
Indians, inhabitants of the country within the limits hereinafter
defined and described, by their Chiefs, chosen and named as
hereinafter mentioned, of the other part:</p>
                  <p>We, the Band of Saulteaux and Swampy Cree Indians, residing at
the "Pas," on the Saskatchewan River, Birch River, the Pas Mountain
and File Lake, and known as "The Pas Band"; and at Cumberland
Island, Sturgeon River, Angling River, Pine Bluff, Beaver Lake and
the Ratty Country, and known as "The Cumberland Band"; and at Moose
Lake and Cedar Lake, and known as "The Moose Lake Band," having had
communication of the aforesaid treaty, of which a true copy is
hereunto annexed, hereby, and in consideration of the provisions of
the said treaty being extended to us, transfer, surrender and
relinquish to Her Majesty the Queen, Her heirs and successors, to
and for the use of the Government of Canada, all our rights, title
and privileges whatsoever, which we have or enjoy in the territory
described in the said treaty and every part thereof, to have and to
hold to the use of Her Majesty the Queen and Her heirs and
successors forever.</p>
                  <p>And Her Majesty agrees, through Her representative as
hereinafter named, to assign a reserve of sufficient area to allow
one hundred and sixty acres to each family of five, or in that
proportion for larger or smaller families, such reserves to be
subject to the approval of Her Majesty's Government of the Dominion
of Canada, and to be laid off and surveyed as soon as may be found
practicable, in manner following, that is to say: For the "Pas"
Band, a reserve on both sides of the Saskatchewan River at the
"Pas"; but as the area of land fit for cultivation in that vicinity
is very limited, and insufficient to allow of a reserve being laid
off to meet the requirements of the Band, that the balance of such
reserve shall be at "Birch River" and the "Pas Mountain"; for the
"Cumberland Band" a reserve at "Cumberland Island," and as the land
fit for cultivation there is also limited and insufficient to meet
their requirements, that the balance of that reserve shall be at a
point between the "Pine Bluff" and "Lime Stone Rock," on
"Cumberland Lake"; and for the "Moose Lake Band" a reserve at the
north end of "Moose Lake," called Little Narrows-reserving,
however, to Her Majesty, Her heirs, successors, and Her subjects,
the free navigation of all lakes and rivers, and free access to the
shores thereof, and excepting thereout such land as may have been
granted to or stipulated to be held by the Hudson's Bay Company at
the Pas and Cumberland Island, and also such land as Her Majesty or
Her successors may in their good pleasure see fit to grant to the
missions established at the "Pas" and Cumberland Island by the
Church Missionary Society, and the mission established at
Cumberland Island by the Roman Catholic Church; and provided Her
Majesty, Her heirs and successors, reserve the right to deal with
any settlers within the bounds of any lands reserved for any Band
as She shall deem fit.</p>
                  <p>And the said Indians, represented herein by their Chiefs and
Councillors, presented as such by the Bands, do hereby agree to
accept the several provisions, payments, and other benefits, as
stated in the said treaty, and solemnly promise and engage to abide
by, carry out and fulfil all stipulations, obligations and
conditions therein contained, on the part of the said Chiefs and
Indians therein named, to be observed and performed, and in all
things to conform to the articles of the said treaty, as if we
ourselves had been originally contracting parties thereto.</p>
                  <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Honourable Thomas Howard, acting herein
for Her Majesty under special authority of the Honourable Alexander
Morris, Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba and of the North-west
Territories, and Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the
Manitoba Superintendency, and the said Chiefs and Councillors, have
