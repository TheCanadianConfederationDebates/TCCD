      THE BUDGET
    </p>
    <p>
      The budget was brought down in the <lb/>
      Legislature on Tuesday of this week. <lb/>
      In a later issue there will be publish<lb break="no"/>ed in THE LEADER, as in former years, <lb/>
      a fairly full report of the Budget De<lb break="no"/>bate in the Assembly. This week we <lb/>
      can give only a cursory glance at the <lb/>
      speech of the Territorial Teasurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <persName ref="pers:ROSS11">Mr. ROSS</persName> in making his first budget <lb/>
      statement spoke nearly two and a half <lb/>
      hours. In the latter part of the speech, <lb/>
      after he had finished the dry details <lb/>
      of the estimates and when dealing with <lb/>
      the question of the future of these Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, Mr. Ross spoke with a fluency <lb/>
      and eloquence which he had never be<lb break="no"/>fore exhibited on the floor of the <lb/>
      House. His announcement of the view <lb/>
      of the Government on the question of <lb/>
      the proper method of approaching the <lb/>
      problem confronting the country—the <lb/>
     problem of provincial establishment— <lb/>
     was highly important and notable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hon. the Treasurer gave a hur<lb break="no"/>ried revierw of the financial history of <lb/>
      the Assembly and its forerunner, the <lb/>
      old North-West Council. The first fi<lb break="no"/>nancial statement presented in the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories was made in 1878, showing a <lb/>
      revenue of $526 and no expenditure. <lb/>
      The next year, 1879, revenue had fallen <lb/>
      off to $25 and expenditure risen to <lb/>
      $237,37. In 1879 the first federal grant <lb/>
      was drawn and in that year the reven<lb break="no"/>ue from all sources was $20,000. In <lb/>
     1886-87—lastyear of the Council—the <lb/>
      total appropriations were $85,578; 1888 <lb/>
     (first year of Legislature)—$105,000. <lb/>
      The following is a summary of Domin<lb break="no"/>ion grants in various years since 1891; <lb/>
     1891-92—$195,700; '93-'94—$199,200;<lb/>
     '94-'95—$225,000; '95-'96—$267,000 (in<lb break="no"/>cluding $25,000 for relief); '96-'97—$242,<lb break="no"/>879; '97-'98—$282,879. In these latter <lb/>
      years local revenues ranged from $20<lb break="no"/>000 in 1892 to $30,000 in 1897, and for the <lb/>
      present year are estaimted at $49,000. <lb/>
      The estiamted revenue for the present <lb/>
      year includes: Balance from last year, <lb/>
      $71,745; Dominion grant for Peace <lb/>
      River road, $10,000, federal grant $282,<lb break="no"/>979; local revenues $49,406. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment hopes that the federal grant <lb/>
      may be increased but cannot anticipate <lb/>
      the Dominion supply bill for the year. <lb/>
      The sum asked from Ottawa is $535,000. <lb/>
      Mr. Ross went into a very full explan<lb break="no"/>ation of the Estimates, the main items <lb/>
      of which appear above. One pleasing <lb/>
      statement made was that the C.P.R. <lb/>
      Co. has agreed to give free transporta<lb break="no"/>tion to Territorial public works officers, <lb/>
      which wil enable the public works vote <lb/>
      to go much farther than it otherwise <lb/>
      woiuld. The item of $10,000 for Peace <lb/>
      River road is an amount paid by order <lb/>
      in council from the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, the sum being entrusted by the <lb/>
      Dominion Public Works Department <lb/>
      to the Territorial department for ex<lb break="no"/>penditure on the road. While elector<lb break="no"/>al boundary lines are not regardedin <lb/>
      apportionment of moneys now, yet the <lb/>
      great natural divisions are kept in <lb/>
      view. On public works there were ex<lb break="no"/>pended last year in Northern Alberta <lb/>
      $36,000, Southern Alberta $49,000, Wes<lb break="no"/>tern Assiniboia, $39,000; Eastern As<lb break="no"/>siniboia, $51,000; Saskatchewan, $38,<lb break="no"/>000. After expaining the estimates, <lb/>
      Mr. Ross dealt with the position of the <lb/>
      Territories financially, and made a <lb/>
      statement of what the Government be<lb break="no"/>lieved shoudl be presented in the way <lb/>
      of a constitutional proposition. There <lb/>
      could be no question, he said, but that <lb/>
      the federal grant of $282,979 was totally <lb/>
      inadequate. The Government had this <lb/>
      year asked $535,000, the amount deem<lb break="no"/>
     <cb/>
      ed necessary for the ordinary services <lb/>
      dealt with by the Assembly. When <lb/>
      considering any proposition for provin<lb break="no"/>cial establishment it has to be remem<lb break="no"/>bered that those services did not em<lb break="no"/>brace all the services which as a pro<lb break="no"/>vince we should be obliged to bear. In <lb/>
      addition to the grant to the Assembly <lb/>
      Parliament votes for Lieut.-Governor's <lb/>
      ofice $5,880; incidental justice $2,000; <lb/>
      land titles offices $15,000; insane <lb/>
     patients, $50,000; schools in unorgan<lb break="no"/>ised territory, $2,000—these items made <lb/>
      up the vote for North-West Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Besides there were voted items <lb/>
      of $40,000 for administration of justice; <lb/>
      $2,500 for sheriffs; $15,000 for jails; $7,<lb break="no"/>000 for agricultural societies; $5,000 <lb/>
      direct vote besides other assistance to <lb/>
      creameries. Then there would be at <lb/>
      least a proportion of the immigration <lb/>
      expenditure; the expenditure on <lb/>
      court houses has always been <lb/>
      borne by the Dominion; there would <lb/>
      be some expenditure for law and order. <lb/>
      While no one could contend that the <lb/>
      Mounted Police vote was a provincial <lb/>
      expenditure, yet as a province we <lb/>
      would have to bear expenditure for <lb/>
      law and order as do the provinces. <lb/>
      The computation showed that to-day <lb/>
      Parliament was voting about $550,000 <lb/>
     for provincial services in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories—a sum far short of the require<lb break="no"/>ments, as instead of the item of $282,<lb break="no"/>979 granted to the Assembly he had <lb/>
      shown that there was need for, and <lb/>
      the Government had asked for, $535,<lb break="no"/>000; which meant that local services <lb/>
      in the Territories to-day demanded an <lb/>
      annual expenditure of $800,000. <lb/>
      This being the case it was well <lb/>
      to look and see where we would <lb/>
      land if the course was followed <lb/>
      which some were advocating. <lb/>
      Manitoba's subsidy was made up as <lb/>
      follows: Per capita grant of 80 cents a <lb/>
      head; $50,000 for government; 100,<lb break="no"/>000 in lieu of lands; and interest on <lb/>
      capital account computed at $32 per <lb/>
      head of population. On such a basis <lb/>
      the Territories would receive say: <lb/>
      $120,000 per capita grant; $50,000 for <lb/>
      government; then on capital account <lb/>
      for argument's sake place the principal <lb/>
      at $3,250,000 (although he might say <lb/>
      that we were already charged with <lb/>
      $3,000,000 on this account) which would <lb/>
      give $162,500; we have about four and <lb/>
      a half times Manitoba's area of land, <lb/>
      and shoudl therefore receive say $400,<lb break="no"/>000 on that account. This made a <lb/>
     total of $732,500,—and remember this <lb/>
      would be a fixed amount, incapable of <lb/>
      enlargement. Alraedy the Assembly <lb/>
      was asking $535,000, and Parliament <lb/>
      was appropriating over $200,000 a year <lb/>
      for local services besides. In view of <lb/>
      these figures was there any man wil<lb break="no"/>ling to believe that an arrangement on <lb/>
      Manitoba' basis would be a good bar<lb break="no"/>gain for the Territories to make? That <lb/>
      bargain once made, and the country <lb/>
      would be in the position tha tno in<lb break="no"/>crease could be got in the way of sub<lb break="no"/>sidy except on the 80 cents per capita <lb/>
      provision up to a certain limit. <lb/>
      Would anyone say that such a bar<lb break="no"/>gain would satisfy the needs of the <lb/>
      Territories, even if the amounts <lb/>
      he had named could be got,<lb break="no"/>and it was more than likely <lb/>
      that there woudul be difficulty in ob<lb break="no"/>taining so mcuh as he ahd computed <lb/>
      on that basis. The bargain would be <lb/>
      just about sufficient for present needs; <lb/>
      but in five years, with any influx of <lb/>
      population, we would be in a position <lb/>
      that we might very well turn to a <lb/>
      method that the House had heard <lb/>
      something of, namely, commence bor<lb break="no"/>rowing. The Government believed that <lb/>
      it was not needed to make that kind of <lb/>
      a bargain; they believed the Territories <lb/>
      shoudl demand the accounting by the <lb/>
      Dominion of the whole land area ex<lb break="no"/>cepting those portions homesteaded. <lb/>
      They believed that we were entitled to <lb/>
      possession of all the public lands, and <lb/>
      more than that, they believed that an <lb/>
      accounting shoudl be made for the <lb/>
      lands which had been given away or <lb/>
     alienated,—given for railways some of <lb/>
      which were not built in the Territories. <lb/>
      Those lands alienated had been given <lb/>
      by Dominion vote for Domini on pur<lb break="no"/>poses. Land was practicaly the only <lb/>
     revenue producing asset which a pro<lb break="no"/>vince could have—an asset which grew <lb/>
      in value with the growth of population, <lb/>
     —the only asset capable of maintain<lb break="no"/>ing an equilibrium between revenue <lb/>
      and expenditure. Mr. Ross made a <lb/>
      computation of the lands. There was <lb/>
      altogether 300,000 square miles; 190,<lb break="no"/>000,000 acres. One-half this area<lb break="no"/>the even-numbered sections-were set <lb/>
      apart for homesteading; calculating <lb/>
      pre-emptions, one-qurter of the one<lb break="no"/>half, gave 120,000,000 acres. Then 35,<lb break="no"/>000,000 acres had been given away as <lb/>
      subsidies to railways. It was fair to <lb/>
      argue that those 35,000,000 acres had <lb/>
      been used in lieu of Dominion cash. <lb/>
      In Canada about $200,000,000 has been <lb/>
      spent in subsidies to railways, and <lb/>
     these land subsidies shoudl be con<lb break="no"/>sidered in the same light as cash sub<lb break="no"/>sidies—federal payments for federal <lb/>
      purposes, and when local resources are <lb/>
      used for federal purposes the province <lb/>
      or the territory whose resources are <lb/>
      thus taken shoudl be given credit. <lb/>
      This principle was accepted in British <lb/>
      Columbia. The Dominion required <lb/> 
     land in that province for raiway pur<lb break="no"/>poses,—and had to buy it. The Domi<lb break="no"/>nion took a 29-mile strip of rocks in <lb/>
      British Columbia, the price being a <lb/>
      capitalisation yielding $100,000 a year, <lb/>
      which is the amount paid on account <lb/>
      of the land yearly by Parliament to <lb/>
      <cb/>
      British Columbia. So if $35,000,000 <lb/>
      acres of our lands have been taken for <lb/>
      railway purposes, the price should be <lb/>
      capitalised for our benefit. One dollar <lb/>
      an acre would be a low rate for these <lb/>
      lands, and it would be fair to ask that <lb/>
      interest be paid by Parliament to <lb/>
      the Territories on a capital account <lb/>
      of $35,000,000 on account of lands so <lb/>
      alienated. That would give a revenue <lb/>
      of $1,000,000 a year. (Cheers.)Then <lb/>
      there was the 35,000,000 acres not alien<lb break="no"/>ated, and whichshould be handed to <lb/>
      the Territories. Set apart 35,000,000 <lb/>
      acres of that which probably the feder<lb break="no"/>al government could properly claim <lb/>
      represented the cost of having survey<lb break="no"/>ed and administered the lands, and <lb/>
      there was left 50,000,000 acres to be <lb/>
      taken by the Territories as a revenue <lb/>
      producing asset, a tangible capital ac<lb break="no"/>count, which would grow in value with <lb/>
      every cent's expenditure, which would <lb/>
      be made more valuable by every dollar's <lb/>
      expenditure on schools, on road im<lb break="no"/>provements, on any and every provin<lb break="no"/>cialobject. As population increased <lb/>
      that asset would increase in value, be<lb break="no"/>cause the law of supply and demand <lb/>
      governed the price of land as every<lb break="no"/>thing else. So as our needs grew, our <lb/>
      revenue would also grow. This was <lb/>
      the class of proposition that this Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment proposed to the people of the <lb/>
      Territories. (Cheers.) When they <lb/>
      asked for provincial establishment <lb/>
      they would certainly ask for the power <lb/>
      to borrow; they would want every <lb/>
      power possessed by any province, but <lb/>
      he trusted that the day would be far <lb/>
      distant when this country woudl need <lb/>
      to resort to the use of the power <lb/>
      to borrow. The resources of the coun<lb break="no"/>try were such that there should be no <lb/>
      need to brorrow at least during the time <lb/>
      of the members of that House. The <lb/>
      above was the proposition which the <lb/>
      Government would ask the people to <lb/>
      consider. The House had no mandate <lb/>
      to make a bargain, but the time had <lb/>
      come for a change, and it was the duty <lb/>
      of public men to seek to educate the <lb/>
      people and to interest the people in the <lb/>
      subject. Every man in the House <lb/>
      and country shoudl stand shoulder to <lb/>
      shoulder on the pricniple, the justice <lb/>
      of the Territorial claim. The lines be<lb break="no"/>tween Grit and Tory should be obliter<lb break="no"/>ated for the time being until the Do<lb break="no"/>minion be brought to admit the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple that those lands were ours. It <lb/>
      was the duty of our representtives in <lb/>
      Parliament to act in concert on this <lb/>
      question, which was the most momen<lb break="no"/>tous that could engage their attention <lb/>
      during this term.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the evening session <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName>, <lb/>
      leader of the Opposition, made a two <lb/>
      hours' speech. His criticism of the <lb/>
      Estimates was mild. He had no ob<lb break="no"/>jection to urge against any of the <lb/>
      items, but urged that someof the pu<lb break="no"/>lic works sums, to be voted in bulk, <lb/>
      should have been itemised,as has been <lb/>
      one here in former years and is done <lb/>
      in all other legislatures. He contend<lb break="no"/>ed that the House might reasonably <lb/>
      expect thatby this time the Agricul<lb break="no"/>ture Department would have some<lb break="no"/>thing to show forits expense, but he <lb/>
      failed to discover anything done. He <lb/>
      held that the Government should do <lb/>
      something to encourage immigration, <lb/>
      whereas they appeared to be anxious <lb/>
      to discourage immigration in alleged <lb/>
      proof of which assertion he read the <lb/>
      letterfrom Mr. Ross to the Regina <lb/>
      Board of Trade respecting application <lb/>
      for a well auger, appearing in THE <lb/>
      LEADER last week. The Government's <lb/>
      proposition respecting the provincial <lb/>
     question-the demand for the lands— <lb/>
     Dr. Brett declared the wildest freak <lb/>
      of imagination ever heard placed <lb/>
      by a responsible minister of the crown <lb/>
      before a responsible assembly, and he <lb/>
      believed the proposition was made <lb/>
      simply to enable the Government to <lb/>
      dilly-dally and do nothing and thus <lb/>
      hold the support of those averse to <lb/>
      establishment, while at teh same time <lb/>
      appealing by teat alluring but ethereal <lb/>
      project to those sections of country <lb/>
      which demand advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <persName ref="pers:BROW6">Mr. Brown</persName> followed Dr. Brett in a <lb/>
      fluent and telling speech, pointing out <lb/>
      the weakness of Dr. Brett's position <lb/>
      and urging that if the Government's <lb/>
      proposition in regard to public lands <lb/>
      was just, the public men of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories would be recreant to their trust <lb/>
      did they fail to make every endeavor <lb/>
      to establish the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      After <persName ref="pers:MEYE1">Mr. Meyers</persName> had spoken briefly, <lb/>
      commending on the whole the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment's policy, there was a long pause. <lb/>
      Ultimately,
    </p>
    <p>
      <persName ref="pers:ROSS11">Mr. Ross</persName> arose and said if no other <lb/>
      member wished to speak he would <lb/>
      close the debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Mr. Patrick</persName> then took the floor. On <lb/>
      the establishment question Dr. Patrick <lb/>
      held that two future provinces should <lb/>
      be now mapped out, their bounds de<lb break="no"/>termined, and for the time being their <lb/>
      legislation and government be carried <lb/>
      on by one legislature and government; <lb/>
     —in effect, a legislative union such as <lb/>
      prevailed in Upper and Lower Canada <lb/>
      from 1841 to 1867. These future pro<lb break="no"/>vinces might remain for some time as <lb/>
      a territory and still obtain and exercise <lb/>
     the powers of borrowing—in fact all <lb/>
      provincial powers, except that their <lb/>
      legislation would be subject as now to <lb/>
      the Governor General in Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      After another long pause, the motion <lb/>
      that the House resolve into Committee <lb/>
      of Supply was put and carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure of Mr. Bennett to join in <lb/>
      the debate was a cause of general sur<lb break="no"/>prise, and the conviction prevails that <lb/>
      the Government's proposition took the <lb/>
      wind so completely out of Mr. Ben<lb break="no"/>nett's sails that he recognized himself <lb/>
      as being hopelessly at sea.

<fw type="running">THE LEADER, THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 4, 1899.</fw> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE POLITICAL POSITION OF THE <lb/>
TERRITORIES.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ROSS11">Mr. Ross</persName> went on to say that he <lb/>
would now, like to make a few obser<lb break="no"/>vations with regard to the present <lb/>
position of the Territories, and the <lb/>
position be thought we should be in: <lb/>
and he would then have something to <lb/>
say with regard to certain propositions <lb/>
which had been made with regard to <lb/>
the political position of the Territories. <lb/>
The local revenue now announted to <lb/>
$45,000 or $50,000. It indicated $50,000 <lb/>
at present. The Dominion grant <lb/>
on the same footing as last year <lb/>
would be $282,979. Now there was no <lb/>
question that the amounts were totally <lb/>
inadequate for the service, but they <lb/>
must remember that although the <lb/>
amount directly received from Ottawa <lb/>
was $282,979, yet there were other <lb/>
moneys expended by the Dominion <lb/>
Government for purely Territorial pur<lb break="no"/>poses. There was the expenditure of <lb/>
$5,880 in the Lieutenant Governor's <lb/>
office; incidental justice, $2,000; regis<lb break="no"/>trars of land titles, $15,000; $50,000 <lb/>
for insane persons; and $2,000 <lb/>
for schools in the unorganised <lb/>
territories, making $74,800 in all. <lb/>
These amounts were expended by <lb/>
the Interior Department directly <lb/>
through the Lieutenant Governor <lb/>
and they would have to be under<lb break="no"/>taken by the local government when <lb/>
the Territories were established on a <lb/>
provincial basis. There were also the <lb/>
amounts of $40,000 for criminal justice, <lb/>
$2,500 for sheriffs. $9,800 for Regina <lb/>
gaol, $6,000 for Prince Albert gaol; aid <lb/>
to agricultural societies, $7,000; and to <lb/>
creameries, $5,000. There was a much <lb/>
larger sum devoted to creameries, but <lb/>
most of it was simply an advance, and <lb/>
recouped. The sum of $5,000, how<lb break="no"/>ever, was a direct aid. Then there was <lb/>
the proportion of immigration outlay in <lb/>
respect of the Territories which it <lb/>
would be difficult to estimate. <lb/>
There was the sum of $23,000 <lb/>
for the construction and main<lb break="no"/>tenance of court houses, and of <lb/>
$353,750 for the maintenance of law and <lb/>
order in the Territories which was now <lb/>
undertaken through the North-West <lb/>
Mounted Police. Although he did <lb/>
not wish for a moment to say that we <lb/>
ought to be charged with the Police <lb/>
expenditure in this country, still we <lb/>
would have to undertake a proportion <lb/>
of the burden entailed for the mainten<lb break="no"/>ance of law and order the same as in <lb/>
Manitoba and the other provinces, if <lb/>
we were formed into a province. The <lb/>
Government this year had asked for <lb/>
$535,000 from Ottawa and they believ<lb break="no"/>ed that sum was actually necessary to <lb/>
provide for the needs of the country. <lb/>
Now if it was the case that this sum <lb/>
was needed, was it not very necessary <lb/>
for them to look minutely into the <lb/>
question and see where they would land <lb/>
themselves if they were to enter into <lb/>
confederation on the Manitoba basis? <lb/>
The province of Manitoba was dealt <lb/>
with in the following manner: They <lb/>
received an allowance of $50,000 for the <lb/>
purposes of government; $100,000 on <lb/>
account of lands; and interest <lb/>
on a capital account at the <lb/>
rate of $32 per head on the actu<lb break="no"/>al population, or about three and a <lb/>
quarter million dollars. If the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories were similarly dealt with we <lb/>
would be in this position. We should <lb/>
have our subsidy based on a per capita <lb/>
amount of 80 cents per head. He sup<lb break="no"/>posed that the Dominion would claim <lb/>
that the Territories had a population of <lb/>
100,000, but we would have, say, for the <lb/>
purposes of argument, a population of <lb/>
150,000. At 80 cents per head that would <lb/>
give us $120,000. Add to that $50,000 <lb/>
for government,the same as Manitoba, <lb/>
and we would then have $170,000. Then <lb/>
we would be entitled to a capital ac<lb break="no"/>count of three and a quarter millions, <lb/>
which at five per cent would produce <lb/>
 $162,500–although it had to be remem<lb break="no"/>bered that the Dominion now held the <lb/>
Territories charged with some $3,000<lb break="no"/>000 on account of capital account <lb/>
expenditures in the Territories: <lb/>
The Province of Manitoba received <lb/>
$100,000 a year in lieu of her <lb/>
lands; but in the Territories we had a <lb/>
little over four and a half times the <lb/>
land of Manitoba–that was in the or<lb break="no"/>ganised Territories—so that we should <lb/>
be entitled on the same basis as Mani<lb break="no"/>toba to over $400,000 a year in lieu of <lb/>
our lands. This would give us in all <lb/>
$732,500. This then was the position <lb/>
we would be in if we were dealt with <lb/>
on the same basis as Manitoba. We <lb/>
should have a fixed subsidy of $732,500. <lb/>
Was there any member of that <lb/>
House who believed that if we require <lb/>
a grant of $535,000 at the present time <lb/>
for the services we are performing, and <lb/>
if in addition to that we had to perform <lb/>
the services now carried out by the <lb/>
Dominion Government, that such a <lb/>
bargain as this would be a good bar<lb break="no"/>gain for all time to come? He did not <lb/>
think so, and he did not think any <lb/>
member of the House thought that the <lb/>
sum he had mentioned would be a suffi<lb break="no"/>cient sum for a fixed subsidy. The <lb/>
question of the division of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies did not come into this calculation. <lb/>
Once the bargain was made we would <lb/>
get no advance except what came <lb/>
through the per capita grant of 80 cents <lb/>
a head on the increase of population <lb/>
from 150,000 up to 400,000. Would any <lb/>
man say this was a proper basis for us <lb/>
to make a deal on? It appeared to him <lb/>
more than likely that a difficulty would <lb/>
be found in getting the Dominion to <lb/>
grant the sum of $400,000 in lieu <lb/>
of lands — not because we were <lb/>
not, entitled to it, for in fact, we were <lb/>
entitled to a great deal more. Now he <lb/>
thought that if we went to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion Parliament and were willing to <lb/>
go into confederation on the same <lb/>
basis as Manitoba, with a reasonable <lb/>
amount of increase owing to the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories having more land than Manitoba, <lb/>
we would probably have enough for <lb/>
our present needs. But we had to <lb/>
look ahead; and he made this state<lb break="no"/>ment, that in five years from that <lb/>
day, with the influx of population, and <lb/>
the extra services that would be re<lb break="no"/>quired through this extra population, <lb/>
we would be in a position that we <lb/>
would have to turn to our borrowing <lb/>
powers in order to carry on the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the country, He believed, <lb/>
 however–and his collegues believed, <lb/>
that there was no necessity for the <lb/>
Government to deal in that way, and <lb/>
this Government had a proposition to <lb/>
make in respect to the position in <lb/>
which these Territories should be <lb/>
placed. The leader of the House had <lb/>
looked into this question, and, this <lb/>
Government was prepared to lay down <lb/>
what they believe would be the pro<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

per course to pursue. In passing, also <lb/>
he would emphasize the point that his <lb/>
hon. friend from Macleod had led the <lb/>
country gently to a point where it could <lb/>
consider and look for a coming change. <lb/>
No doubt some people would say, that <lb/>
that was a drift policy; it might be but <lb/>
it had gradually and safely led the <lb/>
country up to a point when it might <lb/>
seriously commence to take those mat<lb break="no"/>ters into consideration.</p>

<p>In the first place, continued <persName ref="pers:ROSS11">Mr. Ross</persName>, <lb/>
the Government would lay this down <lb/>
as a basis, or starting point, that they <lb/>
would make the best possible bargain <lb/>
with regard to population. They would <lb/>
as large an amount as they could <lb/>
for government. These two items <lb/>
would likely be dealt with in any event <lb/>
on one basis. Then it would be the duty <lb/>
of this Government—or whoever might <lb/>
be carrying on the government of the <lb/>
Territories at that time—to carefully <lb/>
enquire into the alleged expenditure on <lb/>
capital account. It was not known here <lb/>
what services were undertaken on ac<lb break="no"/>count of that; but they could obtain <lb/>
all the information at Ottawa. <lb/>
At present, they did not know what was <lb/>
They did not know what services were <lb/>
undertaken, but it could be learned <lb/>
at Ottawa, and it would be the duty of <lb/>
the Government to inquire into that. <lb/>
It would be their duty to demand on be<lb break="no"/>half of these Territories the whole of the <lb/>
lands of the Territories—(hear, hear) <lb/>
—that is to demand an account of the <lb/>
whole of the lands of the Territories <lb/>
including that portion which had gone <lb/>
from Canada's grasp. It was known <lb/>
that large grants had gone out in sub<lb break="no"/>sidies and so on, and of these an <lb/>
account must be given. Something <lb/>
must be given to the Territories in lieu <lb/>
of those lands which had been alienated <lb/>
by Dominion vote. The land belongs <lb/>
to the people. It is the only natural <lb/>
revenue producing asset they have; it <lb/>
is the one asset that grows by the <lb/>
growth of population; it is the only as<lb break="no"/>set we can look to to maintain an <lb/>
equilibrium between revenue and ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. If we have an absolutely <lb/>
fixed subsidy the expenditure is bound <lb/>
to outgrow the revenue. <lb/></p> 

<p>The speaker continued: In Alberta, <lb/>
Saskatchewan and East Assiniboia we <lb/>
have something like 300,000 square <lb/>
miles of lands, or 190 millions of acres <lb/>
in these Territories. It is only fair to <lb/>
assume that one half of these lands, <lb/>
that is the odd numbered sections <lb/>
throughout the country are lands which <lb/>
may be classed as revenue producing <lb/>
areas. There is the other half or the <lb/>
even numbered sections, set apart for <lb/>
homesteading. But the whole of that <lb/>
portion of the lands was not available <lb/>
or homesteading. Large areas <lb/>
have been sold, and we know that <lb/>
settlers have largely taken advantage <lb/>
of the pre-emption clause; and I think <lb/>
it is fair to say that one half of those <lb/>
lands should also be classed as revenue­<lb break="yes"/>producing. That still leaves 120 <lb/>
million acres to be dealt with. <lb/>
There has been something like 35 <lb/>
millions of acres taken for subsidis<lb break="no"/>ing railways not necessarily, in the <lb/>
Territories but sometimes in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba, and also for the <lb/>
great national highway, the C.P.R. <lb/>
Now it, is but fair for us to remember <lb/>
that if that 35,000,000 acres taken from <lb/>
the Territories to subsidise Dominion <lb/>
undertakings, had been, needed for <lb/>
subsidising undertakings in the <lb/>
eastern provinces, the subsidy would <lb/>
have had to be made in cash. If our <lb/>
lands have been given instead of cash, <lb/>
then I say credit should be given to <lb/>
the new province for the lands which <lb/>
have been so taken. Over 200 millions <lb/>
of dollars have been given by the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion Government to subsidise railways <lb/>
mostly in the eastern part of Canada and <lb/>
why should the policy be changed in <lb/>
in respect of the western portion of <lb/>
the country? Let me quote the posi<lb break="no"/>tion in British Columbia to prove that <lb/>
an account, should be taken of these <lb/>
lands. In British Columbia the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government had to provide <lb/>
certain lands for the completion of the <lb/>
C.P.R. We find that by the terms of <lb/>
union, they made an agreement with <lb/>
British Columbia for twenty miles on <lb/>
each side of the railway, and they <lb/>
agreed to give the province $100,000 a <lb/>
year for this twenty miles of rocks <lb/>
along the line of the C.P.R. This <lb/>
amounts to 13,000,000 acres which the <lb/>
Dominion Government had to provide <lb/>
and which they purchased from British <lb/>
Columbia, and in respect of which they <lb/>
agreed to give the province $100,000 a <lb/>
year in perpetuity. Should it not <lb/>
therefore follow that we in these Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories should have a credit for the <lb/>
amount of lands which have been taken <lb/>
from us? What would be the position <lb/>
if we were given a capital account for <lb/>
this land so taken from the Territories <lb/>
for Dominion purposes? Instead of 35 <lb/>
million or 40 million acres of land we <lb/>
should have a capital account of <lb/>
$35,000,000 at the least calculation. <lb/>
Surely these lands, the choice of this <lb/>
country, taken by the C, P.R. and other <lb/>
corporations—surely, it is a low esti<lb break="no"/>mate to say that they are worth $1 <lb/>
an acre and the expense of surveys in <lb/>
that this is a fair recompense for us to <lb/>
accept for these lands at all, but let us <lb/>
calculate for the sake of argument on <lb/>
a capital account of $35,000,000 for these <lb/>
lands. To show where we could land <lb/>
ourselves by a proper bargain, let us <lb/>
say $33,000,000. On that amount we <lb/>
should be entitled to something over a <lb/>
million dollars a year. That would be <lb/>
a capital account worth calling a capi<lb break="no"/>tal account. Now, over and beyond <lb/>
that, we claim, if our position is good, <lb/>
and if these lands belong to these <lb/>
Territorics and should belong to these <lb/>
Territories when erected into a <lb/>
 province–we claim, I say, that <lb/>
there is a further amount to be <lb/>
dealt with of about S5 millions acres <lb/>
outside of the homestead lands, I <lb/>
think that 35 millions of acres would <lb/>
be a fair recompense to the Dominion <lb/>
of Canada for the expense of the sur<lb break="no"/>vey and administration of these 85 mil<lb break="no"/>lion acres, and that would leave us a <lb/>
residue of 50 million acres. If this <lb/>
province was started off on such a <lb/>
basis as I have indicated, even with <lb/>
a lesser subsidy than I have marked <lb/>
out, we are entitled to a capital <lb/>
account of 50,000,000 acres of land of <lb/>
our own, which would lie increased <lb/>
in value by every expenditure of public <lb/>
money, every dollar expended on our <lb/>
educational institutions, every dollar <lb/>
expended in testing for water, every <lb/>
dollar expended in road improve<lb break="no"/>ments, every dollar expended in build<lb break="no"/>ing bridges—every dollar expended <lb/>
upon any public service would be <lb/>
assisting to improve our own property: <lb/>
and with the influx of population and <lb/>
the consequent increase of the burdens <lb/>
we would have to bear, to meet, these <lb/>
would run concurrently as it were <lb/>
and there would be a perpetual large <lb/>
increase in the value of these lands <lb/>
to meet the burdens added by the <lb/>
growing requirements of the country. <lb/>
I think this is the kind of propo<lb break="no"/>sition the people of this country <lb/>
are looking for. We are not looking <lb/>
so much for thepower of borrowing <lb/>
 money with the public credit. <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
are willing to take those powers, <lb/>
but I hope, the day is far distant <lb/>
when we will have to resort to bor<lb break="no"/>rowing powers. I helieve we have in <lb/>
this country suficient wealth that we <lb/>
will not, if a right course is pursued, <lb/>
have to resort to those borrowing <lb/>
powers, Mr. Speaker, not, in any event, <lb/>
so long as you and I are members of <lb/>
this Legislative Assembly. (Applause.) <lb/>
I believe, Sir, that it is from some such <lb/>
point of view as this that we should <lb/>
bring, this great question before the <lb/>
attention of the people. This House <lb/>
 <cb/>
has no mandate, the Government has <lb/>
no mandate from the people of this <lb/>
country to make as yet any arrange<lb break="no"/>ments to change our present status; <lb/>
but I think it is our duty now to <lb/>
bestow some little attention upon the <lb/>
position in which we are likely to find <lb/>
ourselves. We are satisfied that <lb/>
whether the Dominion Government <lb/>
gives us an increased subsidy or not <lb/>
we have come to the point where we <lb/>
must, consider our position. It is <lb/>
our duty as far as we can to educate <lb/>
the people on this question; and <lb/>
it is the duty of every man in this <lb/>
House, it is the duty of every good <lb/>
citizen in this country, to stand <lb/>
shoulder to shoulder at this time to <lb/>
endeavor to force upon the Dominion <lb/>
of Canada this principle which we <lb/>
believe to be true, that we have a right <lb/>
to these lands. It is the duty of Grit <lb/>
and Tory, or Tory and Grit, no matter <lb/>
how you put it, whether he be a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this legislature or not—it is the <lb/>
duty of the Dominion Members of <lb/>
Parliament representing this western <lb/>
country, that we and they should all <lb/>
stand shoulder to shoulder on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion—the most important that will <lb/>
be dealt with during their term in <lb/>
the Parliament of Canada. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion, as to the land regulations, or <lb/>
whether we shall get a bridge at <lb/>
Edmonton or a post office at Mooso<lb break="no"/>min or some other point, are in com<lb break="no"/>parison of very little moment, to the <lb/>
people of this country at large, but <lb/>
the question as to what the financial <lb/>
position of this country will finally be <lb/>
is one of the greatest moment to the <lb/>
whole of the people of this country. <lb/>
I hope no question will arise at this <lb/>
time as to whether we are to have one, <lb/>
two or three provinces or whether any <lb/>
part will be given to Manitoba. Let <lb/>
us leave those questions altogether on <lb/>
one side: let us endeavor to force upon <lb/>
the Dominion Government the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple that when the bargain is made <lb/>
it should be made upon the basis <lb/>
of the whole of the lands of these <lb/>
Territories belonging to the Territories, <lb/>
and that a full account should be given <lb/>
of them. We have been accused, and <lb/>
especially the leader of this House <lb/>
has been accused, of having adopted <lb/>
a drift policy. <lb/></p>
 
<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—(Hear, hear.)</p>
 
 <p><persName ref="pers:ROSS11">Mr. Ross</persName>—The hon. gentleman from <lb/>
West Calgary says "hear, hear." <lb/>
I have every reason to believe <lb/>
that, the hon. gentleman from <lb/>
West Calgary is a man of great <lb/>
ability, but I would point out to <lb/>
him that it must be entirely from <lb/>
hearsay that he has been able to make <lb/>
up his mind as to the policy which <lb/>
has been pursued by my hon. friend <lb/>
from Macleod, as he has not been with <lb/>
us very long and has had a very short <lb/>
experience in these Territories. If <lb/>
the hon. leader of the House has <lb/>
adopted a drift policy, then all I can <lb/>
say is that he must have been watched <lb/>
over by an All-wise Providence, be<lb break="no"/>cause he drifted us through the stormy <lb/>
times of 1892 when we were fighting <lb/>
for the rights of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, the hon.gentleman, Sir, brought <lb/>
this country through those stormy <lb/>
times, and drifted us not into the <lb/>
harbor of despair, but into the harbor <lb/>
of hope, and into that harbor these <lb/>
Territories came safely and were firmly <lb/>
anchored. There were other gentlemen <lb/>
in this House–there are not many of <lb/>
them here now, but there is one left, <lb/>
(Dr. Brett)—who tried to drift us on <lb/>
to the rocks at that time, and to throw <lb/>
us back in our effort for responsible <lb/>
government, but they were inot suc<lb break="no"/>cessful. But if that policy of drift, <lb/>
has been the policy which has landed <lb/>
us at this time, after it has been pursued <lb/>
so many years, in the position that we <lb/>
have a good and wise body of legisla<lb break="no"/>tion on our statute books, that the <lb/>
people of this country have not been <lb/>
placed in a position in which they <lb/>
  might be burdened with taxation,—if, I <lb/>
say, that policy of drift has brought <lb/>
us to the position we now occupy, <lb/>
where by wise legislation we are able <lb/>
to show to the people of this country <lb/>
and to the people of Eastern Canada. <lb/>
that the government of this country is <lb/>
in the hands of a man who is able to <lb/>
put on the brakes if the brakes are ne<lb break="no"/>cessary, who has been able to branch <lb/>
out when branching out was necessary, <lb/>
who understood his position, and who <lb/>
has been able to take his place, each <lb/>
time he has gone to Ottawa, with men <lb/>
who are supposed to be superior to us <lb/>
poor mortals in this part of the <lb/>
country,--if we have been able to <lb/>
do all this and to demonstrate to <lb/>
the people of Eastern Canada that, <lb/>
we have been able to organise a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on proper lines, and that we <lb/>
we are ready and able, whenever it is <lb/>
necessary, to step into confederation on <lb/>
an equality with the older provinces— <lb/>
I say, Sir, if that be the resulta policy of drift, then I think <lb/>
the policy of drift a good one. <lb/>
(Applause), I would conclude bysaying that I hope and trust the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House—and I know they <lb/>
will—will realise that this is one of the <lb/>
most critical periods in the history of <lb/>
the Territories—one of those times <lb/>
when it is necessary to have at the <lb/>
helm the steady hand and the cool <lb/>
head. Sir, we have that cool head, we <lb/>
believe at all events that we have one <lb/>
who is able to cope with the difficulties <lb/>
which are likely to arise, and when the <lb/>
necessity arises I hope the members of <lb/>
this House will stand shoulder to <lb/>
shoulder on this great question. I have <lb/>
to thank you, Sir, and through you the <lb/>
House, for the very patient hearing <lb/>
which has been given me. I must <lb/>
apologise to the House—not for the <lb/>
matter, because the matter of what I <lb/>
have said is perhaps as good as I could <lb/>
possibly make it—but I must apologise <lb/>
for the manner and the tone of voice in <lb/>
which it has been given. I have been, <lb/>
as you are aware, under the <lb/>
weather for some little time and <lb/>
it is only with great effort that I <lb/>
am able to speak at all to-day.I <lb/>
hope and trust, Mr. Speaker, that the <lb/>
members of the House will enter into <lb/>
this debate fully realising the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility that, rests upon them. Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, I beg to move that you do <lb/>
now leave the chair. <lb/></p>
 
 <p><persName ref="pers:ROSS11">Mr. Ross</persName>, who had spoken for about <lb/>
two hours and a half, then resumed <lb/>
his seat amid loud and general applause. <lb/></p>

on his first budget speech, and also ex<lb break="no"/>pressed the pleasure with which for <lb/>

say that the duty of discharging the <lb/>

<head rendition="simple:centre">BUDGET STATEMENT <lb/>
BY MR. ROSS. <lb/></head> 

<p>Continued from Page 3. <lb/></p> 

<p>newer members of the House to have <lb/>
that little historical sketch of the <lb/>
earlier circumstances of the Territories. <lb/>
There was no member in that House <lb/>
better qualified to give such a resume <lb/>
than the Territorial Treasurer because <lb/>
he had been connected with the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the country since its earliest <lb/>
days. If was not always an easy task <lb/>
to deliver a budget speech, neither was <lb/>
it always easy to criticise it to one's lik<lb break="no"/>ing. And it was more difficult on that <lb/>
occasion than usual to intelligently <lb/>
criticise the different items in the <lb/>
speech, and for two reasons. One was <lb/>
that they did not have as long a time <lb/>
for the perusal of the public accounts <lb/>
as they should have had. He contend<lb break="no"/>ed that those accounts should be laid <lb/>
upon the table at least a week, or ten <lb/>
days before the budget is brought <lb/>
down. Then again, the accounts cov<lb break="no"/>ered a long period—viz., sixteen <lb/>
months, which was a longer period <lb/>
than that usually covered in any other <lb/>
Assembly. Again, the Estimates prac<lb break="no"/>tically were only placed on the table <lb/>
one day ago. Certainly they were re<lb break="no"/>ceived by members late on Saturday <lb/>
night, but Sunday was not the time to <lb/>
study the Estimates. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—Hear, hear. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.)   <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> was glad the Premier con<lb break="no"/>curred in that view, for he (Dr. Brett) <lb/>
was sure there were a great many hon. <lb/>
gentlemen who could not be prevailed <lb/>
upon to study Estimates on Sunday. <lb/>
(Hear, hear, and laughter.) The result <lb/>
was that they were tied down to just <lb/>
one day before being called upon to <lb/>
concur in the Estimates or to express <lb/>
an opinion on the different items. But <lb/>
there was also one reason which made <lb/>
it easier than usual to criticise the <lb/>
budget proposal this year, and that <lb/>
was that there were so few items. At <lb/>
no time since Estimates had been laid <lb/>
on the table had there been so few <lb/>
items as on this occasion. But while <lb/>
that made it easier in one way, it made <lb/>
it more difficult in another way to <lb/>
make up their minds whether these <lb/>
Estimates were such as they could <lb/>
easily concur in or whether they were <lb/>
such as they should object to or take a <lb/>
longer time for discussion and explana<lb break="no"/>tion before they concurred in them. <lb/>
It was true that additional informa<lb break="no"/>tion had been promised them by the <lb/>
hon. the Territorial Treasurer when <lb/>
they went into Supply, but that was <lb/>
not the time given to other legislatures <lb/>
and the members of other parliaments <lb/>
to criticise and express their opinions <lb/>
with reference to the several items of <lb/>
the Estimates. He was thinking to<lb break="no"/>day when the Territorial Treasurer <lb/>
was relating the early history of the <lb/>
country that history was repeating it<lb break="no"/>self. There was a tiime in the early days <lb/>
when the estimates were not brought <lb/>
down for the consideration of the <lb/>
gentlemen who composed the old <lb/>
North-West Council. Some items <lb/>
were voted but the great bulk of the <lb/>
money was kept at the disposal of the <lb/>
Lieutenant Governor, and was dis<lb break="no"/>posed of by him as he pleased. He <lb/>
(Dr. Brett) was not making any charge <lb/>
that the Lieut.-Governor did not ex<lb break="no"/>pend that money properly, but the <lb/>
fact remained that he had the control <lb/>
over the greater part of the money <lb/>
that was expended in those days, <lb/>
Now they had been told that great <lb/>
progress had been made in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories; there had been a general in<lb break="no"/>crease in the population, and <lb/>
demands had grown generally for <lb/>
greater attention to the public ser<lb break="no"/>vice, necessitating a larger employ<lb break="no"/>ment of officials. He was sorry to say <lb/>
that the general progress was not mani<lb break="no"/>fested in the estimates for they found <lb/>
that out of the sum of $136,000 for <lb/>
public works about one-third of that <lb/>
amount was kept to be spent just as <lb/>
the Commissioner of Public Works <lb/>
chose to do. It was not specified <lb/>
whether the bulk of the money was <lb/>
to be expended in this district or in <lb/>
 that district—on the completion of this <lb/>
bridge or of that bridge—it was en<lb break="no"/>tirely in the hands of the Government <lb/>
and the Commissioner of Public Works <lb/>
to expend as they chose. It was true <lb/>
that they were promised more details <lb/>
when they went into Supply but it was <lb/>
important to remember that the House <lb/>
was being asked by the Government to <lb/>
concur in those estimates before they <lb/>
went into Supply. When once they <lb/>
did that they knew very well that they <lb/>
could not increase the amount for any <lb/>
particular work, although they could <lb/>
lessen the amounts; and he said the <lb/>
Government were presuming a great <lb/>
deal on the confidence of the <lb/>
members of the Assembly to ask <lb/>
them to allow them to go into Supply <lb/>
when two-thirds of the amount voted <lb/>
for roads and bridges and public im<lb break="no"/>provements were to be left at the <lb/>
entire disposal of the Government. <lb/>
They were presuming on the confid<lb break="no"/>ence of the House. Probably they <lb/>
enjoyed that confidence, and he (Dr.  <lb/>
Brett), hoped they would continue to <lb/>
enjoy it if they deserved it, but the <lb/>
course pursued with regard to these <lb/>
Estimates was not the way to secure or <lb/>
deserve the confidence of the Assembly <lb/>
or of any other body of gentlemen <lb/>
coming together for the transaction of <lb/>
public business. There was another <lb/>
feature, and probably a worse feature. <lb/>
He did not fear that advantage would <lb/>
be taken of it in that House because <lb/>
he was quite certain, that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men in that House did not come under <lb/>
the class who would be susceptible to <lb/>
it; but it was a fact that the holding <lb/>
back of a large sum of money like this <lb/>
gave the opportunity, if (desired, of <lb/>
attempting to exercise an influence <lb/>
over members of the Assembly. He <lb/>
did not say that it would. On the <lb/>
other hand he said the members of the <lb/>
House were of a class who would not <lb/>
be influenced in that way. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) But it was a pernicious system <lb/>
and a pernicious practice. If there <lb/>
was a good precedent for it; if other <lb/>
governments brought down their <lb/>
estimates for roads and bridges and <lb/>
asked to have them so voted as to be <lb/>
at the disposal of the government then <lb/>
he (Dr. Brett) would admit that there <lb/>
might be some justification; but if <lb/>
they could not point to other legisla<lb break="no"/>tures, or to the Dominion House as <lb/>
doing this, then he should contend that <lb/>
the Government in this instance were <lb/>
making a departure which was bad, one <lb/>
that will grow and grow and grow, <lb/>
until presently they may come and ask <lb/>
the House to vote the whole amount <lb/>
required for the Territories in one vote <lb/>
and let them spend it as they liked. <lb/>
The practice was that even the smallest <lb/>
amounts were put down that were <lb/>
intended to be spent in any particular <lb/>
direction: and if the provinces did <lb/>
that, if the Dominion Government <lb/>
could do that, what was there <lb/>
to justify, this Government, and <lb/>
these gentlemen, who were con<lb break="no"/>ducting the business of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories in asking the House to put them<lb break="no"/>selves in a less business-like position <lb/>
than the legislatures of the provinces <lb/>
or the Dominion Parliament? <lb/>
The Territorial Treasurer did not put <lb/>
his foot very deep into the matter and <lb/>
touched very lightly on it, but still he <lb/>
evidently realised that it was necessary <lb/>
to say something apologetic for the <lb/>
manner of bringing down, the Esti<lb break="no"/>mates. He realised that it was his <lb/>
duty to explain to the House , that it <lb/>
was not exactly the regular way of do<lb break="no"/>
 
 <cb/>

ing things; and he gave as his justifi<lb break="no"/>cation that a great many of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers were young members who had not <lb/>
had the opportunity of finding out <lb/>
what was really necessary for their dis<lb break="no"/>tricts. Now in answer to this he wish<lb break="no"/>ed to point out that the policy last year <lb/>
in regard to public works was the em<lb break="no"/>ployment of district engineers. It was <lb/>
the business of those engineers to go <lb/>
through the country and find out the <lb/>
absolute requirements of the country. <lb/>
Hon. members who were in the last <lb/>
Assembly would hear him out that ex<lb break="no"/>pendatures were made during the time <lb/>
that system was in vogue on <lb/>
the representations of these dis<lb break="no"/>trict engineers. If those en<lb break="no"/>gineers did not visit every lo<lb break="no"/>cality still they had to cover pretty <lb/>
well every portion of the various dis<lb break="no"/>tricts. That was their business. They <lb/>
were charged with the responsibility <lb/>
of reporting on the necessary works <lb/>
required to be done in the districts in <lb/>
which they were employed. He pre<lb break="no"/>sumed those district engineers carried <lb/>
out their instructions. If they did not <lb/>
then the Government was in fault for <lb/>
retaining men who did not carry out <lb/>
their instructions, and if the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment did not instruct them to find out <lb/>
and look over, and report things to <lb/>
them with regard to the necessary <lb/>
works to be done, then he said the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were neglecting a very impor<lb break="no"/>tant part of their duty. Well, he <lb/>
would assume that the resident engin<lb break="no"/>eers understood their business, and <lb/>
made certain reports. If they did, then <lb/>
the Government should be in a position <lb/>
to know, if not absolutely what was <lb/>
required in regard to every road or <lb/>
bridge in the country, yet they should <lb/>
be in a position to give full information <lb/>
as to a large number of important <lb/>
works in the country requiring atten<lb break="no"/>tion this year. After some further re<lb break="no"/>marks on this line Dr. Brett turned <lb/>
to the question of the increase <lb/>
in the departmental staff. <lb/></p> 

<p>He quite agreed with the remarks <lb/>
made by the Territorial Treasurer that <lb/>
afternoon when he stated that he <lb/>
would rather be censured for having <lb/>
expended money on his staff to get the <lb/>
work done than to be censured <lb/>
for neglecting to get the work done <lb/>
properly; and he was not going to <lb/>
carp because there was an; extra em<lb break="no"/>ployee here and there about the build<lb break="no"/>ings. He was not going to complain <lb/>
of that. Whatever assistance was <lb/>
really required, by all means let it be <lb/>
obtained. He had alwaays sustained <lb/>
the Executive where they had employ<lb break="no"/>ed the best talent they could find. He <lb/>
had always supported them, and he <lb/>
hoped he always would, in employing <lb/>
the very best men they could find, even <lb/>
if they had to pay very large salaries <lb/>
to get them. The principle he believed <lb/>
in was to employ the best men they <lb/>
could get and a sufficient number of <lb/>
them, and then to expect and demand <lb/>
good and efficient service at their <lb/>
hands. He had no fault, then, to find <lb/>
in reference to the staff, although it <lb/>
might be large. But what he might <lb/>
point out was that the item of civil <lb/>
government, as compared with the <lb/>
total sum expended, amounted to ten <lb/>
per cent. of the whole. In saying this <lb/>
he was not including the <lb/>
salary of the Superintendent of Educa<lb break="no"/>tion or of the inspectors. It cost some<lb break="no"/>thing like 10 or 11 per cent. without <lb/>
that, and as compared with the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces he could not help saying that <lb/>
this was a very large amount. In On<lb break="no"/>tario it was a little over 4 per cent. of <lb/>
the total expenditure for civil govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Now he was not going to urge <lb/>
that they should do things as cheaply <lb/>
as in Ontario. He was only pointing <lb/>
out the difference, and it would occur <lb/>
no doubt to other members as it did to <lb/>
him that it was a very large amount <lb/>
for civil government as against 4 per <lb/>
cent. in Ontario. However, with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the general question of civil <lb/>
government, until he was able to point <lb/>
out that there was an employee not <lb/>
earning his pay, or for whom there <lb/>
was not sufficient work to keep him <lb/>
employed, he was not going to <lb/>
complain: and he was not able to <lb/>
point to any employee who was in that <lb/>
position. If he was able to point to <lb/>
such an employe then he would ask <lb/>
for a reduction in respect of that <lb/>
employe but he was not going to ask <lb/>
for any reduction of that kind. But <lb/>
he would ask this question? With <lb/>
this large and expensive staff had the <lb/>
Government done everything they could <lb/>
reasonably be expected to do? Had <lb/>
they fulfilled their duties and their <lb/>
offices promptly and efficiently? Of <lb/>
course complaints were heard all over <lb/>
as to the manner in which they did <lb/>
their work. He certainly had heard a <lb/>
great many complaints as to the tardi<lb break="no"/>ness with which business was done. <lb/>
Letters were not answered quickly and <lb/>
things that should be done promptly <lb/>
were not done promptly. He must <lb/>
say that he had no complaint to make <lb/>
himself, but he knew that a great many <lb/>
complaints had been made by the <lb/>
public generally with regard to the <lb/>
tardiness with which business was <lb/>
done. It was not only the business of <lb/>
the Government to answer letters, and <lb/>
issue brands when applied for, and <lb/>
attend to communications in reference <lb/>
to public works, and that sort of thing. <lb/>
That was not their only business. <lb/>
Reference had been made that day to <lb/>
the salary of the members of the <lb/>
Government. He said they were not <lb/>
getting a cent too much. Two thou<lb break="no"/>sand five hundred dollars was not a <lb/>
cent too much. He would go a little <lb/>
farther and say probably it was not <lb/>
enough if they had as much work to <lb/>
do as they said they had. Well then, <lb/>
the business of the Government was <lb/>
not only to see that letters were <lb/>
answered and this or that business <lb/>
conducted quickly and efficiently. <lb/>
These Territories were large and there <lb/>
was room for a large number of people. <lb/>
He might add in passing that he did <lb/>
not complain of the amount for travel<lb break="no"/>ing expenses. He would not object if <lb/>
it were more, if ministers would get <lb/>
around among the people, and if he <lb/>
found it was resulting in some benefit <lb/>
to the people. Part of their business <lb/>
was to get acquainted with the <lb/>
wants and necessities of the people and <lb/>
if they were travelling about more and <lb/>
increasing this item for travelling ex<lb break="no"/>penses he would have no fault to find. <lb/>
But besides all this it was the duty of <lb/>
the Government to look after legislation <lb/>
and see that the necessary legislation <lb/>
was prepared. They heard the fault<lb break="no"/>finding of those who had to work under <lb/>
the conditions that exist; they heard <lb/>
of the drawbacks of the conditions <lb/>
under which people had to exist, and <lb/>
it lay with them to inaugurate any<lb break="no"/>thing which was going to be to the <lb/>
advantage of the Territories, which <lb/>
was going to contribute to the further<lb break="no"/>ing of the prosperity of the Territories, <lb/>
to the enhancing of its wealth and the <lb/>
increasing of its population. Had the <lb/>
Government done all that could reason<lb break="no"/>ably be expected of them in that re<lb break="no"/>gard? He said that as far as attending <lb/>
to the office business in his own case <lb/>
he had nothing to complain of, but at <lb/>
the same time complaints were <lb/>
numerous. But with regard to legis<lb break="no"/>lation he said that the best evidence <lb/>
that the Government had not paid so <lb/>
strict attention to the legislation of <lb/>
the country as they should, was to be <lb/>
 found in the fact—the very striking <lb/>
 fact—that after spending two years <lb/>
in the consolidation of the Ordinances, <lb/>
yet in the very first session after con<lb break="no"/>solidating it was found necessary to <lb/>
amend quite a number of the Ordi<lb break="no"/>nances, the consolidation of which was <lb/>
only completed in 1898. They readily un<lb break="no"/>derstood that necessity was alwayas <lb/>
arising for new legislation, but he <lb/>

<cb/>

felt that altogether the Government <lb/>
had not shown that attention and <lb/>
given that care to legislation that they <lb/>
should have done. <lb/></p> 

<p>He had taken the opportunity on <lb/>
different occasions not so much per<lb break="no"/>haps to criticise the policy of the <lb/>
Government as to enquire what that <lb/>
policy was, because really he had to <lb/>
ask for the information as the policy <lb/>
was something which was not very <lb/>
apparent to him. Well, on several <lb/>
occasions on which he had asked <lb/>
for that informal information, he <lb/>
was told that their policy would be <lb/>
 found in their legislation—that it was <lb/>
to be found embalmed in their Ordi<lb break="no"/>nances. Now, he quite agreed that <lb/>
some of the policy of the Government <lb/>
would be found in the Ordinances. <lb/>
They would take, for instance, for a <lb/>
moment a department that had been <lb/>
referred to at some length by the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial Treasurer, and that was the <lb/>
newly-created Department of Agricul<lb break="no"/>ture. The hon. gentleman had said <lb/>
that was a very important department <lb/>
and one that should have existed long <lb/>
before this, and that hitherto the busi<lb break="no"/>ness in connection with agriculture <lb/>
had been so great that it could not be <lb/>
attended to properly. All that, he (Dr. <lb/>
Brett) agreed with. He agreed that <lb/>
the department was one of the most <lb/>
important that could exist, particular<lb break="no"/>ly in this country, as well as elsewhere. <lb/>
Subjects came under the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of that Department which were <lb/>
of the utmost importance and in no <lb/>
country were they more important <lb/>
than in this country. But if they took <lb/>
the legislation, as far as the legislation <lb/>
was concerned there was nothing before <lb/>
the House to justify the existence of that <lb/>
Department in the Territories up to <lb/>
the present time. He did not wish to <lb/>
be misunderstood in what he said. It <lb/>
was not because the department was <lb/>
not important or that it should not <lb/>
have been created and should not ex<lb break="no"/>ist; this was not the ground he was <lb/>
taking; it was because of the work <lb/>
that was done and which the Assembly <lb/>
did not know anything about. If the <lb/>
department had all the importance <lb/>
ascribed to it, and was doing all the <lb/>
work credited to it, was it not impor<lb break="no"/>tant also that the Assembly should <lb/>
know what that department had been <lb/>
doing? On Friday night a report was <lb/>
laid on the table, but he had had no <lb/>
opportunity of studying it, and speak<lb break="no"/>ing honestly he was not privileged to <lb/>
criticise the head or the deputy head <lb/>
of that department, for he did not <lb/>
know what they had been doing. <lb/>
He did not know whether the money <lb/>
they had dealt with had been spent <lb/>
wisely or unwisely. He contended that <lb/>
one of the first duties of any depart<lb break="no"/>ment, when it came and asked for a large <lb/>
sum of money to support that depart<lb break="no"/>ment, was that it should lay information <lb/>
on the table of the House in such a way <lb/>
that every member would have an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of finding out exactly <lb/>
what had been done in that depart<lb break="no"/>ment. The department in question pre<lb break="no"/>sided over a great number of important <lb/>
matters in relation to these Terrotiroes, <lb/>
and among them was that of vital sta<lb break="no"/>tistics and statistics of other kinds. He <lb/>
rememberd that two years ago the <lb/>
hon. the Commissioner in introduc<lb break="no"/>ing the Statute Labor Ordinance dwelt <lb/>
on the necessity of procuring agricul<lb break="no"/>tural returns, and pointed out that <lb/>
these districts would form an excellent <lb/>
medium for this object. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman said that the question of getting <lb/>
statistics of the cattle, grain and pro<lb break="no"/>duce of the Territories was a matter of <lb/>
great importance to the Territories. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>, continuing, said that was <lb/>
two years ago, and he was not aware <lb/>
that any information on this important <lb/>
matter had been given to the public. <lb/>
He knew there were many people who <lb/>
were desirous of getting that inform<lb break="no"/>ation as to the country as a whole; <lb/>
they wished to get some statistics to <lb/>
show what the country was doing; <lb/>
they wished for statistics of some value <lb/>
that could be sent broadcast to the <lb/>
world, but they were unable to ob<lb break="no"/>tain those statistics. He repeated that <lb/>
the statement referred to had been <lb/>
made two years aago. He did not know <lb/>
how long it took to get the information. <lb/>
He knew it could not be done in a few <lb/>
weeks, but surely it could be done in a <lb/>
year, and certainly it ought to be <lb/>
done in less than two years. Had the <lb/>
House then any evidence that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had carried out that portion <lb/>
of its duty in the manner they should <lb/>
do in reference to these important re<lb break="no"/>turns of cereals and cattle? <lb/></p> 

<p>Then there were the vital statistics. <lb/>
He knew that many people might con<lb break="no"/>sider the Vital Statistics Ordinance <lb/>
an unimportant one to enforce, but he <lb/>
considered it a very important Ordi<lb break="no"/>nance. It was considered important <lb/>
in any other province, and although in <lb/>
the opinion of some, they were begin<lb break="no"/>ning the collection of these statistics <lb/>
very soon in their history yet he did <lb/>
not think himself that they were com<lb break="no"/>mencing a day too soon. They could <lb/>
not commence too soon, because if we <lb/>
were able to demonstrate from such <lb/>
returns that in this country we are <lb/>
freer from disease than in other coun<lb break="no"/>tries, it would be a great incentive to <lb/>
immigration. It could not, he though, <lb/>
fail to be a great stimulus to immigra<lb break="no"/>tion if he could be shown that we had <lb/>
a comparative immunity from those <lb/>
diseases; and therefore he regarded <lb/>
this matter as very important. The <lb/>
sooner the Government realised the <lb/>
importance of their agricultural and <lb/>
vital statistics, the sooner would they <lb/>
give it adequate attention, and attend <lb/>
to their business a little more care<lb break="no"/>fully than they had done in the past. <lb/></p> 

<p>There were other important Ordi<lb break="no"/>nances dealt with by this department. <lb/>
There was the sum of $4,000 for the <lb/>
destruction of noxious weeds. A con<lb break="no"/>siderable sum was expended last year, <lb/>
and he thought they should have had <lb/>
some report of this expenditure and its <lb/>
results. As it was the House did not <lb/>
know how it was expended, what plan <lb/>
was adopted and whether it was being <lb/>
successfully worked. Outside of the <lb/>
information they might have in indi<lb break="no"/>vidual cases the House was not in pos<lb break="no"/>session of any facts or information <lb/>
which would enable them to suggest <lb/>
any changes or made any amendments. <lb/>
They could not intelligently vote this <lb/>
$4,000 without knowing what good <lb/>
had been effected by the expenditure <lb/>
in the past. There was another matter <lb/>
which came under this department <lb/>
and that was agricultural societies. <lb/>
That matter had already been the <lb/>
subject of legislation this year and he <lb/>
was very glad to have an opporunity <lb/>
of congratulating the gentlement who <lb/>
brought in that new legislation, be<lb break="no"/>cause he thought it was the right <lb/>
direction, but still he thought it was <lb/>
not the best that could have been <lb/>
brought in in the best interests of the <lb/>
country. He might be accused of <lb/>
having ideas away up in the heavens. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—Oh, no. <lb/></p> 

<p>He had been accused of having <lb/>
ethereal ideas, but somehow those <lb/>
ideas had always subsequently materia<lb break="no"/>lised into the policy of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It took in some instances on <lb/>
year, in some two years and in some <lb/>
three years for them to bring each <lb/>
particular idea he had advocated into <lb/>
practice, but it was only a matter of <lb/>
time. He had expressed an opinion in <lb/>
the past that a great deal of money <lb/>
had been spent on agricultural socie<lb break="no"/>ties with very little benefit to the <lb/>
Territories. One object of these socie<lb break="no"/>ties was to show to people who wish <lb/>
to come in here that this country is <lb/>
capable of raising good cereals and <lb/>
cattle and vegetables, and that this <lb/>

<cb/>

country generally is a desirable one to <lb/>
live in. How much good did these <lb/>
small shows do on this line? No doubt <lb/>
they did a certain amount of good in <lb/>
creating local rivalry, but he had a <lb/>
suggestion to make on a larger scale <lb/>
than that. Perhaps his ideas would not <lb/>
meet the approval of all, but it was <lb/>
not merely to get the approval of the <lb/>
majority that he was talking. He was <lb/>
talking about the policy which he <lb/>
believed would be for the best interests <lb/>
of the country irrespective of ma<lb break="no"/>jorities in that House; and he said <lb/>
this: Let the Government instead of <lb/>
distributing this sum over a number of <lb/>
small societies, instead of doing that, let <lb/>
them take this eleven thousand dollars <lb/>
and spend it on one good fair; let it be <lb/>
in Regina, or Calgary, or Edmonton, or <lb/>
Moosomin, or Prince Albert. Let the <lb/>
Territories give a substantial sum that <lb/>
would warrant a locality in having the <lb/>
show. They would all remember the <lb/>
Territorial show held in Regina. He <lb/>
would admit that that show, perhaps <lb/>
was not as well managed as it might <lb/>
have been, but it attracted a great <lb/>
number of people, and the number of <lb/>
entries was larger than at Winnipeg or <lb/>
Toronto, and he did not suppose any <lb/>
one sould yet tell how far-reaching <lb/>
the effects of that exhibition would be. <lb/>
They knew that a good number of peo<lb break="no"/>ple who came in here to witness that <lb/>
show afterwards became permanent <lb/>
settlers. Probably every hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man could point to some settlers of that <lb/>
kind in his own district. Let the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment if necessary curtail expendi<lb break="no"/>ture in regard to the small shows, and <lb/>
give a sum to have a good fair. Let it <lb/>
be a travelling show if they liked, at <lb/>
some point in Eastern Assiniboia one <lb/>
year, in Alberta the next, at Calgary <lb/>
or Edmonton, as the case might be, <lb/>
next, in West Assiniboia the next, and <lb/>
after a while they might be sure Prince <lb/>
Albert would claim the distinction of <lb/>
having it there. This plan would do <lb/>
more good than the small shows and <lb/>
he thought this was a pretty general <lb/>
opinion throughout the country. He <lb/>
knew he had talked with men who took <lb/>
a great interest in agricultural matters, <lb/>
and who were well qualified to speak; <lb/>
and while, these gentlemen thought <lb/>
that some benefit was derived locally <lb/>
from the small shows, they were of <lb/>
opinion that the benefit, could not be <lb/>
compared at all with what would be <lb/>
derived from the holding of large fairs. <lb/>
He hoped the Government would con<lb break="no"/>sider the matter and next year adopt <lb/>
and press forward something of the <lb/>
kind suggested. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> next referred to immigra<lb break="no"/>tion. He had, he said, mentioned the <lb/>
subject on previous occasions and he <lb/>
had been told by the leader of the <lb/>
House that it was not constitutional <lb/>
for that  House to deal with immigra<lb break="no"/>tion matters. Now, he was not going <lb/>
to quarrel with the leader of the House <lb/>
as to whether it was constitutional to <lb/>
go into a general system of immigra<lb break="no"/>tion or not, but he certainly thought <lb/>
they were perfectly constitutional and <lb/>
within their rights in discussing the <lb/>
matter. Some might say they had not <lb/>
the money to deal with it. Probably <lb/>
not; but there were different, direc<lb break="no"/>tions in which he thought the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should have moved and should he <lb/>
actually moving in connection with <lb/>
immigration, We were having a <lb/>
number of Doukhobors and Galicians <lb/>
brought into the Territories. It might <lb/>
be said, "What have we to do with <lb/>
that? The Dominion Government are <lb/>
doing that." True they are, but on <lb/>
whom is the responsibility thrown <lb/>
directly, these people get here? The <lb/>
responsibility was thrown on the <lb/>
local government of educating them <lb/>
and providing for any distress among <lb/>
them. It might be that in this latter <lb/>
case the Dominion Government would <lb/>
re-imburse them, but the first duty of <lb/>
seeing that these people did not suffer <lb/>
would fall on the Territories. There <lb/>
was no doubt the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was imposing a great responsi<lb break="no"/>bility on the Territories  in respect of <lb/>
these people, and he thought the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories should have sould say in the <lb/>
matter. He thought people living in <lb/>
the Territories should know as well <lb/>
as the people at Ottawa how and <lb/>
where those people should be settled <lb/>
—whether they should be settled in <lb/>
colonies, or should be distributed <lb/>
among other settlers who would <lb/>
benefit by having a plentiful supply <lb/>
of cheap labor. If the Government did <lb/>
not think it was in their power or <lb/>
within their discretion to take action <lb/>
in the matter, then the House should <lb/>
take upon themselves the duty of <lb/>
pointing out that the Territories <lb/>
should be consulted with re<lb break="no"/>ference to the nature and class <lb/>
of immigrants to be sent in; the <lb/>
manner in which they are to be <lb/>
located in colonies and be dependent <lb/>
on themselves, or located among the <lb/>
older settlers of the country. The <lb/>
question in his opinion was import<lb break="no"/>ant one. It might be productive of a <lb/>

<cb/>

large amount of evil and a large <lb/>
amount of expensve and it should be <lb/>
one of the first duties of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to provide against disastrous <lb/>
consequences in the future. <lb/></p> 

<p>Another thing of importance was <lb/>
the compiling of a book containing <lb/>
information about the Territories and <lb/>
which would be sent out under the <lb/>
authority of the Government. It was <lb/>
true they had not a large amount of <lb/>
money, but he thought sufficient could <lb/>
be found for that purpose. If they <lb/>
picked up the so-called immigration <lb/>
literature issued by the Dominion <lb/>
Government what did they find? They <lb/>
found that the Territories were given <lb/>
a very small space. In one that was <lb/>
circulated a little while ago the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories occupied about four inches in a <lb/>
300 or 400 page book. He said there<lb break="no"/>fore that it behooved the Government <lb/>
to see that a suitable pamphlet, de<lb break="no"/>scriptive of this country and its re<lb break="no"/>sources, should be printed and placed <lb/>
in the hands of the people. The C.P.R. <lb/>
was anxious to distribute literature, <lb/>
but it was not the business of the <lb/>
C.P.R. as much as it was of the <lb/>
Government of the Territories to see <lb/>
that proper literature was compiled <lb/>
and distributed, descriptive of the <lb/>
products and resources of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> went on to read a letter <lb/>
dated March 28th, written by the <lb/>
Commissioner of Public Works <lb/>
to the Regina Board of Trade. It <lb/>
seemed, he said, that the Board was <lb/>
desirous of demonstrating to the world <lb/>
that it was possible to obtain a water <lb/>
supply in the lands south of Regina. <lb/>
So important was it considered that <lb/>
the Council of Regina were willing to <lb/>
contribute a certain amount; the <lb/>
C.P.R. having lands for sale contribut<lb break="no"/>ted an amount of $500; the <lb/>
Hudson Bay Co., $500; and the Board <lb/>
of Trade thought it was not an impro<lb break="no"/>per thing, or an unreasonable thing, to <lb/>
ask the North-West Government what <lb/>
assistance they would give to demon<lb break="no"/>strate that there was water in these <lb/>
lands, this being the only obstacle to <lb/>
settlement south of Regina. The <lb/>
Board asked, therefore, that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would assist them by placing <lb/>
an auger at their disposal to make the <lb/>
necessary tests. Mr. Ross's letter <lb/>
(which has already been published) as <lb/>
read by Dr. Brett was, in brief, that <lb/>
the Government had no machine avail<lb break="no"/>able, and that in any case the depart<lb break="no"/>ment could not see its way clear to bor<lb break="no"/>ing for water in unsettled townships <lb/>
while its resources were already being <lb/>
taxed to the utmost to provide water <lb/>
in districts already settled. The present <lb/>
policy of the government did not in<lb break="no"/>clude what might be termed exploring <lb/>
for water in unsettled districts to aid <lb/>
in the settlement of these districts. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> said no doubt that was a <lb/>
very good policy as far as it went, but <lb/>
were the Government going to tie <lb/>
themselves down to one little narrow <lb/>
groove which was not capable of diver<lb break="no"/>sion or expansion or of being widened? <lb/>
Was it not possible to discover other <lb/>
avenues to which they could devote <lb/>
the public money with advantage? If <lb/>
thy were so narrow; if that was their <lb/>
policy; if they were so contracted that <lb/>
they could not go outside the policy <lb/>
already laid down; if they were not <lb/>
broad enough to assist in in the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of valuable lands, and had not <lb/>
energy enough to develop by their <lb/>
energies and their acts the great re<lb break="no"/>sources of this country as rapidly and <lb/>
as effectively as ought to be done, <lb/>
then he said that although he might <lb/>
enjoy the reputation of having wild <lb/>
 ideas—(Mr. Haultain: Hear, hear)—of <lb/>
having impracticable ideas, yet he <lb/>
would rather have that reputation <lb/>
than the reputation the Government <lb/>
 would make for itself—he would rather <lb/>
 enjoy that reputation and that notor<lb break="no"/>iety—and especially as he knew <lb/>
that judging by the past he would soon <lb/>
have the sanctification of finding that his <lb/>
ideas were being gradually assimilated <lb/>
by the Government and embodied in <lb/>
their policy. <lb/></p> 

<p>But if he had hitherto enjoyed such a <lb/>
reputation he felt that he might now <lb/>
step down and give place to another <lb/>
hon. gentleman to take his place after <lb/>
what they had listened to that after<lb break="no"/>noon on another subject. He did not <lb/>
think any hon. gentleman present ever <lb/>
listened to a responsible Minister <lb/>
speaking to a responsible Assembly on <lb/>
a subject of so much importance to this <lb/>
country as a change in the constitution <lb/>
 of the country;—no hon. gentleman <lb/>
could fail to be struck with <lb/>
the idea;-well, really the English lan<lb break="no"/>guage failed to find him words to de<lb break="no"/>scribe exactly what he wanted to say; <lb/>
but anyway if ever any hon. gentleman <lb/>
present listened to such flights of imagin<lb break="no"/>ation as they had listened to from the <lb/>
hon. Territorial Treasurer that after<lb break="no"/>noon, he was quite sure those flights of <lb/>
imagination did not come from him (the <lb/>
speaker.) <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> went on to say that he had <lb/>

<cb/>

already intimated that year after year <lb/>
he had had to ask what was the policy <lb/>
of the Government. For three or four <lb/>
years they had been talking of provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy. He was quite sure that <lb/>
provincial autonomy was one of those <lb/>
subjects that the Government did not <lb/>
like him to mention. They said that <lb/>
so many men raised their hands in holy <lb/>
horror when it was mentioned that it <lb/>
was better not to refer to it. But he <lb/>
always called a spade a spade, and when <lb/>
he had spoken of provincial autonomy <lb/>
on previous occasions he had been told <lb/>
that he was speaking wildly; that he <lb/>
was talking in the air; that he was <lb/>
speaking of things even their children <lb/>
would not realise till they were grey; <lb/>
and yet in two years they found it laid <lb/>
down in that House that the time had <lb/>
come when they must consider provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy. Dr. Brett quoted from <lb/>
THE LEADER report of the session of <lb/>
1897 to show what Mr. Haultain's views <lb/>
then were on the subject. He went on <lb/>
to say that the policy of the <choice><sic>Govern<lb break="no"/>then</sic><corr>Government</corr></choice> was to hang on to the Yukon and <lb/>
not to let any portion of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies, whether in the east, west, north or <lb/>
south be taken from us; and that, if <lb/>
there was not an increase of subsidy <lb/>
the next step would have to be provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy. That was in 1897. Well <lb/>
there had been no increase in the sub<lb break="no"/>sidy. The estimates before then were <lb/>
based on exactly the same amount. <lb/>
Now, when was provincial autonomy <lb/>
going to come? When was the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment going to take action? Were <lb/>
the Government going to come there <lb/>
year after year making nice-sounding <lb/>
speeches to tickle the ears of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers and of the public, to buoy their <lb/>
hopes up, and lead them to believe that <lb/>
they were going to do something great? <lb/>
Well then the definite policy in 1898 of <lb/>
the Government was provincial autono<lb break="no"/>my if an increased subsidy could not be <lb/>
procured. But in the elections in the <lb/>
fall what did they find? The proper <lb/>
course of the Government in those <lb/>
elections was to have enunciated and <lb/>
enforced that the policy so far as they <lb/>
could. In the western portion of the <lb/>
country where that policy was supposed <lb/>
to suit the people it was their battle <lb/>
cry. They spoke that way at Edmon<lb break="no"/>ton and at Calgary. What they said <lb/>
at Moosomin and the eastern parts he <lb/>
could not say positively for he was not <lb/>
there to hear them, but he had reason <lb/>
to believe that in that portion of the <lb/>
country the people did not want au<lb break="no"/>tonomy because they thought it meant <lb/>
taxation. He did not know how far <lb/>
the Government went in the east to <lb/>
try and educate the people there up to <lb/>
 their policy—how far they went in <lb/>
order to induce the people to vote for <lb/>
 the men of their choice—but if they did <lb/>
not use every means in their power on <lb/>
that line them they were not acting <lb/>
fairly towards the people of this coun<lb break="no"/>try. To-day they found that there was <lb/>
another policy. That policy was pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy, it was true, but un<lb break="no"/>der very different circumstances. They <lb/>
were to first get as much as they could <lb/>
on capital account, and get the popula<lb break="no"/>tion estimated as high as possible. He <lb/>
thought the estimate of 150,000 well <lb/>
within the mark. Certainly before any <lb/>
final arrangement was made the popu<lb break="no"/>lation would be well over the mark <lb/>
at that estimate. The speaker went on <lb/>
to recapitulate the various points in <lb/>
Mr. Ross's outline of the claims to be <lb/>
made; and referring to the suggested <lb/>
revenue from the public lands of a mil<lb break="no"/>lion dollars a year, he said that when <lb/>
the Territorial Treasurer made that <lb/>
statement he thought to himself that <lb/>
this was splendid, and if the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were the men who could do this <lb/>
they were just the Government the <lb/>
country wanted. The hon. gentlemen <lb/>
thought that if we could get a million <lb/>
dollars a year we should not want to <lb/>
borrow any money. There was no <lb/>
doubt that if we could get a million <lb/>
dollars a year in lieu of our public <lb/>
lands we should be in a nice position. <lb/>
We should be getting more <lb/>
than any other Province in the <lb/>
Dominion if this were fulfilled; but he <lb/>
would ask hon. member did they take <lb/>
the proposition seriously? Coming <lb/>
from a responsible minister and ad<lb break="no"/>dressed to them as members of that <lb/>
Assembly, did they take it seriously <lb/>
that they were to sit there and wait <lb/>
till the Government could make such <lb/>
an arrangement as that before they <lb/>
could change their political complexion? <lb/>
Did they not take it in the light of mere <lb/>
bombast to attract the attention of <lb/>
those who did not favor the idea of <lb/>
taxation and borrowing money? If <lb/>
the youngest men in that House had <lb/>
to wait for such an arragment as <lb/>
that to be made with the Dominion <lb/>
Government, did not venture even <lb/>
to think how old that man would be <lb/>
before the arrangement was made. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:ANON1">A voice</persName>—How about me? <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName>—Oh, you will be dead sure. <lb/>
(Laughter.) Continuing the speaker <lb/>
said that if the Government were <lb/>
  honest to-day—because they had come <lb/>
to the jumping off point in respect of [...]<lb/></p>

<p>THE LEADER last week contained a <lb/>
a portion of the report of the Budget <lb/>
Debate in the Assembly on April 25th– <lb/>
 the speeches of the Territorial Trea<lb break="no"/>surer (Mr. Ross) and the leader of the <lb/>
Opposition (Dr. Brett) and part of the <lb/>
speech of the member for North Re<lb break="no"/>gina (Mr. Brown) who followed and re<lb break="no"/>plied to Dr. Brett. This week we pub<lb break="no"/>lish the conclusion of Mr. Brown's <lb/>
speech and of the debate, and a con<lb break="no"/>tinuation of our consecutive report of <lb/>
the sessional proceedings. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BROW6">MR. BROWN</persName> contended that, the <lb/>
Government had managed the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the country wisely and well, <lb/>
profiting by and avoiding the mistakes <lb/>
of other provinces. He contended <lb/>
that if the Government now relinquish<lb break="no"/>ed office and another government took <lb/>
the reins, not in any particular would <lb/>
the new government find itself ham<lb break="no"/>pered by mistakes of the old. He re<lb break="no"/>erred to the able manner in which <lb/>
new and peculiar conditions had been <lb/>
coped with. He drew a parallel be<lb break="no"/>tween the Territories and Manitoba in <lb/>
its earlier stage. Manitoba adopted <lb/>
its system from the older provinces; <lb/>
but, government of the Territories <lb/>
said "No, a complex and expensive <lb/>
system, such as exists in Manitoba and <lb/>
the older provinces will not suit us," <lb/>
and so they commenced with a system <lb/>
dealing only with the actual needs of <lb/>
the country at that time. Those needs <lb/>
had grown and the system had been <lb/>
expanded to meet them. The result <lb/>
was that when they became a province <lb/>
instead of the provincial government <lb/>
taking over a great mass of chaos they <lb/>
would take over a country with insti<lb break="no"/>tutions sufficiently developed to carry <lb/>
on the business of the country to ad<lb break="no"/>vantage. <lb/></p> 

<p>Speaking of the remarks of the Terri<lb break="no"/>torial Treasurer as to the public lands <lb/>
Dr. Brett had characterised them as <lb/>
mere bombast. He (Mr. Brown) <lb/>
thought the members of that House <lb/>
were just as able to say what bombast <lb/>
was as the hon. member for Banff was. <lb/>
He contended that the proposition laid <lb/>
down by the Territorial Treasurer was <lb/>
reasonable and a just proposition. <lb/>
Every other province had been dealt <lb/>
with on the principle that the lands <lb/>
were their own. If the Territories <lb/>
were justly treated they would get the <lb/>
benefit of those lands which should be<lb break="no"/>long to them by right, but which had <lb/>
been disposed of or did not now be<lb break="no"/>long to them owing to the peculiar <lb/>
position in which they were placed at <lb/>
the beginning. The Province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba was once in the same position. <lb/>
The Dominion Government offered <lb/>
Manitoba, a consideration for their <lb/>
lands, but when they did so they did <lb/>
not say to Manitoba, "You have no <lb/>
right to these lands." No; they admitted <lb/>
that the lands belonged to Manitoba: <lb/>
and what they did say was "We will <lb/>
give you so much, not in part compen<lb break="no"/>sation but in lieu of those lands and as <lb/>
an equivalent for them." There, had <lb/>
been a great dispute with Manitoba as <lb/>
to what the lands were worth. The <lb/>
Dominion Government made a sharp <lb/>
bargain with Manitoba at that time, <lb/>
and there could be no man conversant <lb/>
with the facts but who believed that <lb/>
some day the Dominion would have to <lb/>
make Manitoba some further allow<lb break="no"/>ance in respect of those lands. The <lb/>
Territories should note and benefit by <lb/>
the experience of Manitoba. Dr. Brett <lb/>
seemed to think that the lands, of the <lb/>
Territories were not worth the value <lb/>
put upon them by the Territorial Trea<lb break="no"/>surer. Well, if they were not worth a <lb/>
dollar an acre they were coming very <lb/>
near to not being worth anything at <lb/>
all. But if the Dominion Government <lb/>
was not prepared, to settle, in the <lb/>
 way suggested let them hand the lands <lb/>
over to the Territories and, thus pre<lb break="no"/>vent any dispute that, might arise. <lb/>
And with regard to the price of the <lb/>
lands let them remember that although <lb/>
35 million acres had been alienated <lb/>
they had been alienated at a price. <lb/>
Let that be the price if it came to <lb/>
that, or if they wanted to be mag<lb break="no"/>nanimous let them cut it in two. On <lb/>
the other hand, there were charges <lb/>
against the Territories which would <lb/>
live to be deducted, and he was sure <lb/>
every hon. gentleman in that, House <lb/>
was willing to come to a settlement <lb/>
based on the exact rights of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories no matter what those rights may <lb/>
be; and it was not for that House or <lb/>
any member of that House to assume <lb/>
beforehand that when they had certain <lb/>
rights the Dominion Government <lb/>
would refuse to give them those rights. <lb/>
The Dominion Government had never <lb/>
been approached on the question; and <lb/>
until the Dominion Government re<lb break="no"/>fused to give to the Territories the <lb/>
rights they could demand, they had no <lb/>
right to say that the Government at <lb/>
Ottawa would so refuse, <lb/>
</p> 

<p>Then Dr. Brett had a plan for meet<lb break="no"/>
 
 <cb/>
 
 ing the elevator monopoly. He would <lb/>
have a great system of Government <lb/>
elevators. He (Mr. Brown) thought if <lb/>
they could do away with the elevator <lb/>
retrictions the matter would right, it<lb break="no"/>self. He did not believe in the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment going into any works which <lb/>
the people could provide for them<lb break="no"/>selves. Dr. Brett had stated fur<lb break="no"/>ther that the Dominion Government <lb/>
borrowed money to carry on the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Now the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had no right, nor had any other <lb/>
Government any right to borrow one <lb/>
dollar, except to be expended on capi<lb break="no"/>tal account. Dr. Brett spoke as if all <lb/>
a government had to do if it wanted <lb/>
money for any purpose whatever, was <lb/>
to borrow it, but he (Mr. Brown) as<lb break="no"/>serted that this Government had no <lb/>
right, nor had any other Government <lb/>
any right to borrow money unless they <lb/>
could show an asset equal to the <lb/>
amount borrowed. <lb/>
</p> 

<p>What was the position of the Terri<lb break="no"/>torial legislature to-day? For the <lb/>
last twenty-two years they had been <lb/>
 growing—growing from a body in <lb/>
which, the people had not one single <lb/>
elected representative to one in <lb/>
which the people had some re<lb break="no"/>resentation, and from that to one <lb/>
in which the people only were re<lb break="no"/>resented, until they were now a Legis<lb break="no"/>ative Assembly with extended powers, <lb/>
with only one more step to be taken, <lb/>
and, that was the assumption of <lb/>
final, measure of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the form of provincial estab<lb break="no"/>lishment. He thought hon. gentlemen <lb/>
would agree with him that the country <lb/>
had not grown faster than its institu<lb break="no"/>tions; the country had not grown <lb/>
faster than our powers to govern had <lb/>
increased; and hon. gentlemen would <lb/>
also agree with him that the earlier <lb/>
stages of development had been passed <lb/>
through with less taxation and less <lb/>
burdens than had been the case with <lb/>
any province of the Dominion. <lb/></p> 

<p>It had been stated that one of the <lb/>
great advantages to this country from <lb/>
provincial autonomy would be the pow<lb break="no"/>er to borrow money to build railroads. <lb/>
He would point out that we have <lb/>
2,000 miles of railroads to 100,000 <lb/>
people. No province in Canada could <lb/>
show a greater mileage of railways in <lb/>
proportion to population than this. <lb/>
Now, it was not only a question of <lb/>
building railways. Railways when <lb/>
they were built had to be kept up; <lb/>
they could not live on the wind. If <lb/>
there were more railways than were <lb/>
needed, then those railroads had to <lb/>
combine and force the rates up to a <lb/>
point at which they could live. The <lb/>
result therefore of having railways <lb/>
that were not actually needed would <lb/>
be that the people would have <lb/>
to pay increased railway rates. <lb/>
He was not at all sure that <lb/>
they had not enough railways for <lb/>
their present needs. If a question of <lb/>
rates were brought forward there was <lb/>
no court of law that would give any <lb/>
other decision than that a railway <lb/>
should have a reasonable income, and <lb/>
unless railways could obtain a reason<lb break="no"/>able income from the natural and legi<lb break="no"/>timate business of the country they <lb/>
would obtain it by increased rates <lb/>
which the people would have to pay. <lb/>
What was wanted was to either own <lb/>
the railways or have control over them; <lb/>
and he did not think any North-West <lb/>
Government should give one single <lb/>
dollar to bonus a railway. If the <lb/>
Northern Pacific could come in with <lb/>
paltry bonus of $1,750 a mile and make <lb/>
a success of it, why give $10,000 a mile? <lb/>
They had better keep their money, in <lb/>
their pockets than have to pay higher <lb/>
rates and give a bonus too. It was not <lb/>
difficult to build railroads in the west <lb/>
it was not a mountainous country, <lb/>
railways were easy to construct. <lb/>
There was therefore not the need to <lb/>
bonus railroads which might exist in <lb/>
dsitricts where roads were more diffi<lb break="no"/>cult and expensive to construct. <lb/>
</p> 

<p>The speaker next referred to the pub<lb break="no"/>lic lands which were exempt from tax<lb break="no"/>ation. Before they borrowed money <lb/>
or undertook any burden of debt he <lb/>
thought their first duty was to find out <lb/>
what their assets were for the purposes <lb/>
of taxation and what portion of the <lb/>
country was going to hear the burden <lb/>
of that, debt. C.P.R. lands and other <lb/>
lands were at present in such a position <lb/>
that they could not be taxed. They <lb/>
needed to know whether one-fifth of <lb/>
the land was to bear the burden of the <lb/>
whole. When they were asked on the <lb/>
one hand to exercise borrowing powers <lb/>
and increase the burden of taxation, he <lb/>
said on the other hand that their pro<lb break="no"/>per course was not to tie their own <lb/>
hands but strive for that to which they <lb/>
had a right, and to strive to settle for <lb/>
all time whether all or only a portion <lb/>
of the land was to be available for the <lb/>
purposes of taxation. When that all <lb/>
important question was settled then <lb/>
they might be able to consider the <lb/>
question of borrowing money. Lenders <lb/>
of money were not fools, and if we <lb/>
went into the money markets of , the <lb/>
world those money lenders would look <lb/>
at our circumstances very closely. If <lb/>
we had to borrow money with a large <lb/>
incubus of untaxable land we could <lb/>
only borrow it at a rate that would be <lb/>
ruinous to the Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p>As to the question of the division of <lb/>
the Territories he thought that was a <lb/>
matter to be settled when we receiv<lb break="no"/>ed provincial government. For his <lb/>
own part he hoped the result would be <lb/>
one province. He should like to see a <lb/>
 province—the greatest province in <lb/>
Canada which was the premier colony <lb/>
of the British Empire. He did not <lb/>
want to have two or three or four <lb/>
weakling province but one strong pro<lb break="no"/>vince whose voice, if not dominant in <lb/>
the councils of Canada, could at least <lb/>
at all time be heard with effect. But <lb/>
rather than any portion should be a <lb/>
part of that province against its will. <lb/>
rather than such portion should <lb/>
be prevented from running into <lb/>
debt, and should be accusing <lb/>
us of keeping them back <lb/>
 
<cb/>

and retarding their progress—rather, <lb/>
he said, than occupy that position he <lb/>
would be willing to let that portion he  <lb/>
cut off so that they might enjoy the <lb/>
doubtful privileges which they wished <lb/>
to enjoy; but at the same time he <lb/>
should deeply regret to see the power <lb/>
of the new province to assert itself <lb/>
eventually as the premier province of <lb/>
the Dominion in any way impaired. In <lb/>
conclusion he would say that if the pre<lb break="no"/>sent administration had given the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories good government, if it occupied <lb/>
such a strong position that even the <lb/>
hon. member for Banff when they came <lb/>
to analyse his speech was found, to <lb/>
agree with them in the main, if they <lb/>
had preserved the powers and the <lb/>
rights of the Territories intact and had <lb/>
so ordered the affairs of the country <lb/>
that any government which followed <lb/>
them could enter into their duties <lb/>
without being hampered by either their  <lb/>
misdeeds or ther mistakes—if, he said, <lb/>
this was the record of the Government, <lb/>
then he thought that Government <lb/>
ought to receive the commendation <lb/>
and support of that legislature and of <lb/>
the people at large. (Applause.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">SASKATCHEWAN SPEAKS UP.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MEYE1">Mr. MEYERS</persName> (Kinistino) said the <lb/>
few remarks he had to make would not <lb/>
delay the House for any great length <lb/>
of time; in fact he had made up his <lb/>
mind, not to take any part in that <lb/>
the night's debate, but although not an <lb/>
Irishman he thought he might be per<lb break="no"/>mitted an Irishman's privilege to <lb/>
change his mind. In the first place <lb/>
it afforded him great pleasure to add <lb/>
his congratulations to the member for <lb/>
Moose Jaw on the eminently satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory manner in which he had delivered <lb/>
what might be called his maiden <lb/>
speech as the Treasurer of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. He was sure the <lb/>
House would agree with him that <lb/>
that speech was not only ably <lb/>
though out and well delivered, but <lb/>
as to commend itself to the favorable <lb/>
consideration, of the House. As one of <lb/>
the old members he also quite agreed <lb/>
with the hon. member for Moose Jaw <lb/>
in regard to what he had said about <lb/>
the budget speeches which had <lb/>
been delivered in that chamber for <lb/>
Some years past by the leader of the <lb/>
House. As one of the oldest members <lb/>
of the House he had listened with a <lb/>
great deal of interest to those speeches, <lb/>
and he was sure the information deriv<lb break="no"/>ed from those speeches, and the great <lb/>
ability with which they were delivered <lb/>
would long be remembered, by those <lb/>
who had the privilege of listening to <lb/>
Mr. Meyers went on to refer to <lb/>
the system of education prevailing in <lb/>
the Territories. They had, he said, not <lb/>
heard much on the subject in that <lb/>
session but in previous years they had <lb/>
heard a great deal about the expensive<lb break="no"/>ness of the system; Well, to those who <lb/>
were unacquainted with the system it <lb/>
might appear expensive; but the sys<lb break="no"/>tem was equal to any in Canada, and <lb/>
he might go farther and say it was <lb/>
equal to any system in the world. It <lb/>
was a system which, the more it was <lb/>
examined, the more it would commend <lb/>
itself to the people of the Territories, <lb/>
or of any other part of, the country. <lb/>
He found that in something like six <lb/>
years the school population had in<lb break="no"/>creased something like, 150 per cent; <lb/>
 and although the rapid increase might <lb/>
be embarrassing from a financial point <lb/>
of view; yet he thought it was a fact on <lb/>
which the country might congratulate <lb/>
itself. With regard to the public <lb/>
works he also thought the position <lb/>
was one which would commend itself <lb/>
to the favorable consideration of the <lb/>
people of the Territories, as a whole. <lb/>
He noticed in the estimates a certain <lb/>
expenditure for deep wells and dams; <lb/>
and he might say in the interests of <lb/>
the people he represented that he <lb/>
thought these were very important ob<lb break="no"/>jects. Although in many portions of <lb/>
his district there was an abundance of <lb/>
water at easy depths, yet in other parts <lb/>
deep wells were very much needed, and <lb/>
he sincerely hoped that it was the in<lb break="no"/>tention of the Government to take in<lb break="no"/>to consideration the wants of his part <lb/>
of the country and of the whole of the <lb/>
northern part of the country in respect <lb/>
of those matters to which their atten<lb break="no"/>tion had already been called. Then <lb/>
again there was the question of agri<lb break="no"/>culture which they would all agree <lb/>
was a very important one. They had <lb/>
heard a good deal about the excellent <lb/>
system of the Department of Agricul<lb break="no"/>ture,and he quite agreed with the hon. <lb/>
member for Banff that this was one of <lb/>
the most important departments, as <lb/>
agriculture was one of the most impor<lb break="no"/>tant, in fact in every way the most im<lb break="no"/>portant industry in the country. There <lb/>
could be no doubt about that; and <lb/>
with reference to that department he <lb/>
thought that what should be aimed at <lb/>
was as thorough and efficient a system <lb/>
as possible with a view of bringing out <lb/>
the best capabilities of the country at <lb/>
large. It seemed to him that there <lb/>
was no department which had a better <lb/>
opportunity of showing, the capabili<lb break="no"/>ties of the country rapidly and success<lb break="no"/>fully than the Department of Agricul<lb break="no"/>ture. They were informed that the <lb/>
system at Regina was an expensive <lb/>
system, but when they looked at the <lb/>
vast extent of this country, he could <lb/>
not see that it was expensive in com<lb break="no"/>parison with the amount of work to be <lb/>
done. Certainly he thought it would <lb/>
be premature for any one to come to <lb/>
the conclusion at present that it was <lb/>
more expensive than the necessities of <lb/>
the country called for. It had only <lb/>
been in vogue a few months. A year <lb/>
ago they had no agricultural depart<lb break="no"/>ment whatever, and to-day so far as he <lb/>
was in a position to judge they had a <lb/>
department in the hands of a very effi<lb break="no"/>cient staff of officials who were main<lb break="no"/>tained at an expense which he did not <lb/>
think at all out of proportion in com<lb break="no"/>parison with the amount, and impor<lb break="no"/>tance of the work which they perform<lb break="no"/>ed. At a previous session a Brand <lb/>
Ordinance was introduced. At that <lb/>
time the proper registration of brands <lb/> 

<cb/>


was in its infancy, and he might go <lb/>
further and say that it was in its in<lb break="no"/>fancy to-day compared with what it <lb/>
would be. The number of brands had <lb/>
increased one hundred per cent., viz., <lb/>
from 3,500 to 7,000. He thought that <lb/>
was a pretty good proof that the sys<lb break="no"/>tem must be satisfactory, otherwise it <lb/>
would not be so largely taken advan<lb break="no"/>tage of. Then again they had heard a <lb/>
good deal about the experimental <lb/>
farms. They had heard that they <lb/>
might not be a success, and also that <lb/>
they might be premature. As he un<lb break="no"/>derstood it they were to be not so <lb/>
much experimental farms in the large <lb/>
sense of the term as experimental plots, <lb/>
and the expense could not be very <lb/>
great. The step was one in the right <lb/>
direction and one that would commend <lb/>
itself to the favorable consideration <lb/>
of the farmers of the Territories, and <lb/>
for which he thought the Agriculture <lb/>
Department deserved a great deal of <lb/>
credit. <lb/></p>
 
 <p>
There was another subject, however, <lb/>
on which he regretted very much that <lb/>
he could note agree with the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber of Moose Jaw, and that was the <lb/>
omission from the Estimates of any <lb/>
bounty for the destruction of coyotes. <lb/>
It might seem to some that a matter <lb/>
of $1,500 for this object was a small <lb/>
matter and hardly worthy of consider<lb break="no"/>ation, but it was a matter that affected <lb/>
the Saskatchewan country very seri<lb break="no"/>ously. In the last two or three years <lb/>
the attention of the Government had <lb/>
been drawn to the ravages purpetrated <lb/>
by the coyotes and prairie wolves. Per<lb break="no"/>haps some hon. gentlemen might not <lb/>
  be aware—he was not aware of it him<lb break="no"/>self till tow or three years ago—that <lb/>
there was a difference between the coy<lb break="no"/>ote and the prairie wolf. The coyote <lb/>
was more particularly destructive to <lb/>
sheep. The prairie wolf was a cross <lb/>
between the wolf proper and the coy<lb break="no"/>ote, and it was particularly <lb/>
destructive to young animals. There <lb/>
was a sum of $1,500 for the destruction <lb/>
of timber wolves in the west. They <lb/>
understood from the Territorial Treas<lb break="no"/>urer that in the west the Stock Asso<lb break="no"/>ciation paid a certain bonus which was <lb/>
to be supplemented by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment grant. He (Mr. Meyers) wished <lb/>
to say on behalf of the district he re<lb break="no"/>presented, and the people of the north, <lb/>
that during the last three or four years <lb/>
a small bounty had been subscribed by <lb/>
the farmers themselves. No doubt the <lb/>
amount was small, because the circum<lb break="no"/>stances of the people were not perhaps <lb/>
very large, but they had plodded on <lb/>
year after year in this matter of wolf <lb/>
destruction in the hope of receiving <lb/>
some assistance from the Territorial <lb/>
Government, and he had hoped that <lb/>
some provision wouid be made in the <lb/>
present Estimates. They were told <lb/>
that if the same amount was given as <lb/>
for timber wolves it would be very <lb/>
small, but even if the provision made <lb/>
were small he thought some provision <lb/>
should be made with a view to helping <lb/>
those who were helping themselves <lb/>
with a view of protecting their cattle <lb/>
and sheep and young animals. Refer<lb break="no"/>ence had been made in the debate to <lb/>
the subjects of immigration and pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy. These were impor<lb break="no"/>tant subjects, but as the hour was get<lb break="no"/>ting late and there were others to fol<lb break="no"/>low he would not attempt to grapple <lb/>
with them, but leave them to other and <lb/>
abler minds. <lb/></p> 

<p>No one rising to continue the debate, <lb/>
and it now being twenty minutes to <lb/>
twelve (midnight), <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ROSS11">Mr. Ross</persName> arose and said that if no <lb/>
other hon. member desired to join in <lb/>
the debate, he should exercise his right <lb/>
and close the debate. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE MEMBER FOR YORKTON. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">DR. PATRICK</persName> arose, and was receiv<lb break="no"/>ed with applause. He said he had not <lb/>
intended to say anything that night and <lb/>
had hoped that some other hon, mem<lb break="no"/>bers would while away the time till the <lb/>
clock struck the hour of midnight. He <lb/>
 was not prepared with any notes but <lb/>
nevertheless, rather than allow the de<lb break="no"/>bate to collapse, he would endeavor to <lb/>
make a few observations on one or two <lb/>
of the important matters, before the <lb/>
House. He should like, to say with <lb/>
regard to the Estimates that he agreed <lb/>
 to a certain extent with the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Banff in the objection to the <lb/>
lack of detail. On the other hand he <lb/>
understood the position of the hon. <lb/>
Commissioner of Public Works when <lb/>
he pointed thedifficultyof getting ex<lb break="no"/>act information from the members as <lb/>
to the nature and the location of the <lb/>
works required in the various <lb/>
districts; and hethought the explan<lb break="no"/>ation sufficiently satisfactory and rea<lb break="no"/>sonable to allow him to permit himself <lb/>
to assent on the present occasion to the <lb/>
passing of the Estimates in, the form <lb/>
in which they were presented. At the <lb/>
same time he did not think it should <lb/>
 be accepted as a precedent. He thought <lb/>
all the information as to expenditure <lb/>
should be set out in the Estimates. A <lb/>
member should not be, as it were, a <lb/>
mere conduit pipe between the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the people he represented, <lb/>
but should have every opportunity of <lb/>
forming an intelligent opinion and, if <lb/>
necessary, of formulating any criticism <lb/>
on the various subjects which came be<lb break="no"/>fore the House for consideration. <lb/>
He was not willing that the powers <lb/>
vested in him as it representative of <lb/>
the people should be handed over bod<lb break="no"/>ily to the Government to be exercised <lb/>
by order in council. Rather than assent <lb/>
to such a course as that he would pre<lb break="no"/>fer to hand them back to his constitu<lb break="no"/>ents from whom he obtained them. He <lb/>
did not believe much in government by <lb/>
order in council, but when the hon. <lb/>
member for Moose Jaw said he would <lb/>
give details in committee of the <lb/>
inost important works and knowing the <lb/>
hon, gentleman as he did, and never <lb/>
having had any reason to doubt his <lb/>
word, he was willing to accept his <lb/>
statement that a fairly detailed <lb/>
statement would be brought down <lb/>
when the House went into Supply. <lb/>
With regard to the Civil Service <lb/>
he must say that he believed in good <lb/>
men at good salaries. He believed in <lb/>
the employment in every department <lb/>
of the public service of men thoroughly <lb/>
fitted for the work they had to do. In <lb/>
these latter days he thought it neces<lb break="no"/>sary that all public servants who were <lb/>
newly engaged should be stenographers <lb/>
and typewriters, except of course in the <lb/>
case of those who had other qualifica<lb break="no"/>tions, and who would be fitted rather <lb/>
to direct the work of stenographers <lb/>
and typewriters than to perform that <lb/>
class of work themselves. He was very <lb/>
leased to note from the return <lb/>
rought down that the civil service <lb/>
was composed largely of very com<lb break="no"/>petent men who had that thorough <lb/>
technical and clerical qualification <lb/>
which the country had a right to ex<lb break="no"/>pect. Referring to that item of expen<lb break="no"/>diture which was made necessary by <lb/>
the addition of another resident mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Executive Council, he said <lb/>
that in view of the circumstances of <lb/>
the country and the important ques<lb break="no"/>tions waiting to be dealt with, it <lb/>
was a wise move to take in that third <lb/>
member of the Government. He was <lb/>

<cb/>

prepared to express his approval of the <lb/>
action of the Government in that re<lb break="no"/>gard. He thought it was quite in order <lb/>
to refer to the personal qualifications <lb/>
of the new Commissioner. When the <lb/>
Yukon debate was on last year he took <lb/>
occasion to refer in very favorable <lb/>
terms to the manner in which the hon. <lb/>
member for South Qu'Appelle had dis<lb break="no"/>charged his mission; and having that <lb/>
in view he (Dr. Patrick) certainly <lb/>
thought the hon. member had given <lb/>
proofof  his fitness for the new sphere <lb/>
to which he had been called. He <lb/>
would now pass oil to the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional question which so intimately and <lb/>
so seriously concerned the future of <lb/>
the country. He believed in delaying <lb/>
as long as possible the taking on of <lb/>
provincial status. One reason for that, <lb/>
was that whatever might be the con<lb break="no"/>dition of things in the west he did <lb/>
not think the people of the east were <lb/>
sufficiently educated as to the moral <lb/>
rights of this country; and he did not <lb/>
think the representatives in the Do<lb break="no"/>minion House were at present prepared <lb/>
to give the people of the Territories <lb/>
their rights for the simple reason that <lb/>
at this present time, they had a very <lb/>
inadequate appreciation of the true <lb/>
scope and value of those rights. He <lb/>
thought it would take some time for <lb/>
the eastern members to get over the <lb/>
fact that the payment of £300,000 to <lb/>
the Hudson Bay Company did not <lb/>
convey the right to govern this coun<lb break="no"/>try, Let them, if possible, delay the <lb/>
settlement of this question till they <lb/>
had a much larger population which <lb/>
would give them a fairly large repre<lb break="no"/>sentation at Ottawa—a representation <lb/>
large enough to influence the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment at Ottawa and to induce them to <lb/>
take a reasonable view of the position <lb/>
of the Territories. Dr. Patrick went on <lb/>
to point out that there was no precedent <lb/>
in Canada for a territory being erected <lb/>
into a province, and therefore they <lb/>
had to look for precedent to the great <lb/>
country to the south of us where the <lb/>
admission of territories to the dignity <lb/>
of Statehood had been going on for a <lb/>
great number of years. If they looked <lb/>
at their practice they would find that <lb/>
the territory of Dakota was not divid<lb break="no"/>ed into States until it had obtained a <lb/>
population of 485,000. He would point <lb/>
out that it was possible for the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories to enjoy all the <lb/>
powers of a province saye and except <lb/>
that its legislation would continue to <lb/>
be subject to the federal legislation. <lb/>
They might have every one of those <lb/>
powers so long as those powers were <lb/>
subject to the higher federal power. <lb/>
As to many of the powers that cer<lb break="no"/>tain members were clamoring for—the <lb/>
powers to charter railways, to borrow <lb/>
money, to deal with land registration <lb/>
 and so on—those powers might be <lb/>
given and we might still remain Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories; and knowing that this was so <lb/>
he was pleased to find that the propo­ <lb/>
sition made by the Government con<lb break="no"/>templated the obtaining of all those <lb/>
powers while leaving the matter of <lb/>
provincial status to be settled later on <lb/>
in the next few years. He believed in <lb/>
taking over powers in driblets as it <lb/>
were. He thought the experience of <lb/>
the Territories in that line might be <lb/>
taken as a very safe guide in the future. <lb/>
If they took over powers, one by one, <lb/>
until they obtained all the powers of <lb/>
a province saving that their legislation <lb/>
would be subject to Ottawa, they <lb/>
would be in a position of making their <lb/>
own laws while the Parliament at Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa would stand to them some<lb break="no"/>what in the relation of a Senate. They <lb/>
would have the Dominion Government <lb/>
exercising a power over them similar <lb/>
to that which the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment exercised over the Dominion. <lb/>
Probably that power would not often <lb/>
be exercised, but the mere fact that it <lb/>
was there would make the need for its <lb/>
exercise the less. That, then, was the <lb/>
next position that should be assumed <lb/>
by these Territories—that they could <lb/>
have all the enumerated powers of the <lb/>
Provinces save that those powers <lb/>
would be subject to Dominion legisla<lb break="no"/>tion, and still remain Territories. If <lb/>
they could, do that, if they could post<lb break="no"/>pone the final day of settlement until <lb/>
they had sufficient weight in the fede<lb break="no"/>ral councils to enable them to have a <lb/>
reasonable chance of obtaining their <lb/>
 rights—if, he said, they could do this, <lb/>
he thought it would be to their advan<lb break="no"/>tage. On the other hand, if they <lb/>
clamored too early for those rights <lb/>
they would be very apt to find them<lb break="no"/>selves in the position of Manitoba. <lb/>
They would be very apt to tie their <lb/>
hands with a settlement that it would <lb/>
be very difficult to get out of if they <lb/>
left nothing of the public domain on, <lb/>
which, to found a new bargain. The <lb/>
salvation of Manitoba is the other <lb/>
territory that it has and which may <lb/>
enable them to re-open the question of <lb/>
settlement. That was a good reason <lb/>
to his mind for delaying a final settle<lb break="no"/>ment of the claims of the Territories <lb/>
on the Dominion. There was another <lb/>
important consideration. If one made <lb/>
a study of the basis of the subsidies of <lb/>
the Provinces he would come to the <lb/>
conclusion that the basis was unfair. <lb/>
They knew that large debts incurred <lb/>
by the provincial governments were <lb/>
assumed by the Dominion at confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. When they came to determine <lb/>
what the debt capital of Manitoba. <lb/>
should be they were in a difficulty. <lb/>
Manitoba had no debt, and it was <lb/>
necessary that she should be placed on <lb/>
an equality with the other provinces <lb/>
whose public debts had been assumed, <lb/>
but it was very difficult to determine <lb/>
what the basis should be. It would be <lb/>
a very difficult thing for any man, or <lb/>
any set of men, to determine what <lb/>
would be an equitable basis on which <lb/>
to fix the debt capital of the Territories. <lb/>
He would rather see it delayed in the <lb/>
hope that the whole question would be <lb/>
re-opened by the provinces, and that it <lb/>
might then be settled on an equitable <lb/>
basis of so much per head of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation. It seemedto him that if the <lb/>
Dominion of Canada could assume pro<lb break="no"/>vincial debts amounting to some 70 <lb/>
millions or thereabouts—if it could as<lb break="no"/>sume those debts incurred for local pur<lb break="no"/>poses—he was quite sure that it would <lb/>
be to the advantage of the Dominion <lb/>
to advance such sums for the public <lb/>
services of the Territories as would <lb/>
do away with any need for the <lb/>
Territories, going into the money <lb/>
markets of the world, and getting <lb/>
into debt. The Territories might, <lb/>
have the power to contract a debt, <lb/>
the same as the provinces, but if it had <lb/>
the power and used it, then when they <lb/>
became a province the Dominion <lb/>
would have to assume the debt in the <lb/>
same way it had done with other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. They heard of the sum of <lb/>
$3,800,000 incurred on capital account <lb/>
by the Dominion in respect of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. He thought it was about <lb/>
time they should know what this had <lb/>
been expended for; what had been ex<lb break="no"/>pended for local purposes; what <lb/>
amount was fairly chargeable to us as <lb/>
Territories, and what amount would be <lb/>
fairly chargeable to us as a province. <lb/>
Then again before we assumed pro<lb break="no"/>vincial status there should be an ab<lb break="no"/>solute and accurate determination of <lb/>

our boundaries. This was necessary <lb/>
for various reasons <lb/></p> 

<p>On school districts and local improve<lb break="no"/>ment districts were loaning money <lb/>
through the exemption of land from <lb/>
taxation. This was through no fault <lb/>
of ours and the people of Canada. We should <lb/>
have compensation. We should be in <lb/>
a position to claim from the people of <lb/>
Canada money compensation for the <lb/>
loss we sustain because because of these ex<lb break="no"/>emptions; and before we were in a <lb/>
position to make this claim for com<lb break="no"/>pensation we ought to know exactly <lb/>
what our boundaries were. This, there<lb break="no"/>fore, was another step to be taken in <lb/>
the matter. <lb/></p> 

<p>But that raised yet another question; <lb/>
viz., whether their boundaries should <lb/>
really extend to the Arctic circle. He <lb/>
very much doubted the wisdom of <lb/>
that. They were asking a good deal <lb/>
from the Doininion Government when <lb/>
they asked as much as that. He <lb/>
thought they were asking for some<lb break="no"/>thing they were not likely to get. He <lb/>
did not think any government in Can<lb break="no"/>ada would ever grant it. It was a <lb/>
question whether it would be of any <lb/>
utility if we did get it. He questioned <lb/>
if that very far northern country <lb/>
would ever become inhabited; but if it <lb/>
did and the inhabitants should desire <lb/>
to be added to the new province there <lb/>
was machinery in the British North <lb/>
America Act by which that addition <lb/>
could be made, but he did not believe <lb/>
that the northern boundary of the new <lb/>
province should extend to the North <lb/>
Pole. He thought they should take <lb/>
the 60th parallel of latitude for the <lb/>
northern boundary. That was the <lb/>
northern boundary of British Columbia. <lb/>
The new province would therefore be <lb/>
bounded by the 60th parallel on the <lb/>
north, by Manitoba on the east and <lb/>
British Columbia on the west. This <lb/>
province, south of the 60th parallel, <lb/>
would contain an area somewhere in <lb/>
in the neighbourhood of 520, 000 square <lb/>
miles, or an area half as great as that <lb/>
of all the other provinces put together. <lb/>
Would we not be asking the Dominion <lb/>
 a great deal—would we not be asking <lb/>
 them to much—when we asked to be <lb/>
made into a province half as large as <lb/>
the rest of the Dominion? He was <lb/>
sure they did not wish to ask for any<lb break="no"/>thing unreasonable. This matter must <lb/>
be dealt with not only from a Terri<lb break="no"/>torial but from a Canadian point of <lb/>
view. How would it strike the other <lb/>
 provinces?—how would it strike for <lb/>
instance the province of Ontario to <lb/>
have a province more that twice as <lb/>
large itself? There was danger to <lb/>
 his mind in confederation—a danger <lb/>
that strong provinces or states might <lb/>
be a menace to confederation itself. <lb/>
He thought the strength of a confeder<lb break="no"/>ation was in the weakness of its units. <lb/>
He thought the strength of its units <lb/>
was the weakness of confederation. <lb/>
He remembered when the United <lb/>
States constitution was subject to con<lb break="no"/>siderable strain by reason of sectional <lb/>
feeling of the east against the west. <lb/>
It was more difficult to give effect to <lb/>
that feeling when the States were <lb/>
relatively small than when they were <lb/>
relatively large. Now he should be <lb/>
sorry to be understood as giving ex<lb break="no"/>pression to the idea that we needed to <lb/>
increase the number of local govern<lb break="no"/>ments in this country. One local gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would serve our need for <lb/>
years to come yet. It would be ridi<lb break="no"/>culous to give 100, 000 or 200, 000 people <lb/>
a double set of legislative machinery. <lb/>
But when we asked the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to vest us with more powers, <lb/>
we should ask ourselves the question <lb/>
"What is to be our ultimate status?" <lb/>
"If" continued Dr. Patrick, "we <lb/>
 should decide o an ultimate division into two provinces—and my own <lb/>
opinion is that an ultimate divi<lb break="no"/>sion into two provinces is a desirable <lb/>
thing- if we should decide on two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, then there is no reason why we <lb/>
should not have the two provinces de<lb break="no"/>fined as two Territories and united to<lb break="no"/>gether for the purpose of government <lb/>
under one government." We had, he <lb/>
said, had the name of the North-West <lb/>
Territories of Canada now for some <lb/>
twenty-five years. If we were to be <lb/>
one province let us be established now <lb/>
as one Territory, with one name. If <lb/>
we were to have two provinces then <lb/>
let there be two Territories with dis<lb break="no"/>tinctive names but one government. <lb/>
He might remind them that Upper and <lb/>
Lower Canada from 1841 to 1867 were <lb/>
united. There were obstacles to the <lb/>
union of those provinces which did not <lb/>
exist in this country. There were <lb/>
differences of race and creed that pre<lb break="no"/>vented for some years a harmonious <lb/>
union, but if they could get along for <lb/>
twenty-six or twenty-seven years, sure<lb break="no"/>ly we in the west can get along <lb/>
for fifteen or twenty years. But he <lb/>
thought they ought not only look ahead <lb/>
for 15 or 20 years, they should look <lb/>
farther than that. This country was <lb/>
capable of supporting a population of <lb/>
millions. Its territory was larger <lb/>
than Norway, Sweden and Finland, and <lb/>
surely it was capable of supporting a <lb/>
larger population than those countries. <lb/>
Not only was our country larger, but <lb/>
our climate was not so inhospitable, <lb/>
the country was not so mountainous, <lb/>
there was room for a much larger agri<lb break="no"/>cultural population; and the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of Norway, Sweden and Finaland <lb/>
was about seven millions. They must <lb/>
look forward to the time when these <lb/>
Territories would have been five millions, or <lb/>
even ten millions of people occupying <lb/>
it. The question arose, What would be <lb/>
the state of things then? That was the <lb/>
point of view from which this matter <lb/>
must be looked at by the Government <lb/>
and the Parliament and the people of <lb/>
Canada; and it was our duty to look <lb/>
at it as Canadians as well as residents <lb/>
of the Territories. He did not believe <lb/>
that at the present time, nor for years <lb/>
yet, nor for many years yet, not until <lb/>
the population reached 500,000 or even <lb/>
 more, that we should ask to be separ<lb break="no"/>ated. For years at least the govern<lb break="no"/>ment should be vested in one legisla<lb break="no"/>ture—as long perhaps as Lower and <lb/>
Upper Canada stayed together, we <lb/>
might remain as a united province. <lb/></p> 

<p>Another reason that made him take <lb/>
this view of the question was that he <lb/>
believed when provincial status is es<lb break="no"/>tablished the question of a portion of <lb/>
the Territories being hitched on to a <lb/>
neighbouring provinces would arise. He <lb/>
thought that if we tried to have one <lb/>
very large province established under <lb/>
one government it would excite suffi<lb break="no"/>cient jealousy to make the people of <lb/>
the province of Manitoba ask for an <lb/>
extension of their boundaries. If it <lb/>
were clear to him that our boundaries <lb/>
would not be interfered with; if he <lb/>
were assured that no interference <lb/>
would be attempted with a view to <lb/>
hitch any section of the eastern portion <lb/>
 of the Territories on to Manitoba—he <lb/>
quite admitted that then from the local <lb/>
point of view a large area under one <lb/>
government would be best. If a <lb/>
large area could be established as one <lb/>
province, and it could be left to <lb/>
the people themselves when the popu<lb break="no"/>lation grew large enough to seek for <lb/>
 division—for the province to seek div<lb break="no"/>ision of itself—that would put a deiffer<lb break="no"/>ent aspect on the matter; but what he <lb/>
feared was that if we sought to have <lb/>
too large a territory established as one <lb/>
province, it would lead to a division of <lb/>
the whole which would be anything <lb/>
but satisfactory to the inhabitants of <lb/>
the eastern portion of the Territories. <lb/>
For that and for many other reasons <lb/>
he was inclined to hold that we should <lb/>
look at this question fairly, and ask <lb/>

<cb/>

ourselves whether, 200,000 square miles <lb/>
which would be the area of each pro<lb break="no"/>vince if we were divided, was too small <lb/>
an area for a province in the years to <lb/>
come. He would like to repeat that he <lb/>
was no advocate for any unneccessary <lb/>
machinery of local government or any <lb/>
other government machinery, but he <lb/>
thought they should look at this ques<lb break="no"/>tion not from the point of view of the <lb/>
present, or of the immediate future, or <lb/>
of the comparatively near future, but <lb/>
from the point of view of the far <lb/>
distant future. (Applause) <lb/></p> 

<p>The motion to go into supply was <lb/>
then agreed to. Mr. Speaker left the <lb/>
chair. The House resolved into com<lb break="no"/>mittee. <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> moved that the <lb/>
committee rise and report progress <lb/>
and ask leave to sit again; and the <lb/>
House adjourned at midnight. <lb/></p> <lb/>
