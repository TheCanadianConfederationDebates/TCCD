<head rendition="simple:centre">N.W.T. ASSEMBLY OPENED.</head> 

<head rendition="simple:centre">Second Session of Fifth Legislature <lb/>
Has Begun Its Labors.</head> 

<p>At three o'clock this afternoon His <lb/>
Honor <persName ref="pers:FORG1">Lieutenant Governor Forget</persName> <lb/>
formally opened the second session of <lb/>
the fifth Legislative Assembly of the <lb/>
North-West Territories. He was es<lb break="no"/>corted from Government House to the <lb/>
Assembly chamber by a detachment of <lb/>
15 or 20 men of the N.W.M.P. under <lb/>
command of Insp. Heffernan. Sergt. <lb/>
Major Church was second in command. <lb/>
Lt.-Col. Macdonell, D.S.O., acted in <lb/>
the capacity of A.D.C.. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Speech with which His Honor <lb/>
opened the Assembly was as follows:— <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MR. SPEAKER AND GENTLEMEN OF <lb/>
THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY:—</p> 

<p>I have much pleasure in welcoming <lb/>
you on the occasion of the opening of <lb/>
the Second Session of the fifth Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Assembly of the Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p>Although, owing to adverse climatic <lb/>
conditions at the critical time of har<lb break="no"/>vest, the expectations formed at the <lb/>
beginning of the season have not all <lb/>
been realised, I can still congratulate <lb/>
you on the continued growth and pros<lb break="no"/>perity of the country. <lb/></p> 

<p>It being the opinion of my Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that the public business will be <lb/>
greatly facilitated by a change in the <lb/>
time of the meeting of the Legislative <lb/>
Assembly, I have called you together <lb/>
again at this early date in order to <lb/>
enable your ordinary Sessions to be <lb/>
held hereafter in the autumn instead <lb/>
of, as hitherto, in the early part of the <lb/>
year. <lb/></p> 

<p>By legislation passed at the late <lb/>
Session of the Dominion Parliament, <lb/>
your legislative jurisdiction has been <lb/>
extended so as to enable you to deal <lb/>
with the qualification of Members of <lb/>
the Legislative Assembly, and a Bill <lb/>
dealing with that subject will be pre<lb break="no"/>sented for your consideration. <lb/></p> 

<p>Your power to legislate with regard <lb/>
to certain matters affecting the admin<lb break="no"/>instration of justice has also been in <lb/>
creased, in consequence of which you <lb/>
will be required to make some provision <lb/>
for the establishment of Judicial Dis<lb break="no"/>tricts and the appointment of Police <lb/>
Magistrates. Bills concerning these <lb/>
subjects will be presented to you. <lb/></p> 

<p>The rapid increase of population in <lb/>
the Territories, and the wide area over <lb/>
which that population is scattered, <lb/>
have led my Government to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that a gradual decentralisation <lb/>
of the work at present performed by <lb/>
the central Government has become <lb/>
necessary. This important matter has <lb/>
been the subject of careful considera<lb break="no"/>tion by my Government during the <lb/>
recess, and your co-operation and <lb/>
assistance will be asked with a view to <lb/>
the establishment of a simple, efficient <lb/>
and economical system of rural organi<lb break="no"/>sation. <lb/></p> 

<p>Measures for the creation of a Uni<lb break="no"/>versity; dealing with the powers and <lb/>
liabilities of Trustees; and the levying <lb/>
of Succession Duties will be be submit<lb break="no"/>ted to you; as will a consolidation of <lb/>
the law relating to game; and Bills <lb/>
amending the Municipal, School and <lb/>
Fence Ordinances. <lb/></p> 

<p>Estimates for the coming year have <lb/>
been prepared, having regard for the <lb/>
conditions of the Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">GENTLEMEN OF THE LEGISLATIVE <lb/>
ASSEMBLY:—</p> 

<p>I leave you all these and such other <lb/>
matters as may be brought before you, <lb/>
in full confidence that your earnest <lb/>
endeavours and consideration will be <lb/>
given to them, and in the belief that <lb/>
your labors will be Divinely guided to <lb/>
a successful and satisfactory issue.  <lb/></p>
