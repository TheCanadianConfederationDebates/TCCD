<p>The correspondence on the subject of <lb/>
granting the provincial status to the <lb/>
Territories which was laid on the table <lb/>
in the Legislature a couple of weeks <lb/>
ago is concluded with the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing letters between Sir Wilfrid <lb/>
Laurier and Premier Haultain: <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:right">OTTAWA, June 8th, 1903.</p> 

<p>Hon. F. W. G. Haultain, Regina. <lb/></p> 

<p>Sir, —I have the honour to acknow<lb break="no"/>ledge the receipt of your letter of the <lb/>
2nd instant. The Minister of Finance <lb/>
has, by this time, communicated with <lb/>
you respecting the financial grant to be <lb/>
given to the North-West Legislature. <lb/></p> 

<p>With regard to your further request <lb/>
that legislation be introduced this <lb/>
session conferring on the Territories <lb/>
full provincial organisation, I have had <lb/>
the honour to discuss the matter with <lb/>
the members of the House of Commons <lb/>
from the Territories. I have asked <lb/>
them to consider whether it would be <lb/>
advisable to have such legislation <lb/>
introduced this year. We are, as you <lb/>
know, introducing a redistribution <lb/>
measure at the present session, and we <lb/>
are giving to the Territories a much <lb/>
larger representation in the House of <lb/>
Commons than they would be entitled to <lb/>
were they to become organised at once <lb/>
as a province. In fact the Bill which we <lb/>
have introduced allows to the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies a representation in the House of <lb/>
Commons of ten members. Were they <lb/>
to be admitted at once as a province, <lb/>
they would be entitled to only six <lb/>
members. It would be a question of <lb/>
extreme difficulty, and complications <lb/>
to give to the Territories at the same <lb/>
time all the advantages of full provin<lb break="no"/>cial organisation, without the corres<lb break="no"/>ponding disadvantages. I have the <lb/>
honour to be, Sir, <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">Yours truly,</p> 

<p rendition="simple:right"><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">WILFRLD LAURIER</persName>.</p> 

<p rendition="simple:right">REGINA, June 15, 1903.</p> 

<p>The Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, <lb/>
G.C.M.G., President Privy Council, <lb/>
Ottawa. <lb/></p> 

<p>Sir, —I have the honour to acknow<lb break="no"/>ledge receipt of your letter of the <lb/>
eighth instant, relating to the question <lb/>
of Provincial institutions in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, and to express regret on the <lb/>
part of the North-West Government <lb/>
that that question has again been put <lb/>
on one side for a reason which seems <lb/>
quite foreign to the subject. <lb/></p> 

<p>With all deference to the opinion <lb/>
expressed by you, I cannot see that <lb/>
the representation proposed to be <lb/>
given to the Territories under the <lb/>
Redistribution Bill could be in any <lb/>
way affected by the passing of concur<lb break="no"/>rent legislation granting the Provincial <lb/>
status to the Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p>The provisions of the B.N.A. Act <lb/>
relating to the representation would <lb/>
not, I submit, apply to a Province <lb/>
which, at the earliest, could only come <lb/>
into existence at the same time as the <lb/>
Redistribution Bill became law. Even <lb/>
if legislation creating a Province were <lb/>
introduced at the present session of <lb/>
Parliament, the actual coming into <lb/>
existence of the Province would neces<lb break="no"/>sarily be postponed for some months <lb/>
to enable Territorial affairs to be wound <lb/>
up, and thus any question with regard <lb/>
to representation and the effect of the <lb/>
B.N.A. Act would be removed. I <lb/>
might also remind you that upon the <lb/>
admission of British Columbia into the <lb/>
Confederation and upon the creation of <lb/>
the Province of Manitoba larger repre<lb break="no"/>sentation was given than these two <lb/>
Provinces were respectively entitled to <lb/>
under the B.N.A. Act. <lb/></p> 

<p>You say that you have discussed the <lb/>
question of Provincial organisation <lb/>
with the Members of the House of <lb/>
Commons from the Territories and <lb/>
have asked them to consider whether <lb/>
it would be advisable to have such <lb/>
legislation introduced this year. Your <lb/>
letter does not make it clear what the <lb/>
opinion of these gentlemen is, but I <lb/>
feel justified in asserting that that <lb/>
opinion was not in accord with the <lb/>
wishes of the people they represent <lb/>
unless it supported the claims made by <lb/>
us which are unanimously endorsed by <lb/>
the North-West Legislature, and were <lb/>
practically unanimously endorsed by <lb/>
the people of the North-West Territor<lb break="no"/>ies at the general elections in May, 1902. <lb/>
The question of larger representation <lb/>
in the Federal Parliament is without <lb/>
doubt an important one, but the <lb/>
infinitely more urgent question of <lb/>
Provincial organisation should not be <lb/>
subordinated to it. The two questions <lb/>
are quite separate and independent, <lb/>
and cannot, I think I have shown, <lb/>
affect one another. Under any circum<lb break="no"/>stances, however, the obtaining of Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial powers is in our opinion of much <lb/>
greater importance to the people of the <lb/>
Territories than additional representa<lb break="no"/>tion in a Parliament whose failure to <lb/>
fulfil the duties and obligations it has <lb/>
assumed with regard to the North-<lb break="yes"/>West is one of our strongest reasons <lb/>
for demanding home rule. I have the <lb/>
honour to be, Sir, <lb/></p>
