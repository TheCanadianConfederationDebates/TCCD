Regret at the Action of the Federal <lb/>

<p rendition="simple:right">THURSDAY, April 3.</p> 

<p>The legislature re-assembled to-day <lb/>
after the Easter recess. The Speaker <lb/>
took the chair at 2.30 p.m. Mr. Vil<lb break="no"/>leneuve (St Albert) asked: (1) Has the <lb/>
Government since the last session of <lb/>
this Assembly considered the question <lb/>
of extending the boundaries of License <lb/>
District No. 8 so as to comprise Atha<lb break="no"/>basca Landing in St. Albert Electoral <lb/>
District? (2) If so, what action does <lb/>
the Governinent intend to take in <lb/>
reference to this question? <lb/></p> 

<p>In reply Mr. Haultain said: (1) Yes. <lb/>
(2) The matter is still under considera<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> (Yorkton) moved for a <lb/>
return showing (1) Copies of all corres<lb break="no"/>pondence between the Department of <lb/>
Public Works and Frederick J. Bull of <lb/>
Yorkton relative to the amount of <lb/>
compensation to be paid by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment for a right of way surveyed <lb/>
through section 7, township 26, range <lb/>
3 west of the second meridian. (2) <lb/>
Copies of all correspondence between <lb/>
the said Department, and any and all <lb/>
other persons relative to  the amount <lb/>
of the said compensation.  Dr. Patrick <lb/>
said he thought this correspondence <lb/>
would show that before the Ordinance <lb/>
was passed last session a definite pro<lb break="no"/>mise was made to Mr. Bull that his <lb/>
case would be taken to the courts to <lb/>
determine what amount should be paid <lb/>
him. Since then an arbitary amount <lb/>
had been fixed by the commissioner <lb/>
and offered him, and was refused. <lb/>
While the Ordinance has been passed <lb/>
giving the commissioner power to fix <lb/>
the compensation it would be, said Dr. <lb/>
Patrick, a difficult, thing to say that <lb/>
such coupensation shall be accepted. <lb/>
The motion was agreed to. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> also moved for copies of <lb/>
all correspondence between Jas. H. <lb/>
Nelson of Yorkton, and any and all <lb/>
other persons and the Department of <lb/>
Public Works relative to the amount <lb/>
of compensation to be paid to the said <lb/>
Nelson for a right of way surveyed <lb/>
through his lands adjacent to the right <lb/>
of way of the Manitoba and North­<lb break="yes"/>Western Railway and within the limits <lb/>
of the municipality of the town of <lb/>
Yorkton. His reason for asking for <lb/>
this return was that the House might <lb/>
get an idea of the opinions of some of <lb/>
the men whose property was affected. <lb/>
Mr. Sifton agreed to the motion saying <lb/>
he had no fear of the opinions of the <lb/>
members of the House when the papers <lb/>
were brought down. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> further moved for (1) <lb/>
Copies of all correspondence between <lb/>
Sam. Goodacre, secretary-treasurer <lb/>
of the Pebble Lake School District No. <lb/>
316, and the Secretary of the Council <lb/>
of Public Instruction and the Deputy <lb/>
Commissioner of Education relative to <lb/>
the omission from the area of the <lb/>
said District of section 36, township 25, <lb/>
range 4 west of the second meridian, <lb/>
and (2) relative to an alteration of the <lb/>
boundaries of the said District to in<lb break="no"/>clude the said section therein, and (3) <lb/>
relative to the claim made by the said <lb/>
District by reason of omission of the <lb/>
said section from the area thereof. Dr. <lb/>
Patrick said that this school district <lb/>
was organised about 1894, and the <lb/>
usual steps were taken by the people <lb/>
of the locality, a petition being sent in <lb/>
which was approved by the Council of <lb/>
Public Instruction, and subsequently by <lb/>
a meeting of ratepayers. A proclama<lb break="no"/>tion was inserted in the Gazette but <lb/>
through an error one section was omit<lb break="no"/>ted. This error was not discovered for <lb/>
some years until the people were as<lb break="no"/>sessed, the lands were sold and pur<lb break="no"/>chased by a man who thought every<lb break="no"/>thing was all right. The result was he <lb/>
lost his money paid in connection with <lb/>
this matter and the school district <lb/>
found itself under the necessity of re<lb break="no"/>funding the money that had been paid. <lb/>

<cb/>

The ratepayers felt that the people of <lb/>
the Territories as a whole should pay <lb/>
for the mistakes made by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. They, therefore, made applica<lb break="no"/>tion for a special grant nearly a year <lb/>
ago, but the matter had apparently <lb/>
not been dealt with up to a recent date. <lb/>
He did not know whether the corres<lb break="no"/>pondence would show negligence on <lb/>
the part of the Commissioner of Edu<lb break="no"/>tion or inability to make up his mind <lb/>
to grant it.   <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> in reply said that this <lb/>
motion was, he presumed, one of those <lb/>
whose main object was to allow the <lb/>
mover to indulge in certain specula<lb break="no"/>tions which were not warranted and <lb/>
make a speech. A mistake was made <lb/>
in the office and the Gazette carried it <lb/>
on and one section out of a large num<lb break="no"/>ber was omitted. The trustees had <lb/>
acted on a letter from the office and <lb/>
not on the Gazette. They sold the <lb/>
land for taxes and the school district <lb/>
did suffer a certain amount of damage <lb/>
through the mistake of the depart<lb break="no"/>ment. A claim was made for a special <lb/>
grant and the reason it had not been <lb/>
made was because they could not <lb/>
arrive at a satisfactory amount. The <lb/>
school district claimed compensation <lb/>
for the taxes they might have levied <lb/>
and other items which could never be <lb/>
reasonably considered. The whole <lb/>
case was how much is the school dis<lb break="no"/>trict entitled to, which was not a very <lb/>
serious matter. There was one reason <lb/>
why he was willing to allow the notion <lb/>
to pass and that was to show how in<lb break="no"/>accurate the hon. gentleman's state<lb break="no"/>ments were. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BROW6">Mr. G. W. Brown</persName> (North Regina) in<lb break="no"/>troduced a Bill to amend Chapter 54 of <lb/>

Chemists and Druggists." The Bill <lb/>
was read a first time and put down <lb/>
for its second reading on Monday. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> moved that the House <lb/>
adjourn, whereupon Dr. Patrick asked <lb/>
when the public accounts would be <lb/>
brought down. In reply Mr. Sifton <lb/>
said they expected to have them ready <lb/>
on Monday. Mr. Sifton then laid the <lb/>
report of the Public Works Depart<lb break="no"/>ment for 1901 on the table and Mr. <lb/>
Haultain the report of the Attorney­ <lb/>
General's department as required by <lb/>
the Liquor License Ordinance. The <lb/>
House then adjourned. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">LIQUOR LICENSE REPORT.</p> 

<p>The liquor license report showed that <lb/>
121 applications had been received for <lb/>
hotel licenses: of this number 107 were <lb/>
granted, 7 refused and 7 withdrawn. <lb/>
Applications for wholesale licenses <lb/>
numbered 39, of which 35 were granted, <lb/>
1 refused and 3 withdrawn. Two <lb/>
wholesale and 28 hotel licenses were <lb/>
transferred. During the year 29 per<lb break="no"/>sons were interdicted by magistrates <lb/>
and 44 by license inspectors, a total of <lb/>
73. The total amount of fines inflicted <lb/>
and collected for offences under the <lb/>

<p>Premier Haultain laid on the table <lb/>
of the House the correspondence <lb/>
with the Dominion  Government on the <lb/>
question of provincial autonomy, and <lb/>
gave notice that on Monday he would <lb/>
move the following resolution: <lb/>
"Whereas, the larger powers and <lb/>
income incidental to provincial status <lb/>
are urgently and imperatively required <lb/>
to aid the development of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies and to meet the pressing necessities <lb/>
of a large and rapidly increasingpopu-  <lb/>
lation, be it resolved that this House <lb/>
regrets that the Federal Government <lb/>
has decided not to introduce legislation <lb/>
at the present session of parliament <lb/>
with a view to  granting provincial <lb/>
institutions to the Territories." Cheers. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon, G. H. V. Bulyea laid on the <lb/>
table the report of the Territorial <lb/>
Secretary and the House adjourned. <lb/></p> 

<p>AUTONOMY CORRESPONDENCE, <lb/></p> 

<p>The correspondence with the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion Governmont over the question of <lb/>
provincial autonomy which was laid <lb/>
on the table of time Assembly to-day <lb/>
by Premier Haultain is quite volumi<lb break="no"/>nous. Summarised it is as follows: <lb/></p> 

<p>The "Case for the Territories," pre<lb break="no"/>sented by the North-West Government <lb/>
to Sir Wilfrid Laurier bears date of <lb/>
Dec. 7, 1901. It points out not only <lb/>
that the population of the Territories <lb/>
is rapidly increasing by the efforts of <lb/>
the immigration branch of the depart<lb break="no"/>ment of the interior. but that the new <lb/>
settlers seem desirous to become <lb/>
pioneers in districts far removed from <lb/>
settlement. The new settlements, <lb/>
therefore, are too small and too widely <lb/>
scattered to bear the burdens which <lb/>
necessarily go with the opening up of <lb/>
a new country. The fact cannot be <lb/>
disguised that they must be assisted to <lb/>
do so if the people are to be contended <lb/>
and prosperous, Bridges. ferries and <lb/>
adequate water, supply and schools <lb/>
must be provided, roads surveyed and <lb/>
made, and difficulties overcome. That <lb/>
the cost of these should be raised by <lb/>
taxation is shown to be undesitable; <lb/>
first, because it would militate against <lb/>
the work of the Dominion government <lb/>
in inducing immigration, and secondly, <lb/>
to require the people of the Territories <lb/>
to carry on the work of opening up <lb/>
and developing the country would not <lb/>
be to treat the early settlers in the <lb/>
North-West Territories in the manner <lb/>
in which the people of the older pro<lb break="no"/>vinces have been treated. <lb/></p> 

<p>OBJECT TO TAXATION.  <lb/></p> 

<p>The document lays great stress upon <lb/>
the fact that the public debts of the <lb/>
provinces were for the development of <lb/>
the sources of the country, and to <lb/>
attract immigration. The cost of those <lb/>
debts is borne by the North West <lb/>
along with the rest of Canada. All the <lb/>
public revenue of the Territories goes <lb/>
to swell the consolidated fund: the <lb/>
public domain is employed for purely <lb/>
federal purposes, and the Territories <lb/>
are not permitted to draw upon the <lb/>
future. The grants made to the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories have never been considered from <lb/>
the point of view of their requirements. <lb/>
Last January $600,000 were asked for <lb/>
and parliament met, the request by ap<lb break="no"/>propriating 979 to meet the case, <lb/>
Another objection to introducing a <lb/>
a heavy rate of taxation to meet ex<lb break="no"/>penditure on public improvements is <lb/>
that a considerable portion of such ex<lb break="no"/>penditures ought properly to be charge<lb break="no"/>able to capital account. As the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, not being empowered to borrow, <lb/>
have no capital account, this would be <lb/>
equivalent to making the present set<lb break="no"/>tlers pay for the advantages to be reap<lb break="no"/>ed by future generations. It is then <lb/>
shown that in order to perform the <lb/>

<cb/>

public duties of the Territories during <lb/>
the first half of 1902, $465,000 are re<lb break="no"/>quired, and it is likely that the grant <lb/>
made will be $250,000 less than that <lb/>
sum. Parliament is the only source <lb/>
that can appealed to to find this deficit <lb/>
and the neglect to furnish prompt relief <lb/>
can only have the effect of neutralising <lb/>
the efforts of the Dominion to people <lb/>
the Territories. The North-West <lb/>
Government does not seek for any ad<lb break="no"/>vantages over any other province and <lb/>
does not anticipate it will be denied <lb/>
any privilege given elsewhere. <lb/></p> 

<p>A MODEL BILL. <lb/></p> 

<p>Premier Haultain then presented a <lb/>
draft of a model bill to meet the case, <lb/>
the main features of which have already <lb/>
been outlined by the premier on more <lb/>
than one occasion. The draft bill <lb/>
provides for one province, consisting <lb/>
of the present territories of Alberta, <lb/>
Saskatchewan, Assiniboia and a part <lb/>
of Athabasca. A foot-note to this <lb/>
proposal admits that it may be claimed <lb/>
that the area proposed is too large for <lb/>
one province, but goes on to point out <lb/>
that it is practically the same as now <lb/>
administèred by the Territories with<lb break="no"/>out difficulty. Furthermore. the cost <lb/>
of government at the present is only 10 <lb/>
per cent. of the annual expenditure, <lb/>
which is much less than in the older <lb/>
provinces, and indicates that the pre<lb break="no"/>sent machinery can he extended far <lb/>
cheaper than new machinery can be <lb/>
created. The location of the capital it <lb/>
was proposed to leave to the executive <lb/>
of the government. <lb/></p> 

<p>Clause 17 provides that all Hudson's <lb/>
Bay rights relinquished to the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion shall be transferred to the new <lb/>
province. This is explained as relating <lb/>
chiefly to the right at present denied <lb/>
by the company to the Territories, but <lb/>
granted to Canada, of taking land for <lb/>
roads through reserves without com<lb break="no"/>pensation. <lb/></p> 

<p>Clause 18 vests all the public lands in <lb/>
the new province. <lb/></p> 

<p>Clause No. 19 gives it the mines, <lb/>
minerals, timber and royalties belong<lb break="no"/>ing to the crown. Those sections, says <lb/>
the foot note, provide,so far as circum<lb break="no"/>stances appear to admit for an arrange<lb break="no"/>ment analagous to that which obtains <lb/>
in the several provinces originally <lb/>
forming the confederation.  It is claim<lb break="no"/>ed further, that the Dominion possesses <lb/>
no proprietory rights to the lands <lb/>
surrendered to the crown by the Hud<lb break="no"/>son's Bay company. <lb/></p> 

<p>Another argumeut adduced is that <lb/>
the increase of population imposed the <lb/>
necessity for increase of expenditure, <lb/>
and the use of lands by the Dominion <lb/>
solely to encourage settlement, places <lb/>
an undue burden on the province. The <lb/>
burden, it is claimed, should fall where <lb/>
the benefits go. <lb/></p> 

<p>A subsidy of $50,000 for the support <lb/>
of the government, and 80 cents per <lb/>
head on an estimated population of <lb/>
250,000 is asked for at the outset. with <lb/>
an increase at the same rate till paid <lb/>
on a population of 1.396,091, which is <lb/>
the number Ontario is paid. <lb/></p> 

<p>Clause 24 provides that five per cent, <lb/>
interest shall lie paid on the sum of <lb/>
one dollar per acre of all land  'used for <lb/>
Federal purposes. This includes grants <lb/>
totaling to 39,459,722 acres. most of <lb/>
which are for railway lines either out<lb break="no"/>side or only partially within the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. They have, says the foot-note, <lb/>
been built for the general welfare of <lb/>
Canada, but cash subsidies, reaching <lb/>
$166,009,203. have been given to aid <lb/>
these and other lines, the burden of <lb/>
which, unlike land grants, falls on the <lb/>
Territorial people equally with the rest <lb/>
of the Dominion. Hence it is conceived <lb/>
to be wrong to make the Territories <lb/>
bear the burden of land grants and <lb/>
also their share of money grants. <lb/></p> 

<p>In addition, exclusive power with <lb/>
reference to irrigation is asked for, <lb/>
together with an absolute title to all <lb/>
water. <lb/></p> 

<p>Four senators are asked for until the <lb/>
population reaches 250,000, to be then <lb/>
increased to five, and one extra for <lb/>
each additional 50,000. Ten members <lb/>
of the House of Commons are suggest<lb break="no"/>ed, with an increase in the number, <lb/>
according to the terms of the British <lb/>
North America Act. <lb/></p> 

<p>In addition to matters dealt with in <lb/>
the draft bill, Mr. Haultain asks for the <lb/>
removal of the veto to tax the C. P. R. <lb/>
A copy of the memorial passed by the <lb/>
Assembly in 1910 is also attached. <lb/></p> 

<p>The answer of the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to these representations is con<lb break="no"/>veyed in the following letter from the <lb/>
Minister of the Interior: <lb/></p> 

<p>AUTONOMY REFUSED       <lb/></p> 

<p>OTTAWA,27th March, 1902. <lb/></p> 

<p>Dear Mr. Haultain: <lb/></p> 

<p>Absence from Ottawa due to ill health <lb/>
has prevented me from communicat<lb break="no"/>ing with you on the subjects discussed <lb/>
by you and your Colleague when here <lb/>
respecting the financial and constitu<lb break="no"/>tional status of the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. I presume, however, that you <lb/>
would have gathered our views from the <lb/>
expressions of opinion which took place <lb/>
during our interviews. and our conclu<lb break="no"/>sions will not, therefore, I trust come <lb/>
in the way of a surprise. <lb/></p> 

<p>It is the view of the Governument <lb/>
that it will not be wise at the present <lb/>
time to pass legislation forming the <lb/>
North-West territories into a Province <lb/>
or Provinces. Some of the reasons <lb/>
leading to this view may be found in <lb/>
the fact, that the population of the <lb/>
Territories is yet sparse: that <lb/>
the rapid increase in population <lb/>
now taking place will in a short <lb/>
time alter the conditions to be <lb/>
dealt with very materially: and that  <lb/>
there is a considerable divergence of <lb/>
opinion respecting the question wheth<lb break="no"/>er there should be one province only <lb/>
or more than one province... Holding <lb/>
this view therefore, it will not be <lb/>
necessary for me to discuss the details <lb/>
of the draft bill which you presented <lb/>
as embodying your views. <lb/></p> 

<p>Respecting the present financial re<lb break="no"/>quirements, the question of an increase <lb/>
in your subsidy is now receiving con<lb break="no"/>sideration, but the result cannot. as <lb/>
you are aware, be communicated until <lb/>
the Estimates are brought before Par<lb break="no"/>liament. This I have every reason to <lb/>
hope will take place in a very short <lb/>
time. <lb/></p> 

<p>CLIFFORD SIFTON    <lb/></p> 

<p>MR. HAULTAIN'S REPLY. <lb/></p> 

<p>REGINA. April 2, 1902 <lb/></p> 

<p>Dear Mr. Sifton, <lb/></p> 

<p>I beg to acknowledge the receipt of <lb/>
your letter of the 27th of March, con<lb break="no"/>veying the decision of the Government <lb/>
with regard to the financial and consti<lb break="no"/>tutional questions which have been the <lb/>
subject of diseussion during the past <lb/>
year, and a half. So far from your <lb/>
conclusions not coining as a surprise <lb/>
as you sugges. I must say quite frank<lb break="no"/>ly that the decision of the Governument <lb/>
has come not ouly as a surprise, but as <lb/>
a deep disappointment as well. In <lb/>
your letter of the 21st of March, 1901 <lb/>
you say: <lb/></p> 

<p>"I may say that I realise very fully <lb/>
"the difficulty of the position in  <lb/>
"which the Government and Legisla-­ <lb/></p>
