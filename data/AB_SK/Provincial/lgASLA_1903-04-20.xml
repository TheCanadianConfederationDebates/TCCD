were appointed a special committee to <lb/>

of the House: Messrs. McDonald, Ben<lb break="no"/>nett, Brown, DeVeber, Meyers, and <lb/>
the mover and seconder. Agreed. <lb/></p> 

<p>On motion of Premier Haultain the <lb/>
house then adjourned at 3.15 pm. <lb/></p> -->

<p rendition="simple:right">MONDAY, April 20th.</p> 

<p>The House did not sit over an hour <lb/>
today but in that space of time consid<lb break="no"/>erable business was transacted and the <lb/>
Address in reply to the Speech from <lb/>
the Throne passed. <persName ref="pers:GILL3">The Speaker</persName> took <lb/>
the Chair at 2.45 p.m. Petitions were <lb/>
presented as follows:— <lb/></p> 

<p>By <persName ref="pers:DEVE1">Dr. DeVeber</persName> asking for amend<lb break="no"/>ments to the Ordinance incorporating <lb/>
the Galt Hospital; also asking for <lb/>
amendments to the Municipal Ordi<lb break="no"/>nance to enlarge the powers of Leth<lb break="no"/>bridge. <lb/></p> 

<p>By <persName ref="pers:SHER1">Mr. Shera</persName> asking for the incor<lb break="no"/>poration of the Bishop of the Russian <lb/>
Greek Catholic Orthodox Church. <lb/></p> 

<p>The following Bills were introduced <lb/>
and read a first time:— <lb/></p> 

<p>By <persName ref="pers:YOUN3">Mr. Young</persName> –To incorporate the <lb/>
Western Canada Historical Society; to <lb/>

<p>By <persName ref="pers:BROW6">Mr. G. W. Brown</persName> to amend the <lb/>

<p>Before the Orders of the Day were <lb/>
called <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Premier Haultain</persName> laid on the <lb/>
Table of the House the correspondence <lb/>
with the Dominion authorities relating <lb/>
to the Memorial of the Assembly of <lb/>
May 2nd, 1900, upon the financial and <lb/>
constitutional position of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies; also the report of the Attorney-<lb break="yes"/>General's department with reference to <lb/>
liquor licences. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE ADDRESS IN REPLY.</p> 

<p>The Address in Reply to the Speech <lb/>
from the Throne was then moved by <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:FINL3">Mr. Finlay</persName> (Medicine Hat). After <lb/>
touching briefly on the King's illness <lb/>
and Coronation, the general prosperity <lb/>
of the Territories and the consequent <lb/>
increase in responsibilities devolving <lb/>
on the Assembly, the speaker referred <lb/>
to the efforts made by the Territorial <lb/>
Government to secure provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy and failing in that, a largely in<lb break="no"/>creased grant. He declared himself <lb/>
as being strongly in favor of provincial <lb/>
autonomy and stated that he could not <lb/>
understand why the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should persist in refusing to give <lb/>
it. He would not uphold the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in doing wrong. He was there as <lb/>
a North-West man to uphold the <lb/>
rights of the North-West. The Dom<lb break="no"/>inion Government was doing a great <lb/>
injustice to the North-West by not <lb/>
granting what was their due. They <lb/>
had by giving the Territories ten <lb/>
members in the House of Commons <lb/>
acknowledged that there was a popula<lb break="no"/>tion of 250,000 in this country, and why <lb/>
then, asked the speaker, do they not <lb/>
grant us provincial autonomy; why <lb/>
not give us a larger grant? After <lb/>
touching on the question of transpor<lb break="no"/>tation, the public domain, tranfer of <lb/>
the land titles offices, etc., Mr. Finlay <lb/>
declared in conclusion that he would be <lb/>
thoroughly independent in treating all <lb/>
questions and he hoped the House <lb/>
would continue to carry out that inde<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

pendent spirit which it had maintained <lb/>
to the present time. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MR. MACNUTT SECONDS.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACN3">Mr. MacNutt</persName> (Saltcoats) in seconding <lb/>
the Address in Reply said he would <lb/>
not deal with the many questions re<lb break="no"/>ferred to in the Speech as in the later <lb/>
discussions in the House these would <lb/>
be fully dealt with. On the subject of <lb/>
provincial autonomy, however, he ex<lb break="no"/>pressed himselt strongly, and said that <lb/>
the sessions of the Territorial Assembly <lb/>
should not be dependent on the sessions <lb/>
of Parliament at Ottawa. The corres<lb break="no"/>pondence which had been laid on the <lb/>
Table of the House showed the strenu<lb break="no"/>ous efforts made by the local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to secure autonomy and he be<lb break="no"/>lieved in keeping up the correspondence <lb/>
until the Dominion Government be<lb break="no"/>came so weary of it that they would <lb/>
grant the request. It was an injustice <lb/>
for the Dominion Government to send <lb/>
in immigrants from all parts of the <lb/>
earth by tens and tens of thousands <lb/>
and not provide the wherewithal to <lb/>
give these people educational, trans<lb break="no"/>portation and other facilities necessary <lb/>
in the country. On the question of <lb/>
transportation Mr. MacNutt said the <lb/>
natural resources of his part of the <lb/>
country could not be taken advan<lb break="no"/>tage of for lack of the necessary <lb/>
facilities. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PREMIER HAULTAIN.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Premier Haultain</persName> was the next <lb/>
speaker. He said that under ordinary <lb/>
circumstances he would not be address<lb break="no"/>ing the House just then. The usual <lb/>
procedure was for the leader of the <lb/>
Opposition to follow the mover and <lb/>
seconder and make what criticisms he <lb/>
had to offer on the policy of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and then the leader of the <lb/>
Government spoke in reply. He took <lb/>
the absence of any such speech from <lb/>
the leader of the Opposition, or his <lb/>
representtive, as significant, and as <lb/>
implying that as the Speech from the <lb/>
Throne outlined subjects of such over<lb break="no"/>whelming importance to the Territories <lb/>
the Opposition were going to join with <lb/>
all the other Members in trying to <lb/>
come to some united action, on those <lb/>
important subjects. (Cheers.) This <lb/>
condition augured well for the success<lb break="no"/>ful meeting of the difficulties of the <lb/>
unfortunate position in which they <lb/>
found themselves at present. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Premier then congratulated the <lb/>
mover and seconder on the able man<lb break="no"/>ner in which they had performed their <lb/>
duties and went on to speak of the <lb/>
King's illness and Coronation. He <lb/>
dwelt on the significance of the latter <lb/>
ceremony and amid hearty cheers <lb/>
spoke eloquently of Britain as a free <lb/>
land for a free people. While it <lb/>
had been a great year in Imperial <lb/>
events it had also been a momentous <lb/>
year for the Territories. In speaking <lb/>
of their growth and added responsibili<lb break="no"/>ties they did not do so in a pessimistic <lb/>
or hopeless spirit. All they asked was <lb/>
that they should be in a position to <lb/>
meet those responsibilities, and he <lb/>
believed they were fully as capable of <lb/>
doing so as the people in any other <lb/>
portion of Canada. This was in fact <lb/>
the burden of the Speech from the <lb/>
Throne. It would be an unfortunate <lb/>
thing if the people, and Government <lb/>
and Legislature of the Territories <lb/>
should have to approach the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada with the methods of <lb/>
the unfortunate widow, as referred to <lb/>
by the hon. member for Saltcoats. It <lb/>
would be unfortunate for the Dominion <lb/>
Government to be placed in the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the unjust judge, forced to <lb/>
recognise the widow's rights by reason <lb/>
of her importunities. More forcible <lb/>
means than those employed by the <lb/>
Territorial Government to gain these <lb/>
rights could not have been used than <lb/>
were used. They had resorted to <lb/>
everything short of force. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">NEGOTIATIONS FOR LARGER GRANT.</p> 

<p>The financial question, said the <lb/>
Premier, is one of the immedite <lb/>
present. We have a plain duty to the <lb/>
people at the present time. In the <lb/>
financial statement we submitted to <lb/>
the Federal Government we took the <lb/>
ground that the point we had reached <lb/>
had been arrived at largely through <lb/>
the want of consideration paid to our <lb/>
requests made in previous years. The <lb/>
financial position has been growing <lb/>
more aggravated and difficult for the <lb/>
past ten years and our needs have been <lb/>
growing rapidly year by year. In our <lb/>
negotiations with the Dominion <lb/>
authorities we set forth that it was <lb/>
absolutely necessary in order to carry <lb/>
on the work for this year, that is the <lb/>
Dominion fiscal year beginning 1st of <lb/>
July next, that we be given the sum of <lb/>
$880,000 and $250,000 as supplementary <lb/>
to meet the expenditures for the <lb/>
current year to June 30th next. New <lb/>
settlers are coming in, largely through <lb/>
the efforts of the immigration move<lb break="no"/>ment, and it would be unfortunate to <lb/>
meet them with a large tax bill on <lb/>
their arrival. We pointed out that <lb/>
unless the Government provided for <lb/>
the necessary roads, bridges, schools, <lb/>
etc., the people must pay additional <lb/>
taxes. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">ADVANCES ON CAPITAL ACCOUNT.</p> 

<p>I saw the other day in THE LEADER, <lb/>
continued the Premier, a telegram <lb/>
announcing in general terms the action <lb/>
to be taken by the Government. As <lb/>
yet we have not been officially inform<lb break="no"/>ed what action the Government pro<lb break="no"/>pose to take. In THE LEADER, how<lb break="no"/>ever, I saw that a supplementary <lb/>
amount would be voted to meet the <lb/>
overdraft for this year, and that <lb/>
instead of a larger grant being granted <lb/>
we would be given something on capi<lb break="no"/>tal account. I would like to inform <lb/>
the House and country that the Terri<lb break="no"/>torial Government did not ask for <lb/>
anything on capital account. (Cheers.) <lb/>
The suggestion of a capital advance <lb/>
runs through all the correspondence <lb/>
on this subject for a great many years. <lb/>
We have pointed out that the whole <lb/>
burden of capital expenditure has been <lb/>
thrown on the current revenues of this <lb/>
country, which we claimed were <lb/>
inadequate even as revenue. But we <lb/>
did not ask for an advance on capital <lb/>
account. It is bad enough to have to <lb/>
try to meet expenditures which are <lb/>
purely capital expenditures out of <lb/>
revenue but it would be still worse to <lb/>
have money which really belongs to us <lb/>
as revenue chargeable to capital. <lb/></p>

<cb/>

<p rendition="simple:centre">PROVINCIAL AUTONOMY.</p> 

<p>With regard to the provincial ques<lb break="no"/>tion itself, we have stated it as clearly <lb/>
as possible. We are not theorists,but <lb/>
sincere, practical men making a prac<lb break="no"/>tical proposition with regard to a <lb/>
practical question. We stand on <lb/>
the principle that this country must <lb/>
mange its own affairs. In a letter to <lb/>
the Minister of the Interior, dated 31st <lb/>
January last, I said: "We demand <lb/>
that system of government under <lb/>
which we shall have as full opportuni<lb break="no"/>ies for the exercise of our citizenship <lb/>
as our fellow-citizens in the provinces. <lb/>
The local Government and Legislature <lb/>
should have full and free scope of <lb/>
action left to them on many subjects <lb/>
which relate to the prosperity and <lb/>
happiness of the country and the <lb/>
North-West will not be satisfied until <lb/>
this is granted."That, said Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain, is the position we take. <lb/></p> 


    <!-- IC, 2018-10-31, Commented out below as it is not relevant the debate day-->


<!--<p>TRANSPORTATION DIFFICULTIES. <lb/></p> 

<p>With regard to the transportation <lb/>
question Mr. Haultain said that condi<lb break="no"/>tions had reached such a point in this <lb/>
country, and so vitally affected the <lb/>
people, that he thought the Assembly <lb/>
was justified in " resoluting " a little on <lb/>
a question which was outside their <lb/>
jurisdiction. Everyone knew what <lb/>
the conditions have been and are and <lb/>
no one could tell what conditions <lb/>
would be within the next few months <lb/>
or during the year. The present condi<lb break="no"/>tions were largely due to the fact that <lb/>
the existing railway companies had <lb/>
not lived up to their contracts. He <lb/>
quoted the C.P.R. contract to the <lb/>
effect that the company was to forever <lb/>
maintain efficiency and work their <lb/>
railway. He did not need to elaborate <lb/>
on the fact that the company have not <lb/>
efficiently maintained or run their line <lb/>
during the past two years. He was <lb/>
afraid that while rival railway comp<lb break="no"/>anies are struggling for rights-of-way <lb/>
and covering grounds with posts and <lb/>
flags where railways would not be <lb/>
contstructed for years, or while they <lb/>
were after subsidies at Ottawa or <lb/>
waiting until the necessary power was <lb/></p>
