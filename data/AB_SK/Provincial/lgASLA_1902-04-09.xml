<!--

<p>Mr.D.H.McDonald, leader of the <lb/>
Opposition followed Mr. Sifton in <lb/>
the debate on provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy, and took up a line of argu<lb break="no"/>ment similar to that followed <lb/>
by previous Opposition speakers. He <lb/>
declared theOpposition to be in favor <lb/>
of provincial autonomy but not in favor <lb/>
of having certain terms put upon the <lb/>
people unless those terms received the <lb/>
consent and approval of the people. <lb/>
The premier by introducing a contro<lb break="no"/>versial matter into the negotiations, <lb/>
had to a certain extent deceived the <lb/>
members of the House. As to the <lb/>
Sifton banquet at Prince Albert Mr. <lb/>
McDonald said that the Commissioner <lb/>
of Public Works knew full well that <lb/>
the people of that country were unani<lb break="no"/>mously in favor of two provinces and <lb/>
consequently he failed to express the <lb/>
opinion of the Government or himself <lb/>
on the question then before the House. <lb/></p> 

<p>The speaker refuted the idea that <lb/>
the members of the Opposition wanted <lb/>
two provinces in order that they might <lb/>
hold office. The firmly believed that <lb/>
it was for the best interests of Canada <lb/>
that there should be two provinces. If <lb/>
the policy of advocating one province <lb/>
was persisted in it would drive a large <lb/>
portion of Eastern Assiniboia into <lb/>
Manitoba. The Opposition desired <lb/>
that those people should remain in the <lb/>
Territories as long as they desired <lb/>
to do so. It was a mistake to think <lb/>
that any large number of people were <lb/>
agitating for annexation to Manitoba. <lb/>
They had not so declared themselves pub<lb break="no"/>licly and had on no occasion expressed <lb/>
themselves as desirous of joining Man<lb break="no"/>itoba. There might be a certain am<lb break="no"/>ount of feeling that the people of Man-<lb break="maybe"/>toba were in a better position to carry <lb/>
out their wheat. This was a fact and <lb/>
it was largely due to the inactivity of <lb/>
the present Territorial Government in <lb/>
pressing for the construction of rail<lb break="no"/>ways in this country. <lb/></p> 

<p>It was well that the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had seen that there was a div<lb break="no"/> </p>

<milestone type="unknown"/> <lb/>

<p>ergency of opinion as to one or more <lb/>
provinces as it was possible that other<lb break="no"/>wise the terms submitted by the local <lb/>
Government might have been forced <lb/>
on the people of the Territories. There <lb/>
was even now some jealousy in some <lb/>
provinces that other provinces had too <lb/>
much influence and was it advisable <lb/>
that they should stir up that unfriend<lb break="no"/>ly feeling which might lead to a still <lb/>
worse feeling? The only question be<lb break="no"/>fore the House was whether the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories should be formed into one or <lb/>
two provinces. The Opposition laid be<lb break="no"/>fore the House their views in favor of <lb/>
two provinces and on those views they <lb/>
were prepared to go to the country and <lb/>
on them they asked that the vote be <lb/>
taken. (Cheers) <lb/></p> 

<p>MEMBER FOR NORTH REGINA. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. G. W. Brown followed. He did <lb/>
not propose to take up much of the <lb/>
time of the House at that <lb/>
hour, and while he did not impute the <lb/>
motive for a number of provinces to <lb/>
be that the political ambitions of hon. <lb/>
gentlemen opposite might be satisfied, <lb/>
he would congratulate their leader on <lb/>
the manner in which he distributed <lb/>
amongst his followers the work which <lb/>
generally fell to the leader himself. <lb/></p> 

<p>In view of the fact that, while the <lb/>
leader of the Opposition was complain<lb break="no"/>ing that the Government had not ac<lb break="no"/>complished more with reference to this <lb/>
important subject, the member for <lb/>
West Calgary was speaking of steam <lb/>
boiler inspection, etc., and forgetting <lb/>
entirely the great question his leader <lb/>
was trying to impress on the House, <lb/>
the people must come to the conclu<lb break="no"/>sion that so far as they were concerned <lb/>
there had been no great deal of atten<lb break="no"/>tion given to what the policy of the <lb/>
Opposition should be. They had the <lb/>
humble confession of the leader of the <lb/>
Opposition that for two years he had <lb/>
expressed no opinion on it. Then after <lb/>
the member for West Calgary had de<lb break="no"/>voted his time to his private affairs <lb/>
and the hon. member for Yorkton had <lb/>
time to make up his mind, the House and <lb/>
public had that wonderful document <lb break="no"/>the, amendment. Just imagine those <lb/>
hon. gentlemen who had expressed <lb/>
such divergent opinions at so late a <lb/>
date, within 2 hours formulating a <lb/>
policy for the people and coming down <lb/>
here to ask fro a short respite to pro<lb break="no"/>duce that document. (Laughter.) <lb/>
There was no agreement among them <lb/>
yet. <lb/></p> 

<p>DR. PATRICK'S UNUSUAL POSITION. <lb/></p> 

<p>Talk about the Government exceed<lb break="no"/>ing their duties and introducing a <lb/>
question which did not belong in the <lb/>
negotiations. When the estimates were <lb/>
being voted in a previous year had not <lb/>
the member for Yorkton asked if there <lb/></p>

<milestone type="unknown"/> <lb/>

<p>was sufficient money to call a special <lb/>
Session and pay for a deputation to go to <lb/>
Ottawa? He knew last year the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were going to Ottawa to treat <lb/>
with reference to this question exactly <lb/>
as they did treat with it. Knowing <lb/>
this, and that the House could be call<lb break="no"/>ed together, he obtained a specific <lb/>
promise from the leader of the House <lb/>
that there would be funds enough to <lb/>
bring the House together, and then he <lb/>
came there to-day and said that the <lb/>
Government had no mandate. This <lb/>
was a very unusual position to take. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. gentleman opposite declared <lb/>
for two provinces but claimed it was <lb/>
not necessary to say what they should <lb/>
be. The hon. member for West Cal<lb break="no"/>gary had said that New Brunswick and <lb/>
Nova Scotia could not agree, neither <lb/>
could Ontario and Quebec, and that <lb/>
the same state of affairs would exist <lb/>
out here. If the hon. gentleman was <lb/>
any exponent of the views of the <lb/>
people he represented then he (Brown) <lb/>
would like to know if these people <lb/>
were going to be linked in with eastern <lb/>
and western Assiniboia. The realreason <lb/>
for not stating where these provinces <lb/>
should be was given by one hon, mem<lb break="no"/>ber when he explained they wished to <lb/>
be in a position to change front when­ <lb/>
ever they liked. <lb/></p> 

<p>AN ANNEXATION ARGUMENT. <lb/></p> 

<p>As to the cost of governing small <lb/>
provinces Mr. Brown pointed out that <lb/>
Prince Edward Island was running <lb/>
behind and getting deeper in the hole <lb/>
all the time. The claim for two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces instead of being a reason for not <lb/>
annexing a portion to Manitoba was <lb/>
an argument in favor of it. It was the <lb/>
Opposition who were suggesting it and <lb/>
the Dominion Government might say <lb/>
if there is too much for one province <lb/>
then we will give a portion to Manito<lb break="no"/>ba and make the balance into one <lb/>
province. <lb/></p> 

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Brown said the <lb/>
smaller province had all the rights and <lb/>
privileges of the larger provinces but <lb/>
they had not the ability to undertake <lb/>
large schemes for the benefit and wel<lb break="no"/>fare of the people which the larger <lb/>
provinces possessed. (Cheers.) <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. A. E. Cross (East Calgary) mov<lb break="no"/>ed the adjournment of the debate and <lb/>
a few minutes later at 1.35 a.m. the <lb/>
House adjourned. <lb/></p> -->

<p rendition="simple:centre">WEDNESDAY, April 9th.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:EAKI1">Speaker Eakin</persName> took the chair at half <lb/>
past two. Mr. A. B. Gillis, chairman <lb/>
of the committee on standing orders <lb/>
reported in favor of a petition for <lb/>
incorporating the Red Deer Memorial <lb/>
hospital. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Premier Haultain</persName> in reply to Mr. <lb/>
Villeneuve said that the permits for <lb/>
the sale of liquor in the organized <lb/>
Territories and the amounts received <lb/>
were as follows: 1899 (84) $253; 1900 <lb/>
(72) $179; 1901 (142) $325; 1902 to April <lb/>
8 (54) $143. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Premier Haultain</persName> in answer to Mr. <lb/>
Villeneuve said no members of the edu<lb break="no"/>cational council had been appointed <lb/>
since the last meeting of the assembly. <lb/>
The government did intend to make <lb/>
such appointments but he could not <lb/>
exactly say when. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SIFT2">Hon. A. L. Sifton</persName> in reply to Mr. C. <lb/>
Fisher said that 2,740 quarter sections <lb/>
in Batoche electoral district had been <lb/>
included in Prince Albert's local im<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

provement district but neither the hon. <lb/>
member nor any one else was consulted <lb/>
in the matter. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MR. A. E. CROSS.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CROS1">Mr. A. E. Cross</persName> (East Calgary) re<lb break="no"/>sumed the debate on provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy. He was thoroughly in accord <lb/>
with Mr. Haultain's motion expressing <lb/>
regret that the Dominion Government <lb/>
had not agreed to pass legislation giv<lb break="no"/>ing the Territories provincial establish<lb break="no"/>ment. The amendment was a sort of <lb/>
snap-shot, want of confidence in the <lb/>
Government. It was not his intention <lb/>
to vote for two provinces till he knew <lb/>
where they were to be, and he would <lb/>
rather vote for one province than for <lb/>
two if they were to be divided up into <lb/>
northern and southern provinces. If, <lb/>
as stated, they were to be divided more <lb/>
or less equally in area it would place <lb/>
the northern province in a most ridic<lb break="no"/>ulous light. He did not think anybody <lb/>
would vote for it. If they threw off <lb/>
the northern part which was not popu<lb break="no"/>lated and then divided the remainder <lb/>
there would be a province consisting <lb/>
of a long thin line along the interna<lb break="no"/>tional boundary largely populated with <lb/>
people from the United States and <lb/>
coming in with agressive ideas and <lb/>
looking down more or less on our <lb/>
country. He had lived in the United <lb/>
States and knew something of their <lb/>
ideas and if the House invited that con<lb break="no"/>dition of affairs they were not only do<lb break="no"/>ing a wrong to the country but a great <lb/>
injustice to every man in it. By intro<lb break="no"/>ducing that long thin province they <lb/>
would create a wedge of discord right <lb/>
in the heart of Western Canada, and <lb/>
in the future these people might make <lb/>
a demand on Ottawa which was unrea<lb break="no"/>sonable and could not be granted. <lb/>
There would follow an agitation and <lb/>
an appeal to Washington and the first <lb/>
thing they knew they would have an <lb/>
international question on their hands. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CROS1">Mr. Cross</persName> said he was in favor of two <lb/>
provinces and would go further and <lb/>
state where they should be, which was <lb/>
more than members of the Opposition <lb/>
had courage to do. He believed in <lb/>
an eastern and western province. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> —Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CROS1">Mr. Cross</persName> —They should be divided <lb/>
almost equally in area and I do not <lb/>
think any controversial, questions <lb/>
should arise if they are so divided. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> —Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CROS1">Mr. Cross</persName> said the western province <lb/>
would find its best market in the west, <lb/>
while the eastern province would be <lb/>
contributary to the east, as the chief <lb/>
product, wheat went to the seaboard. <lb/></p> 

<p>As far as the area of two provinces <lb/>
was concerned Mr. Cross claimed it <lb/>
was not fair to make comparisons <lb/>
with other provinces where, much of <lb/>
the land would support neither man <lb/>
nor animal, whereas the Territories <lb/>
was composed of arable land capable <lb/>
of producing all kinds of agricultural <lb/>
products and live stock. Consequently <lb/>
they would be in a position to support <lb/>
a very much larger population than <lb/>
the other provinces, and if they were <lb/>
divided into two provinces they would <lb/>
eventually be larger provinces, than <lb/>
any in the Douminion. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
He had that much confidence in the <lb/>
west. (Hear, hear.) The outcome <lb/>
would be the formation of the greatest <lb/>
and most powerful provinces with the <lb/>
people in the front rank. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
He, therefore, regretted that the <lb/>
amendment had not come before the <lb/>
people in a reasonable and fair way so <lb/>
that honest and intelligent people <lb/>
could judge for themselves and say <lb/>
they either had confidence in the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition or they had not. The amend<lb break="no"/>ment was really no amendment at all, <lb/>
but in fact a motion. He was perfect<lb break="no"/>ly in accord with Mr. Haultain's <lb/>
motion and could not vote for the <lb/>
amendment even if it came up as a <lb/>
motion. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MR. ANNABLE'S POLICY.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ANNA2">Mr. G. M. Annable</persName> (MooseJaw) <lb/>
claimed that a majority of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment supporters were in favor of two <lb/>
provinces. He had taken an independ<lb break="no"/>ent stand in the House voting with <lb/>
one side as much as the other. He <lb/>
congratulated the Opposition on gett<lb break="no"/>ing out a platform on one plank of <lb/>
which he could stand. He was in favor <lb/>
of two provinces, and when they were <lb/>
formed he thought the boundary lines <lb/>
would be in sympathy with the ideas <lb/>
of the member from East Calgary. <lb/></p> 

<p>Dealing with the negotiations car<lb break="no"/>ried on by the local Government, Mr. <lb/>
Annable said: "If I was a member of <lb/>
that Government I would give the <lb/>
Dominion Government 30 days to grant <lb/>
our demands. I would say I <lb/>
want this subsidy or I will resign and <lb/>
you can run the show." (Hear, hear, <lb/>
and cheers.) Continuing he said no<lb break="no"/>body knew better than the Dominion <lb/>
Government, the extent of the influx of <lb/>
immigration into this country and yet <lb/>
the local Government was expected to <lb/>
build roads, bridges, schools, etc., and <lb/>
make these people happy on $300,000 a <lb/>
year. If the local Government would <lb/>
give the Dominion Government 30 days <lb/>
notice and then resign if their request <lb/>
was not acceded to they need not be <lb/>
afraid that the lieutenant governor <lb/>
would call on any three other men to <lb/>
form a Government because they could <lb/>
not be elected. (Laughter). These <lb/>
were not hard times and the Dominion <lb/>
Government did not know what to do <lb/>
with their money. (Laughter.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">MR. A. S. ROSENROLL</persName></p> 

<p>was the next speaker. The question <lb/>
of one or two provinces had found <lb/>
their fullest expression. The hon. <lb/>
member for Yorkton had not quite <lb/>
proved his case as to the cost of ad<lb break="no"/>iministering large and small provinces. <lb/>
He (Rosenroll) had had a little experi<lb break="no"/>ence himself last summer. For a few <lb/>
months he had to keep up two house<lb break="no"/>holds as his wife and faimily were in <lb/>
one province, while he had to keep up <lb/>
his house at his place of business at <lb/>
Wetaskiwin. Two governments, he <lb/>
declared, were twice as expensive as <lb/>
one. That was as clear as that twice <lb/>
two makes four. The world was get<lb break="no"/>ting smaller and distances shorter all <lb/>
the time, and government of a large <lb/>
area was much easier and more econo<lb break="no"/>mical in Canada, now than twenty <lb/>
years ago. The tendency all over the <lb/>
world was for combination in the poli<lb break="no"/>tical as well as the commercial world. <lb/>
The smaller nations of Europe had <lb/>
been wielded together into large and <lb/>
powerful nations such as Germany and <lb/>
taly. In all branches of human acti<lb break="no"/>vity instead of dividing forces people <lb/>
were uniting them. The people of the <lb/>
Territories should conform to the spirit <lb/>
of the times and unite and have one <lb/>
great, prosperous province. <lb/></p> 

<p>Another objection to two provinces <lb/>
would be the obstacles thus placed in <lb/>
the way of professional men. Why <lb/>
build a Chinese wall between two sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the country. So far they <lb/>
had grown up together under the same <lb/>
institutions and they formed a national <lb/>
character peculiar to the North-West. <lb/>
Still another reason was that as one <lb/>
province they would assimilate <lb/>

<cb/>

foreign races such as the Galicians and <lb/>
Doukhobors more easily. These people <lb/>
were enjoying privileges unknown to <lb/>
them before they came to Canada; <lb/>
they were poor in there own land as <lb/>
our grandparents were here; they were <lb/>
becoming prosperous and would make <lb/>
good patriotic citizens but the process <lb/>
of assimilation would be more rapid <lb/>
in one province. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Minister of the Interior had <lb/>
stated at a public meeting in Winni<lb break="no"/>peg that it was not desirable to increase <lb/>
the present number of provinces. The <lb/>
hon. member for Yorkton only as late <lb/>
as last year was in favor of the ex<lb break="no"/>tension of Manitoba's boundaries and <lb/>
justified his contention by a lengthy <lb/>
speech. It had been said that one great <lb/>
overshadowing province would be a <lb/>
future danger to confederation. What <lb/>
did that mean? It meant that if there <lb/>
existed no danger of annexation that <lb/>
danger had since been created by the <lb/>
arguments of the gentlemen on the op<lb break="no"/>posite side of the house. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> explained that he did not <lb/>
advocate the extension of Manitoba <lb/>
westward. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. Rosenroll</persName>—I did not say north<lb break="no"/>ward or westward. The facts are that <lb/>
he practically said that Manitoba, was <lb/>
too small a province. He admitted <lb/>
that it should be made larger. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—But he was willing to <lb/>
state the boundaries. (Laughter) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MR. J. B. SHERA.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SHER1">Mr. J. B. Shera</persName> (Victoria) contented <lb/>
that the motion did not mean that they <lb/>
should have been made into, one pro<lb break="no"/>vince, but that they regretted that the <lb/>
Dominion Government had not grant<lb break="no"/>ed provincial institutions. He regret<lb break="no"/>ted that and he thought the people did, <lb/>
and taking that ground he was willing <lb/>
to support the resolution. He believed <lb/>
it was nothing more than right and he <lb/>
did so conscientiously. He might <lb/>
suffer for it as the people in the north<lb break="no"/>ern country were in favor of two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">SOUTH REGINA'S REPRESENTATIVE.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAWK1">Mr. J. B. Hawkes</persName> (South Regina) <lb/>
said he was in favor of one province. <lb/>
Some people said the time had not <lb/>
yet arrived when the Territories should <lb/>
come into provincial rights but he <lb/>
claimed the time had fully arrived and <lb/>
the sooner they were formed into a <lb/>
province the better it would be for all <lb/>
parties concerned. They had also <lb/>
heard that the Government had no <lb/>
mandate to go to Ottawa and treat <lb/>
to form a province. He did not look <lb/>
at it in that way. The Government <lb/>
had started to bring the matter as <lb/>
near it as possible before consulting <lb/>
the House so that if the Dominion <lb/>
Government was willing to grant their <lb/>
request the House would be in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to close the bargain. He could <lb/>
see no reason why they could not get <lb/>
along as one province quite as well as <lb/>
two and it could be managed just as <lb/>
economically. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAWK1">Mr. Hawkes</persName> referred to Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Leod's Prince Albert speech in which <lb/>
that gentleman claimed the Opposition <lb/>
were working together to hold this <lb/>
matter in abeyance. The speaker said <lb/>
that while he had belonged to that <lb/>
Opposition no man could say that he <lb/>
ever, endeavored to hold the question <lb/>
in abeyance. The sooner they got <lb/>
provincial autonomy the better. Quot<lb break="no"/>ing further from Mr. McLeod's speech <lb/>
in which that gentleman was reported <lb/>
to have said he was satisfied the <lb/>
Dominion Government would not <lb/>
grant autonomy for some years and <lb/>
that they were better as they were, <lb/>
Mr Hawkes said he thought the hon. <lb/>
gentleman did not know what he was <lb/>
talking about. With the very worst <lb/>
terms they could possibly get they would <lb/>
be better than they were today. If they <lb/>
were made into a province today they <lb/>
would have a better chance to develop <lb/>
the resources of the country. Pioneers <lb/>
were now paying for all the improve<lb break="no"/>ments while in a province the pay<lb break="no"/>ments would be extended over many <lb/>
years; they could fix the country up <lb/>
and newcomers would pay their share <lb/>
of the burden. It was a well known <lb/>
fact that the Government had not the <lb/>
money to do necessary work. He had <lb/>
asked for work to be done which he felt <lb/>
sure would have been done if the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Publie Works had had the <lb/>
money at his disposal. <lb/></p> 

<p>A contented settler, Mr. Hawkes <lb/>
claimed, was the best possible immigra<lb break="no"/>tion agent. It was therefore of the <lb/>
utmost importance that the Terri<lb break="no"/>ories should be formed into a province <lb/>
and thus be able to build roads and <lb/>
bridges, carrying on tests for water, <lb/>
and develop the resources of the <lb/>
country. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PROUD OF THE GOVERNMENT .</p> 

<p>He believed the Government were <lb/>
working not for the interests of <lb/>
Regina, Calgary, Macleod, but for the <lb/>
Territories as a whole. Did the pro<lb break="no"/>position it sent Ottawa sound as if it <lb/>
had no interest in the country or its <lb/>
development? It did not. Every <lb/>
member supporting the Government <lb/>
should be proud of the position it had <lb/>
taken and he was very proud of it, and <lb/>
he felt sure every member would regret <lb/>
the way in which the Government had <lb/>
been treated. The Opposition had <lb/>
formulated their policy and he could <lb/>
follow them no longer. (Cheers.) He <lb/>
would give the Government all the <lb/>
support he could give them until their <lb/>
policy of one province was carried out. <lb/>
(Cheers) <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DEVE1">Dr. De Veber</persName> (Lethbridge) supported <lb/>
the resolution. Although it did not <lb/>
declare for one province he was in <lb/>
favor of one province. Some of the <lb/>
arguments advanced against one pro<lb break="no"/>vince were very poor, and the argu<lb break="no"/>ment that the larger the province the <lb/>
more it cost per capita would not ap<lb break="no"/>peal to anyone of sense. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MR. R. S. LAKE.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. R. S. Lake</persName> (Grenfell) expressed <lb/>
his approval of the proposal of the exe<lb break="no"/>cutive. The opposition were unani<lb break="no"/>mous in favor of the recital of the <lb/>
motion, but they were nearly all at <lb/>
variance as to the motion itself. For <lb/>
his own part, however, the motion <lb/>
was very simple. It was merely a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of regret that legislation of some <lb/>
kind was not introduced into the <lb/>
Dominion parliament and he could not <lb/>
see why the opposition even holding <lb/>
the views they did, could not vote for <lb/>
the motion. Coming to the reasons <lb/>
given by the Minister of the Interior <lb/>
for postponing the question, he said <lb/>
that if the population was too sparse <lb/>
for one province, surely it was too <lb/>
sparse for two provinces. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
It was evident when the conference <lb/>
was arranged, that the Dominion <lb/>
government meant business, but some<lb break="no"/>thing had evidently happened, he did <lb/>
not know what, which had changed <lb/>
that intention. He concluded by ex<lb break="no"/>pressing his approval of the actions and <lb/>
methods of the executive and said it <lb/>
would be inconsistent with the federal <lb/>
principle if the new province was not <lb/>
treated on an equal plane with the <lb/>
older provinces. Otherwise confedera<lb break="no"/>tion would totter and fall to the <lb/>

<cb/>

ground. He was a one province man <lb/>
on the principle that union is strength, <lb/>
and as one province they could work <lb/>
out the solution of the transportation <lb/>
problem so much more easily. The <lb/>
varied climate and resources of the <lb/>
several districts might be an argument <lb/>
against, but there were many good rea<lb break="no"/>sons favoring one large province. He <lb/>
was opposed to annexation with Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">CAPTAIN MEYERS.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MEYE1">Capt. Meyers</persName> (Kinistino) opposed the <lb/>
amendment. Some of the people to <lb/>
the north wanted two provinces with <lb/>
the dividing line between Assiniboia <lb/>
and Saskatchewan from Manitoba to <lb/>
British Columbia. He ridiculed the <lb/>
idea of carrying the boundary line so <lb/>
far north as the northern boundary of <lb/>
British Columbia, which would further <lb/>
carry the dividing line some hundreds <lb/>
of miles north. If the proposed boun<lb break="no"/>daries were clearly defined he might <lb/>
have seen his way clear to support the <lb/>
amendment, but as it was he must say <lb/>
he had greater faith in one province <lb/>
although it might be large than in two <lb/>
provinces with uncertain boundaries. <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA6">Mr. M. McCauley</persName> thought the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was not so much one of one pro<lb break="no"/>vince or two provinces, as a question of <lb/>
terms, Edmonton and Prince Albert <lb/>
Boards of Trade had passed resolutions <lb/>
in favor of a northern and southern <lb/>
province, but obviously they had been <lb/>
influenced by the question of capital. <lb/>
Such resolutions were a little previous, <lb/>
and he thought the real question was <lb/>
one of terms. Personally he was in <lb/>
favor of one province, on the score of <lb/>
economy. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MR. FISHER.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. C. Fisher</persName> said that he had al<lb break="no"/>ways been a one-province man, but <lb/>
seeing that the Dominion Government <lb/>
had refused, and had postponed the <lb/>
question for two years, he should, <lb/>
when that time elapsed, be prepared to <lb/>
vote for two provinces. If, however, <lb/>
there were to be a northern and a <lb/>
southern province, he would like to <lb/>
know how they were to be divided. <lb/>
He joined, however, in the expression <lb/>
of regret in the resolution, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, he should support it. <lb/></p>

of the government. <lb/></p>
