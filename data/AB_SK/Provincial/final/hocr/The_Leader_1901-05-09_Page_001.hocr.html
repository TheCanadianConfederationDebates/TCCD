    <p>
      The third session of the fourth legis-<lb/>
      lation Assembly of the North-West<lb/>
      Territories was opened this afternoon.<lb/>
      The bright May day induced a much<lb/>
      larger crowd than usual to witness the<lb/>
      proceedings. ong before the hour of<lb/>
      the ceremony the Assembly hall was<lb/>
      thronged with gaily clad ladies, and<lb/>
      the other sex were also present in<lb/>
      large numbers. At 2:40 the lowering<lb/>
      of the flag at government house an-<lb/>
      nounced the departure of the Lieut.-<lb/>
      Governor and soon a cavalcade of<lb/>
      North-West Mounted Police, under<lb/>
      command of Inspector McGibbon, were<lb/>
      seen coming along, escorting his honor<lb/>
      with Captain Gilpin-Brown as aide-de-<lb/>
      camp. The stte od Dewdney street<lb/>
      did not permit a direct journey, and as<lb/>
      a result picturesqueness was lent to<lb/>
      the approach of the procession by its<lb/>
      meanderings across the prairie. On<lb/>
      arrival at the government bulidings<lb/>
      the escort lined up and as soon as the<lb/>
      Lieut.-Governor had alighted arms<lb/>
      were presented and the trumpets<lb/>
      sounded the royal salute. His honor<lb/>
      was conducted by Premier Haultain<lb/>
      and Territorial Secretary Bulyea to<lb/>
      the Speaker's chair, whence he read<lb/>
      the following speech:-
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SPEAKER AND GENTLEMENT OF THE LEGIS-<lb/>
      LATIVE ASSEMBLY:-
    </p>
    <p>
      In welcoming you to the Third Session of the<lb/>
      Fourth Legislative Assembly,I rejoice to re-<lb/>
      cord the present era of prosperity throughout<lb/>
      these Territories and the favourable prospects<lb/>
      to be noted everywhere for the future welfare<lb/>
      of our people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since our last meeting the civilised world has<lb/>
      joined in mourning the death of our late Sove-<lb/>
      reign, Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Vic-<lb/>
      toria, under whose long, wise, and beneficient<lb/>
      rule the British Empire hs made unprecedent-<lb/>
      ed advancement. Nowhere has her noble ex-<lb/>
      ample in all the relations of life been more sin-<lb/>
      cerely admired or her death more deeply re-<lb/>
      <cb/>
      retted than in the North-West Territories.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will, I am sure, desire to express in fitting<lb/>
      terms at the earliest opportunity the grief of<lb/>
      those whom you represeent at the death of the<lb/>
      Great Queen, their deep sympathy with the<lb/>
      Royal Family in its great afflication and their<lb/>
      devoted loyalty to our new Soveriegn King<lb/>
      Edward VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      In common with the rest of Canada you must<lb/>
      be gratified at the splendid service done on be-<lb/>
      half of teh Empire by our fellow citizens in<lb/>
      South Africa. That some of those who volun-<lb/>
      teered their services have lost their lives must<lb/>
      be a cause of the deepest sorrow and I am sure<lb/>
      that you will join me in expressing the greatest<lb/>
      sympathy for the relatives and friends of those<lb/>
      who have fallen as well as the heartiest wel-<lb/>
      come to those who have returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memorial which, at your last session, you<lb/>
      addressed to the Governor General in Council<lb/>
      respecting the constitutional and financial posi-<lb/>
      tion of the Territorieswas duly forwarded by<lb/>
      me to His Excellency, and I wil have such<lb/>
      correspondence as bears upon the subject laid<lb/>
      before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Representations hvae been made to the Domi-<lb/>
      nion Government respecting the necessity ex-<lb/>
      isting for further provision being made to meet<lb/>
      the present inadequacy of the revenue. Parlia-<lb/>
      ment has not, as yet, given any indication as to<lb/>
      its intentions in the matter and I am, therefore<lb/>
      unable to inform you of the reception given to<lb/>
      the requests of my Govenrment, the nature of<lb/>
      which you will be made conversant with in due<lb/>
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addressing you on the occasion of your<lb/>
      last meeting I referred to "the great dispropor-<lb/>
      "tion existing between the means at command<lb/>
      "and the ever growing neccessities of the rapidly<lb/>
      "increasing population of the Territories." As<lb/>
      those neccessities have still continued to grow<lb/>
      with our population, and there is no substantial<lb/>
      increase to the revenue apparently to be looked<lb/>
      for, I feel it my duty to call your attention to<lb/>
      the absolute impossibility of supplying the<lb/>
      ordinary servicesof the Territories with the<lb/>
      means at your command.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past few months, small pox, which<lb/>
      has been epidemic in the States of the Ameri-<lb/>
      can Union immediately to the south of us and<lb/>
      also in a number of the Provinces of the Domi-<lb/>
      nion, made its appearance at several points in<lb/>
      the Territories. Measures were taken to pre-<lb/>
      vent the spread of the disease and I am happy<lb/>
      to be able to inform you that it is being rapidly<lb/>
      stamped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great losses of crops annually caused by<lb/>
      hail storms, and the hitherto unsatisfactory<lb/>
      systems of hail insurance conducted as a private<lb/>
      enterprise,have led my Government to con-<lb/>
      sider the subject: and a measure will be sub-<lb/>
      mitted to you by which it is hoped an efective<lb/>
      and economical systemof insurance against<lb/>
      losses by hail, administered by the Government,<lb/>
      will be offered to those wishing to take advan-<lb/>
      tage of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be asked to consider a Bill to amend<lb/>
      and consolidate the law relating to Joint Stock<lb/>
      Companies, by which a more simple and inex-<lb/>
      pensive process of formation will be provided<lb/>
      and a more complete and comprehensive system<lb/>
      regulating companies and co-operative enter-<lb/>
      prises introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legislation will also be introduced having in<lb/>
      view the simplification of the law relating to the<lb/>
      establishment and conduct of rural school dis-<lb/>
      tricts and the method of assessment therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desirability of the readjustment of the<lb/>
      basis upon which the Legislative grants in aid<lb/>
      of schools are at present made will be generally<lb/>
      recognised, and propositions relating to this<lb/>
      subject willbe submitted to you during the<lb/>
      Session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your attention will be directed to a Bill en-<lb/>
      larging the scope of the Public Works Depart-<lb/>
      ment by providing means whereby roads at<lb/>
      <cb/>
      present impassable may beimproved by a<lb/>
      system of drainage works, as well as simplify-<lb/>
      ing and cheapening the manner of dealing with<lb/>
      the vexed question of roadways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mesures will be submitted for your consider-<lb/>
      ation amending the law respecting Steam<lb/>
      Boilers,Liquor Licences, the Administration of<lb/>
      Civil Justice, Villages and Local Improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      A statement of the Receipts and Expenditures<lb/>
      of the past year will be laid before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Estimates for the current year have been<lb/>
      prepared with due regard to the rapid growth<lb/>
      and increased necessities of the Territories.
    </p>
   <p>
     Gentlement of the Legislative Assembly-
   </p>
    <p>
      To these and all other measures which may<lb/>
      be brought before you I woudl sk your earnest<lb/>
      consideration, in full confidence that under the<lb/>
      Divine guidance your labours will have bene-<lb/>
      ficial results and advance the proserity of the<lb/>
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short sojourn in the Speak­<lb/>
      er's room the Lieut.-Governor depart­<lb/>
      ed, amid a flourish of trumpets. Com­<lb/>
      missioner, Perry and all time officers of<lb/> 
      the North-West Mounted Police at<lb/>
      present in Regina were present in full<lb/>
      uniform, and the whole scene was one<lb/>
      of gaiety and animation.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
    Immediately at the close of the cere­<lb/>
    mony Speaker Eakin took the chair<lb/>
    and business began. Mr. A. L. Sifton<lb/>
    and Mr. R. S. Lake were introduced,<lb/>
    having been re-elected. Mr. R. B.<lb/>
    Bennett and the successful candi­<lb/>
    date at the Moose Jaw by-elec­<lb/>
    tion, have not yet arrived.<lb/> 
    Premier Hauſtain then introduced a<lb/> 
    formal bill for ºn; legal and<lb/>
    constitutional questions. It was de­<lb/>
    cided to take the speech into considera­<lb/>
    tion on Monday, and a select com­<lb/>
    mittee was appointed to prepare a list<lb/> 
    of standing committees. Hon. G. H. V<lb/>
    Bulyea laid on the table particulars of<lb/>
    the parliamentary appropriation for<lb/>
    the year and also a copy of the corres-<lb/>
    pondence with the Dominion govern-<lb/>
    ment relating to the status and finan-<lb/>
    cial position of the Territories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The House then adjourned and the</p>
    members proceeded to Government</p>
    House to call on Madam Forget.
