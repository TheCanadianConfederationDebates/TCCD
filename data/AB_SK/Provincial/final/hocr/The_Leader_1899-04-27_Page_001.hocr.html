    <p>
      THE BUDGET
    </p>
    <p>
      The budget was brought down in the<lb/>
      Legislature on Tuesday of this week.<lb/>
      In a later issue there will be publish-<lb/>
      ed in THE LEADER, as in former years,<lb/>
      a fairly full report of the Budget De-<lb/>
      bate in the Assembly. This week we<lb/>
      can give only a cursory glance at the<lb/>
      speech of the Territorial Teasurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. ROSS in making his first budget<lb/>
      statement spoke nearly two and a half<lb/>
      hours. In the latter part of the speech,<lb/>
      after he had finished the dry details<lb/>
      of the estimates and when dealing with<lb/>
      the question of the future of these Ter-<lb/>
      ritories, Mr. Ross spoke with a fluency<lb/>
      and eloquence which he had never be-<lb/>
      fore exhibited on the floor of the<lb/>
      House. His announcement of the view<lb/>
      of the Government on the question of<lb/>
      the proper method of approaching the<lb/>
      problem confronting the country—the<lb/>
      problem of provincial establishment-<lb/>
      was highly important and notable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hon. the Treasurer gave a hur-<lb/>
      ried revierw of the financial history of<lb/>
      the Assembly and its forerunner, the<lb/>
      old North-West Council. The first fi-<lb/>
      nancial statement presented in the Ter-<lb/>
      ritories was made in 1878, showing a<lb/>
      revenue of $526 and no expenditure.<lb/>
      The next year, 1879, revenue had fallen<lb/>
      off to $25 and expenditure risen to<lb/>
      $237,37. In 1879 the first federal grant<lb/>
      was drawn and in that year the reven-<lb/>
      ue from all sources was $20,000. In<lb/>
      1886-87-lastyear of the Council-the<lb/>
      total appropriations were $85,578; 1888<lb/>
      (first year of Legislature)-$105,000.<lb/>
      The following is a summary of Domin-<lb/>
      ion grants in various years since 1891:<lb/>
      1891-92 - $195,700; '93-'94 - $199,200;<lb/>
      '94-'95 - $225,000; '95-'96 - $267,000 (in-<lb/>
      cluding $25,000 for relief); '96-'97 - $242,-<lb/>
      879; '97-'98 - $282,879. In these latter<lb/>
      years local revenues ranged from $20-<lb/>
      000 in 1892 to $30,000 in 1897, and for the<lb/>
      present year are estaimted at $49,000.<lb/>
      The estiamted revenue for the present<lb/>
      year includes: Balance from last year,<lb/>
      $71,745; Dominion grant for Peace<lb/>
      River road, $10,000, federal grant $282,-<lb/>
      979; local revenues $49,406. The Gov-<lb/>
      ernment hopes that the federal grant<lb/>
      may be increased but cannot anticipate<lb/>
      the Dominion supply bill for the year.<lb/>
      The sum asked from Ottawa is $535,000.<lb/>
      Mr. Ross went into a very full explan-<lb/>
      ation of the Estimates, the main items<lb/>
      of which appear above. One pleasing<lb/>
      statement made was that the C.P.R.<lb/>
      Co. has agreed to give free transporta-<lb/>
      tion to Territorial public works officers,<lb/>
      which wil enable the public works vote<lb/>
      to go much farther than it otherwise<lb/>
      woiuld. The item of $10,000 for Peace<lb/>
      River road is an amount paid by order<lb/>
      in council from the Dominion Govern-<lb/>
      ment, the sum being entrusted by the<lb/>
      Dominion Public Works Department<lb/>
      to the Territorial department for ex-<lb/>
      penditure on the road. While elector-<lb/>
      al boundary lines are not regardedin<lb/>
      apportionment of moneys now, yet the<lb/>
      great natural divisions are kept in<lb/>
      view. On public works there were ex-<lb/>
      pended last year in Northern Alberta<lb/>
      $36,000, Southern Alberta $49,000, Wes-<lb/>
      tern Assiniboia, $39,000; Eastern As-<lb/>
      siniboia, $51,000; Saskatchewan, $38,-<lb/>
      000. After expaining the estimates,<lb/>
      Mr. Ross dealt with the position of the<lb/>
      Territories financially, and made a<lb/>
      statement of what the Government be-<lb/>
      lieved shoudl be presented in the way<lb/>
      of a constitutional proposition. There<lb/>
      could be no question, he said, but that<lb/>
      the federal grant of $282,979 was totally<lb/>
      inadequate. The Government had this<lb/>
      year asked $535,000, the amount deem-<lb/>
      <cb/>
      ed necessary for the ordinary services<lb/>
      dealt with by the Assembly. When<lb/>
      considering any proposition for provin-<lb/>
      cial establishment it has to be remem-<lb/>
      bered that those services did not em-<lb/>
      brace all the services which as a pro-<lb/>
      vince we should be obliged to bear. In<lb/>
      addition to the grant to the Assembly<lb/>
      Parliament votes for Lieut.-Governor's<lb/>
      ofice $5,880; incidental justice $2,000;<lb/>
      land titles offices $15,000; insane<lb/>
      patients, $50,000; schools in unorgan-<lb/>
      ised territory, $2,000-these items made<lb/>
      up the vote for North-West Govern-<lb/>
      ment. Besides there were voted items<lb/>
      of $40,000 for administration of justice;<lb/>
      $2,500 for sheriffs; $15,000 for jails; $7,-<lb/>
      000 for agricultural societies; $5,000<lb/>
      direct vote besides other assistance to<lb/>
      creameries. Then there would be at<lb/>
      least a proportion of the immigration<lb/>
      expenditure; the expenditure on<lb/>
      court houses has always been<lb/>
      borne by the Dominion; there would<lb/>
      be some expenditure for law and order.<lb/>
      While no one could contend that the<lb/>
      Mounted Police vote was a provincial<lb/>
      expenditure, yet as a province we<lb/>
      woiuld have to bear expenditure for<lb/>
      law and order as do the provinces.<lb/>
      The computation showed that to-day<lb/>
      Parliament was voting about $550,000<lb/>
      for provincial services in the Terri-<lb/>
      tories-a sum far short of the require-<lb/>
      ments, as instead of the item of $282,-<lb/>
      979 granted to the Assembly he had<lb/>
      shown that there was need for, and<lb/>
      the Government had asked for, $535,-<lb/>
      000; which meant that local services<lb/>
      in the Territories to-day demanded an<lb/>
      annual expenditure of $800,000.<lb/>
      This being the case it was wel<lb/>
      to look and see where we would<lb/>
      land if the course was followed<lb/>
      which some were advocating.<lb/>
      Manitoba's subsidy was made up as<lb/>
      follows: Per capita grant of 80 cents a<lb/>
      head; $50,000 for government; 100,-<lb/>
      000 in lieu of lands; and interest on<lb/>
      capital account computed at $32 per<lb/>
      head of population. On such a basis<lb/>
      the Territories would receive say:<lb/>
      $120,000 per capita grant; $50,000 for<lb/>
      government; then on capital account<lb/>
      for argument's sake place the principal<lb/>
      at $3,250,000 (although he might say<lb/>
      that we were already charged with<lb/>
      $3,000,000 on this account) which would<lb/>
      give $162,500; we have about four and<lb/>
      a half times Manitoba's area of land,<lb/>
      and shoudl therefore receive say $400,-<lb/>
      000 on that account. This made a<lb/>
      total of $732,500,-and remember this<lb/>
      would be a fixed amount, incapable of<lb/>
      enlargement. Alraedy the Assembly<lb/>
      was asking $535,000, and Parliament<lb/>
      was appropriating over $200,000 a year<lb/>
      for local services besides. In view of<lb/>
      these figures was there any man wil-<lb/>
      ling to believe that an arrangement on<lb/>
      Manitoba' basis would be a good bar-<lb/>
      gain for the Territories to make? That<lb/>
      bargain once made, and the country<lb/>
      would be in the position tha tno in-<lb/>
      crease could be got in the way of sub-<lb/>
      sidy except on the 80 cents per capita<lb/>
      provision up to a certain limit.<lb/>
      Would anyone say that such a bar-<lb/>
      gain would satisfy the needs of the<lb/>
      Territories, even if the amounts<lb/>
      he had named could be got,-<lb/>
      and it was more than likely<lb/>
      that there woudul be difficulty in ob-<lb/>
      taining so mcuh as he ahd computed<lb/>
      on that basis. The bargain would be<lb/>
      just about sufficient for present needs;<lb/>
      but in five years, with any influx of<lb/>
      population, we would be in a position<lb/>
      that we might very well turn to a<lb/>
      method that the House had heard<lb/>
      something of, namely, commence bor-<lb/>
      rowing. The Government believed that<lb/>
      it was not needed to make that kind of<lb/>
      a bargain; they believed the Territories<lb/>
      shoudl demand the accounting by the<lb/>
      Dominion of the whole land area ex-<lb/>
      cepting those portions homesteaded.<lb/>
      They believed that we wereentitled to<lb/>
      possession of all the public lands, and<lb/>
      more than that, they believed that an<lb/>
      accounting shoudl be made for the<lb/>
      lands which had been given awayor<lb/>
      alienated,-given for railways some of<lb/>
      which were not built in the Territories.<lb/>
      Those lands alienated had been given<lb/>
      by Dominion vote for Dominionpur-<lb/>
      poses. Land was practicaly the only<lb/>
      revenue producing asset which a pro-<lb/>
      vince could have-an asset which grew<lb/>
      in value with the growth of population,<lb/>
      -the only asset capable of maintain-<lb/>
      ing an equilibrium between revenue<lb/>
      and expenditure. Mr. Ross made a<lb/>
      computation of the lands. There was<lb/>
      altogether 300,000 square miles; 190,-<lb/>
      000,000 acres. One-half this area-<lb/>
      the even-numbered sections-were set<lb/>
      apart for homesteading; calculating<lb/>
      pre-emptions, one-qurter of the one-<lb/>
      half, gave 120,000,000 acres. Then 35,-<lb/>
      000,000 acres had been given away as<lb/>
      subsidies to railways. It was fair to<lb/>
      argue that those 35,000,000 acres had<lb/>
      been used in lieu of Dominion cash.<lb/>
      In Canada about $200,000,000 has been<lb/>
      spent in subsidies to railways, and<lb/>
      these land subsidies shoudl be con-<lb/>
      sidered in the same light as cash sub-<lb/>
      sidie-federal payments for federal<lb/>
      purposes, and when local resources are<lb/>
      used for federal purposes the province<lb/>
      or the territory whose resources are<lb/>
      thus taken shoudl be given credit.<lb/>
      This principle was accepted in British<lb/>
      Columbia. The Dominion required<lb/> 
      land in that province for raiway pur-<lb/>
      poses,-and had to buy it. The Domi-<lb/>
      nion took a 29-mile strip of rocks in<lb/>
      British Columbia, the price being a<lb/>
      capitalisation yielding $100,000 a year,<lb/>
      which is the amount paid on account<lb/>
      of the land yearly by Parliament to<lb/>
      <cb/>
      British Columbia. So if $35,000,000<lb/>
      acres of our lands have been taken for<lb/>
      railway purposes, the price should be<lb/>
      capitalised for our benefit. One dollar<lb/>
      an acre would be a low rate for these<lb/>
      lands, and it would be fair to ask that<lb/>
      interest be paid by Parliament to<lb/>
      the Territories on a capital account<lb/>
      of $35,000,000 on account of lands so<lb/>
      alienated. That would give a revenue<lb/>
      of $1,000,000 a year. (Cheers.)Then<lb/>
      there was the 35,000,000 acres not alien-<lb/>
      ated, and whichshould be handed to<lb/>
      the Territories. Set apart 35,000,000<lb/>
      acres of that which probably the feder-<lb/>
      al government could properly claim<lb/>
      represented the cost of having survey-<lb/>
      ed and administered the lands, and<lb/>
      there was left 50,000,000 acres to be<lb/>
      taken by the Territories as a revenue<lb/>
      producing asset, a tangible capital ac-<lb/>
      count, which would grow in value with<lb/>
      every cent's expenditure, which would<lb/>
      be made more valuable by every dollar's<lb/>
      expenditure on schools, on road im-<lb/>
      provements, on any and every provin-<lb/>
      cialobject. As population increased<lb/>
      that asset would increase in value, be-<lb/>
      cause the law of supply and demand<lb/>
      governed the price of land as every-<lb/>
      thing else. So as our needs grew, our<lb/>
      revenue would also grow. This was<lb/>
      the class of proposition that this Gov-<lb/>
      ernment proposed to the people of the<lb/>
      Territories. (Cheers.) When they<lb/>
      asked for provincial establishment<lb/>
      they would certainly ask for the power<lb/>
      to borrow; they woudl want every<lb/>
      power possessed by any province, but<lb/>
      he trusted that the day woudl be far<lb/>
      distant when this country woudl need<lb/>
      to resort to the use of the power<lb/>
      to borrow. The resources of the coun-<lb/>
      try were such that there should be no<lb/>
      need to brorrow at least during the time<lb/>
      of the members of that House. The<lb/>
      above was the proposition which the<lb/>
      Government woudl ask the people to<lb/>
      consider. The House had no mandate<lb/>
      to make a bargain, but the time had<lb/>
      come for a change, and it was the duty<lb/>
      of public men to seek to educate the<lb/>
      people and to interest the people in the<lb/>
      subject. Every man in the House<lb/>
      and country shoudl stand shoulder to<lb/>
      shoulder on the pricniple, the justice<lb/>
      of the Territorial claim. The lines be-<lb/>
      tween Grit and Tory should be obliter-<lb/>
      ated for the time being until the Do-<lb/>
      minion be brought to admit the prin-<lb/>
      ciple that those lands were ours. It<lb/>
      was the duty of our representtives in<lb/>
      Parliament to act in concert on this<lb/>
      question, which was the most momen-<lb/>
      tous that could engage their attention<lb/>
      during this term.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the evening session Dr. Brett,<lb/>
      leader of the Opposition, made a two<lb/>
      hours' speech. His criticism of the<lb/>
      Estimates was mild. He had no ob-<lb/>
      jection to urge against any of the<lb/>
      items, but urged that someof the pu-<lb/>
      lic works sums, to be voted in bulk,<lb/>
      should have been itemised,as has been<lb/>
      one here in former years and is done<lb/>
      in all other legislatures. He contend-<lb/>
      ed that the House might reasonably<lb/>
      expect thatby this time the Agricul-<lb/>
      ture Department woudl have some-<lb/>
      thing to show forits expense, but he<lb/>
      failed to discover anything done. He<lb/>
      held that the Government should do<lb/>
      something to encourage immigration,<lb/>
      whereas they appeared to be anxious<lb/>
      to discourage immigration in alleged<lb/>
      proof of which assertion he read the<lb/>
      letterfrom Mr. Ross to the Regina<lb/>
      Board of Trade respecting application<lb/>
      for a well auger, appearing in THE<lb/>
      LEADER last week. The Government's<lb/>
      proposition respecting the provincial<lb/>
      question-the demand for the lands-<lb/>
      Dr. Brett declared the wildest freak<lb/>
      of imagination ever heard placed<lb/>
      by a responsible minister of the crown<lb/>
      before a responsible assembly, and he<lb/>
      believed the proposition was made<lb/>
      simply to enable the Government to<lb/>
      dilly-dally and do nothing and thus<lb/>
      hold the support of those averse to<lb/>
      establishment, while at teh same time<lb/>
      appealing by teat alluring but ethereal<lb/>
      project to those sections of country<lb/>
      which demand advancement.

      Mr. Brown followed Dr. Brett in a<lb/>
      fluent and telling speech, pointing out<lb/>
      the weakness of Dr. Brett's position<lb/>
      and urging that if the Government's<lb/>
      proposition in regard to public lands<lb/>
      was just, the public men of the Terri-<lb/>
      tories woudl be recreant to their trust<lb/>
      did they fail to make every endeavor<lb/>
      to establish the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Mr. Meyers had spoken briefly,<lb/>
      commending on the whole the Govern-<lb/>
      ment's policy, there was a long pause.<lb/>
      Ultimately,
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ross arose and said if no other<lb/>
      member wished to speak he would<lb/>
      close the debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Patrick then took the floor. On<lb/>
      the establishment question Dr. Patrick<lb/>
      held that two future provinces should<lb/>
      be now mapped out, their bounds de-<lb/>
      termined, and for the time being their<lb/>
      legislation and government be carried<lb/>
      on by one legislature and government;<lb/>
      -in effect, a legislative union such as<lb/>
      prevailed in Upper and Lower Canada<lb/>
      from 1841 to 1867. These future pro-<lb/>
      vinces might remain for some time as<lb/>
      a territory and still obtain and exercise<lb/>
      the powers of borrowing-in fact all<lb/>
      provincial powers, except that their<lb/>
      legislation would be subject as now to<lb/>
      the Governor General in Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      After another long pause, the motion<lb/>
      that the House resolve into Committee<lb/>
      of Supply was put and carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure of Mr. Bennett to join in<lb/>
      the debate was a cause of general sur-<lb/>
      prise, and the conviction prevails that<lb/>
      the Government's proposition took the<lb/>
      wind so completely out of Mr. Ben-<lb/>
      nett's sails that he recognized himself<lb/>
      as being hopelessly at sea.
