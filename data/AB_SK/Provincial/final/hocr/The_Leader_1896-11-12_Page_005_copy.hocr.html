<p>SECESSION<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  (Continued from page 4)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  MR. INSINGER<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  (Yorkton) remarked that certain reasons<lb/>
  were given a week or more ago by the<lb/>
  hon. member for Moose Jaw (Mr. Ross)<lb/>
  why it was necessary to reconsider their<lb/>
  position with regard to their constitution-<lb/>
  al status. It was stated that their powers<lb/>
  were not sufficient, and that the powers<lb/>
  they had been ostensibly given were in-<lb/>
  complete. The hon. member further<lb/>
  brought on the point which whould appeal<lb/>
  more strongly to the House, perhaps, than<lb/>
  anything else, that they should ask for<lb/>
  more money. That was a very tangible<lb/>
  question, and appealed not only to mem-<lb/>
  bers of that House but to every man in<lb/>
  this country. If they could in justice put<lb/>
  in a claim for more funds from the Do-<lb/>
  minion Parliament, if they could show<lb/>
  that the Territories were entitled to re-<lb/>
  ceive more from the Dominion treasury,<lb/>
  they would be remiss in their duty if they<lb/>
  did not make some kind of a claim. He<lb/>
  believed the present to be a favorable time<lb/>
  to reconsider their position. As early as<lb/>
  1885 they made a similar petition, but<lb/>
  then they hadn't the same knowledge nor<lb/>
  the same experiences of legislation. The<lb/>
  requests they then made were premature.<lb/>
  When they asked for responsibility in<lb/>
  1885 and 1888 they asked for something<lb/>
  that probably had they get it they would<lb/>
  not have been in a position to use. But<lb/>
  they had now been administering the<lb/>
  affairs of this country nearly as much as<lb/>
  any of the provinces, and he thought they<lb/>
  could claim to have administered those<lb/>
  affairs, with no discredit to themselves,<lb/>
  and quite as well as the affairs of any pro-<lb/>
  vince were administered. He therefore<lb/>
  thought they could put in a good claim,<lb/>
  with a good conscience, to the Dominion<lb/>
  Government for more powers and for more<lb/>
  funds. There was another reason why<lb/>
  to-day they were in a better position than<lb/>
  formerly. There had been a change of<lb/>
  Government on a certain date in June.<lb/>
  He did not want to say for a moment<lb/>
  that one side of the House was more fav-<lb/>
  orable to the Territories than the<lb/>
  other side, and it was well known that<lb/>
  many members of the present Govern<lb/>
  ment, when in opposition, made proposi-<lb/>
  tions to give the Territories more powers<lb/>
  than had been given them. Mr. Davies,<lb/>
  now a member of the Government at<lb/>
  Ottawa in 1893 declared that it was the<lb/>
  duty of the Government in amending the<lb/>
  North-West Territories Act to give them<lb/>
  certain rights wholesale,- not to quibble<lb/>
  about and take back with one hand what<lb/>
  they give with the other. He (Mr. In-<lb/>
  singer) - thought they could now go<lb/>
  to the Cabinet and remind its members of<lb/>
  certain statements made by them when in<lb/>
  opposition. They had now a member in<lb/>
  the House at Ottawa, who was more able<lb/>
  than any member they had had there be<lb/>
  fore, to present the claims of the Territo-<lb/>
  ries before Parliament. He referred to<lb/>
  Mr. Oliver. It was not only his ability,<lb/>
  but by his long experience he was better<lb/>
  posted on the requirements of this coun<lb/>
  try, on their laws and general constitu<lb/>
  tional standing, than perhaps any other<lb/>
  member of that House. Then, too, he<lb/>
  was with the Territories on the present<lb/>
  question. 'But to proceed. A certain<lb/>
  day was appointed to draft a memorial to<lb/>
  consider the matter and to bring in a re-<lb/>
  port accordingly. The mover of the mo-<lb/>
  tion (Mr. Ross) made a speech in which<lb/>
  he laid down the lines in which he thought<lb/>
  the House should restrict itself in asking<lb/>
  for Territorial autonomy, and he gave his<lb/>
  reasons therefor. Every one in the<lb/>
  House thought they were in unison with<lb/>
  the expressions of the hon. member for<lb/>
  Moose Jaw. These members who it now<lb/>
  seemed were not kept silent and by their<lb/>
  silence assented in the expressions of the<lb/>
  hon. member for Moose Jaw. But as<lb/>
  soon as the committee met it was found<lb/>
  that that unanimity did not remain, and<lb/>
  from many parts came different opinions<lb/>
  upon the subject. He was not sorry that<lb/>
  that was so. It was made apparent there<lb/>
  were three possible propositions that<lb/>
  could be laid before the House. One<lb/>
  was to make one province of the whole of<lb/>
  the Territories and ask for full provincial<lb/>
  rights. Another proposition was to<lb/>
  divide the country into more than one<lb/>
  province, and make one province of Al-<lb/>
  berta; the third proposition was to ask<lb/>
  that the powers they already had should<lb/>
  be completed and put beyond doubt, and<lb/>
  ask for more money, - or Territorial auto-<lb/>
  nomy. He did not intend to follow the<lb/>
  hon. member and calculations, because he<lb/>
  simply couldn't. He did not think it<lb/>
  possible to follow the hon. gentleman into<lb/>
  anything that went to the bottom of his<lb/>
  heart, and that touched his sensibilities<lb/>
  keenly, because then his imagination ran<lb/>
  a little wild. The hon. gentleman at first<lb/>
  seemed to be under the impression that I<lb/>
  was rather premature to ask provincial<lb/>
  rights, but he blossomed slowly out into a<lb/>
  champion for provincial rights of the<lb/>
  Territories, and then he bloomed right<lb/>
  out into a champion for Alberta being<lb/>
  made into a province. He based his<lb/>
  claim on the consideration of the local<lb/>
  revenues; that a very large part came<lb/>
  from Alberta, and a very small part went<lb/>
  to Alberta. He showed that they had<lb/>
  more liquor drunk in Alberta, and that<lb/>
  there were more criminals in Alberta, and<lb/>
  that there were more people contributing<lb/>
  to the local revenue in Alberta by means<lb/>
  of fines.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Brett: What I did point out was<lb/>
  this, that the greater amount contributed<lb/>
  by fines came from the rest of the Terri-<lb/>
  tories. Out of about $400, only $40 came<lb/>
  from Alberta.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Insinger was very glad to hear the<lb/>
  disclaimer by the hon. gentleman. There<lb/>
  was more hope for Alberta than the hon.<lb/>
  member had given hope for. It struck<lb/>
  him (Mr. Insinger) as a very peculiar<lb/>
  claim that Alberta should be held out by<lb/>
  one of its representatives as being a place<lb/>
  where more liquor was drunk than any-<lb/>
  where else. Then the hon. member<lb/>
  pointed to the schools. Certainly it was<lb/>
  a very strange claim to put forward that<lb/>
  Alberta was a more ignorant place than<lb/>
  any other part of the Territories. (Laugh-<lb/>
  ter.) The hon. gentleman had shown<lb/>
  that population had it creased in Alberta,<lb/>
  and he must know that the establishment<lb/>
  of schools would always be a few years<lb/>
  behind the incoming of the population.<lb/>
  So if the hon. member would only rest his<lb/>
  soul in patience, say for a year or so, he<lb/>
  (Mr. Insinger) had sufficient confidence in<lb/>
  the intelligence of the people of Alberta<lb/>
  to believe they would have the full num-<lb/>
  ber of schools, and that they would before<lb/>
  long make a full drain upon the Territo-<lb/>
  rial resources for payment of schools.<lb/>
  Another claim for the autonomy of Al-<lb/>
  berta was made on the ground of popula-<lb/>
  tion. The hon. member went into points<lb/>
  which he clearly did not understand, and<lb/>
  the parts he did understand he clearly<lb/>
  did not comprehend. (Laughter.) Any<lb/>
  body who knew Alberta knew what the<lb/>
  hon. member for Banff ought to know,<lb/>
  <cb/>
  but did not seem to know, namely, that<lb/>
  in Alberta, they had special immigration<lb/>
  in the years 1891-94, and that that special<lb/>
  immigration there is not going on now.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Brett: It is going on yet.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Insinger: It may be going on, but<lb/>
  if so, it is a very silent trend. What we<lb/>
  hear is only the rumbling of the wheels,<lb/>
  as it were, of the people who are going<lb/>
  out. (Laughter.) Still he believed there<lb/>
  always would be a certain number of peo-<lb/>
  ple going into Alberta, but the calculation<lb/>
  made by the hon. member was utterly<lb/>
  wrong, and he knew it, or he ought to<lb/>
  know it. He must know that on the build-<lb/>
  ing of the colonization railroad there was<lb/>
  a large influx of population, and that that<lb/>
  influx had stopped. So the large increase<lb/>
  shown to have taken place then had not<lb/>
  continued. Then the hon. member ought<lb/>
  to know, and he did know, that of the in-<lb/>
  crease of population that went in during<lb/>
  those few years quite a number had gone<lb/>
  out, and the hon. member did know that<lb/>
  the population of Alberta had not in<lb/>
  creased in the same ratio in the last few<lb/>
  years as it had increased before. He (Mr.<lb/>
  Insinger) must therefore refuse to believe<lb/>
  any conclusions based on the hon. mem-<lb/>
  ber ought not to make claims for rights<lb/>
  from the Dominion Parliament based on<lb/>
  figures which he knew were belied by<lb/>
  facts. Were the Assembly to allow that<lb/>
  to be done, it would make them the<lb/>
  laughing stock of the whole country.<lb/>
  When the hon. member speaks about the<lb/>
  development of industries, he must know<lb/>
  that in one large Territory they had more<lb/>
  industries, and of course larger chances of<lb/>
  development and would have more power<lb/>
  of development, and would have more<lb/>
  credit for their developments than any<lb/>
  particular portion of it would have. He<lb/>
  did not want to create an impression in<lb/>
  the mind of the hon. member that he<lb/>
  (the speaker) did not fully realize the<lb/>
  great importance and richness of Alberta.<lb/>
  There was no doubt that it was one of the<lb/>
  fairest parts they had, but that was not a<lb/>
  sufficient reason why it should be separat<lb/>
  ed from the rest of the Territories. In-<lb/>
  deed it was a very good reason it should<lb/>
  stay in with the rest. But really the<lb/>
  point upon which the hon. member put<lb/>
  the most stress was because of his, well,<lb/>
  call it sentimental reason; - the senti-<lb/>
  mental reason that the idea in the minds of<lb/>
  intending immigrants was that the Terri-<lb/>
  tories was a country of continual snow.<lb/>
  How a territory should create an impres-<lb/>
  sion of snow he could not see, but he did<lb/>
  know that Alberta would create an im-<lb/>
  pression of snow upon the mountains in<lb/>
  the mind of anyone who knew anything<lb/>
  about it. Why did not the territories in<lb/>
  the United States create an impression<lb/>
  of snow in the United States? There was<lb/>
  this difference between the territories, and<lb/>
  it was to our advantage, - that this side the<lb/>
  border the Territories had the rights of<lb/>
  provinces, and on the other side the Ter-<lb/>
  ritories had not the rights of the states.<lb/>
  But if there really was anything in the<lb/>
  sentimental, and the main, reason of the<lb/>
  hon. gentleman, and if it would act as a<lb/>
  balm to soothe the wounds of his bleeding<lb/>
  heart, he (Mr. Insinger) saw no reason<lb/>
  why the conceding so small a thing as the<lb/>
  change of a name should not be granted.<lb/>
  He did not object to have the name<lb/>
  "Territories" taken away, and to calling<lb/>
  the whole of this country Alberta. If any<lb/>
  little thing like that would satisfy the<lb/>
  hon. gentleman he would have no more<lb/>
  objection to the Territories being tacked<lb/>
  on to Alberta than he would to Alberta be-<lb/>
  ing tacked on to the Territories. (Hear,<lb/>
  hear.) By that, sentiment might be ap-<lb/>
  peased and the hon. gentleman's heart<lb/>
  by at rest for a little time. He<lb/>
  (Mr. Insinger) had never yet met the immi-<lb/>
  grant who was scared from coming into<lb/>
  this country because it was a<lb/>
  Territory. He found as a rule<lb/>
  that when people came to this coun-<lb/>
  try they knew very little about it at all.<lb/>
  They knew that they came to America, and<lb/>
  if they were very clever they knew they<lb/>
  were coming to Canada, and that was<lb/>
  about the extent of their knowledge. He<lb/>
  was sorry the hon. member stated an<lb/>
  amendment might be brought in, but that<lb/>
  he was not going to bring it in now. This<lb/>
  was the proper time to bring in any<lb/>
  amendment if the amendment was draft<lb/>
  ed, for really, to give "home rule" to Al-<lb/>
  berta was an amendment which attacked<lb/>
  the principle of the memorial. The mem-<lb/>
  orial was drafted for the distinct purpose<lb/>
  of obtaining Territorial autonomy and<lb/>
  would not fit on to a province of Alberta.<lb/>
  It would certainly expedite matters if the<lb/>
  hon. member for Banff would bring on<lb/>
  his amendment in the full House. It<lb/>
  showed a certain amount of want of cour-<lb/>
  age in not bringing his amendment down<lb/>
  to the full House when particularly asked<lb/>
  by the mover of the memorial to do so.<lb/>
  If it was meant that by becoming a pro-<lb/>
  vince they should have the right of char<lb/>
  tering railways, that was a matter for<lb/>
  serious consideration. The hon. member<lb/>
  for Banff had spoken about making a con-<lb/>
  tract, or bargain, with the Dominion<lb/>
  Government. On going to the Domin-<lb/>
  ion Government, say they made a<lb/>
  contract, and a contract was supposed to<lb/>
  be binding. For the hon. member<lb/>
  to say they could enter into a contract<lb/>
  and consider the contract would only bind<lb/>
  the other side simply showed that the<lb/>
  hon. member did not know what the<lb/>
  word "contract" meant. The question<lb/>
  was, were they sufficiently strong to go<lb/>
  into the position to make a full contract,<lb/>
  and if they had the full power to make<lb/>
  these demands? Unless they had suffi-<lb/>
  cient interest at Ottawa to enforce their<lb/>
  side of the question they would, to use a<lb/>
  vernacular expression, "get left" on the<lb/>
  contract. They had only four members<lb/>
  at present, although they might have five<lb/>
  in a short time. Were the Territories in<lb/>
  a position to fight all the other parts of<lb/>
  Canada, because fight they must. Would<lb/>
  the Parliament at Ottawa give them full<lb/>
  consideration for the large amount of pub-<lb/>
  lic lands which had been taken from them<lb/>
  for the general benefit of Canada? The<lb/>
  Parliament at Ottawa would simply give<lb/>
  what they thought proper, and not what<lb/>
  the Territories wanted. More than 30<lb/>
  millions of acres had been taken away<lb/>
  from the Territories for the C.P.R.<lb/>
  Could they put a price on that land? A<lb/>
  great part of that land at present had no<lb/>
  value. If this country developed, - as<lb/>
  it had, slowly it was true, but it had de-<lb/>
  veloped, - surely that land would get a<lb/>
  larger value, and the Territories would be<lb/>
  in a better position a few years hence to<lb/>
  make a demand for compensation better<lb/>
  than they were now ; and if they did<lb/>
  make a demand now they would get left.<lb/>
  Rather than that he would possess his<lb/>
  soul in patience a few years longer.<lb/>
  Reference had been made to the position<lb/>
  of Manitoba at the time it entered into<lb/>
  confederation. The Territories were not<lb/>
  in the same position as was Manitoba.<lb/>
  Manitoba was not made a province be<lb/>
  cause the people there wanted or liked it.<lb/>
  They were simply made a province because<lb/>
  they were compelled to ; it was through<lb/>
  necessity. And when they wanted to<lb/>
  make a change in a few years<lb/>
  they found it would cost them a<lb/>
  rebellion nearly to shake off their con-<lb/>
  tract and make a new one. The Terri-<lb/>
  tories were not forced by force of circum-<lb/>
  stances. When they went into a province<lb/>
  <cb/>
  they would do it with a free will, and with<lb/>
  power to make contracts which would be<lb/>
  binding upon their heirs forever. Con-<lb/>
  sidering the lands here would have an<lb/>
  enormous value in a few years, and con-<lb/>
  sidering that if they were to put a price<lb/>
  upon those lands now they would be do-<lb/>
  ing a great injustice to the people who are<lb/>
  to come after; when they considered their<lb/>
  position, that they were not able to force<lb/>
  their claims, he thought they should halt<lb/>
  before entering into a binding contract.<lb/>
  The hon. member seemed to think - and<lb/>
  perhaps many people had expressed simi-<lb/>
  lar opinions - that as soon as a province<lb/>
  was formed the revenue at once fell in,<lb/>
  be he (Mr. Insinger) did not know<lb/>
  from where. Probably from the sky, or<lb/>
  some other place equally remote. The<lb/>
  estimated revenue for the province of<lb/>
  Manitoba last year was $800,000. The<lb/>
  idea of having a province was to develop.<lb/>
  If they wanted to go into the developing<lb/>
  business they had to get the money, and<lb/>
  the whole thing hinged upon the fact that<lb/>
  when they became a province it would<lb/>
  give them more money. He did not<lb/>
  think that was the fact. If the hon.<lb/>
  member would look up the revenues of<lb/>
  Manitoba he would find that the estimat-<lb/>
  ed revenue consisted in the first place of a<lb/>
  Dominion grant of $50,000. So far as<lb/>
  the Dominion grant was concerned the<lb/>
  Territories were making a claim for some<lb/>
  similar consideration. On that ground,<lb/>
  therefore, the province was in no better<lb/>
  position than the Territories. In the<lb/>
  next place the Manitoba revenue consist-<lb/>
  ed of the magnificent sum of $6,000 local<lb/>
  revenues. These were the the same local<lb/>
  revenues as the Territories could levy<lb/>
  with the exception of a law stamp levy,<lb/>
  which brought in $12,000. The Territories<lb/>
  however, could bring in similar legislation<lb/>
  to provide for the same purposes, but up<lb/>
  to the present they had not thought fit to<lb/>
  do so. The balance of those revenues was<lb/>
  made up of fees which were not of par-<lb/>
  ticular benefit to a province. They found<lb/>
  that Manitoba as a province - and the<lb/>
  Territories would be in the same position<lb/>
  - did not increase their revenue by<lb/>
  one single cent on the amount they would<lb/>
  get as a territory. Therefore the province<lb/>
  had no advantage over a territory. The<lb/>
  hon. member for Banff had stated that in<lb/>
  British Columbia they had local taxation,<lb/>
  but they had no municipal taxation ; and<lb/>
  in Manitoba they had municipal taxation<lb/>
  but no provincial taxation. From that he<lb/>
  seemed to infer that they would be the<lb/>
  same as British Columbia. Surely the<lb/>
  hon. member must see that because Mani-<lb/>
  toba did not raise its money by provincial<lb/>
  taxation, and British Columbia raises its<lb/>
  money by a local taxation, that we could<lb/>
  do without either of them. But if the<lb/>
  Territories, as a province, went in for large<lb/>
  plans surely they must go in for some<lb/>
  taxation. Where was money to come<lb/>
  from ? Was it to come from heaven, or<lb/>
  from England, or where, and bring in<lb/>
  capital and they never pay interest on it ?<lb/>
  In Manitoba they had a local taxation for<lb/>
  the maintenance and building of their<lb/>
  Court houses, only they did not raise it<lb/>
  for the province, but divided it amongst<lb/>
  the municipalities, but after all it was ex-<lb/>
  actly the same thing as provincial tax-<lb/>
  ation. It was not necessary for the Terri<lb/>
  tories to go in for being made a province<lb/>
  in order to get what they were seeking ;<lb/>
  the same object could be obtained by go<lb/>
  ing in for territorial autonomy, and with<lb/>
  the distinct advantage that the demand<lb/>
  for larger Territorial powers was on the<lb/>
  face of it, not a contract, but only an<lb/>
  arrangement that would hold good for a<lb/>
  few years, or until such time as they<lb/>
  might want something else. Another<lb/>
  great advantage the asking for Territorial<lb/>
  autonomy would have over asking<lb/>
  the erection of a province, was<lb/>
  that they had a great deal more chance of<lb/>
  getting it. The hon. member for Banff<lb/>
  seemed to think that in politics by asking<lb/>
  for a great deal more than you expect<lb/>
  you would get a little. A mistake of<lb/>
  that kind was worse than a mistake. It<lb/>
  was simply prejudicing the whole case.<lb/>
  If they went to Ottawa and showed that<lb/>
  they asked for more than they expected,<lb/>
  that they were asking for what they did<lb/>
  not want ; if they went and asked for<lb/>
  things in the lump and did not know that<lb/>
  they had a distinct knowledge of the<lb/>
  items, he thought they ran a great chance<lb/>
  of getting nothing at all. Their principle<lb/>
  should be to go and ask for those things<lb/>
  in detail;- show why they wanted those<lb/>
  things, and prove that they really wanted<lb/>
  them. If they showed that they under-<lb/>
  stood what they wanted, and that they<lb/>
  knew how to handle it, they stood a very<lb/>
  good chance of getting it. He did not<lb/>
  believe in asking for a whole lot of things<lb/>
  in the chance of getting a little. He be-<lb/>
  lieved they should follow the lines laid<lb/>
  down in the memorial. In asking for<lb/>
  Territorial autonomy they did not ask for<lb/>
  the power to charter railways. The pow-<lb/>
  er of chartering railways was absolutely<lb/>
  useless to them unless they were in a posi-<lb/>
  tion to go and grant them the credit of a<lb/>
  country, and that they could not do.<lb/>
  Another power they did not ask for in<lb/>
  the memorial was the administration of<lb/>
  justice in criminal matters. That was a<lb/>
  point upon which a certain amount of<lb/>
  difference of opinion should be allowed.<lb/>
  He was inclined to ask that administration<lb/>
  of justice be given them, but it was found<lb/>
  there were certain very heavy charges<lb/>
  against the administration of justice, and<lb/>
  it would be foolish to take upon their<lb/>
  shoulders such a very large debt unless<lb/>
  there was a very good reason shown in<lb/>
  favor of it. In the memorial they asked<lb/>
  for certain amendments. First they ask-<lb/>
  ed that the powers which were given un-<lb/>
  der the North-West Territories Act, and<lb/>
  which were now subject to any Act of the<lb/>
  Parliament of Canada, should be secured<lb/>
  to the Assembly. That means that<lb/>
  the moment the Assembly had passed a<lb/>
  law in any subject some member of Par-<lb/>
  liament might turn round and make some<lb/>
  bill in which one clause perhaps affected<lb/>
  the Territories, and therefore put aside<lb/>
  their ordinance. They had been in such<lb/>
  danger several times. For instance there<lb/>
  was the Animals Infections Acts. They<lb/>
  had the same danger when they brought<lb/>
  into that House a bill regarding the in-<lb/>
  spection of coal mines. When they<lb/>
  brought in a bill respecting irrigation they<lb/>
  did not know whether they had power or<lb/>
  not to deal with the subject. The mem-<lb/>
  orial asked that the powers they had, and<lb/>
  such other powers as they asked for,<lb/>
  should be given to them the same as to<lb/>
  any province in Canada. It was also<lb/>
  asked that the Executive Committee<lb/>
  should be changed for an Executive Coun-<lb/>
  cil. An Executive Council had all the<lb/>
  political precedents of England and Can-<lb/>
  ada to show it its way. An Executive<lb/>
  Committee never knew what it was at.<lb/>
  The memorial also asked that the Assem-<lb/>
  bly should have powers to incorporate<lb/>
  insurance companies; that the appoint-<lb/>
  ments of sheriffs and clerks should be put<lb/>
  in their hands ; and they asked for other<lb/>
  powers which would not be of any great<lb/>
  value to them, but it certainly would be<lb/>
  policy to have them. They made a claim<lb/>
  for more funds for the reasons that they<lb/>
  stood greatly in need of more money, and<lb/>
  that the Parliament of Canada was respon-<lb/>
  sible for the due administration of edu-<lb/>
  cation in this country; as long as they<lb/>
  were a territory and not a province the<lb/>
  Parliament of Canada was responsible for<lb/>
  <cb/>
  the full government of affairs in this coun-<lb/>
  try. They had also shown that if they be<lb/>
  allowed to make an analogy of what was<lb/>
  due to them, and what to the province,<lb/>
  they could show a very great claim for a<lb/>
  greater amount of money, but they did<lb/>
  not in the memorial want to base their<lb/>
  claim on that, and they did not want to<lb/>
  put a distinct figure on the subsidy they<lb/>
  might claim for compensation for lands.<lb/>
  He thought there were few occasions when<lb/>
  they, as a House, had to state their posi-<lb/>
  tion as a House, and when those occasions<lb/>
  did arise it was their duty to give unre-<lb/>
  servedly expression to their opinions, so<lb/>
  that not only the House but the country<lb/>
  should know exactly where they were.<lb/>
  He did not think it was their duty to<lb/>
  slowly follow public opinion, but to lead<lb/>
  public opinion. The Territories needed<lb/>
  more funds, and they had a right to more<lb/>
  funds. They contributed as much as any<lb/>
  province in Canada, and there was no<lb/>
  reason why other men in Canada should<lb/>
  be given fifty cents back out of every dol-<lb/>
  lar they contributed, while they of the<lb/>
  Territories should be sent back only<lb/>
  ten or fifteen cents of the dollar they con-<lb/>
  tributed. (Applause.)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  MR. MAGRATH.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  (Lethbridge) stated that as the hon. gen-<lb/>
  tleman who had just sat down had sugges-<lb/>
  ted there should be an amendment before<lb/>
  the House on the lines the hon. member<lb/>
  for Banff had spoken, he rose to propose<lb/>
  such an amendment, which was seconded<lb/>
  by the hon. member for Banff (Mr. Brett.)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  It was in connection with the following<lb/>
  clause of the memorial :- "The Assembly<lb/>
  is of opinion that to remedy this undesir-<lb/>
  able state of affairs it is not necessary to<lb/>
  have recourse to the granting of a full<lb/>
  provincial status. They believe that till<lb/>
  the time arrives, which may be at a not<lb/>
  distant day, when the Territories should<lb/>
  be taken into Confederation (as one or<lb/>
  more provinces) the passing of a few<lb/>
  amendments to the North-West Terri-<lb/>
  tories Act will allow them, subject to dis-<lb/>
  allowance of their ordinances, to exclus-<lb/>
  ively make laws in relation to matters al-<lb/>
  ready within their legislative jurisdic-<lb/>
  tion."<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Magrath said that according<lb/>
  to that clause they did not<lb/>
  appear to have fully made up their<lb/>
  minds as to whether that day was at an<lb/>
  early period or not. The next point was<lb/>
  as to whether they felt they "should be<lb/>
  taken into Confederation as one or more<lb/>
  provinces." The amendment he would<lb/>
  move simply meant that they should more<lb/>
  forcibly point out that it was the opinion<lb/>
  of the House that this country should be<lb/>
  taken into Confederation as two provinces<lb/>
  at a very early period, otherwise it did<lb/>
  not disturb the memorial in any matter<lb/>
  whatever. He did not follow the hon.<lb/>
  gentleman from Banff, but he did hear<lb/>
  the levity with which the hon. member<lb/>
  from Yorkton referred to Alberta.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Insinger : I didn't refer to Alber-<lb/>
  ta with any levity at all.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Magrath : I certainly accept the<lb/>
  hon. gentleman's view of the matter, but<lb/>
  it appeared to me in his referring to Al-<lb/>
  berta that he did do so, and that, subse-<lb/>
  quently, he made amends by asserting<lb/>
  that Alberta was after all one of the fair-<lb/>
  est provinces.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Insinger : I might have referred<lb/>
  to the views expressed by the hon. mem-<lb/>
  ber for Banff, but there is a difference be<lb/>
  tween the views expressed by the hon.<lb/>
  member for Banff respecting Alberta, and<lb/>
  Alberta itself.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Magrath : I am glad to hear the<lb/>
  explanation. I feel the time will come<lb/>
  when we must enter Confederation as a<lb/>
  province.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Page (Cannington) : As a province?<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Magrath: I say as a province. He<lb/>
  considered the interests in the Territories<lb/>
  were entirely different. In the west<lb/>
  they had to look to the west for their<lb/>
  trade, while in the east the trade was<lb/>
  largely diverted, or largely flowed towards<lb/>
  the east, and in that it appeared to him<lb/>
  there was a wide difference. As to being<lb/>
  created into a full province at the present<lb/>
  time he did not think it was desirable or<lb/>
  necessary. It was an unfortunate thing<lb/>
  in Canada to day, that they were over-<lb/>
  governed. (Hear, hear.) There were<lb/>
  too many institutions in Canada, but he<lb/>
  felt, if they thought their interests were<lb/>
  going to be different in this country, that<lb/>
  they should emphasize their views in re-<lb/>
  <cb/>
  lation to that so far as the creation of more<lb/>
  than one province was concerned.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Half past five having arrived Mr. Speak-<lb/>
  er left the chair, leaving the hon. gentle<lb/>
  man in possession of the floor.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The House re-assembled at eight o'clock.<lb/>
  In the greater part of the evening the<lb/>
  chair was occupied by Mr. Deputy Speak-<lb/>
  er Page, in the absence of the Speaker.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Magrath, resuming, said the ques-<lb/>
  tion for consideration was not a question<lb/>
  as to the importance of the memorial at<lb/>
  large; it was merely a question as to the<lb/>
  expression of opinion contained in one<lb/>
  clause of that memorial. He, and those<lb/>
  who held the same views as he did, wish-<lb/>
  ed to go further than the memorial.<lb/>
  There was the difference. They all agreed<lb/>
  that the time would come when the Ter-<lb/>
  ritories would be taken into Confederation<lb/>
  (hear, hear.) They were a unit on that.<lb/>
  (Hear, hear.) But it had occurred to<lb/>
  those who held the same opinions as him-<lb/>
  self that the memorial did not emphasize<lb/>
  that fact strongly enough. They had<lb/>
  never approached the Federal Government<lb/>
  on matters pertaining to the welfare of<lb/>
  this country that were conceded to them<lb/>
  when asked for. Were they going to wait<lb/>
  until the time had arrived when they<lb/>
  considered the time was ripe for the en-<lb/>
  tering of the Territories into Confeder-<lb/>
  ation before they brought the matter<lb/>
  strongly to the attention of the Federal<lb/>
  Government as they should ? He did not<lb/>
  think that was desirable. There had<lb/>
  been a good deal of talk about educating<lb/>
  the country. He thought they had some<lb/>
  education to do in reference to this mat-<lb/>
  ter. It was their duty to commence the<lb/>
  education, and commence it on vigorous<lb/>
  lines. He did not for a moment imagine<lb/>
  if they presented the memorial to the<lb/>
  Federal Government that it would be re-<lb/>
  ceived, and that they would be received<lb/>
  with open arms. He also thought that<lb/>
  they should bring the matter very forcibly<lb/>
  before the Government, not that he<lb/>
  thought they were going to have it grant-<lb/>
  ed, but that they might keep pressing it<lb/>
  from time to time. If they were satisfied<lb/>
  that the Federal Government would take<lb/>
  the memorial into consideration and act<lb/>
  upon it then he and his friends would sit<lb/>
  down. But their experience had been<lb/>
  otherwise, and for that reason they had<lb/>
  considered it necessary to draw attention<lb/>
  to that portion in one clause of it. There<lb/>
  was no diversity of opinion as to the main<lb/>
  point in that part of the amendment.<lb/>
  The next point he understood was they<lb/>
  considered that when the time did arrive<lb/>
  for the Territories to be taken into Con-<lb/>
  federation, that the section of the country<lb/>
  from which he and his friends came should<lb/>
  be set apart as a province. They did not<lb/>
  presume to try to educate the House as to<lb/>
  what should be done with the rest of the<lb/>
  Territories. That remained for the repre-<lb/>
  sentatives of the people of the balance of<lb/>
  the Territories. He thought he could<lb/>
  state confidently, that when the time had<lb/>
  arrived, the larger portion of Alberta<lb/>
  would be found a unit on that question.<lb/>
  (Hear, hear.) They had to bear in mind<lb/>
  that a portion of Alberta had already dis<lb/>
  cussed this matter. It had not been dis-<lb/>
  cussed in his section. From the discus-<lb/>
  sions that took place there was no ques-<lb/>
  tion in his mind that the people of that<lb/>
  section of country had stated positively<lb/>
  and emphatically that they wished to be<lb/>
  set apart as a province. As to the other<lb/>
  sections it was a matter of question. He<lb/>
  believed if Alberta was canvassed to-day<lb/>
  that they would vote against provincial<lb/>
  institutions. (Mr. Haultain : "Hear,<lb/>
  hear.") - because they were frightened, he<lb/>
  thought, largely from the fact that there<lb/>
  was no question but there was too much<lb/>
  government in Canada. (Hear, hear.) It<lb/>
  was hardly possible to walk down any by<lb/>
  alley without meeting someone who was<lb/>
  in the business. So people for that rea-<lb/>
  son, he considered, had just cause to feel<lb/>
  alarmed. But that did not alter the fact<lb/>
  that they were coming to it, that they had<lb/>
  got to come to it, and the question then<lb/>
  would be with the people of Alberta,<lb/>
  whether they wanted one or two provin-<lb/>
  ces. When that time came, he was posi-<lb/>
  tive that 90 per cent of the people of Al-<lb/>
  berta would ask for Alberta being set<lb/>
  apart as one province. (Hear, hear.) It<lb/>
  might be argued that the Territories are<lb/>
  not as large as some of the provinces in<lb/>
  Canada. He was reminded the other day<lb/>
  that what was good for Ontario and else-<lb/>
  where, it did not necessarily follow it was<lb/>
  good for this country, and he concurred<lb/>
  with that statement, although it did not<lb/>
  possibly suit his views at that time. But<lb/>
  the cases were not parallel. Ontario was<lb/>
  very large, probably much larger in ex-<lb/>
  tent than were the Territories, - at least<lb/>
  much longer. But the populated portion<lb/>
  of Ontario was not, nor ever would be, as<lb/>
  large as the portions of the Territories<lb/>
  that were capable of population, and that<lb/>
  would be populated in due time. There<lb/>
  were good reasons that could be advanced<lb/>
  on the part of the people of Alberta which<lb/>
  it might not be desirable to advance, as<lb/>
  he might be accused of being narrow in<lb/>
  his views, but they all looked after their<lb/>
  own interests first, and although he be-<lb/>
  longed to Alberta he was a Canadian, and<lb/>
  if he thought the portion of the country<lb/>
  to which he belonged, by having provin-<lb/>
  cial rights of its own would be of, advan<lb/>
  tage not only to itself but to Canada, he<lb/>
  thought no one should blame him for hav<lb/>
  ing that wish. (Hear, hear.) The hon.<lb/>
  member from Banff had made quite a<lb/>
  lengthy speech in which he brought down<lb/>
  some figures. He (Mr. Magrath) did not<lb/>
  say he endorsed the ideas the hon. mem-<lb/>
  ber advanced. He had no doubt the fig-<lb/>
  ures were correct, but the hon. member<lb/>
  for Yorkton, in referring to them, stated<lb/>
  the figures were not fact, but he did not<lb/>
  try to dispute them, and he did not add<lb/>
  that figures don't lie. He (Mr. Magrath)<lb/>
  did not think the criticism of the hon.<lb/>
  member for Yorkton had the force he<lb/>
  would like the House to believe. There<lb/>
  were other matters referred to by the<lb/>
  <cb/>
  hon. members which he (Mr. Magrath)<lb/>
  need not reply to because he was good<lb/>
  enough to withdraw-<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Insinger: I beg your pardon ;<lb/>
  I didn't withdraw a single statement I<lb/>
  made.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Magrath: I certainly understood<lb/>
  you to withdraw-<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The Speaker: He withdrew nothing.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Magrath: I accept the hon. gentle-<lb/>
  man's correction.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Insinger: I accept the hon. gentle-<lb/>
  man's apology.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Magrath: I have a distinct recol-<lb/>
  lection that the hon. gentleman referred<lb/>
  to several matters in Alberta deduced<lb/>
  from figures the hon. member for Banff<lb/>
  adduced. The deductions he drew were<lb/>
  that the tippling proclivities of the people<lb/>
  of Alberta were noted, and he made other<lb/>
  statements in reference to the Albertan's<lb/>
  ability for consuming liquor. (Laughter.)<lb/>
  As a representative from Alberta, of<lb/>
  course I don't like that. (Hear, hear)<lb/>
  I presume there are other representatives<lb/>
  from Alberta who are going to speak to-<lb/>
  night, who are more capable of looking<lb/>
  after Albertan interest than I am, and I<lb/>
  leave it to them to either endure, if they<lb/>
  see fit, the expressions that the hon.<lb/>
  gentleman chose to make in reference to<lb/>
  that matter, or refute them if they think<lb/>
  it desirable. I therefore beg to move,<lb/>
  seconded by the hon. member for Banff,<lb/>
  "That the report be referred back to the<lb/>
  select committee with instructions to<lb/>
  strike out the first clause of the section<lb/>
  referred to, and insert in lieu thereof<lb/>
  the following : The Assembly is of the<lb/>
  opinion that until the Territories are ad-<lb/>
  mitted into Confederation as two or more<lb/>
  provinces which they consider is necessary<lb/>
  at an early date for the compact govern-<lb/>
  ment on local lines of such a vast country,<lb/>
  that the passage of a few amendments at<lb/>
  the first session of the Parliament of Can-<lb/>
  ada to the North-West Territories Act<lb/>
  will allow them, subject to disallowance<lb/>
  of their ordinances, to exclusively make<lb/>
  laws in relation to matters already within<lb/>
  their legislative jurisdiction." (Applause.)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  MR. FEARON,<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  (Medicine Hat) said he was in the em-<lb/>
  barassing position of agreeing in part with<lb/>
  promoters of the memorial and in part<lb/>
  with the framers of the amendment. He<lb/>
  agreed with the first part of the question<lb/>
  as to whether the time had arrived that<lb/>
  steps should be taken towards admitting<lb/>
  the Territories into the Confederation as<lb/>
  a province. The framers of the memorial<lb/>
  as interpreted by the hon. member from<lb/>
  Yorkton seemed to infer that the time<lb/>
  had not yet arrived. The position they<lb/>
  took was that they would leave matters<lb/>
  as they are,-in the same indefinite man-<lb/>
  ner as now exists. It was there that he<lb/>
  differed from them. He considered the<lb/>
  time had arrived that at least steps<lb/>
  should be taken to frame events which<lb/>
  would speedily allow the Territories to be<lb/>
  taken into Confederation as a province.<lb/>
  The hon. member from Yorkton, in giv-<lb/>
  ing his reasons why he considered it pre-<lb/>
  mature that such a step should be taken<lb/>
  gave as one, that even with an increased<lb/>
  subsidy the difference between the amount<lb/>
  of money coming to them as a province<lb/>
  and now, would not be sufficient to more<lb/>
  than bear the expenses of the Territories,<lb/>
  and that it would be absolutely necessary<lb/>
  to carry on the government,-that was on<lb/>
  the lines that a province should be carried<lb/>
  on to develop the resources of the coun-<lb/>
  try,-that means would be taken to bor-<lb/>
  row money. Mr. Insinger consider-<lb/>
  ed it would be premature to do so. The<lb/>
  point then to be considered was, if, with<lb/>
  a population of 112,000 in the Territories,<lb/>
  that was not sufficient, when would they<lb/>
  arrive at that point ? If with a member-<lb/>
  ship in the Dominion Parliament of four<lb/>
  members they were not sufficient, how<lb/>
  many should they have before they would<lb/>
  be in a position to compel the Dominion<lb/>
  Government to grant the Territories terms<lb/>
  as favorable as they could desire ? It was<lb/>
  constantly brought forward that admission<lb/>
  into Confederation as a province would<lb/>
  necessitate the borrowing of money. He<lb/>
  believed it would, but he did not consider<lb/>
  it so much of a bugbear as it was popular-<lb/>
  ly supposed to be. They were in the<lb/>
  position of a business house, or a farmer,<lb/>
  who by cultivating part of his farm was<lb/>
  able to pay expenses. He had natural<lb/>
  resources in a large area, but he did not<lb/>
  attempt to cultivate simply because he<lb/>
  had not the means to do so. Was it better<lb/>
  for him to continue indefinitely only pay-<lb/>
  ing expenses, or to borrow money, deve-<lb/>
  lop his farm and make it a dividend pay-<lb/>
  ing concern ? That was the position they<lb/>
  were in regarding the Territories. Wheth<lb/>
  er would it be better for them to go on<lb/>
  for an indefinite period simply paying ex-<lb/>
  penses, allowing their natural resources<lb/>
  to remain dormant, or whether it would<lb/>
  be better to borrow money and develop<lb/>
  the resources ? The hon. member from<lb/>
  Yorkton, in speaking of British Columbia<lb/>
  and Manitoba, as the different systems of<lb/>
  carrying on municipal or provincial gov-<lb/>
  ernment, showed it was absolutely neces-<lb/>
  sary that some taxes had to be levied in<lb/>
  British Columbia, but he said the taxes<lb/>
  were levied by a provincial tax. That<lb/>
  was correct. But that tax in rural dis-<lb/>
  tricts, other than municipalities, this year<lb/>
  was only 10 mills on the dollar. There<lb/>
  was a poll tax of $3 per head for all who<lb/>
  were not otherwise assessed. As he said,<lb/>
  the tax was only 10 mills on the dollar,<lb/>
  but they should bear in mind the provin-<lb/>
  cial government paid all the expenses of<lb/>
  the scholl system,-that it included what<lb/>
  in the Territories was their school tax,-<lb/>
  he asked did they consider that a very<lb/>
  high tax ? How many school districts<lb/>
  were there in the Territories whose assess-<lb/>
  ment was lower than 10 mills on the dol-<lb/>
  lar? So that to-day they were assessing<lb/>
  themselves nearly as high as British Col-<lb/>
  umbia assessed itself. British Columbia<lb/>
  had developed from a population of<lb/>
  20,000 to a population of 80,000 during<lb/>
  the last 15 years. British Columbia came<lb/>
  into confederation as a crown colony. But<lb/>
  supposing B.C. had been an undeveloped<lb/>
  portion of the North-West Territories,<lb/>
  and instead of going into confederation as<lb/>
  a province had simply been formed into a<lb/>
  local government on the lines of the<lb/>
  North-West Territories, what would have<lb/>
  been her position to-day ? The amount<lb/>
  of money she would have had to expend<lb/>
  would only have been sufficient to pay<lb/>
  expenses, consequently they would have<lb/>
  had no money to make their roads and to<lb/>
  make the necessary improvements that<lb/>
  had produced that increase. British<lb/>
  Columbia not being an agricultural coun-<lb/>
  try, it might be said the N.W.T had<lb/>
  increased in the same ratio, but with this<lb/>
  difference,-the Territories had an asset<lb/>
  that could be realized, upon agricultural<lb/>
  <cb/>
  lands ; British Columbia had none. So if<lb/>
  British Columbia had been in the position<lb/>
  of a Territoryshe would have been to-day<lb/>
  with very few more in population than<lb/>
  she was then. It was only by borrowing<lb/>
  money she was able to develop her natural<lb/>
  resources that made it possible for a<lb/>
  population of 8,000 or 9,000 to exist at<lb/>
  Cariboo, 300 miles from the railroad, and<lb/>
  made it possible for millions of money to<lb/>
  be invested there. It was not a danger<lb/>
  to have the power vested in a provincial<lb/>
  government to borrow money ; it was only<lb/>
  by that means that it was possible to de-<lb/>
  velop the uatural resources of the country.<lb/>
  He hoped he hd made himself clear on<lb/>
  that point. The first part of the question<lb/>
  was that he was distinctly in favor in the<lb/>
  near future of the best efforts being made<lb/>
  to admit the Territories into confederation<lb/>
  as a province.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr.Insinger : One province ?<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Fearon : That was where he agreed<lb/>
  with the framers of the memorial, and<lb/>
  where he differed with them in not going<lb/>
  far enough. Where he differed from the<lb/>
  framers of the amendments was where they<lb/>
  laid down that the Territories should be<lb/>
  admitted as two or more provinces. If<lb/>
  they entered as two provinces they would<lb/>
  enter as three. Was it desirable that the<lb/>
  Territories should be divided into three<lb/>
  provinces ? He thought not. That would<lb/>
  be a state of affairs only parallel to the<lb/>
  Maritime provinces to-day, where there<lb/>
  was a movement to consolidate the three<lb/>
  provinces into one. The hon. member<lb/>
  from Banff spoke of the amount of money<lb/>
  paid into the local revenue fund from<lb/>
  Alberta. The amounts were small and<lb/>
  unimportant for the very reason that<lb/>
  they might from year to year alter the<lb/>
  amount of money obtained from licenses,<lb/>
  registration of companies ; and other<lb/>
  sources of revenue were such that at any<lb/>
  time the case might be reversed. There<lb/>
  was no argument advanced why Alberta<lb/>
  should be separated from the Territories<lb/>
  and formed into a province that could not<lb/>
  be advanced in favor of any other part of<lb/>
  the Territories. In fact it was disintegra-<lb/>
  tion, a principle opposed to the spirit of<lb/>
  the age. He was opposed to any division<lb/>
  of the Territories. There were many<lb/>
  arguments why they should remain united.<lb/>
  First, that as a whole they certainly would<lb/>
  be of more importance than they would be<lb/>
  divided. The hon. member for Lethbridge<lb/>
  (Mr. Magrath) thought the Territories<lb/>
  would be too large, and as evidence ad-<lb/>
  vanced that the territories to the south<lb/>
  had recognized the principle and divided<lb/>
  as small as possible. It would be found,<lb/>
  however, that the territories, which are<lb/>
  now States, like Dakota, Texas and others<lb/>
  were as large or larger than the North-<lb/>
  West Territories. It had not been shown<lb/>
  that there had ever been any difficulty<lb/>
  about the machinery of the Territories.<lb/>
  If it was possible for the Executive Com-<lb/>
  mittee in a sparsely populated country,<lb/>
  now to manage the machinery of Govern-<lb/>
  ment in the North-West Territories under<lb/>
  present conditions he did not see how but<lb/>
  a provincial cabinet ought to be able to do<lb/>
  it with increased facilities. He would<lb/>
  have preferred seeing an amendment<lb/>
  brought in which would more clearly have<lb/>
  answered his position, but as it remained<lb/>
  at present between voting for the memor-<lb/>
  ial as it stood, which left it in doubt, and<lb/>
  the amendment proposed, which distinctly<lb/>
  stated that two or more provinces should<lb/>
  be formed, he must vote against the<lb/>
  amendment and in favor of the memorial.<lb/>
  (Hear, hear.)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The debate will be continued in next<lb/>
  issue.<lb/>
