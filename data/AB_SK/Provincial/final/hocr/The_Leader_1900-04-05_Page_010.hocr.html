   <p>THE LEGISLATURE<lb/>
   </p>
   <p>Continued from page 1<lb/>
   </p>
    <p>      
      withstanding their increasing interest<lb/>
      in and growing faith in this country;<lb/> 
      had no real understanding of its<lb/> 
      magnitude or needs, and could not be<lb/> 
      expected to have. He was not ranging<lb/> 
      in a speculative field. He was speak­<lb/>
      ing of something that was well known<lb/>
      to be the fact. The case was not new.<lb/> 
      Gur claims were not a matter only of<lb/>
      yesterday. For years the deniand<lb/>
      had been there. We have representa­<lb/>
      tives in Parliament, some of them inell<lb/> 
      who went there fresh from this Assem­<lb/>
      bly, and who were as well acquainted<lb/>
      with the claims as any men who could<lb/>
      be sent to Parliament. The Territorial<lb/>
      Press has been agitating the question,<lb/>
      and the House knew that its leaders<lb/>
      had constantly pressed the claims.<lb/>
      What was lººd was no list of sup­<lb/>
      posed rights, but only enough for bare<lb/>
      necessities. And what was the result<lb/>
      Could anyone suggest a scheme where­<lb/>
      by Parliament could be prevailed on<lb/>
      to give an adequate subsidy ? Were<lb/>
      there any means or methods to be<lb/>
      resorted to which had not already been<lb/>
      used to all possible extent? Answer­<lb/>
      ing that question in the negative,<lb/>
      what was to be done * There was just<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>ONE PLAIN OPEN ROAD.</p>
    <p>
      All that was left was to ask to be put<lb/> 
      into the position to exercise provincial<lb/> 
      powers. If that were granted, would<lb/>
      our position be improved 2 Certainly,<lb/>
      declared Mr. Hrown. The Territories<lb/>
      would be in a much better position<lb/>
      financially, because they would have<lb/>
      control of rights and resources now<lb/>
      controlled and held by the federal<lb/>
      authority. The fundamental obstacle<lb/>
      now, and which will exist until the<lb/>
      provincial change comes, said Mr.
      Brown, is that vital questions affect-<lb/>
      ing us await solution at the hands of a<lb/>
      body of men who comparatively and<lb/>
      practically have no particular interest<lb/>
      in the question : and a change of Gov-<lb/>
      ernment or any other change at Ot-<lb/>
      tawa did not change this condition one<lb/>
      iota.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the minds of many, pursued the<lb/>
      speaker, a bugbear of expense hampers<lb/>
      the question of assuming provincial<lb/>
      status. The truth was that the Terri­<lb/>
      tories now hve practically all the<lb/>
      machinery of provincial government.<lb/>
      Provincial governmetn woudl not<lb/>
      neccessarily mean any increase in our<lb/>
      machinery of government. There was<lb/>
      no nee for us to inaugurate any ex-<lb/>
      travagant policy of bonousing railways.<lb/>
      He woudl totaly disapprove of rail-<lb/>
      way bonuses, wven if we had the power<lb/>
      to pay them. There woudl be no need<lb/>
      of the Territories loading themselves<lb/>
      with a bigpublic debt. We already<lb/>
      have the power of direct taxation, but<lb/>
      do not apply it. Simply because we<lb/>
      secured the power to bonus railways<lb/>
      and incur debt, would not be sufficient<lb/>
      reason to use the power. The benefits<lb/>
      to be reaped under provincial status<lb/>
      woudl be the receipt of subsidy and<lb/>
      control of provincial resources such as<lb/>
      the public lands exactly as the older<lb/>
      provinces receive and enjoy, neither<lb/>
      more, neithe rless. Look at one<lb/>
      incidental benefit. Take the case<lb/>
      of excemptoin from taxation<lb/>
      of millions of acres of railway<lb/>
      companies lands. The probability was<lb/>
      that the exemption question could and<lb/>
      woudl be settled in the  course of the<lb/>
      negotiations with Ottawa ; but, if not,<lb/>
      the question would niot long await<lb/>
      settlement once the Territorial Assem-<lb/>
      bly had power to deal with it Think<lb/>
      of the 35,000,000 acres of corporation<lb/>
      lands to-day enjoying exemption. So<lb/>
      long as the question is a federal issue,<lb/>
      there is small hope of its ever being<lb/>
      settled, for the simple reason, as stated<lb/>
      before, that of the 216 members of<lb/>
      Parliament, only a bar half dozen are<lb/>
      really and vitally interested in the<lb/>
      problem. There would be a benefit<lb/>
      from a larger direct subsidy, but it  ws<lb/>
      questionable if the settlement of the<lb/>
      exemptions question would not be a<lb/>
      vasly greater benefit. Another point<lb/>
      was that at present there is much un­<lb/>
      necessary clashing of legislation.<lb/>
      While the Dominion administers the<lb/>
      lands, the Territories legislate on the<lb/> 
      subjects of property and civil rights,<lb/>
      and it is found that Dominion legisla­<lb/>
      tion is constantly interfering with<lb/>
      local Ordinances. The Assembly in<lb/>
      this sphere ought to have the sole<lb/>
      right and power, because it went with­<lb/>
      out saying that the Assembly, every<lb/>
      member of which body was intimately<lb/>
      conversant with all phases of the sub-<lb/>
      ject, could more, satisfactorily deal<lb/>
      with it than Parliament with its pre­<lb/>
      onderating majority of members who<lb/>
      &now scarcely anything of the con­<lb/>
      ditions of the country. It was purely<lb/> 
      a local subject and should be dealt<lb/>
      with locally ; and the only way to ob­<lb/>
      tain the transfor to local authority was<lb/> 
      by assuming the state of provincehood.<lb/>
      On this subject, as on others, it was<lb/>
      hardly possible to expect satisfactory<lb/>
      administration from Ottawa even if<lb/>
      the entire western delegation in Par­<lb/>
      liament was an absolute unit.<lb/>
      Alluding niore specifically to His<lb/>
      Honor's speech, Mr. Brown said that<lb/>
      the House would agree unanimously<lb/>
      with the expression on the subject of<lb/>
      the<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA.</p>
    <p>
      That event could not be viewed other­<lb/>
      wise than as a very regrettable one,<lb/>
      yet the unanimous and grand and<lb/>
      proud course and action which Canada<lb/>
      had taken for the assistance of the<lb/>
      mother country was such as had given<lb/>
      Canada a standing in the estimation of<lb/> 
      not alone Great Britain but the world<lb/>
      at large, that she did not occupy be:<lb/>
      fore. (Applause.) The courage and<lb/>
      devotion of our brave Canadian volun­<lb/>
      teers had formed for us a new associa­<lb/>
      tion with Great Britain and our sister<lb/> 
      colonies, and had given us a new and<lb/>
      lasting legacy as a people. Nothing so<lb/> 
      surely created a national sentil lent,<lb/> 
      without which no country could be<lb/>
      truly great, as the graves of national<lb/> 
      horjes, and the monuments erected in<lb/>
      memory of those who shed their blood<lb/>
      for and in honor of their country, our<lb/> 
      country. (Cheers.) While we all re­<lb/>
      gretted and deplored the death of so<lb/>
      many valiant sons of , Canada, we all<lb/>
      felt the deepest pride in the fact that<lb/>
      they died in a manner commanding<lb/>
      the commendation of the watching world.<lb/>
      (Cheers.) Mr. Brown moved the adop-<lb/>
      tion of the  Address in REply, and sat<lb/>
      down amid warm applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DE WEBER (Lethbridge) second­<lb/>
      ed the Address, and was cordially ap­<lb/>
      lauded as he arose to fulfill the task.<lb/>
      At the outset he assured the House that<lb/> 
      there was no cause to fear that he was<lb/>
      going to administer a long or nauseous<lb/>
      dose of what was frequently termed<lb/>
      “wind.” (Laughter.) In any event,<lb/>
      had he been possessed of any such dire<lb/>
      intent, he was now debarred, because<lb/>
      the nover (Mr. Brown) had touched<lb/>
      all the salient points of His Honor's<lb/>
      gracious speech, and had thoroughly<lb/>
      Covered the ground. This system of<lb/>
      inaugurating the business of a business<lb/> 
      body, be could only look upon as an<lb/>
      evidence of the ineradicable character<lb/>
      of old habits and customs. The formal<lb/>
      Speech and its necess: rily formal ans­<lb/>
      wer, were relics of antiquity. He<lb/>
      could not tell upon whom to saddle the<lb/>
      blame, not being as well versed as he<lb/>
      ought to be in ancient history, but he<lb/>
      imagined  it waas Ceasar, or Cicero,or<lb/>
      Demosthenes, or possibly Mephisto-<lb/>
      pheles. (Laughter.). Turnign to the<lb/>
      speech, Dr. DeVeber said that the<lb/>
      nature of his calling as a physician,<lb/>
      prevented him visiting all parts of the<lb/>
      <cb/>
      Territories and personally witnessing<lb/>
      the prosperity fo the  country, but<lb/>
      judging from the generally dissemin-<lb/>
      ated information he had every con-<lb/>
      fidence in the  statement that prosperi-<lb/>
      ty was reigning. Nearly 50,000 new<lb/>
      settlers arrived in Western Canada<lb/>
      lasty ear, and he velieved that of these<lb/>
      the Territories got a goodly share. At<lb/>
      the sale of school lands in Indian Head<lb/>
      district a few days ago, some 8,000<lb/>
      acres of land brought some $80,000,<lb/>
      an average price of $10 per acre, while<lb/>
      certain sections were sold for as high<lb/>
      as $25 per acre. Judging from such<lb/>
      facts and figures as these, and from the<lb/>
      expressions of contentment on the<lb/>
      faces of at least one or two fo the Mem-<lb/>
      bers here (with a sly glance at Mr. Mc-<lb/>
      Caule, another at Mr. Cross, and still<lb/>
      another t Mr. Shera)-(roars of laugh-<lb/>
      ter)-he felt sure there was good cause<lb/>
      for congratulatio. Of one quarter of<lb/>
      the Territories, his own district, Leth-<lb/>
      bridge,he could speak from personal<lb/>
      knoweldge. That district had ex-<lb/>
      ceptionl stimulus in the way of an<lb/>
      irrigation project of great magnitude,<lb/>
      the benefits to flow from which it was<lb/>
      utterly impossible to estimate as yet.<lb/>
      The scheme embraced a length of 60<lb/>
      miles of main canal, with many<lb/>
      branches. One 20 mile branch enters<lb/>
      the torn at Lethbridge. It is estimat-<lb/>
      ed that the system has a watering<lb/>
      capacity of 500,000 acres. The secure<lb/>
      the branch to the town, as the House<lb/>
      knew, because it had given the neces-<lb/>
      sary legislation, the town paid a bonus<lb/>
      of $30,000 in return for which the Com-<lb/>
      pany had undertaken to expend certain<lb/>
      sums within the town and put the  un-<lb/>
      dertaking in such shape that every<lb/>
      householder in the town may avail<lb/>
      himself of water for a garden. A class of set­<lb/>
      tlers not having knowledge, would pro­<lb/>
      bably be a detriment, or rather with<lb/>
      people ignorant of the science, the<lb/>
      schème might be a curse instead of a<lb/>
      blessing. But the Company are pro­<lb/>
      curing settlers who are used to farming<lb/> 
      with irrigation. The Company are pay­<lb/>
      ing the wages of the men employed on<lb/>
      the ditch with land, and last year land<lb/> 
      was earned in this way to the value of<lb/>
      $119,000. In a few years there was<lb/>
      every reason to hope that the systein<lb/>
      would transform the treeless prairie<lb/>
      into orchards and the pasture land into<lb/> 
      golden grain fields. (Applause.). As<lb/>
      an indication of the wonderful develo-<lb/>
      mentment occuring within that district, he<lb/>
      might mention that to-day there are<lb/>
      two communities,which wil soon take<lb/>
      the status of villages, Magrath and<lb/>
      Stirling, with poppulation sof 400 and<lb/>
      300 respectively, where last year there<lb/>
      was nothing, and these villages have<lb/>
      stores and business places that would<lb/>
      grace any town. (Applause.) Refer-<lb/>
      ring to the war,Dr. DeVeber said that<lb/>
      our love and loyalty to the Mother</p>
    Country had before his been confined<lb/>
    to word of mouth and scratch of pen.<lb/>
    It was of course not hte first time that<lb/>
    British soldiers and colonials had<lb/>
    fougth side by side, because there had<lb/>
    been occasions in the past when most<lb/>
    of the  colonies had had their own<lb/>
    wars, and on those occasions each<lb/>
    colony separately was assisted by the <lb/>
    Mother Country. But this was the<lb/>
    first occasion that colonials and British<lb/>
    soldiers had fought and died together,<lb/>
    both away from home. (Applause.)<lb/>
    The manner of the response of the<lb/>
    Colonies ot the Mother's call,-the<lb/>
    eagerness with which each Colony<lb/>
    offered to assist, and pressed to be<lb/>
    allowed to assist, must have shown to<lb/>
    the world that the bonds uniting<lb/>
    Great Britain and her now-powerful<lb/>
    Colonies are daily growing stronge<lb/>
    and tighter, and must have awakened<lb/>
    the nations of the earth to the fact<lb/>
    that the peoiple under the British flag<lb/>
    are in very deed an Empire. (Cheers.)<lb/>
    He was sure that the  House would con-<lb/>
    cure in the grants made to the North-<lb/>
    West Contingent nd the measures to<lb/>
    legalise certain municipal grants,not<lb/>
    only unanimously but with cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth section, that dealing with<lb/>
      the financial question, was, he thought<lb/>
      the meatof the Speech. For years<lb/>
      our financial demands had not been<lb/> 
      adequately satisfied. This year the<lb/> 
      House could congratulate itself upon a<lb/> 
      moderate increase of subsidy and a<lb/>
      respectably large special grant. But<lb/>
      these would only meet the difficulty<lb/>
      temporarily,–merely relieve the tension<lb/> 
      for the time being. The problem was<lb/>
      one that must be touched carefully,<lb/>
      and handled gingerly. In seeking a<lb/>
      solution, they should lay aside all party<lb/> 
      spirit, all sectional feelings, all personal<lb/>
      aim :- (hear, hear)- they shoudl adopt<lb/>
      a scheme and a solution apart from<lb/>
      any thought of sectional benefit or any<lb/>
      minor consideration:-(hear, hear)-<lb/>
      they should rise superior to small ideas<lb/>
      and asirations and strive for a higher,<lb/>
      truer and nobler conception of their<lb/>
      duties on this question of tremendous<lb/>
      moment and act unitedly for the best<lb/>
      interests of the North-West Territories<lb/>
      as a whole (Cheers.)<lb/>
           
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. De Veber has resumed his<lb/> 
      seat, Mr. Speaker and the House wait-<lb/>
      ed in expectancy for about three and a<lb/>
      half minutes. It was the moment for<lb/>
      the leader of the Opposition to arise in<lb/>
      his might and smite the Government.<lb/>
      No one arose. "Question, question,"<lb/>
      finally called Mr. Speaker to his feet.<lb/>
      "Does the House agree to the motion?"<lb/>
      The House unanimously agreed. Ex-<lb/>
      pectancy's thirst remained anassuaged.<lb/>
