     "tive Assembly of the North-West<lb/>
     "Territories is placed, and I admit<lb/>
     that there is very much in the sug-<lb/>
     gestions which are made in your<lb/>
     "letter and in the memorial regarding<lb/>
     "the necessity of change in the con-<lb/>
     "stitutional and financial position of<lb/>
     "the Territories.
   </p>
    <p>
      Without at the present moment<lb/>
      committing myself to any positive<lb/>
      statement I am prepared to say that<lb/>
      "the time has arrived when teh ques-<lb/>
      "tion of organising the Territories on<lb/>
      "the Provincial bsis ought to be the<lb/>
      "subject of full consideration. It<lb/>
      "would appear to me that the better<lb/>
      "way of bringing the matter to a more<lb/>
      "definite position would be to arrange<lb/>
      "for a conference upon the subject<lb/>
      "between the representatives of your<lb/>
      "Government and a committee of<lb/>
      "Council representing the Federal<lb/>
      "Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again on the fifth of April 1901, you<lb/>
      write :
    </p>
    <p>
      "The latter potion of the Session of<lb/>
      "Parliament here finds ll the mem-<lb/>
      bers of the Government extremely<lb/>
      "busy, and it would be hopeless to<lb/>
      "expect from them that mature and<lb/>
      "careful consideration of the various<lb/>
      "and important subjects which will<lb/>
      "require to be debted and settled in<lb/>
      "connection with th establishment of<lb/>
      "the Territorie as a Province or upon<lb/>
      "Provincial basis. I think I shall<lb/>
      "therefore be compelled to ask you to<lb/>
      "defer the discussion until after Par-<lb/>
      liament has prorogued.
    </p>"
   <p>
     Theese opionins and the long delay<lb/>
     tht followed,in order to choose a<lb/>
     convenient time for tht "mature and<lb/>
     careful considertion of the various<lb/>
     and important subjects which will re-<lb/>
     quire to be debated and settled in con-<lb/>
     nection with the establishmentof the<lb/>
     Territories as a Province or upon a<lb/>
     Provincial basis," led us to suppose<lb/>
     that when the subject was<lb/>
     finally taken up it would be<lb/>
     taken up with a view to imp-<lb/>
     mediate settlement. The written<lb/>
     statements, which ahve been made by<lb/>
     me, must have proved conclusively<lb/>
     that the necessity for the change was<lb/>
     a pressing one and that we had arrived<lb/>
     at a point when our constitutional and<lb/>
     financial osition was not adequate to<lb/>
     the proper performance of the duties<lb/>
     devolving upon us. Recognising this<lb/>
     state of afairs, we have gone to the<lb/>
     Dominion Government and said: "if<lb/>
     you cannot we will not deal with the<lb/>
     questions which have arisen in the<lb/>
     Territories  <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> the powers and the<lb/>
     <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>would justly accompany<lb/>
     those powers and allow us to work<lb/>
     <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> To this you<lb/>
     answer : "That it is the view of the<lb/>
     Government that it will not be wise<lb/>
     "t the present time to pass legisla-<lb/>
     tion <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> the Territories into a<lb/>
     "Province or Provinces." One of the<lb/>
     <cb/>
     reaspms given for this position is :<lb/>
     "That the popuation of the Territories<lb/>
     "is sparse." I might point out that<lb/>
     we have at least ten times the popula-<lb/>
     tion of Manitoba when it was erected<lb/>
     into a Provine, and a larger popula-<lb/>
     tion than that Province had so lately as<lb/>
     1891 ; a considerably larger population<lb/>
     than the Province of Prince Edward<lb/>
     Island and with the immigraiton of<lb/>
     the present season a considerably<lb/>
     larger population than the Province of<lb/>
     British Columbia according to the late<lb/>
     census. Another reason advanced is :<lb/>
     "That the rapid increase in population<lb/>
     "now taking place will in a short time<lb/>
     "alter the conditions to be dealt with<lb/>
     very materially." The rapid increase<lb/>
     in population is one of the principal<lb/>
     reasons why we are asking to be form-<lb/>
     ed into a Province, in order that we<lb/>
     may be able to deal with teh new con-<lb/>
     ditions tht it brings about. The long-<lb/>
     er it goes on without the change the<lb/>
     more aggravated the present difficult-<lb/>
     ties will become.
     
   </p>
    <p>
      With regard to a divergence of opin­<lb/>
      ion as to one or intore Provinces, <lb/>
      might say that that is a difficulty <lb/>
      which will always exist and which any <lb/>
      postponentent of action will not re­<lb/>
      move.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must also say on behalf of the <lb/>
      North-\West Government that after <lb/>
      having been asked to meet a sub-com­<lb/>
      mittee of the Privy Council and to <lb/>
      state our case not only verbally but in <lb/>
      writing, it is extremely unsatisfactory <lb/>
      that the Governinent has couiſe to <lb/>
      the conclusion : “That it will not be <lb/>
      “necessary to discuss the details of <lb/>
      " the draft bill which elnbodied our <lb/>
      “ views.” This is a conclusion to the <lb/>
      negotiations which have been held <lb/>
      which we could hardly have expected <lb/>
      considering the importance of the sub­<lb/>
      ject discussed and the formal manner <lb/>
      in which the discussion has taken<lb/>
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wecannot but regret tht the Gov-<lb/>
      ernment has not been able to recognise<lb/>
      the urgent necessity for the change<lb/>
      that has been asked and can only trust<lb/>
      that as you ahve denied us the oppor-<lb/>
      tunity of helping ourselves you will be<lb/>
      at least impressed with the necessity<lb/>
      and the duty, which is now yours, of<lb/>
      meeting the pressing necessities of<lb/>
      these rapidly developing Territories.<lb/>
      While we may,in your opinion with-<lb/>
      out inconvenience mark time constitu-<lb/>
      tionally; we cannot do without<lb/>
      the transportation facilities,the<lb/>
      roads, the bridges,the schools and<lb/>
      the other improvements which our<lb/>
      rapidly growing population impera-<lb/>
      tively requires, and at once. Whether<lb/>
      we are made into a Province or not,<lb/>
      our financial necessities are just as<lb/>
      real, and in conclusion I can only trust<lb/>
      that when the question of an increase<lb/>
      to our subsidy is receiving considera-<lb/>
      tion, more weight will be given to our<lb/>
      representations in that respect than<lb/>
      has been given to our requests for<lb/>
      constitutional changes.
