DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS.<lb/>
(Continued From Page 1.)<lb/>
<cb/>
We were all glad to learn that the<lb/>
Dominion Government has recognized<lb/>
the necessities of the Territories in the<lb/>
unprecedented increase to our grant,<lb/>
which for the first time is the full<lb/>
amount asked for. There is no Mem-<lb/>
ber in this House I feel safe in say-<lb/>
ing who has not time and again, felt<lb/>
the pinch of poverty in our public fi-<lb/>
nances. I do not suppose that the<lb/>
present remarkable increase will any-<lb/>
thing like meet all the requirements<lb/>
of the country, for as usual the "sup-<lb/>
ply" will create a "demand." But I<lb/>
think we should all recognise one<lb/>
fact evidenced by the large increase in<lb/>
our grant. We have all heard the<lb/>
small grants we have had in the past<lb/>
attributed to the difficulty met with<lb/>
by the Dominion Government in in-<lb/>
teresting Members of Parliament from<lb/>
Eastern constituencies in western af-<lb/>
fairs. The fact that such a large<lb/>
grant has been given for this year<lb/>
without any criticism shows, to my<lb/>
mind, that that difficulty has been<lb/>
done away with. Though we have not<lb/>
been successful in obtaining provin-<lb/>
cial institutions, yet I am hopeful<lb/>
from the fact that I have just mentioned,<lb/>
that we are within a reasonable dis-<lb/>
tance of it.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Speaker, it is with much pleas-<lb/>
  ure I second the resolution before the<lb/>
  House.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The Opposition Leader.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. D. H. McDonald, leader of the<lb/>
  Opposition, followed.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Received Full Amount Asked For.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  I quite agree with the Government<lb/>
  in expressions of pleasure that this<lb/>
  year we have received all the money<lb/>
  we asked for.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Patrick — Possibly they did<lb/>
  not ask for enough.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. McDonald — Well, then it is up<lb/>
  to them.<lb/>
  <cb/>
</p>
<p>
  Taking up the question of provin-<lb/>
  cial autonomy, Mr. McDonald said he<lb/>
  sincerely hoped that when they next<lb/>
  met together, whether at a legisla-<lb/>
  ture of the North-West Territories,<lb/>
  or as a provincial legislature, that at<lb/>
  that time the provincial question<lb/>
  would be settled. I believe, said<lb/>
  the speaker, that we should have this<lb/>
  question settled by this time. (Hear,<lb/>
  hear.) I am sincerely in favor of get-<lb/>
  ting autonomy, but I understand<lb/>
  this Government has made it a con-<lb/>
  sideration that there must be one<lb/>
  province. As you know, we of the<lb/>
  Opposition do not agree to that. I<lb/>
  believe a majority of this Legislat-<lb/>
  ure is now getting to that way of<lb/>
  thinking. All we have to do today<lb/>
  is to keep plugging at the Govern-<lb/>
  ment and they will come around on<lb/>
  this as they have done on many<lb/>
  things. I do not believe there is<lb/>
  anyone in Canada who believe that<lb/>
  the whole North-West will be form-<lb/>
  ed into one large province. This is<lb/>
  a matter in which we are not the<lb/>
  only people interested. When we be-<lb/>
  come a province or provinces we en-<lb/>
  ter into confederation with the other<lb/>
  provinces and they will have some-<lb/>
  thing to say about our size. During<lb/>
  recent years we have been growing<lb/>
  in population, our representation in<lb/>
  the House of Commons has been in-<lb/>
  creased, and we now have a larger<lb/>
  force at our back and should there-<lb/>
  fore be in a position to obtain bet-<lb/>
  ter terms than we could four or five<lb/>
  years ago. I do not know, there-<lb/>
  fore, but that we have been actual<lb/>
  gainers by the matter of provincial<lb/>
  autonomy being postponed for a few<lb/>
  years. However, I believe the time<lb/>
  has come for the granting of pro-<lb/>
  vincial institutions and I hope the<lb/>
  Government will have better success<lb/>
  before the House meets again.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Poked Fun at Bennett.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Although not informed officially,<lb/>
  we have reason to believe that a<lb/>
  number of Members in this Assembly<lb/>
  are endeavoring to secure seats in<lb/>
  the House of Commons and, we<lb/>
  trust, if any are successful that they<lb/>
  will represent the views of this As-<lb/>
  sembly. (Hear, hear.) I have always<lb/>
  thought that it would be a very<lb/>
  good thing if certain Members of this<lb/>
  Legislature were in the House of<lb/>
  Commons. (Laughter.) Of course<lb/>
  there are some Members you cannot<lb/>
  recommend for that position. (More<lb/>
  laughter.) But I think we all ought<lb/>
  to be agreed that if any man resigns<lb/>
  his seat in this House and attempts<lb/>
  to secure a seat in the House of<lb/>
  Commons and is defeated he should<lb/>
  not endeavor to come back here.<lb/>
  (Loud laughter, during which Mr. R.<lb/>
  B. Bennett interjecting some remark.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. McDonald — I am sorry that<lb/>
  I have hurt the feelings of the Mem-<lb/>
  ber for West Calgary, but he has<lb/>
  given up all idea of ever securing a<lb/>
  seat in the House of Commons.<lb/>
  (Laughter.) Aside from political con-<lb/>
  siderations it would be a good thing<lb/>
  if some of the Members of this As-<lb/>
  sembly were amongst those represent-<lb/>
  ing us at Ottawa.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. McDonald in referring to the<lb/>
  Governor General, said he would<lb/>
  prove a good friend of the North-<lb/>
  West and in bringing our great agri-<lb/>
  cultural resources before the people<lb/>
  of Great Britain would do us a great<lb/>
  service as, after all, it was to the<lb/>
  mother country we looked for the<lb/>
  great number of people we expect to<lb/>
  have in this country.<lb/>
  <cb/>
  Member for the district, and that if<lb/>
  the Government had not sufficient<lb/>
  confidence in the Member they should<lb/>
  send an engineer in to investigate<lb/>
  and report. Mr. McDonald resumed<lb/>
  his seat amidst applause.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The Premier's Reply.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Premier Haultain was received with<lb/>
  hearty applause on rising to reply.<lb/>
