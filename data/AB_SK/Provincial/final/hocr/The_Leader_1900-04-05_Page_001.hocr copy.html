<p>
  TEXT OF HIS HONOR'S SPEECH<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Address in Reply Adopted Without<lb/>
  Opposition or Criticism, on Motion<lb/>
  of Mr. Brown and Dr. De Veber-<lb/>

<p>
  THE OPENING.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The second session of the Fourth<lb/>
  Legislature of the Territories was<lb/>
  opened at Regina on Thursday, 29th<lb/>
  March, 1900, by His Honor Lieut.-Gov-<lb/>
  ernor Forget. Twenty-six of the thir-<lb/>
  ty-one Members were in their seats.<lb/>
  The function was attended by the<lb/>
  usual display, and was witnessed by a<lb/>
  large assemblage of spectators. His<lb/>
  Honour was attended from Govern-<lb/>
  ment House to the Assembly buildings<lb/>
  by a Mounted Police escort, and arrived<lb/>
  at the Chamber a few minutes after<lb/>
  three o'clock, accompanied by Inspec-<lb/>
  tor Gilpin-Brown, A.D.C.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  THE SPEECH.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The Speech delivered by the Lieut.-<lb/>
  Governor was the following:-<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Legisla-<lb/>
  tive Assembly:-<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  I have much pleasure in welcoming<lb/>
  you upon the occasion of the opening<lb/>
  of the Second Session of the Fourth<lb/>
  Legislative Assembly of the Territories,<lb/>
  and in congratulating you upon the<lb/>
  remarkable growth in population and<lb/>
  material resources which the Terri-<lb/>
  tories have experienced during the<lb/>
  past year.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The spontaneous expressions of loyal-<lb/>
  ty with which all parts of the Empire<lb/>
  have given practical evidence of their<lb/>
  devotion to the Queen and Imperial in-<lb/>
  terests, will ever mark the past year as<lb/>
  a memorable one in the history of the<lb/>
  nation. Owing to the non-establish-<lb/>
  ment of the militia system, the Terri-<lb/>
  tories were deprived of the privilege<lb/>
  of being represented in the first Cana-<lb/>
  dian Contingent, but it must be a mat-<lb/>
  ter of pride and gratification to know<lb/>
  that in the Second Contingent, and in<lb/>
  that corps raised and equipped through<lb/>
  the splendid generosity and patriotism<lb/>
  of Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal,<lb/>
  the Territories have now the honor of<lb/>
  having given not only a large number<lb/>
  of men in the aggregate but, in propor-<lb/>
  tion to their population, a larger num-<lb/>
  ber than any other portion of the<lb/>
  Dominion, to the Canadian contribu-<lb/>
  tion to the cause of the Empire. In<lb/>
  this connection you will be asked to<lb/>
  concur in a grant made to the North-<lb/>
  West members of the Second Contin-<lb/>
  gent, and your assent will be asked to<lb/>
  a measure legalising grants made by<lb/>
  Municipal Corporations to various<lb/>
  patriotic funds.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The financial position of the Terri-<lb/>
  tories has been the subject of consider-<lb/>
  able correspondence addressed to the<lb/>
  Federal authorities by my Govern-<lb/>
  ment. A portion of the correspon-<lb/>
  dence was laid before you at your last<lb/>
  Session, and I have ordered copies of<lb/>
  subsequent communications to be pre-<lb/>
  pared for your information.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The unprecedented rainfall and dis-<lb/>
  astrous floods of the past year brought<lb/>
  about a state of affairs which the<lb/>
  revenue, already proved to the inade-<lb/>
  quate under ordinary conditions, was<lb/>
  altogether unable to cope with. This<lb/>
  state of affairs tended not so much to<lb/>
  create as to aggravate and call more<lb/>
  pointed attention to the great dispro-<lb/>
  portion existing between the means at<lb/>
  command and the ever-growing neces-<lb/>
  sities of the rapidly increasing popula-<lb/>
  tion of the Territories. It is gratify-<lb/>
  ing for me to be able to inform you<lb/>
  that the Federal Government has<lb/>
  proposed to Parliament now in session<lb/>
  a moderate increase to your annual<lb/>
  grant and a large special vote for the<lb/>
  purpose of restoring public works de-<lb/>
  stroyed by the floods. In spite of this<lb/>
  very substantial increase to the<lb/>
  Revenue, my Government can only<lb/>
  look upon it as affording a temporary<lb/>
  and partial amelioration of otherwise<lb/>
  impossible financial conditions, and<lb/>
  will ask you to take action leading to<lb/>
  the earliest practicable solution of Ter-<lb/>
  ritorial financial and administrative<lb/>
  problems.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  In the administration of the law some<lb/>
  changes have suggested themselves as<lb/>
  being calculated to bring about greater<lb/>
  economy and effectiveness. Bills to<lb/>
  secure these ends will be duly submitted<lb/>
  to you.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The accounts of the Income and Ex-<lb/>
  penditure for the past year will be laid<lb/>
  before you, as will also the Estimates<lb/>
  for the current year, which have been<lb/>
  prepared with due regard to the effi-<lb/>
  ciency of the several services to be<lb/>
  undertaken and the rigid limitations<lb/>
  of the revenue.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Gentlemen of the Legislative Assembly-<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  I now leave you to your delibera-<lb/>
  tions, in full confidence that the same<lb/>
  devotion will be given to the interests<lb/>
  of the Territories which has heretofore<lb/>
  characterised the labours of the Legis-<lb/>
  lative Assembly.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  His Honor having departed, Mr.<lb/>
  Speaker (Hon. Wm. Eakin) took the<lb/>
  Chair. Mr. Speaker announced that<lb/>
  during the recess he had received the<lb/>
  certificate of election of Arthur L. Sif-<lb/>
  ton as member for Banff. Mr. Sifton<lb/>
  was then introduced to Mr. Speaker by<lb/>
  Premier Haultain and Mr. Wallace of<lb/>
  High River, and took his seat amid<lb/>
  warm applause. The Premier moved<lb/>
  for leave to introduce a formal bill,<lb/>
  which was read a first time.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  On motion of Messrs. Haultain and<lb/>
  Ross a select committee was struck to<lb/>
  name the members to compose the<lb/>
  Standing Committees for the session,<lb/>
  and report, after which the House ad-<lb/>
  journed.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <cb/>
  MONDAY, April 2.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Speaker took the Chair at 2:55<lb/>
  o'clock.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  THE ADDRESS IN REPLY.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Mr. G. W. BROWN (North Regina)<lb/>
  on rising to move the Address in Reply<lb/>
  to His Honor's speech, was loudly ap-<lb/>
  plauded. He said that he would preface<lb/>
  the task with the remark that the un-<lb/>
  precedented success attending these<lb/>
  Territories, particularly within the<lb/>
  past twelve months, and in great meas-<lb/>
  ure during the last three or four years,<lb/>
  was certainly a matter of evident satis-<lb/>
  faction to the House and to the coun-<lb/>
  try. The past year had been one of<lb/>
  <cb/>
  magnificent crops, and magnificent<lb/>
  weather for the curing and marketing<lb/>
  of the crops. It seemed as if at last<lb/>
  PROVIDENCE WAS SMILING<lb/>
  upon these Territories. Business in all<lb/>
  lines and branches was lucrative and<lb/>
  cheering; our own people were now<lb/>
  possessed of confidence, and the people<lb/>
  in the Eastern Provinces were gaining<lb/>
  confidence in us and in this part of<lb/>
  Canada. The North-West was no<lb/>
  longer looked upon as a barren or<lb/>
  dubious quantity. The people of the<lb/>
  East, it was no exaggeration to say,<lb/>
  now looked on the Territories as the<lb/>
  hope and the future mainstay of the<lb/>
  industries and manufactures of Canada.<lb/>
  That favorable feeling regarding the<lb/>
  North-West did not always prevail in<lb/>
  the East. There was a time not very<lb/>
  many years ago, when Eastern people<lb/>
  had small faith, - when the Eastern<lb/>
  Provinces had more than half an idea<lb/>
  that the Territories were proving a big<lb/>
  bill of expense with no very sure pros-<lb/>
  pect of a return, and that this country<lb/>
  was simply a burden. All that is<lb/>
  changed now. There is reason for the<lb/>
  changed feeling. The returns compiled<lb/>
  by the Agriculture Department show<lb/>
  that whereas a few years ago our grain<lb/>
  exports were the smallest of any part<lb/>
  of Canada, to-day we are exporting<lb/>
  grain measured by the millions of<lb/>
  bushels annually. Dairying, which a<lb/>
  few years ago was languishing and<lb/>
  scarcely deserved the name of industry,<lb/>
  so far as the North-West was concern-<lb/>
  ed, is now in a thriving state of devel-<lb/>
  opment, yielding handsome profits to<lb/>
  those engaged in it and adding per-<lb/>
  ceptibly to the bulk of our exports and<lb/>
  to the name and<lb/>
  FAME OF CANADIAN PRODUCTS.<lb/>
  North-West butter, which a few years<lb/>
  ago merchants hesitated to handle at<lb/>
  all, is now becoming an article of stan-<lb/>
  dard value not only in the mining<lb/>
  province west of us but as well in the<lb/>
  markets of the British Isles. (Applause.)<lb/>
  Within a few short years the Territor-<lb/>
  ies have advanced from the position of<lb/>
  the provincial division having the<lb/>
  smallest exports, to the position of the<lb/>
  division having the largest per capita<lb/>
  export of cattle. Looked at from all<lb/>
  sides the development of the Terri-<lb/>
  tories could not but be pronounced<lb/>
  eminently satisfactory to the people of<lb/>
  the Territories and to the whole of<lb/>
  Canada. (Applause.) Our population<lb/>
  was increasing rapidly. For the past<lb/>
  year or two the increase in population<lb/>
  of Manitoba and the Territories had<lb/>
  gone on at a rate of at least 20 or 25 per<lb/>
  cent., which was a ratio of annual in-<lb/>
  crease heretofore unparalleled in the<lb/>
  Territories or in any part of Canada.<lb/>
  (Applause.)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SHIELD.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  But while in these respects our suc-<lb/>
  cess had been great, our development<lb/>
  most encouraging, while faith in the<lb/>
  country was becoming well established<lb/>
  and our credit abroad was gaining a<lb/>
  sure footing, there was yet one point<lb/>
  of view from which could be seen<lb/>
  reason for only chastened rejoicing. It<lb/>
  was with sorrow they were compelled<lb/>
  to look at the comparative absence of<lb/>
  increase of the revenue for the local<lb/>
  government of the Territories. The<lb/>
  revenue had not been increasing to any<lb/>
  adequate extent. For the proper gov-<lb/>
  ernment of the country, to ensure the<lb/>
  proper development of the country, to<lb/>
  give sustained confidence to the pio-<lb/>
  neers who are here and who are com-<lb/>
  ing in to help build up the country, it<lb/>
  could be laid down as an unassailable<lb/>
  proposition that it was absolutely<lb/>
  necessary that<lb/>
  LOCAL REVENUE MUST GROW APACE<lb/>
  WITH LOCAL NEEDS.<lb/>
  For several years past the local revenue<lb/>
  had not been keeping pace with the<lb/>
  local needs. What had been done to<lb/>
  meet the case? What was done when<lb/>
  the revenue became in a sense station-<lb/>
  ary while the needs kept on growing?<lb/>
  This was done: The people consented<lb/>
  to a reduction of the school grants, and<lb/>
  consented to share in the prosecution<lb/>
  and maintenance of public works by<lb/>
  means of a Local Improvement system.<lb/>
  In these ways the demands on the re-<lb/>
  venue were lessened. He believed the<lb/>
  people had done and were doing all that<lb/>
  it was reasonable to ask them to do,<lb/>
  but again we are face to face with the<lb/>
  problem of insufficient revenue. In<lb/>
  this circumstance the Assembly and<lb/>
  the people had a duty to perform. The<lb/>
  problem must be met and dealt with;<lb/>
  it must be dealt with in a way best for<lb/>
  the interests of the Territories as a<lb/>
  whole. (Applause.) There was possible<lb/>
  the method of<lb/>
  DIRECT TAXATION.<lb/>
  We have the power and privilege of<lb/>
  assuming the burden of direct taxation,<lb/>
  but in the early stage of the develop-<lb/>
  ment of the country, with the people<lb/>
  still in the position, and for some years<lb/>
  to come likely to be in the position of<lb/>
  pioneers struggling and battling with<lb/>
  primitive conditions and striving under<lb/>
  many incident handicaps for the goal<lb/>
  of permanency, he did not believe it<lb/>
  would be advisable or in the best inter-<lb/>
  est of the country to apply that meth-<lb/>
  od. What was the alternative? Could<lb/>
  we look for an adequately increased<lb/>
  subsidy from Ottawa? That was a<lb/>
  very important question. What answer<lb/>
  could be given? He was convinced<lb/>
  that we could not look with any mea-<lb/>
  sure of hope for remedy from that<lb/>
  source. He did not believe that we<lb/>
  need look to Ottawa for any such in-<lb/>
  crease as the circumstances demand.<lb/>
  The case had been pressed at Ottawa<lb/>
  for years, and while some increases<lb/>
  were obtained, every year shows a big-<lb/>
  ger disparity between the amount we<lb/>
  get and the amount we require. Has<lb/>
  our case not been properly presented at<lb/>
  Ottawa? He (Mr. Brown) thoroughly<lb/>
  believed that our case had been pre-<lb/>
  sented as properly, as well and as force-<lb/>
  fully as it could be presented. The<lb/>
  leaders of the Assembly, who under-<lb/>
  derstood the case at least as well as any<lb/>
  men or collection of men alive, had<lb/>
  gone year after year to Ottawa hat in<lb/>
  hand, as had been said. He believed<lb/>
  the federal Government understood the<lb/>
  case now as well as it can be hoped that<lb/>
  they ever will understand it. On this<lb/>
  subject he did not believe that Ottawa's<lb/>
  action depended on whether a Conser-<lb/>
  vative or a Liberal Government was in<lb/>
  power. Any Government would do<lb/>
  the best it could. Did the matter de-<lb/>
  pend wholly on the Government, the<lb/>
  cabinet ministers, probably we might<lb/>
  expect adequate remedy from Ottawa,<lb/>
  from either a Liberal or a Conservative<lb/>
  Government. But it did not lie with<lb/>
  them wholly. There were more than<lb/>
  two hundred members of Parliament<lb/>
  to be consulted, only four of whom<lb/>
  were sent from the Territories. He did<lb/>
  not want to convey the impression that<lb/>
  the Eastern Provinces were hostile to<lb/>
  us, or that Eastern members would not<lb/>
  grant us what they thought was just<lb/>
  and right, because he did not think<lb/>
  that would be a true impression. The<lb/>
  fact was that the Eastern men, not-<lb/>
