<p>The House divided on the amend<lb break="no"/>ment, which was carried by 19 to 10. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PREMIER CLOSES AUTONOMY DEBATE.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>, in closing the debate <lb/>
on provincial autonomy, said he <lb/>
felt somewhat under a disadvan<lb break="no"/>age in taking up this subject, <lb/>
which had been discussed at so <lb/>
much length. However, a number of <lb/>
important questions had been raised <lb/>
during the debate and he felt that he <lb/>
would have to ask the House, even at <lb/>
this stage to allow him a short consid<lb break="no"/>eration of them. After three day's de<lb break="no"/>bate, after the motion has been put <lb/>
and a lengthy amendment proposed; <lb/>
aftera number of long speeches, the <lb/>
general result had been the important <lb/>
discovery that there are divergences of <lb/>
opinion with regard to the areas with<lb break="no"/>in which provincial institutions should <lb/>
be worked out. These divergences of <lb/>
opinion, which were mentioned by the <lb/>
Minister of the Interior, had <lb/>
been still more clearly indicat<lb break="no"/>ed. So far as the main result <lb/>
of the discussion, especially as carried <lb/>
on by gentlemen on the other side of <lb/>
the House, went, it had only added to <lb/>
the information, which, he fancied, <lb/>

<cb/>

was pretty well possessed by the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior, that there are <lb/>
divergences of opinion with regard to <lb/>
the area of the proposed province <lb/>
or provinces. The reply which he <lb/>
proposed, to make on the gen<lb break="no"/>eral debate, was necessitated <lb/>
purely by the matters which were con<lb break="no"/>tained in the amendment, and by the <lb/>
statements made by hon. gentlemen <lb/>
in their speeches in support of the <lb/>
amendment. In his opinion the <lb/>
amendment was not relevant in any <lb/>
sense, to the main motion. It intro<lb break="no"/>duced something which had nothing <lb/>
whatever to do with the main motion, <lb/>
and if hon. gentlemen wish to go on <lb/>
record, they would have found better <lb/>
opportunity by moving a specific <lb/>
amendment. He did not take the <lb/>
point of order because he did not wish <lb/>
to allow himself to be open to the <lb/>
charge of an attempt to burk discuss<lb break="no"/>ion. Hon. gentlemen had attempted to <lb/>
read into his speech, on moving the <lb/>
motion, a meaning and significance it <lb/>
did not suggest. He had said distinc<lb break="no"/>tly that he did not ask an expression <lb/>
of opinion regarding the contents of <lb/>
of the Memorial addressed to the <lb/>
Ottawa Government, that the question <lb/>
of one or two or three provinces, or <lb/>
even annexation to Manitoba, was not <lb/>
even remotely concerned with the <lb/>
resolution. In spite of this plain state<lb break="no"/>ment, hon. genntlemen had persisted, <lb/>
through wilful misinterpretation or <lb/>
misconception, upon reading a con<lb break="no"/>trary meaning into it. They want to <lb/>
tell the Government, at Ottawa that <lb/>
the postponement of the consideration <lb/>
of the question of provincial institu<lb break="no"/>tions in the West was justifiable; and <lb/>
they want, more than that, to say that <lb/>
they do not want to hasten the change <lb/>
until some unanimity has been obtain<lb break="no"/>ed upon a subject which this debate <lb/>
has proved there never can be unani<lb break="no"/>mity. The Opposition practically say: <lb/>
Because the Dominion Government <lb/>
has discovered there are divergences of <lb/>
opinion, we are going to vote want of <lb/>
confidence against the local adminstra<lb break="no"/>tion by bringing in an amendment <lb/>
which simply proves that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment's discovery is correct. The Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government found there were <lb/>
divergences of opinion, therefore we <lb/>
will vote want of confidence in the <lb/>
local government because they hold <lb/>
one opinion regarding this question. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:PATR1">DR.PATRICK</persName> AND PRIVATE <lb/>
CONVERSATIONS.</p> 

<p>Before going into the general ques<lb break="no"/>tion, there were one or two features of <lb/>
the discussion he wished to notice. In <lb/>
speaking to the motion before, he had <lb/>
drawn attention to a statement of the <lb/>
hon. member for West Prince Albert, <lb/>
inade on the public platform, and a <lb/>
 private statement —that is, private as <lb/>
distinct from the platform or House <lb/>
 statement—which was attributed to him <lb/>
as being made in the rotund a of a <lb/>
Regina hotel. The hon. member from <lb/>
Yorkton (Dr.Patrick) took advantage <lb/>
of that statement, and accused him of <lb/>
having been guilty of a gross breach of <lb/>
parliamentary conduct in divulging a <lb/>
private conversation, and took advan<lb break="no"/>tage of the fact to divulge a private <lb/>
conversation between himself and the <lb/>
hon. member for Yorkton some three <lb/>
or four years ago. It was not neces<lb break="no"/>sary to explain to the House the diff<lb break="no"/>erence between a statement made <lb/>
openly in a public hotel and a state<lb break="no"/>ment made in a private conversation. <lb/>
Did he need to explain to his hon. <lb/>
friend the difference between a public <lb/>
statement, and a private conversation <lb/>
some years ago when according to his <lb/>
own statement, they were upon terms <lb/>
of a certain amount of political <lb/>
association? How long could political <lb/>
parties stand together if the moment <lb/>
a gentleman turned his coat, he was <lb/>
immediately at liberty to divulge and <lb/>
make publić, confidences which he re<lb break="no"/>ceived while intimately connected <lb/>

<cb/>

with former associations? He would <lb/>
leave the subject at that. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman, with his versatile nature, <lb/>
had very quickly picked up the met<lb break="no"/>hods of his latest political associates. <lb/>
Whether the hon. gentleman was a <lb/>
political chameleon or simply a pol<lb break="no"/>itical mirror, he at least reflected the <lb/>
ideas, the sentiments, the manners <lb/>
and methods of those with whom he <lb/>
so lately had associated. He congrat<lb break="no"/>ulated the hon. gentleman on having <lb/>
at last found a resting place—temporary <lb/>
 it may be; he hoped it would be per<lb break="no"/>manent—for his political soul. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter) It would be interesting to follow <lb/>
the hon. gentleman in his new career. <lb/>
What he would do, what he would <lb/>
say, when he would do it, when he <lb/>
would say it would always be matters <lb/>
of conjecture. According to his former <lb/>
record, he had never been a certain <lb/>
quantity. He congratulated the hon. <lb/>
gentleman's political associates upon <lb/>
having obtained the temporary aid of <lb/>
a gentleman whose record could never <lb/>
be considered more than a temporary <lb/>
auxiliary force. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
was ready to advance at times with his <lb/>
party, and then retreat; and as a <lb/>
matter of fact, he could size the hon. <lb/>
gentleman up generally as a political <lb/>
factor, a source of embarrassment to <lb/>
his friends, of hope to his political <lb/>
enemies, and of speculation on the <lb/>
part of the rest of the world. What a <lb/>
strange combination the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man completes—a combination which, <lb/>
apart from a very few discordant notes <lb/>
which have been expressed on nearly <lb/>
all the important points at issue in <lb/>
this debate, has been wandering and <lb/>
stumbling about in a sort of dreary <lb/>
silence of negation. This bantling po<lb break="no"/>litical party reminded him, in the <lb/>
words of the poet, of <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"An infant crying in the night <lb/>
An infant crying for the light <lb/>
And with no language but a cry." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
 
<p>The infant apparently was in such a <lb/>
powerless state that they had been <lb/>
obliged to send for the doctor. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) It would be interesting if they <lb/>
could only draw aside the veil of secre<lb break="no"/>cy which of course must envelope the <lb/>
proceedings of political parties, if they <lb/>
could only be admitted for an evening <lb/>
to the deliberations of these gentle<lb break="no"/>men when they are preparing their <lb/>
ammunition. It would be interesting <lb/>
to hear the hon. gentleman from <lb/>
Yorkton dilating on the golden beauty <lb/>
of silence to his leader (Mr. McDonald). <lb/>
or exchanging compliments with the <lb/>
hon. member for West Calgary (Mr. <lb/>
Bennett) in the way of assenting to the <lb/>
questionable maxim that the means <lb/>
justifies the end, in return for the hon. <lb/>
gentleman's disquisition as to <lb/>
consistency, which was given the other <lb/>
day. He would like to know whether <lb/>
the policy contained in the amendment <lb/>
was the result of the new political <lb/>
combination, or if it was simply a <lb/>
coincidence. If the former then they <lb/>
must attribute the authorship of the <lb/>
amendment to the hon. member from <lb/>
Yorkton: but he believed the only <lb/>
consolation that gentleman would have <lb/>
when he came to reflect upon it in the <lb/>
future, would be the conclusion in the <lb/>
words of Touchstone, "It's a very <lb/>
ill-formed thing, sir, but mine own." <lb/>
The Opposition had taken the position <lb/>
of Mr. Dooley, when he wrote his <lb/>
presidential address. Mr. Dooley in <lb/>
dealing with the great question of the <lb/>
Nicaragua Canal, said: "Something <lb/>
ought to be done for the Nicaragua <lb/>
Canal, but what the devil it is, I don't <lb/>
know." (Laughter.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE OPPOSITION ANALYSED.</p>

<p>He would like to analyse the position <lb/>
of this Opposition on the various <lb/>
provincial suggestions. We hear the <lb/>
hon. member for Qu'Appelle ( <persName ref="pers:MCDO10">Mr. <lb/>
McDonald</persName> ) urging a settlement of this <lb/>
question, but as to the details he <lb/>
preserves silence. He regrets the delay, <lb/>
and then indulges in unholy glee that <lb/>
the Federal Government has thrown <lb/>
us down. He will not support a motion <lb/>
which simply presses upon the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion Government the desirability of <lb/>
immediately settling the question. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member for West Calgary <lb/>
( <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> ), though an ardent <lb/>

<cb/>

provincialist, ranks himself with his <lb/>
leader and seems to be pleased that no <lb/>
action has been taken at Ottawa. He <lb/>
supports an amendment that simply <lb/>
means that the question should be <lb/>
postponed until the next legislature <lb/>
meets. <lb/></p>

<p>Then the hon, member from Yorkton <lb/>
( <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> ) has had certain and <lb/>
various opinions on this subject, and <lb/>
lest his new associates should be misled, <lb/>
his true position should now be explain<lb break="no"/>ed to them. (Laughter.) The hon. <lb/>
gentlemen has had various theories. <lb/>
While he was free to confess that <lb/>
obstinacy was a vice, under certain <lb/>
circumstances, it was yet a most de<lb break="no"/>sirable thing under others. The hon. <lb/>
member could be relieved from any <lb/>
charge of either consistency or obstin<lb break="no"/>acy so far as adherence to any phase <lb/>
of this important questien goes. He <lb/>
admitted the other day at one time <lb/>
favoring the one-province idea; on <lb/>
another occasion he had argued that <lb/>
the faith of the Dominion was pledged <lb/>
to the constitution of the three provin<lb break="no"/>cial districts Assiniboia, Alberta and <lb/>
Saskatchewan. Later on we find him <lb/>
with a new god. As late as 1899, he <lb/>
proposed a scheme of two provisional <lb/>
provinces. What that meant, the <lb/>
speaker did not exactly know. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman talks in the larger <lb/>
language of the earlier gods, sometimes, <lb/>
in discussing this question. His idea <lb/>
was to divide the country up in two, <lb/>
with an eastern and a western division, <lb/>
which should be made provinces at <lb/>
some indefinite date in the future. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman in supporting this <lb/>
proposition, argued that the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of provinces should be postponed <lb/>
as long as possible. It would be unde<lb break="no"/>sirable that some of the larger powers <lb/>
should he extended at that time. He <lb/>
proposed, however, that these two <lb/>
provisional provinces should be estab<lb break="no"/>ished under a Legislative union, with <lb/>
one Legislature governing the two of <lb/>
them; and thought this state of affairs <lb/>
might go on for a very long time—pos<lb break="no"/>sibly for 15 years. Then he drew an <lb/>
analogy between these two provisional <lb/>
provinces, and the Legislative union <lb/>
which existed between Upper and <lb/>
Lower Canada; and because they had <lb/>
been able, in spite of their many dif<lb break="no"/>ferences, to go on satisfactorily and <lb/>
amicably for 25 or 26 years, he thought <lb/>
that would be an early enough period <lb/>
for the two districts to be put into two <lb/>
provinces. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName>. On that occasion I <lb/>
pointed out that the States of the <lb/>
American Union were giving back <lb/>
many of their powers, even the bor<lb break="no"/>rowing powers. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>. Do I understand the <lb/>
hon. gentleman to say that he was in <lb/>
favor of the borrowing powers being <lb/>
extended to the two provisional pro<lb break="no"/>vinces? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName>. Certainly. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>. Well, that only in<lb break="no"/>dicates another of those quick changes <lb/>
in which the hon. gentleman is such <lb/>
an artist. Within less than six months <lb/>
of that date, the hon. gentleman in a <lb/>
pamphlet issued for the information of <lb/>
 his constituents,—at the time he was <lb/>
 getting his mandate,—made this <lb/>
statement: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I need scarcely point out to the older re<lb break="no"/>sidents of the Yorkton district that not only in <lb/>
the Legislature, but outside of it, I have lost no <lb/>
opportunity to urge that the matter of establish<lb break="no"/>ing a province or provinces should be delayed <lb/>
as long as possible. It is too soon to give our <lb/>
Legislature power to mortgage the future of <lb/>
this young country by borrowing money on the <lb/>
public credit." (Cheers.) <lb/></p> 
</quote>
 
<p>Of course. I do not seek to fasten on <lb/>
the hon. gentleman this vice of consist<lb break="no"/>ency: I am not accusing him of that. <lb/>
(Laughter.) I am simply trying to <lb/>
point out the various changes of opin<lb break="no"/>ion that the hon. gentleman has under<lb break="no"/>gone. I will continue to explain what <lb/>
his opinion was in 1899, and then go <lb/>
back six months from that date and <lb/>
see what his opinion was in October, <lb/>
1898, when he was getting his mandate. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman at that time in his <lb/>
proposal of two provisional provinces, <lb/>
certainly did not refer to the borrow<lb break="no"/>ing powers. If he did, then of course <lb/>
it saves him to a certain extent from <lb/>
the charge I have made against him. <lb/>
At the same time it leaves him in the <lb/>
position of, what was the use of two <lb/>
provisional provinces if they had all <lb/>
the powers of provinces? Then fancy <lb/>
the provisional provinces under one <lb/>
Legislative union, deciding how much <lb/>
each of them should borrow! If this <lb/>
proposition is not proof that the hon. <lb/>
gentleman is not guilty of the vice of <lb/>
consistency, it is certainly proof that he <lb/>
is inclined to indulge in some visionary <lb/>
schemes. Now, I will ask a little more <lb/>
attention to the statements the hon. <lb/>
gentleman made at the time he was <lb/>
receiving his mandate. This document <lb/>
I have in my hands is entitled "Facts <lb/>
bearing on the future of the North­ <lb/>
West Territories, compiled for the <lb/>
electors of Yorkton," and dated Octo<lb break="no"/>ber 10th, 1898. Now the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is discussing his amendment, <lb/>
more than once said that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had no mandate, that the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature had no mandate, nobody had a <lb/>
mandate, and we had to have a general <lb/>
election before a mandate could be <lb/>
given. The pamphlet says: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

<p>"Electors of Yorkton.—The agitaion which <lb/>
has been fostered in the neighborhood of Cal<lb break="no"/>gary for some years, to have the Provisional <lb/>
District of Alberta -separated from these Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories and established as a province with <lb/>
Calgary as its capital, and the opinion expressed by <lb/>
the Premier of the Territories on the question <lb/>
of the establishment of a province in the Ter<lb break="no"/>tories, make it incumbent on candidates for <lb/>
election to the next Legislature to discuss with <lb/>
electors, this most important question." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
 
 
<p>Now, for what reason, as a rule, do <lb/>
candidates discuss questions with their <lb/>
electors before elections? Is it not in <lb/>
order that the electors can give them <lb/>
an opinion, or for the purpose of telling <lb/>
electors what they, as candidates, <lb/>
believe regarding public questions, and <lb/>
ask to be sent to represent, those views <lb/>
in the Legislature? The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man says: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I need scarcely point out * * * I have lost <lb/>
no opportunity to urge that the matter be de<lb break="no"/>layed as long as possible. It is too soon to give <lb/>

<p>In October 1898 the statement was <lb/>
that, "It was too soon to give the <lb/>
Legislature the power to mortgage, the <lb/>
future of this young country by bor<lb break="no"/>rowing money, "—and in the following <lb/>
April, 1899, the hon. gentleman says he <lb/>
made the argument on the analogy of <lb/>
the American states that we should <lb/>
establish two provisional provinces <lb/>
with all the powers of a province to <lb/>
borrow money. Not only did the hon. <lb/>
gentleman state the fact of his convic<lb break="no"/>tion, but he indulged in a little pro<lb break="no"/>phetic map drawing, and showed what <lb/>
in his opinion these provinces should <lb/>
be. The hon. gentlenian says: "One <lb/>
province or two provinces—that is the <lb/>
conundrum," and then he undertakes <lb/>
in the blithe way in which, he under<lb break="no"/>takes to do other people's business, to <lb/>
carve out a very much enlarged pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba. He then indicates <lb/>

<p>figures point to an eastern and a west<lb break="no"/>ern province. It is true one of them is <lb/>
a little higher than the other and he <lb/>
may claim he referred to a northern <lb/>
and a southern province. The Prince <lb/>

<p rendition="simple:centre">WHAT TWO PROVINCES?</p> 

<p>Now the proposition of the amend<lb break="no"/>ment is two provinces. What two <lb/>
provinces? That is a fair question to <lb/>
ask hon. gentlemen who are allied with <lb/>
the question of two provinces, as <lb/>
against one. Will they be two provinc<lb break="no"/>es, north and south, which the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Public Works has shown will <lb/>
throw the whole of our organised ter<lb break="no"/>ritory into the southern province? Or <lb/>
will they be provinces, east and west, <lb/>
which I fancy certain members of the <lb/>
House would believe in. The hon. <lb/>
member for St. Albert ( <persName ref="pers:VILL1">Mr. Villeneuve</persName> ) <lb/>
is willing to go the length of three <lb/>
provinces, and is willing to put him<lb break="no"/>self in the hands of the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. He says we will have three <lb/>
provinces if that Government thinks it <lb/>
desirable to so constitute us. He <lb/>
practically says: "We are the crea<lb break="no"/>tures and they are the creators—do <lb/>
with us whatever you will." <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">QUESTION OF MANDATE.</p> 


  <!-- IC STOPPED HERE -->


<p>Then the hon. gentleman says we <lb/>
had no mandate. What about the <lb/>
mandate which the hon. gentleman <lb/>
received in the elections of 1898 accord<lb break="no"/>ing to his election address which I <lb/>
have just read? He says in it is incum<lb break="no"/>bent upon candidates to discuss with <lb/>
electors, this important question. Did <lb/>
he discuss it for the purpose of not <lb/>
getting a mandate, or for the purpose <lb/>
of coming down here and being able to <lb/>
say: Nobody had a mandate. Or did <lb/>
he discus it, as he states him<lb break="no"/>self, in view of the fact that, "the <lb/>
subject was certain to be raised in the <lb/>
next House, I have prepared this infor<lb break="no"/>mation." So far as a mandate is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, there seems to have been a <lb/>
mandate to the Legislature, judging <lb/>
by what almost every member has <lb/>
stated. The hon. member from West <lb/>
Calgary ( <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> ) has said so. He <lb/>
goes further and says the Government <lb/>
had a mandate to discuss non-con<lb break="no"/>troversial terms. The whole House <lb/>
will agree that we had a mandate, ex<lb break="no"/>cept possibly on the question of area. <lb/>
My opinion on the question of area is <lb/>
well known. The matter had been <lb/>
discussed in the House as early as 1896, <lb/>
and the House at that time declared <lb/>
most emphatically in favor of a single <lb/>
province. More than that, it has been <lb/>
so stated in the House and in the <lb/>
country. The hon. member for West <lb/>
Calgary referred to my speech of May, <lb/>
1900, as non-controversial. So it was. <lb/>
I purposely asked the House to leave <lb/>
controversial points out of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion. The question of area at that time <lb/>
would have been controversial. There<lb break="no"/>fore; we were not in a positon to <lb/>
make a recommendation with regard <lb/>
to it, but we were in a position to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss some of the general features of <lb/>
what our terms should be. I was <lb/>
anxious not to have a division of the <lb/>
House. Even then there were diver<lb break="no"/>gencies of opinion, but we were dis<lb break="no"/>cussing a feature of it on which there <lb/>
was no reason that we should differ. <lb/>
If I had then proposed the one province <lb/>
idea, judging by the opinion I have <lb/>
been able to gather from members of <lb/>
the House. I could have received a <lb/>
mandate, because I believe a majority <lb/>
of the House is in favor of one province. <lb/>
I did not think it would be of particu<lb break="no"/>lar value to obtain an expression of <lb/>
opinion at that time, and therefore I <lb/>
did not ask for it. I wanted unanimity <lb/>
on the most important subject, that <lb/>
we might spork as one man to the <lb/>
Dominion Government. We knew <lb/>
perfectly well that we could not be <lb/>
unanimous on the question of area: <lb/>
we could not be then, and we are not <lb/>
now. We will never be able to get this <lb/>
House or the country to agree on it. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:PATR1">DR. PATRICK</persName>'s BILL OF RIGHTS.</p> 

<p>The hon. member for Yorkton says <lb/>
his proposition is that we should gath<lb break="no"/>er the views of the people and incor<lb break="no"/>porate them in a Bill of Rights. Im<lb break="no"/>agine the hon. member going all over <lb/>
the country gathering the views of <lb/>
168,00 people on the question of one or <lb/>
two provinces, and then embodying <lb/>
them in a Bill of Rights! <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> My idea was to make it <lb/>
an issue at the elections. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> —I did not say those <lb/>
were the words of the hon. gentleman <lb/>
and I do not wish to put a strained <lb/>
interpretation on his views. But he <lb/>
says we should gather the views of the <lb/>
people. I would like to picture the <lb/>
hon. gentleman running around ob<lb break="no"/>taining the views of 168,000 people and <lb/>
afterwards incorporating them into a <lb/>
Bill of Rights. Can you image the <lb/>
Bill of Rights the hon. gentleman <lb/>
would draw after doing all this? It <lb/>
would be just as variegated, just as <lb/>
contradictory, just as meaningless as <lb/>
the longwinded amendment he has <lb/>
just introduced into the House. It <lb/>
would still contain the various <lb/>
provincial propositions. In the Bill of <lb/>
Rights he would have his one province <lb/>

<cb/>

idea, his two province idea, his double-<lb break="yes"/>headed-two-province idea, and he <lb/>
would have the hon. member for St. <lb/>
Albert's (Mr. Villeneuve) idea of three <lb/>
provinces, if the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment wanted it—and I am perfectly <lb/>
certain if the whole country were polled <lb/>
that one man would be found to favor <lb/>
annexation to Manitoba. So that it <lb/>
would be an important contribution to <lb/>
the literature on this subject and great<lb break="no"/>ly aid in its settlement if we had the <lb/>
general expression of opinion. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) Would would that aid the Dominion <lb/>
Government? Would a Bill of Rights <lb/>
drawn after a general election in which <lb/>
five or six, or fifteen or twenty opinions <lb/>
were expressed, furnish the Dominion <lb/>
Government with any further know<lb break="no"/>ledge, or put at a conclusion, especially <lb/>
after they have declare that they <lb/>
already know there is a divergence of <lb/>
opinion? If an expression of opinion <lb/>
on one side of the subject upon which <lb/>
the Government was well aware there <lb/>
was a divergence of opinion, was a <lb/>
block to the settement of the question, <lb/>
how would a settlement be aided, <lb/>
either by going back to the country and <lb/>
asking the opinion of the people, or in <lb/>
drafting the Bill of Rights the hon. <lb/>
gentleman suggested? Would the <lb/>
Dominion Government be in any better <lb/>
position? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName>—Yes. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—Of course the hon. <lb/>
gentleman says yes, but if he can <lb/>
tell me how much more the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment at Ottawa would know than they <lb/>
know today, except that there was a <lb/>
divergence of opinion, I would be glad <lb/>
to hear it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—The whole point is <lb/>
really this: In the speech which the <lb/>
hon. gentleman made on 2nd May, 1900, <lb/>
he said the question of area was a con<lb break="no"/>troversial question and one upon which <lb/>
no opinion was taken from this House. <lb/>
Therefore, on this question, there <lb/>
should be an expression of opinion <lb/>
before the country was pledged to it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—What has that got to <lb/>
do with the question I am discussion? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—Everything. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—I am not discussing <lb/>
whether the terms of my speech in <lb/>
1900 were controversial; what I am <lb/>
saying is: Would the consideration of <lb/>
the subject be aided or furthered so far <lb/>
as the Dominion Government is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, by coming back to the House, <lb/>
or drafting this wonderful Bill of <lb/>
Rights? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—Certainly. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—What further would <lb/>
it disclose? What further informa<lb break="no"/>tion would it give, except what there <lb/>
was, as the Government was already <lb/>
aware, a divergence of opinion? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—For this reason, that <lb/>
the Dominion Government would <lb/>
know that this Government had auth<lb break="no"/>ority from the House to pledge this <lb/>
country to one or two provinces, <lb/>
whether there was a divergence of <lb/>
opinion or not. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—The hon. gentleman <lb/>
is again introducing an entirely differ<lb break="no"/>ent point. I am not arguing whether <lb/>
this Government had a mandate to <lb/>
pledge this House, because the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment never did pledge this House. <lb/>
What I am arguing is, that so far as the <lb/>
Dominion Government is concerned, <lb/>
they would not be in a bit better posi<lb break="no"/>tion to settle a question which they <lb/>
must settle ultimately, the responsibil<lb break="no"/>ity for which rests upon themselves; <lb/>
by coming back to this House they <lb/>
would still know there was a diverg<lb break="no"/>ence of opinion, but they would also <lb/>
know there was a <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MAJORITY FOR ONE PROVINCE</p> 

<p>in this House. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
will no doubt be perfectly satisfied <lb/>
when he discovers that the majority <lb/>
of this House are in favor of one pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and that the subsequent ratifica<lb break="no"/>tion of our proposals to the Federal <lb/>
Government justifies them. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman at great length argued out <lb/>
this question on the question of agency, <lb/>
and in making reply I need not go <lb/>
beyond the bounds of elementary law. <lb/>
I can tell him that if an agent makes a <lb/>
proposition without the authority of <lb/>
his principal, the subsequent ratifica<lb break="no"/>tion by his principal makes it a perfect<lb break="no"/>ly good bargain. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>. That's right. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>. So that if it is any <lb/>
satisfaction to the hon. gentleman to <lb/>
know it, I firmly believe and have <lb/>
every confidence in what I know is the <lb/>
opinion of a majority of the members <lb/>
of the House, and we can easily get a <lb/>
ratification of our position on that oc<lb break="no"/>casion. So that coming back to the <lb/>
question, you might keep going to <lb/>
Ottawa and coming back to this House, <lb/>
drafting Bills of Rights and discussing <lb/>
and arguing for the next 20 years, and <lb/>
you will never arrive at a more definite <lb/>
conclusion than the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has arrived at, and that I arrived <lb/>
at in 1900, that that question is contro<lb break="no"/>versial and that there are divergencies <lb/>
of opinion. That merely is all that <lb/>
this amendment has shown; that is all <lb/>
the amendment is worth, and every<lb break="no"/>body knew it before the amendment <lb/>
was brought in. If what was admitted <lb/>
in this House and was known to every<lb break="no"/>body, was a block to our negotiations: <lb/>
if the Dominion Government sent us <lb/>
back because of divergences of opinion <lb/>
what they knew, and we knew, and <lb/>
everybody else knew, and which was <lb/>
naturally brought about by an expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion in favor of one province, <lb/>
then I would say: Suppose we went <lb/>
back to them and said, "we have been <lb/>
converted, the hon. gentleman from <lb/>
Yorkton has a wonderful double-bar<lb break="no"/>relled two province scheme," would <lb/>
not the Federal Government still say <lb/>
there were divergences of opinion? <lb/>
The hon. gentleman seems to think, as <lb/>
long as we accept his idea, there are no <lb/>
divergences of opinion. (Laughter.) <lb/>
" Simply accept my doctrine, and <lb/>
there is no diversity of opinion,"—al<lb break="no"/>though we would still have the various <lb/>
opinions as to whether the two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should run north and south, or <lb/>
east and west. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:SIFT2">MR. SIFTON</persName>'S OBJECTIONS <lb/></p> 

<p>What are the difficulties as expressed <lb/>
in Mr. Sifton's letter? First, sparseness <lb/>
of population made it undesirable. <lb/>
This sparseness was not brought about <lb/>
by the memorial sent to Ottawa, so <lb/>
that, if that is the principal reason for <lb/>
the Federal Government not acting, <lb/>
the local administration cannot be <lb/>
blamed for being sent back. I need not <lb/>
advance the argument that, if sparse<lb break="no"/>ness of population is a bar to the im<lb break="no"/>mediate settlement, what about sparse<lb break="no"/>ness of population in case two provine<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

es were formed, as the hon. gentleman­ <lb/>
proposes; especially if the country is <lb/>
divided east and west, leaving the <lb/>
northern province without any popula<lb break="no"/>tion at all. <lb/></p> 

<p>Next as to the increase of population, <lb/>
which will bring about such a change <lb/>
in conditions that provincial institu<lb break="no"/>tions should not be established. That <lb/>
is an argument which, I believe, was <lb/>
never dreamed and cannot surely be <lb/>
blamed against the local administra<lb break="no"/>tion. The next position taken by the <lb/>
Federal authorities is regarding the <lb/>
divergence of opinion as to one or two <lb/>
provinces. Simply because we express<lb break="no"/>ed one of the various divergent opin<lb break="no"/>ions, that is the one reason discovered <lb/>
by these hon. gentlemen why the <lb/>
Dominion Government refused to take <lb/>
action. Was the divergence of opinion <lb/>
first suggested by our talking about one <lb/>
province, or was it not suggested for <lb/>
years in the debates in this House? If <lb/>
we suggested one province, was that a <lb/>
sufficient reason for the Government <lb/>
to say: There are other opinions,—go <lb/>
back, or, to use the quotation from the <lb/>
hon. member for Yorkton, we were <lb/>
told to go 'way back and find out <lb/>
something. Suppose we should accept <lb/>
this gratuitous invitation, what would <lb/>
we have discovered? We would have <lb/>
found there were divergences of opin<lb break="no"/>ion as to one or two provinces. We <lb/>
would then go back to Ottawa and <lb/>
say: We have accepted your invita<lb break="no"/>tion and gone back to the Legislature. <lb/>
What have you discovered? We <lb/>
have discovered, in the language <lb/>
of Mr. Sifton's letter, that there are <lb/>
divergences of opinion as to one or <lb/>
more provinces. Then they would <lb/>
say: You better go back to the coun<lb break="no"/>try and follow the suggestion of the <lb/>
hon. member for Yorkton, and find out <lb/>
the opinion of the 168,000 people. Well, <lb/>
we would come back and have a gener<lb break="no"/>al election, and presuming we would <lb/>
still be in charge of the negotiations, <lb/>
we would go to Ottawa and relate our <lb/>
discovery. Mr. Sifton would ask us <lb/>
what we had to report, and we would <lb/>
say: We have gone 'way back' to <lb/>
the people and have discovered that <lb/>
you were perfectly right in stating in <lb/>
your letter that there were divergences <lb/>
of opinion. Then let us imagine the <lb/>
impossible, and presume the hon, <lb/>
gentlemen appealed to the country <lb/>
on this wonderful double-barrelled <lb/>
two province thing and got suffi<lb break="no"/>cient support to put them in power, <lb/>
and they go to conduct negotiations <lb/>
at Ottawa. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
for Yorkton will have to draw a <lb/>
new map and have a conference with <lb/>
the members for Prince Albert about <lb/>
it. (Laughter.) He goes down and <lb/>
makes his two province proposition, <lb/>
but I have discovered there is a diverg<lb break="no"/>ence of opinion: you better go back to <lb/>
the Legislature—and so on, ad finitum, <lb/>
ad absurdum. (Laughter.) <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>. Was not that the way <lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>. They went back <lb/>

or not—sat down and settled it. <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—No, they did not. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—Yes, they did. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—Of course the hon, <lb/>

understood there was a little province <lb/>
down by the sea that they did not <lb/>
consult. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—That caused all the <lb/>
trouble. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—Very likely, but the <lb/>
hon. gentleman said they did. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) After we had been up and down, <lb/>
and backward and forward, in these <lb/>
numerous trips, we would still be in <lb/>
the position, if leaving for the 500th <lb/>
time, that there were divergences of <lb/>
opinion. The hon. gentleman has <lb/>
suggested that we might have come <lb/>
back tot e House and ask for futher <lb/>
instructions. Suppose we did, how <lb/>
much further would we have been on? <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WHERE IS THE OPPOSITION MANDATE?</p> 

<p>When hon. gentlemen talk so glibly <lb/>
about no mandate, and say we had no <lb/>
right to express an opinion as to one <lb/>
or more provinces, let us take the <lb/>
amendment they have submitted, and <lb/>
I ask them where did they get their <lb/>
mandate for expressing their definite <lb/>
and clear-cut opinion in favor of two <lb/>
provinces? The immediate and prac<lb break="no"/>tical result of the amendment if car<lb break="no"/>ried, would be to convey to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion Government that there are <lb/>
divergences of opinion. What do the <lb/>
gentlemen say? Here is the operative <lb/>
part of their amendment: "That is the way they <lb/>
propose to do away with the question <lb/>
of divergences of views! They are <lb/>
taking the position of the Three <lb/>
Tailors of Tooley Street—" we, the <lb/>
people of England." <lb/></p>

<cb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—So are you. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—No, if you read the <lb/>
Memorial, you will find that it is <lb/>
directly stated that we simply express<lb break="no"/>ed the views of the members of the <lb/>
Government. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—Yes, that is it, the <lb/>
"Three Tailors of Tooley Street." <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—No, I think it ill <lb/>
becames hon. gentleman who are in a <lb/>
hopeless and helpless minority to sug<lb break="no"/>gest that we, having the great majority <lb/>
of this House and the country at our <lb/>
back, are the "Three Tailors of Tooley <lb/>
Street." Now, the amendment pro<lb break="no"/>ceeds to say that it will be the duty of <lb/>
the next Legislature to adopt a Bill of <lb/>
Rights demanding that the Territories <lb/>
be established into two provinces. Is <lb/>
there anything more absurd or presum<lb break="no"/>tious in the Government asking to be <lb/>
created into one province than there is <lb/>
in an insignificant minority dictating <lb/>
to the next Legislature the sort of <lb/>
legislation that should be adopted with <lb/>
regard to exactly the same question? <lb/>
I put it again to the House, whether <lb/>
the application of the "Three Tailors <lb/>
of Tooley Street" applies to the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition side of the House or to this side. <lb/>
The hon. gentlemen are not only at<lb break="no"/>tempting to speak for this House, but <lb/>
dictating to the next Legislature—to <lb/>
the future members of this House and <lb/>
to Parliament itself, as to their duty. <lb/>
If we had no mandate, what mandate <lb/>
have the hon. gentlemen to contem<lb break="no"/>plate doing what the amendment <lb/>
proposes? The whole question boils <lb/>
down to this: They say to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, you have expressed an opinion <lb/>
in favor of one province, therefore we <lb/>
will declare want of confidence in you <lb/>
by introducing a resolution which <lb/>
distinctly advocates two provinces. <lb/>
They do not content themselves by <lb/>
expressing their opinion, but they go <lb/>
further and say it will be the duty of <lb/>
the next Legislature to ask for two <lb/>
provinces, notwithstanding the diver<lb break="no"/>gent views. It does not matter wheth<lb break="no"/>er a majority of the House, or of the <lb/>
country, favor one province, or wheth<lb break="no"/>er the member for St. Albert favors <lb/>
three provinces, or whether Mr. Ben<lb break="no"/>nett favors annexation with Manitoba, <lb/>
but I, the member for Yorkton, <lb/>
say it will be the duty of the <lb/>
next House to declare for <lb/>
two provinces. Wherein are we dif<lb break="no"/>ferent from the hon. gentleman? <lb/>
except that we went to Ottawa clothed <lb/>
with all the authority of a Government, <lb/>
having the right of a Government, <lb/>
possessing the confidence of this House <lb/>
and the country to speak definitely on <lb/>
this subject. The long amendment is <lb/>
a mixture of a definite policy and an <lb/>
admission of impotency. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman (  <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> ) says we may <lb/>
not be able to obtain at the outset <lb/>
what we want. Is that the proper <lb/>
spirit in which representatives should <lb/>
go to Ottawa to press the claim of <lb/>
our people? Is that the sort of men <lb/>
the people are likely to trust with their <lb/>
most vital interests? Is that the spirit <lb/>
in which men should go forth to war <lb/>
—we are afraid we won't get all we <lb/>
ask for, because we are merely the <lb/>
creatures and you the creators. Yet <lb/>
they then turn around and blame this <lb/>
Government for suggesting at Ottawa <lb/>
one phase of a very large question,— <lb/>
for daring to suggest to our creators <lb/>
what should or should not be done. <lb/>
Well, so long as I purpose not only <lb/>
to express an opinion to our "crea<lb break="no"/>tors," but also to enforce those opinions <lb/>
whether we are creatures or creators. <lb/>
(Cheers.) We are told that because <lb/>
we suggested the one province idea, <lb/>
we have precipitated annexation to <lb/>
Manitoba. Who suggested the one <lb/>
province idea? I do not claim to be <lb/>
the discoverer of it. I have not very <lb/>
strongly expressed the opinion, but the <lb/>
opinion of the same men, the sensible <lb/>
men is largely in favor of one province. <lb/>
There are other views, but the sane <lb/>
view is in favor of one province, and <lb/>
always was. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName>. What about the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for East Calgary? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>. That gentleman (Mr. <lb/>
Cross) holds different views than I do; <lb/>
but if there is one argument against <lb/>
the insanity of the proposal of the Op<lb break="no"/>position, it is the fact that they think <lb/>
they are unanimous in favor of it. <lb/>
(Laughter.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">ANNEXATION TO MANITOBA.</p> 

<p>It is easy for hon. gentlemen to take <lb/>
advantage of the feeling against an<lb break="no"/>nexation in Assiniboia, and cry <lb/>
"wolf" to frighten the people there: <lb/>
but a mere expression of opinion on <lb/>
their part, no matter how insane or <lb/>
inconsiderate that opinion may be, will <lb/>
not help the final settlement of the <lb/>
question at Ottawa. Because we con<lb break="no"/>sider one province to be the best, is not <lb/>
going to precipitate annexation to <lb/>
Manitoba. More than that, I say that <lb/>
the suggestion of two provinces is very <lb/>
much more likely to lead to annexa<lb break="no"/>tion, and for this reason: We have <lb/>
heard a great deal about the broad <lb/>
Canadian spirit which should mark <lb/>
our discussions of the subject. Very <lb/>
well, I think I am a broad enough <lb/>
Canadian to discuss most questions <lb/>
fairly, but when it comes to discussing <lb/>
what almost exclusively concerns the <lb/>
present welfare and the future prosper<lb break="no"/>ity, the future fate of this great coun<lb break="no"/>try, I am disposed to be a little more <lb/>
of a westerner than anything else. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MULTIPLICATION OF PROVINCES.</p> 

<p>It seemed to him from the broad <lb/>
Canadian standpoint, however, that <lb/>
the argument of the eastern people <lb/>
would be against a multiplication of <lb/>
provinces in the west. The <lb/>
people of the east would say they <lb/>
were not going to make more <lb/>
than two provinces in the west, and <lb/>
some looked on Manitoba as the west. <lb/>
He thought the Dominion Government <lb/>
and Parliament would deal with the <lb/>
matter from a broad Canadian view <lb/>
and that there would be two provinces <lb/>
in Western Canada. He did not be<lb break="no"/>lieve in the annexation of any portion <lb/>
to Manitoba under any terms or cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances. They would not likely <lb/>
be successful in opposing annexation <lb/>
if they were divided up into a number <lb/>
of camps and refused to join together <lb/>
on the general question. As to the <lb/>
argument of the western portion of the <lb/>
Territories having one market and the <lb/>
eastern portion another, he thought <lb/>
this would be a desirable feature in the <lb/>
one province. For his own part, he <lb/>
believed that a Hudson's Bay railway, <lb/>
whether built by the people of the <lb/>
Territories or under whatever name <lb/>
they might be known, would solve a <lb/>
great many difficulties, and afford the <lb/>
shortest passage to England. The <lb/>
idea of two provinces, northern and <lb/>
southern, that each might have its <lb/>
own transcontinental line, would be a <lb/>
disadvantage, not a benefit, for the <lb/>
province would be at the mercy of a <lb/>
road with which it alone could deal, <lb/>
compared with one large province able <lb/>
to play one railway against the other. <lb/>
The argument was on the side of one <lb/>
province <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">CONTROLLING ALL ITS LINES.</p> 

<p>The Opposition spoke of co-operaton <lb/>
between several provinces, but he <lb/>
asked, did the provinces do so? The <lb/>
railway companies would rather deal <lb/>
with two or three comparatively small <lb/>
provinces than with the Government <lb/>
of one big, strong province. He denied <lb/>
that a large province in proportion to <lb/>
area cost more than a small one. The <lb/>
reverse was true, not only in business <lb/>
matters but in government. He ridi<lb break="no"/>culed the idea that by having two <lb/>
provinces they would thus obtain an <lb/>
additional fifty thousand dollars from <lb/>
the Federal Government for purposes <lb/>
of legislation. All the legislative <lb/>
machinery would be doubled. Adapt<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

ing the phrase "Little Englanders," <lb/>
he characterised the members of the <lb/>
Opposition as "Little Westerners." <lb/>
They were not acting in a broad western <lb/>
spirit, let alone a good broad Canadian <lb/>
spirit. Only a few days ago he read <lb/>
articles in Maritime Province papers <lb/>
favoring the union of those provinces <lb/>
into one. There were enough people <lb/>
in the east advocating a narrow policy <lb/>
without them doing so and enough <lb/>
people in Manitoba favoring annexa<lb break="no"/>tion without members of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ial House acting as their advocates. <lb/>
The Opposition confessed their <choice><sic>inabili-lb break="no"/>ity</sic><corr>inibility</corr></choice> to deal with the subject, by refusing <lb/>
to take a stand on the all-important <lb/>
point. The Government had been <lb/>
accused, like the boy and the jug of <lb/>
nuts of trying to get too much at once, <lb/>
but they only asked what the people <lb/>
had a right to. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Opposition would go crawling <lb/>
and begging a nut at a time. Gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite occupied the position of <lb/>
narrow and partisan men not trying to <lb/>
work together for the desire of the <lb/>
people but like men trying to work to <lb/>
thwart the Government in their efforts, <lb/>
not for the benefit of the country but <lb/>
for their own selfish ends. The House <lb/>
and country could not agree as to areas, <lb/>
and never would. The Opposition <lb/>
could not agree. The Government <lb/>
supporters could not, but they had <lb/>
sunk all their differences and united on <lb/>
broad terms and would leave the mat<lb break="no"/>ter to the Ottawa authorities who had <lb/>
full knowledge of these differences. <lb/>
What they wanted was some solution. <lb/>
Mr. Haultain resumed his seat amid <lb/>
cheers, having spoken for an hour and <lb/>
forty minutes. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE VOTE.</p> 

<p>The House then divided on Mr. <lb/>
Haultain's motion expressing regret <lb/>
that the Dominion Government had <lb/>
not introduced legislation at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent session of Parliament granting <lb/>
provincial autonomy to the Territories. <lb/>
The motion was carried by twenty-<lb break="yes"/>one to seven. the vote being: <lb/></p> 

<p>Yeas—Messrs. Haultain, Sifton, Bul<lb break="no"/>yea, DeVeber, Brown, Fisher, McIn<lb break="no"/>tyre, Meyers, Elliott, Cross, Rosenroll, <lb/>
Lake, Smith, Shera, Prince, Connell, <lb/>
McCauley, Simpson, Wallace, Gillis <lb/>
and Hawkes. <lb/></p> 

<p>Nay—Messrs. McDonald, Bennett, <lb/>
Patrick, Villeneuve, McKay, McLeod, <lb/>
Annable. Messrs. Greeley and Mc<lb break="no"/>Diarmid were not present when the <lb/>
vote was taken. The House then <lb/>
adjourned. <lb/></p>
