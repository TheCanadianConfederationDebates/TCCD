<p>The fourth session of the fourth Leg<lb break="no"/>islative Assembly of the North-West <lb/>
Territories was opened in a most aus<lb break="no"/>picious manner by His Honor Lieuten<lb break="no"/>aut Governor. Forget last Thursday <lb/>
afternoon. The crowd in attendance <lb/>
was unusually large and very great <lb/>
interest was manifested in the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings. The public schools were dismiss<lb break="no"/>ed in order that the scholars might be <lb/>
enabled to be present and thereby get <lb/>
an insight into some of the methods of <lb/>
procedure under our system of govern<lb break="no"/>ment.</p> 

<p>Shortly after three o'clock Madame <lb/>
Forget arrived, accompanied by her <lb/>
sisters, Mrs. Dr Mount and Madame <lb/>
Freichette, of Montreal, and Mrs. <lb/>
Graham of File Hills. The Lieutenant <lb/>
Governor drove in a four-in-hand car<lb break="no"/>riage from Government House escorted <lb/>
by a squad of the N. W. M. P. under <lb/>
command of Inspector Taylor. His <lb/>
Honor was accompanied by Colonel <lb/>
Macdonnell, D. S. O., as aide-de-camp, <lb/>
and Commissioner Perry, Surgeon<lb break="no"/>Major Bell, M.D., Captain Gilpin <lb/>
Brown and A. W. G. Bourget, private <lb/>
secretary. He was received by Prem<lb break="no"/>ier Hauitain, Hon. A. L. Sifton and <lb/>
Hon. G. H. W. Bulyea, members of the <lb/>
Government. Having been conducted <lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Speaker</persName> and Gentlemen of the <lb/>
Legislative Assembly:— <lb/></p> 

<p>It is with much pleasure that I wel<lb break="no"/>come you to this the fourth session of <lb/>
the fourth Legislative Assembly. The <lb/>
time at which you meet is one charat<lb break="no"/>erised by great and unexampled pros<lb break="no"/>sperity in all sections of our country. <lb/>
New settlements with bright prospects <lb/>
are springing up in every direction, <lb/>
and the succession of excellent crops <lb/>
during recent years tends to encourage <lb/>
the continuation of the immigration <lb/>
movement so noticeable at present. <lb/></p> 

<p>During the month of September last <lb/>
the Territories were honored by the <lb/>
presence of Their Royal Highnesses <lb/>
the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and <lb/>
York, now the Prince and Princess of <lb/>
Wales. Every effort possible was <lb/>
made to make the visit pleasant and <lb/>
memorable, and I am assured, Their <lb/>
Royal Highnesses were much gratified <lb/>
at the evidences of sterling loyalty <lb/>
shown in the numerous addresses pre<lb break="no"/>sented by the several municipalities <lb/>
and other public bodies in the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies. <lb/></p> 

<p>The unprecedented crop of last sea<lb break="no"/>son brought the transportatiou ques<lb break="no"/>tion into prominence, and demonstrat<lb break="no"/>ed the necessity for improved and <lb/>
enlarged accommodation for shipping <lb/>
and carrying grain to eastern points <lb/>
after the close of lake navigation. Ow<lb break="no"/>ing to the representations made to the <lb/>
Canadian Pacific authorities by my <lb/>
Government through the Department of <lb/>
Agriculture the evils of the grain block<lb break="no"/>ade existing a few weeks ago have been <lb/>
considerably mitigated by shipments <lb/>
to Duluth via North Portal. As a re<lb break="no"/>sult the farmers are now in receipt of <lb/>
an increase in prices amounting to at <lb/>
least ten per cent. over prices formerly <lb/>
obtaining. <lb/></p> 

<p>During the recess my Government <lb/>
has been in communication with the <lb/>
Federal Government upon the matters <lb/>
set forth in your memorial to His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency in Council of the second day of <lb/>
May, 1900, and as a result a conference <lb/>
was held with a sub-cominittee of the <lb/>
Privy Council appointed for that pur<lb break="no"/>pose. In addition to verbal represen<lb break="no"/>tations made, a statement in writing <lb/>
was submitted on behalf of my Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. This statement together with <lb/>
reply of the Federal authorities– 
    <lb/>which I regret to say has not yet been <lb/>
received -will be communicated to you <lb/>
at the earliest possible moment and <lb/>
you will be asked to take action with <lb/>
respect to the important questions <lb/>
dealt with therein. <lb/></p> 

<p>Owing to the great increase of popu<lb break="no"/>lation in the Territories provision will <lb/>
have to be made for increased repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in the Legislature and a <lb/>
measure dealing with that subject will <lb/>
be submitted to you. <lb/></p> 

<p>Statements of receipts and expendi<lb break="no"/>tures of the past year together with <lb/>
estimates of the public requirements <lb/>
during the present year will be laid <lb/>
before you. <lb/></p> 

<p>I now leave you to your deliberations <lb/>
confident that you will, under Divine <lb/>
guidance, give your most earnest con<lb break="no"/>sideration to the matters brought to <lb/>
your attention. <lb/></p>
