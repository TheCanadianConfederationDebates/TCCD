<p>The third session of the Fifth Leg<lb break="no"/>islative Assembly of the North-West <lb/>
Territories was formally opened at <lb/>
10.30 o'clock this morning by His <lb/>
Honor <persName ref="pers:FORG1">Lieutenant Governor Forget</persName>. <lb/>
His Honor was accompanied by Col. <lb/>
Macdonell, D. S. O., A. D. C.; Asst. <lb/>
Comm'r. McIllree, Supt. Wilson and <lb/>
Insp. Ritchie of the R. N. W. M. P., <lb/>
and was escorted by the usual guard <lb/>
of honor of the R. N. W. M. P., un<lb break="no"/>der command of Capt. Worsley. The <lb/>
force looked particularly well in their <lb/>
new uniforms, worn for the first <lb/>
time, with the blue facings worn by <lb/>
all military honored with the desig<lb break="no"/>nation "Royal." <lb/></p> 

<p>Inside the Chamber was a good at<lb break="no"/>tendance of Members, among the <lb/>
number being Premier Haultain, Mr. <lb/>
Bulyea, Mr. Elliott, Speaker Gillis, <lb/>
Deputy Speaker Rutherford, Dr. De <lb/>
Veber, Mr. Brown, Mr. McIntyre, <lb/>
Capt. Meyers, Mr. MacNutt, Mr. <lb/>
Young, Mr. Secord, Mr. Wallace, Mr. <lb/>
Finlay. Mr. Clinkskill, Mr. Lambert, <lb/>
Mr. Talbot, Mr. Annable, Mr. Hawk<lb break="no"/>es, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Shera, Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Kay, Mr. Fisher, (Banff), Mr. Lake. <lb/>
The attendance of citizens was smal<lb break="no"/>ler than usual, owing to the counter <lb/>
attraction of the Vice-Regal visit. <lb/>
Among the few visitors present was <lb/>
Senator Perley. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">SPEECH FROM THE THRONE.</p> 

<p>After the preliminary ceremonies <lb/>
His Honor opened the Session with <lb/>
the following speech from the throne: <lb/>
Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the <lb/></p>
    <p>
Legislative Assembly: <lb/></p> 

<p>It is my agreeable duty to welcome <lb/>
you to the Third Session of the Fifth <lb/>
Legislative Assembly of the North­<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p>We have much cause for thankful<lb break="no"/>ness in the continuation of the pros<lb break="no"/>perity that has been so marked a <lb/>
feature of our people for several <lb/>
years past. Though the season has <lb/>
not been an ideal one, yet through<lb break="no"/>out the greater part of these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories the harvest is bountiful, and <lb/>
the advance in prices of all grain <lb/>
products will do much to compensate <lb/>
for losses that have been met with in <lb/>
a few localities. <lb/></p> 

<p>By a happy coincidence the occasion <lb/>
of the opening of your Session is also <lb/>
the occasion of the farewell visit of <lb/>
Their Excellencies the Governor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral and the Countess of Minto to <lb/>
Regina and the North-West. I am <lb/>
sure that you will join with me in <lb/>
offering a hearty welcome to Their <lb/>
Excellencies as well as in expressing <lb/>
sincere regret at their approaching <lb/>
departure from Canada upon the con<lb break="no"/>clusion of His Excellency's official <lb/>
connection with our Country and al<lb break="no"/>so in expressing the confident hope <lb/>
that when they leave our shores <lb/>
they will carry with them and ever <lb/>
retain that generous interest in our <lb/>
affairs and welfare that has been so <lb/>
prominent a feature of Their Excel<lb break="no"/>lencies' life with us. In the North<lb break="no"/>West particularly, Her Excellency's <lb/>
name will long be held in grateful <lb/>
remembrance, and many hospitals <lb/>
established or aided during the past <lb/>
five years will stand as lasting mon<lb break="no"/>uments to her womanly sympathy <lb/>
and kindness of heart. <lb/></p> 

<p>It is not proposed by my Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to introduce legislation at this <lb/>
Session dealing with any of those <lb/>
large public questions that might well <lb/>
call for your consideration, but a <lb/>
number of Bills to amend existing <lb/>
enactments in order to meet chang<lb break="no"/>ing conditions will be submitted to <lb/>
you. It is a matter for gratification <lb/>
to note that some of the private <lb/>
Bills that are being promoted speak <lb/>
loudly of the forward march of the <lb/>
Territories. The creation of new <lb/>
cities and increased municipal powers <lb/>
are being asked for; the Higher Edu<lb break="no"/>cation is seeking to effect a footing <lb/>
upon a permanent basis; and public <lb/>
enterprise is beginning to look for <lb/>
avenues in which to employ its en<lb break="no"/>ergies. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Public Accounts and Reports <lb/>
of the work of the several Depart<lb break="no"/>ments for the past year will be laid <lb/>
before you for your consideration. <lb/></p> 

<p>Estimates of the amounts required <lb/>
to complete the public services for <lb/>
the current year, as well as those re<lb break="no"/>quired for next year, have been pre<lb break="no"/>pared, all of which, will, I trust, <lb/>
meet with your approval. The lib<lb break="no"/>eral response on the part of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and Parliament of Canada <lb/>
to the financial representations of <lb/>
my Government should enable you <lb/>
this year to meet in some adequate <lb/>
measure the more immediately pres<lb break="no"/>sing necessities which your restricted <lb/>
constitutional status permits you to <lb/>
deal with. <lb/></p> 

<p>I have to express the regret of my <lb/>
Government that the movement to<lb break="no"/>wards the establishment of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories upon a Provincial basis has <lb/>
not been materially forwarded dur<lb break="no"/>ing the past year. All correspon<lb break="no"/>dence on the subject will be submit<lb break="no"/>ted to you. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of <lb/>
Legislative Assembly: <lb/></p> 

<p>I leave you to your work in the <lb/>
firm conviction that your labors <lb/>
will be in the best interests of our <lb/>
country and, under Divine Guidance, <lb/>
result in much good to the <choice><sic>common<lb break="no"/>weal</sic><corr>commonwealth</corr></choice>. <lb/></p>
