<p><persName ref="pers:GILL3">Speaker Gillis</persName> took the chair at 2.30 <lb/>
p.m. The first Order of the Day was <lb/>
the second reading of Bill No. 2 re<lb break="no"/>specting Foreign Companies. In mov<lb break="no"/>ing the second reading <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Premier Haul<lb break="no"/>tain</persName> said the necessity for the Bill <lb/>
emphasised the necessity of the im<lb break="no"/>mediate granting of the provincial <lb/>
status to the Territories. In 1901 an <lb/>
Ordinance was passed regarding the <lb/>
licensing of foreign corporations to <lb/>
carry on business in the Territories and <lb/>
was disallowed by the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The question of the disallow<lb break="no"/>ance of the Ordinance was suggested <lb/>
by certain companies incorporated <lb/>
under Dominion charters and who <lb/>
objected to paying a further corpora<lb break="no"/>tion fee to do business in the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies. So far as the powers of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Assembly of the Territories are <lb/>
concerned, said the Premier, we have <lb/>
to-day in this respect practically the <lb/>
same powers as are conferred on the <lb/>
provincial legislatures. We stand in <lb/>
precisely the same position as if we <lb/>
were a province, and in dealing with <lb/>
the disallowance of the Ordinance it is <lb/>
only fair to inquire what was done by <lb/>
the federal authorities with respect to <lb/>
similar legislation by the provinces. <lb/>
The Ordinance of 1901 called for the <lb/>
registration and licensing of foreign <lb/>
corporations, that is companies incor<lb break="no"/>porated otherwise than under the Ordi<lb break="no"/>nances of the Territories. A foreign <lb/>
corporation was some company formed <lb/>
for the purpose of carrying on some <lb/>
business which fell within the powers <lb/>
of the Territories. By the Ordinance <lb/>
of 1901 the Territories did not attempt <lb/>
to control companies carrying on busi<lb break="no"/>ness which was outside the powers of <lb/>
the Territories. The fees prescribed to <lb/>
be charged these companies were made <lb/>
by order-in-council. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WHY ORDINANCE WAS DISALLOWED.</p> 

<p>Objection was taken by the Minister <lb/>
of Justice to this Ordinance and to put <lb/>
it shortly these were: First, that the <lb/>
Ordinance was ultra vires of the legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and second, an interference <lb/>
with Dominion policy by discriminat<lb break="no"/>ing against Dominion companies in <lb/>
favor of Territorial companies. So far <lb/>
as this latter objection was concerned <lb/>
there was a measure of truth in it. By <lb/>
order-in-council the fees were fixed at <lb/>
$150 instead of on a sliding scale as <lb/>
would be the case under the Territorial <lb/>
law. In response to the representa<lb break="no"/>tions of the Minister of Justice the <lb/>
Territorial Government undertook to <lb/>
amend the Ordinance so as to make the <lb/>
fees the same in the case of all com<lb break="no"/>panies. With regard to the first ob<lb break="no"/>jection the Territorial Government <lb/>
took the straight ground that the <lb/>
Ordinance was not outside the powers <lb/>
of the legislature and that our conten<lb break="no"/>tion was upheld by former ministers of <lb/>
justice, more particularly Sir Oliver <lb/>
Mowat, who, in his time, was the great<lb break="no"/>est authority on such questions in <lb/>
Canada. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">DIFFERENT TREATMENT TO PROVINCES.</p> 

<p>It was admitted that the Ordinance <lb/>
was framed for the purpose of taxing <lb/>
and regulating these comp[anies but <lb/>
that it only had to do with companies <lb/>
over which the Territories had juris<lb break="no"/>diction and such as the Territories <lb/>
could license themselves. The Premier <lb/>
went on to quote the judgment of Hon. <lb/>
David Mills and Sir Oliver Mowat to <lb/>
the effect that while the Dominion had <lb/>
the right to grant such charters the <lb/>
provinces had power to regulate and <lb/>
license them. These opinions were <lb/>
given on a British Columbia and an <lb/>
Ontario case. The Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had disallowed a Manitoba stat<lb break="no"/>ute but the question was not the same <lb/>
inasmuch as the Manitoba law under<lb break="no"/>took to license and regulate companies <lb/>
which were beyond the jurisdiction of <lb/>
the province. In conclusion Premier <lb/>
Haultain said: The British Columbia <lb/>
law, which was the same as ours in <lb/>
principle on all the important points on <lb/>
which ours was disallowed, was al<lb break="no"/>lowed to go into operation. The <lb/>
Ontario legislation was allowed to go <lb/>
into operation although it went further <lb/>
than ours. Manitoba's was disallowed <lb/>
but it certainly was objectionable along <lb/>
the lines I have indicated. Ours, how<lb break="no"/>ever, was disallowed. This only dem<lb break="no"/>onstrates another reason why we <lb/>
should have provincial status for there <lb/>
does seem to be a difference in the way <lb/>
in which a strong provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment is treated and the way the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories are treated. It was a question <lb/>
whether the Territories were to be <lb/>
allowed to legislate in regard to mat<lb break="no"/>ters which were clearly and distinctly <lb/>
placed under the control of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Assembly. The Bill now sub<lb break="no"/>mitted meets all the objections of the <lb/>
Minister of Justice except on the one <lb/>
point that the Assembly had exceeded <lb/>
its powers. He was not willing to <lb/>
yield that point and he asked the leg<lb break="no"/>islature to re-enact the Ordinance. The <lb/>
Bill was then read a second time. <lb/></p>
