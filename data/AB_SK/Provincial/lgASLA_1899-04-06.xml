<p>Speaker took the chair at 2:45. <lb/></p>

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE ADDRESS IN REPLY.</p> 

<p rendition="simple:right">EVENING SESSION.</p> 

<p>At 8 o'clock Mr. Speaker resumed <lb/>
the chair. It had been rumored and <lb/>
 
 <cb/>

expected that Mr. Bennett of West <lb/>
Calgary intended entering the debate <lb/>
with an onslaught against Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. When the sitting opened Mr. <lb/>
Bennett was not in the House and <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. HAULTAIN</persName> arose to close the <lb/>
debate. He explained his somewhat <lb/>
unusual position in the debate as leader <lb/>
of the Government. Under an ordi<lb break="no"/>nary and well defined party system <lb/>
there would be a regularly appointed <lb/>
leader of the Opposition. In the ab<lb break="no"/>sence of any regularly formed Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion or recognized leader of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition, and as there was possibility of <lb/>
hearing from members or leaders of an <lb/>
Opposition or Oppositions, he had post<lb break="no"/>poned his remarks, it being generally <lb/>
understood that the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment had a right to reply to the chief <lb/>
criticism levelled against the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration. He presumed that the House <lb/>
had now heard the principal critician, <lb/>
and he would make his own remarks <lb/>
brief. The Premier heartly compliment<lb break="no"/>ed the mover and seconder of the ad<lb break="no"/>dress, and agreed with <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. Lake</persName> that <lb/>
if any apology were called for it was <lb/>
the old members who should apologise <lb/>
for their continued existence. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) The seconder also laid down the <lb/>
proper position as regarded the occasion <lb/>
of the address, that it was better to <lb/>
leave the controversies to a later stage. <lb/>
While there was perhaps controversial <lb/>
matter in the address, it was not placed <lb/>
in a controversial way. In fact the <lb/>
Address in Reply was framed, as far as <lb/>
possible, to avoid controversy, and a <lb/>
member voting for its adoption was <lb/>
mot committing himself on any impor<lb break="no"/>tant question one way or the other. <lb/>
The Premier alluded to <persName ref="pers:MCKA6">Mr. McKay</persName>'s <lb/>
statement regarding his (Mr. McKay's) <lb/>
attitude and wrong classification by a <lb/>
newspaper characterised as a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment organ. He said if it was a ques<lb break="no"/>tion between the statement of <persName ref="pers:MCKA6">Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Kay</persName> and a statement appearing in any <lb/>
newspaper whether an organ of the <lb/>
Government or not he could assure the <lb/>
House that he was perfectly ready <lb/>
in the latter event to disown the organ <lb/>
and accept <persName ref="pers:MCKA6">Mr. McKay</persName>'s frank and fair <lb/>
statement. In his opinion <persName ref="pers:MCKA6">Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Kay</persName>'s position fittingly belonged to <lb/>
every member of the House, and was <lb/>
a creditable and proper position. It <lb/>
was right that members should deal <lb/>
with the propositions of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment on their merits; and he was <lb/>
glad to hear that that was <persName ref="pers:MCKA6">Mr. McKay</persName>'s <lb/>
attitude. The hon. member for Banff <lb/>
had referred to the speeches of <persName ref="pers:VILL1">Mr. <lb/>
Villeneuve</persName> and <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. Lake</persName> as being <lb/>
unique because of their independent <lb/>
expressions. If the hon. member <lb/>
was referring to things within that <lb/>
Assembly, then he ( <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> ) <lb/>
could say the statement was very wide <lb/>
of the mark. There was nothing <lb/>
unique about the independence of the <lb/>
hon. mover and seconder. There had <lb/>
never been any servile following in <lb/>
that House. If their tone was <lb/>
independent, it was simply char<lb break="no"/>acteristic of the North-West Legis<lb break="no"/>lature as it always had been <lb/>
found. The member for Banff's <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">VAGUE AND MYSTERIOUS</p> 

 <p>reference to prosperity had created ap<lb break="no"/>prehension in <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>'s mind—it <lb/>
had a familiar ring, and seemed like an <lb/>
echo from another arena. If he were <lb/>
not introducing a foreign subject, he <lb/>
might say that, belonging to the politi<lb break="no"/>cal party to which like himself <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. <lb/>
  Brett</persName> owed allegiance—a party which <lb/>
at least was accused of claiming that <lb/>
good harvests and the conditions of <lb/>
prosperity were managed by Acts of <lb/>
  Parliament and affected by govern<lb break="no"/>mental interventions:—belonging to that <lb/>
  party the member for Banff might con<lb break="no"/>sistently give the North-West Govern<lb break="no"/>ment a measure of credit for the favor<lb break="no"/>able conditions which are found to ex<lb break="no"/>ist throughout the country to-day— <lb/>
  some little measure, after thanking <lb/>
Providence and the weather and other <lb/>
toward conditions. (Laughter.) The <lb/>
Speech, continued the Premier, in one <lb/>
  respect was like the speech of the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Banff,—it contained both hopes <lb/>
and regrets. The first part dealt with <lb/>
some causes of congratulation, and un<lb break="no"/>fortunately some regrets were express<lb break="no"/>ed. He desired simply to re-echo all <lb/>
that had been said respecting Lt.-Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor Forget. It would not be fitting <lb/>
in his position to attempt any eulogy. <lb/>
He endorsed <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. Lake</persName>'s remark that in <lb/>
that case the proper course had been <lb/>
followed in appointing a North-West <lb/>
man and thus giving recognition to <lb/>
home industry. In their choice the <lb/>
Dominion Government had made no <lb/>
mistake. The appointment had <lb/>
been favorably received through<lb break="no"/>out the whole Territories. <lb/>
Any eulogy from him respecting the <lb/>
late Lieut.-Governor Cameron, too, <lb/>
would be unbecoming at that time, <lb/>
Hon. Mr. Cameron had made his repu<lb break="no"/>tation in the larger field of Dominion <lb/>
politics, and of any man in the sphere <lb/>
in which Mr. Cameron had moved and <lb/>
been an influence, there was bound to <lb/>
be very marked differences of opinion. <lb/>
But no one could say that from the <lb/>
very moment of his entrance upon the <lb/>
duties of the office of Lieut.-Governor <lb/>
he had not shown a keen interest in <lb/>
this country-shown that he was re<lb break="no"/>solved to devote his time and the <lb/>
strength of his high position to pro<lb break="no"/>mote the interests of the country. (Ap<lb break="no"/>plause.) The Premier repeated that <lb/>
the Speech should be dealt with in a <lb/>
non-controversial spirit, particularly <lb/>
the first Speech given by His Honor. <lb/>
It seemed to him that the reply should <lb/>
be made as unanimous and as counteous <lb/>
as possible. Of course he did not wish <lb/>
to deprecate critician or stop debate, <lb/>
but upon the subjects of the Speech <lb/>
criticism could be made much more <lb/>
effectively later on in the session. <lb/>
  The foreshadowed subjects of legisla<lb break="no"/>tion,—on each one of them a bill would <lb/>
  be brought in. On other matters— <lb/>
  matters of administration—well, the <lb/>
Supply Bill had to be introduced, and <lb/>
when it came down there was oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to discuss all such matters. <lb/>
Every subject would come up later <lb/>
in more definite and practical <lb/>
form. In other legislature, it was <lb/>
true, very extended debates on the <lb/>
address seemed to be the rule, but <lb/>
judging by what we heard of the de<lb break="no"/>bates themselves and their effect, it <lb/>
would certainly seem that a different <lb/>
course would cause no loss. The <lb/>
Saturday Review, he thought it was, <lb/>
which said that the debate on the <lb/>
Address in the Imperial Parliament was <lb/>
a "rambling discussion upon things <lb/>
in general," and suggested that if those <lb/>
who participated had written an <lb/>
article or hired a hall on equally good <lb/>
result would have been accomplished. <lb/>
The member of Banff made the usual <lb/>
critician in perhaps different words <lb/>
that the Speech was remarkable for <lb/>
  what it failed to contain—that it was <lb/>
  barren or at least meager—that no use<lb break="no"/>ful legistlation was promised, etc. <lb/>
Whether the criticism was merited or <lb/>
not it was certain that the Speech <lb/>
seemed to contain nothing upon which <lb/>
 
 <cb/>

the hon. member could declare his own <lb/>
position, and it was fair to ask if the <lb/>
remark should be taken as coming <lb/>
from one who was <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">HUNGRY FOR WORK.</p> 

<p>anxious to be making himself useful, <lb/>
or was it simply the commonplace re<lb break="no"/>mark of an Oppositionist who flet a <lb/>
compulsion to criticise. As the House <lb/>
had no recognised Opposition, the <lb/>
Premier supposed they would have to <lb/>
assume that it was the remark of one <lb/>
who disappointed that he could <lb/>
not at once roll into hard work. Leav<lb break="no"/>ing aside that question, however, <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. <lb/>
Haultain</persName> challenged comparison with <lb/>
Speeches made to any other Assembly <lb/>
or to Parliament. He said the state<lb break="no"/>ment could not be contradicted that <lb/>
none of them contained mention of <lb/>
anything like the variety of important <lb/>
subjects contained in the Speech for <lb/>
which he and his collegues were <lb/>
responsible, and this notwithstanding <lb/>
the more extended work and greater <lb/>
organization of provincial assemblies <lb/>
or the federal Parliament, with their <lb/>
well developed parties and greater <lb/>
scope. The statement that work <lb/>
of the country had increased so as to <lb/>
necessitate a third member of the <lb/>
Executive Council was important, and <lb/>
would come before the House again in <lb/>
a practical way. Unless the House <lb/>
saw fit to vote Supply and provide for <lb/>
that third member, his services could <lb/>
not be continued. The matter of the <lb/>
Consolidation of the Ordinances was <lb/>
by no means unimportant. The re<lb break="no"/>marks of the hon. member for Banff <lb/>
on that subject, coming from an old <lb/>
member, were not very appropriate. <lb/>
That hon. member had been in the <lb/>
House and knew perfectly well what <lb/>
had caused the delay. The dela was <lb/>
made at the request of the Commission, <lb/>
and this <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> knew or <lb/>
should have known. The Commission <lb/>
was first appointed in 1897, and in 1989 <lb/>
after they had done through the work, <lb/>
they advised various changes before <lb/>
the Consolidation should be completed <lb/>
and adopted. <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> thought it <lb/>
was desirable that the delay should <lb/>
have occurred. The Consolidation <lb/>
now contained the whole of the <lb/>
work of the last Assembly, and <lb/>
was certainly much more complete <lb/>
that if it had been issued earlier. In <lb/>
any event the delay was not caused by <lb/>
the Government, the country had not <lb/>
suffered but benefitted, and to-day the <lb/>
whole law was to be found in one <lb/>
volume. <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> spoke of amend<lb break="no"/>ments he had proposed to the local im<lb break="no"/>provement law in former years; he <lb/>
advised that those amendments ought <lb/>
to be made now, and at the same time <lb/>
protested against the Consolidated <lb/>
Ordinances being amended. That was <lb/>
a lesson to the House in consistency. <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> had much fault to find with <lb/>
the local improvement Ordinance. At <lb/>
an elelction meeting in Banff district <lb/>
(at Jumping Pound) the hon. member <lb/>
had referred to the Ordinance in very <lb/>
different terms. <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> quoted <lb/>
from a report of <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName>'s speech at <lb/>
the meeting, highly commedning the <lb/>
Ordinance. The report went on to say <lb/>
that <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> declared he "had al<lb break="no"/>ways taken an active part in the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the House, that he had always <lb/>
held at the Statute Labor law was <lb/>
good, and that the people would like it <lb/>
when they got a proper understanding <lb/>
of it." This was the way, said <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. <lb/>
Haultain</persName>, that the member for Banff <lb/>
expressed himself when he was not <lb/>
filling in the time alloted to the <lb/>
gentleman who assumes to lead Her <lb/>
Majesty's loyal Opposition. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName>—If you will permit me, I <lb/>
will say that I always approved the <lb/>
principle of the law, and said nothing <lb/>
this afternoon inconsistent with that <lb/>
approval. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—The explanation does <lb/>
not meet the point. To-day the hon. <lb/>
gentleman criticised the law as it stands. <lb/>
At his election meeting he approved <lb/>
the law entirely and completely. The <lb/>
Premier, continuing, said that another <lb/>
very important subject mentioned was <lb/>
that of water supply. He was sorry <lb/>
that it was so important, and that its <lb/>
importance had to be admitted in the <lb/>
Speech, and in speeches in the cham<lb break="no"/>ber. He felt very much disinclined to <lb/>
include reference to it in the Speech <lb/>
and to so advertise the fact of its im<lb break="no"/>portance to the world. But it was one <lb/>
of the conditions the Government was <lb/>
compelled to deal with, and which had <lb/>
to be considered. If it were not in the <lb/>
speech, the bill of fare would be lack<lb break="no"/>ing still more and the hon. gentleman <lb/>
from Banff would have still greater <lb/>
reason to complain. Then there were <lb/>
the subjects of stock inspection and <lb/>
farming experiments, both highly im<lb break="no"/>portant. Another subject was that re<lb break="no"/>specting elections. The hon. member <lb/>
was very free in criticisms after the <lb/>
event. The Speech accurately indica<lb break="no"/>ted the position. It was the test made <lb/>
by the general elections which showed <lb/>
the weak points in the law. The in<lb break="no"/>volved questions arising in the Banff <lb/>
election, for instance, called for remedy. <lb/>
He would not say it absolutely, but be<lb break="no"/>lieved that the imperfections of the law <lb/>
influenced <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE RESULT IN BANFF.</p>

<p>On that score the Premier was not <lb/>
complaining. On the contrary he wel<lb break="no"/>comed <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> back to the House. <lb/>
But <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> was as much a party to <lb/>
the law as anyone else. Had he not al<lb break="no"/>ways "taken an active part in the <lb/>
business of the House?" He had al<lb break="no"/>ways been a critic. The assembly <lb/>
surely could complain that the hon. <lb/>
gentleman had not given the advantage <lb/>
of his knowledge and prescience regard<lb break="no"/>ing the election law in 1897 or 1898, so <lb/>
that the Chapter of the Consolidated <lb/>
Ordinances would not be demanding <lb/>
amendment. References to the law of <lb/>
partnership, winding up joint stock <lb/>
companies, villages, swelled the list of <lb/>
important subjects embodied in the <lb/>
Speech. The bill dealing with the law <lb/>
of Partnership would be found very <lb/>
important. The Speech itself refuted <lb/>
the statement that it contained refer<lb break="no"/>ence to no useful legislation. Of course <lb/>
whether the legislation as finally adopt<lb break="no"/>ed would prove useful or not would de<lb break="no"/>pend on the consideration given by the <lb/>
House. On the other hand, continued <lb/>
the Premier, the Government purpose<lb break="no"/>ly refrained as much as possible from <lb/>
preparing any legislation not urgently <lb/>
required. The Consolidation was just <lb/>
out. Of course some amendment was <lb/>
necessary, but especially at this time <lb/>
no changes should be made but just for the <lb/>
sake of doing something. It was <persName ref="pers:CART2">Sir <lb/>
Geo. Cartier</persName> who said he would never <lb/>
be satisfied until a session could be met <lb/>
 with only one Bill—the Supply Bill. <lb/>
Certainly at this stage the fewer bills <lb/>
the better, especially of the tinkering <lb/>
sort. <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName>'s references to the in<lb break="no"/>completeness of the statute law did not <lb/>
fall with good grace from one who <lb/>
sat through three legislatures and <lb/>
always "taken that active interest in <lb/>
the business of the House." It was <lb/>
late in the day to find the existence of <lb/>
this incompleteness. <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> <lb/>
thought that no one who would read the <lb/>
titles of the various Ordinances and <lb/>
 
 <cb/>

look even casually into them—many of <lb/>
them embodying the results of the ex<lb break="no"/>periences of older countries adapted to <lb/>
our special conditions-would find any <lb/>
warrant for the comtemptous declara<lb break="no"/>tion made with a wave of the hand <lb/>
that the statute law of the Territories <lb/>
was so incomplete. The Assembly of <lb/>
the Territories had been in particularly <lb/>
good circumstances, free from the <lb/>
drawbacks and sidepullings of other <lb/>
Aseemblies, for exercising the function <lb/>
of the legislation. They had not had the <lb/>
sometimes necessary but in many re<lb break="no"/>spects undesirable features of party <lb/>
strife to contend against, and had been <lb/>
able to devote an unusual degree of <lb/>
single mindedness to the work of <lb/>
legislation. The Premier declared he <lb/>
was ready to stand on the declaration <lb/>
that the North-West statute law was in <lb/>
a high degree complete and useful in <lb/>
comparison with other countries. It <lb/>
was not perfect. The House was but <lb/>
human, as <persName ref="pers:VILL1">Mr. Villeneuve</persName> had truly <lb/>
said. The member for Banff seemed <lb/>
to think there something needed to be <lb/>
done, but was at a loss to know <lb/>
just what was required. He re<lb break="no"/>minded the Premier of that curate <lb/>
out of employment who in the <lb/>
disputations anent the claims of <lb/>
the high churchmen, low churchment, <lb/>
and so forth, took his stand on the <lb/>
declaration of "No Views," and im<lb break="no"/>mediately gained employment. <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. <lb/>
Haultain</persName> hoped that the criticisms <lb/>
would take more definite and practical <lb/>
form when the questions come before <lb/>
the House. After all, however, <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. <lb/>
Brett</persName> had always been a friendly critic, <lb/>
and <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> only wished his <lb/>
Government might always meet with <lb/>
criticisms as friendly and fair as his <lb/>
had been in the past. (Applause.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE DEBATE BREAKS OUT <lb/>
AFRESH.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">MR. BENNETT</persName> (West Calgary) had <lb/>
come into the chamber near the close <lb/>
of the Premier's speech. When the <lb/>
latter sat down the former arose. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. <lb/>
Bennett</persName>'s opening sentences proclaimed <lb/>
him a voluble, eloquent and pleasing <lb/>
speaker. He commenced by saying <lb/>
that while he was probably the young<lb break="no"/>est man in the House, yet he repre<lb break="no"/>sented a most important constituency, <lb/>
upon which fact he would rest his <lb/>
justification for joining in the debate. <lb/>
With this brief preliminary he plunged <lb/>
into his topics. After the speeches <lb/>
made last fall at Calgary by the hon. <lb/>
the Attorney General and the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Public Works, the House <lb/>
might have expected on this occasion <lb/>
the presentation of a programme <lb/>
meriting their consideration. Every <lb/>
man who realised the great problems <lb/>
 treated,—was looking to see some <lb/>
indication that the problems presenting <lb/>
for solution by the administration of <lb/>
these Territories would be grappled <lb/>
with by the Government. He would say <lb/>
nothing in a spirit of captions criticism: <lb/>
his remarks would be offered rather in <lb/>
the spirit of determination to aid to <lb/>
the full extent of his poor powers the <lb/>
promotion of the welfare of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. The Speech, in its reference to <lb/>
the Lieut.-Governor, noted the fact <lb/>
that it was twenty-five years ago that <lb/>
the North-west Territories began to <lb/>
be organized. Twenty-five years, thun<lb break="no"/>dered <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>, was a long time. <lb/>
Twenty-five years was a <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">QUARTER OF A CENTURY.</p> 

<p>Almost twenty-five years ago Hon. <lb/>
David Mills, then Minister of the Inter<lb break="no"/>ior, now Minister of Justice for Can<lb break="no"/>ada, in a speech referring to the North-<lb break="yes"/>West alluded to the Territories as be<lb break="no"/>ing then in the minority, and declar<lb break="no"/>ed that they would be expected to do <lb/>
 the work of a grown-up coun<lb break="no"/>try,—act the part of a grown-up man. <lb/>
On this day, twenty-five years later, it <lb/>
was surely not too early to ask if the <lb/>
time had not come for the people of <lb/>
these Territories to assume the status <lb/>
contemplated by Hon. Mr. Mills. Con<lb break="no"/>tinuing, <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> declared that pro<lb break="no"/>blems momentous, gigantic, of the ut<lb break="no"/>most seriousness, confronted the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and with which it behooved the <lb/>
Assembly to deal. In the light of this <lb/>
declaration <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> ridiculed an <lb/>
address given by the hon. the Attorney <lb/>
General in October last at Calgary. <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> had professed the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment's inability to deal with the <lb/>
large questions of competitive freight <lb/>
rates, elevator monopolies, or the mat<lb break="no"/>ter of arranging for the people of Cal<lb break="no"/>gary a schooner of beer for five cents. <lb/>
Laughter.) <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> had accentu<lb break="no"/>ated the need of the cultivation of the <lb/>
philosophy of dullness. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> <lb/>
said that while the Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral had not mentioned his name <lb/>
everybody knew that the remarks had <lb/>
sarcastic reference to his (Mr. Ben<lb break="no"/>nett's) election address. The speaker <lb/>
thought the framers of His Honor's <lb/>
Speech must have spent a great deal of <lb/>
time in the study of the philosophy of <lb/>
dullness, for if ever there was a docu<lb break="no"/>ment distinctly the evolution of such <lb/>
study that the document was the speech. <lb/>
But if the Government were unable to <lb/>
cope with the momentous questions, <lb/>
he ( <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> ) had a mandate from <lb/>
the people of West Calgary to endea<lb break="no"/>vor to have them dealt with. Were <lb/>
not the people of these Territories in<lb break="no"/>terested in the question of competitive <lb/>
freight rates, the putting an end to <lb/>
railway monopoly, the question of the <lb/>
elevator monopoly? Would not effec<lb break="no"/>tive dealing with those questions bene<lb break="no"/>fit every man in the country? He <lb/>
said that Mr. Haultain's remarks at <lb/>
Calgary were an insult to the intelli<lb break="no"/>gence and knowledge of the people <lb/>
who suffered from elevator and rail<lb break="no"/>way monopolies-people who are <lb/>
hampered and oppressed at every turn <lb/>
by monopolies, and who intend to re<lb break="no"/>main no longer content to helplessly <lb/>
bear the drawbacks and burdens im<lb break="no"/>posed by the monopolies. The major<lb break="no"/>ity of the members of the present As<lb break="no"/>sembly were new men: they had come <lb/>
 in with no set ideas of Opposition,— <lb/>
 had come in open-minded, ready and <lb/>
anxious to support every step in the <lb/>
line of progress. But if they found <lb/>
the Government pursuing its old policy <lb/>
of "drift" instead of seeking to grap<lb break="no"/>ple with the problems of the hour, <lb/>
then it was the duty of the members to <lb/>
oppose that Government no matter by <lb/>
what or whom it was composed and <lb/>
without regard to any services the <lb/>
members of it may have rendered to the <lb/>
state in days gone by. If the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment failed in the duty of the hour it <lb/>
was entitled to Opposition. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> declared that no <lb/>
man had more unbounded confidence in <lb/>
this country than himself. Looking <lb/>
back over the twenty-five years' history <lb/>
of the North-West, it was fair to ask <lb/>
whether this Government had done <lb/>
aught to facilitate progress or bring <lb/>
about the prosperity which was being <lb/>
felt in some measure by the people to-<lb break="yes"/>day. This Government had done to <lb/>
Ottawa year after year asking this <lb/>
thing and that thing. Whatever was <lb/>

possessed had come in driblets. Had <lb/>
all been got that might have been got? <lb/>
As far back as 1890 Mr. Laurier asked <lb/>
in Parliament why self-government <lb/>
was not conferred on the Territories, <lb/>
yet year after year the Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral had been at Ottawa on bended <lb/>
knee asking driblets. When members <lb/>
of Parliament enquired why so little <lb/>
was granted, ministers time and again <lb/>
answered that all was being given that <lb/>
was asked, that <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> said the <lb/>
people of the Territories were not fit <lb/>
for self-government and did not want <lb/>
it. Was the proposition true? dra<lb break="no"/>matically demanded <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>. Was <lb/>
it so that the people here were unfit <lb/>
for self-government? Did or did not <lb/>
the people desire the powers to improve <lb/>
their condition? Did Eastern Assini<lb break="no"/>boia, for instance, care whether or not <lb/>
they were monopoly ridden? <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PROGRESS OF THE STATES.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> made a comparison of <lb/>
the progress of certain States with that <lb/>
of the North-West to show, as he said, <lb/>
how much this North-West Territories <lb/>
Government was to be credited with. <lb/>
In 1861 Dakota was a Territory with a <lb/>
population of 4,837. In 1864, Mon<lb break="no"/>tana was a Territory with <lb/>
population of 20,595. In 1870, Wyom<lb break="no"/>ing, a ranching Territory, had a popula<lb break="no"/>tion of 9,000. Montana in 1880 had <lb/>
increased to 39,159, in 1890 to 132,000, <lb/>
and in 1898 to 240,000. The North-West <lb/>
had just as wide and as good resources <lb/>
as Montana. North Dakota—a part of <lb/>
the original Territory of Dakota—had <lb/>
increased in 1880 to 36,000, in 1890 to <lb/>
182,000 and in 1898 to 225,000. South <lb/>
Dakota in 1880 had 98,000, in 1890 328,<lb break="no"/>000, and in 1898 410,000. Wyoming, <lb/>
still a Territory in 1880, had risen to <lb/>
20,000, and in 1898 to 85,000. Bring the <lb/>
comparison nearer home. Take Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, the population of which province <lb/>
is to-day computed at 300,000, with <lb/>
facilities of transportation second to <lb/>
those of no province in Canada, and all <lb/>
obtained practically without cost to <lb/>
the people, largely so at any rate, as <lb/>
the Dauphin line and other lines con<lb break="no"/>structed on similar arrangement, are be<lb break="no"/>ing obtained without the cost of a single <lb/>
cent to the people of Manitoba. He <lb/>
referred to this because the Executive <lb/>
Council had attempted to draw the red <lb/>
herring of taxation into the question <lb/>
of provincial establishment. On his <lb/>
responsibility as a member he desired <lb/>
to declare that neither the people of <lb/>
Manitoba or any other province were <lb/>
taxed a single cent by reason of being <lb/>
a province, and he charged that the <lb/>
Attorney General knew this fact per<lb break="no"/>fectly well. Then why did he con<lb break="no"/>tinually seek to drag in the bugbear of <lb/>
taxation? Simply because he feared <lb/>
that his pet projects, his leisure and <lb/>
his luxury would be interfered <lb/>
with if his Government undertook <lb/>
to grapple with the gigantic pro<lb break="no"/>blems that awaited solution. Pro<lb break="no"/>ceeding, <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> declared that <lb/>
municipal organisation was the free <lb/>
act of a free people. Before any muni<lb break="no"/>cipality could be formed two-thirds of <lb/>
the people must agree to formation. <lb/>
Even without provincial powers these <lb/>
Territories found themselves obliged <lb/>
to undertake municipal duties. Had <lb/>
we not organised local improvement <lb/>
districts, villages and cities—all estab<lb break="no"/>lished on the municipal principle? The <lb/>
assertion that provincial establishment <lb/>
necessarily meant the introduction of <lb/>
direct taxation, he characterised as <lb/>
"mere rot;" and declared it a deliberate <lb/>
insult to every man who possessed a <lb/>
soul to say that this country was un<lb break="no"/>fit and unable to deal with the pro<lb break="no"/>blems to be created by provincial es<lb break="no"/>tablishment or to use to good advant<lb break="no"/>age the powers of chartering railways <lb/>
and raising money upon the public <lb/>
credit. He claimed no magic for the <lb/>
name of Province, but did claim that <lb/>
the name "Territories " was a detri<lb break="no"/>ment and prevented capital from <lb/>
coming into the country. <lb/></p> 

<p>After making the above very direct <lb/>
pleas for provincial establishment, <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. <lb/>
Bennett</persName> begged the House not to mis<lb break="no"/>understand him. He was not seeking <lb/>
to precipitate on the House the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of provincial autonomy. Just two <lb/>
things these Territories lacked, name<lb break="no"/>ly, the power to pledge the public <lb/>
credit and the power to charter rail<lb break="no"/>ways. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> charged that five <lb/>
years ago the Attorney General ad<lb break="no"/>vised the Government at Ottawa that <lb/>
the people here did not wish the power <lb/>
of incorporating railway companies. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> asked the authority for <lb/>
the statement. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> modified his assertion. <lb/>
In 1893 or 1894, he thought it was, Sir <lb/>
John Thompson, upon a bill granting <lb/>
certain powers to the Territories, stated <lb/>
that all was being granted that <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. <lb/>
Haultain</persName> had asked. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> <lb/>
then proceeded to state the reson why <lb/>
the people should have power to pledge <lb/>
the public credit. He laid down the <lb/>
proposition that the measure of a coun<lb break="no"/>try's prosperity was the measure of its <lb/>
power to borrow money. The gist of <lb/>
the argument appeared to be that with <lb/>
borrowed money prosperity could be <lb/>
enhanced and the ability to borrow <lb/>
more thus created. <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> had <lb/>
answered at Calgary that the charter<lb break="no"/>ing of railways was a federal matter. <lb/>
He ( <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> ) joined issue on that <lb/>
question. Manitoba had tapped the <lb/>
Northern Pacific at the point of the <lb/>
bayonet, with incalculable benefit to <lb/>
herself. He said he was aware that <lb/>
even now the President of the Northern <lb/>
Pacific was prepared to tap the bound<lb break="no"/>ary line of the Territories, if connection <lb/>
could be made from this side. To show <lb/>
the adverse condition under which the <lb/>
people of the North-West labored as <lb/>
regarded transportation, <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> <lb/>
stated that a single firm, a saddlery <lb/>
firm in Calgary, last year paid $7,000 <lb/>
upon their freighted material in excess <lb/>
of what they should have paid had their <lb/>
place of business been located in Van<lb break="no"/>couver. That was a single instance. The  <lb/>
same condition affected everybody and <lb/>
almost everything. People in Calgary <lb/>
and Regina pay higher rates on sugar <lb/>
from Vancouver than do the <lb/>
people of Portage la Prairie. <lb/>
These were the conditions which <lb/>
made every man in the Territories in<lb break="no"/>terested in the question of comparative <lb/>
freight rates. The elevator monopoly <lb/>
was another burden, felt more severely <lb/>
in the eastern sections than in South<lb break="no"/>ern Alberta. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> promised <lb/>
that he would not be afraid to grapple <lb/>
with and overcome these monopolies. <lb/>
Were we less active, less enterprising, <lb/>
less courageous than the people of <lb/>
Manitoba or the people of the States on <lb/>
our southern border? Caution was a <lb/>
good thing, but overcaution might be <lb/>
carried too far. He was in favor of <lb/>
daring something, and declared him<lb break="no"/>self a believer in the proposition that <lb/></p>
 
 <p rendition="simple:centre">THE END JUSTIFIED THE MEANS.</p>
 
 <p>
He believed that it was possible to ac<lb break="no"/>celerate the motion of the machine. <lb/></p> 

<p>At Calgary last fall the Attorney <lb/>
General had said that the time for pro<lb break="no"/>vincial establishment had "just about <lb/>
come." It had not come last year, but <lb/>
last year the time had almost arrived. <lb/>
Upon that statement <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> had <lb/>
based his expectation that the step <lb/>
would be foreshadowed this year, <lb/>
only to be disappointed. The Speech <lb/>
was barren of mention of any great <lb/>
project or problem. The elections <lb/>
were over. The Government could <lb/>
rest for another four years, pursue the <lb/>
old policy of "drift," and contemplate <lb/>
the philosophy of dullness. The <lb/>
twenty-one new faces appearing in the <lb/>
chamber should warn the Government <lb/>
that the policy of "drift" could no <lb/>
longer prevail. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> criticised <lb/>
Mr. Haultain for the departure from <lb/>
precedent made that afternoon. Never <lb/>
before had <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> failed to <lb/></p> 

<cb/>

<p>follow Dr. Brett in the debate on <lb/>
the address. In the light of pre<lb break="no"/>cedent there was something peculiar <lb/>
in the reason offered by <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> <lb/>
respecting the absence of a recog<lb break="no"/>nised Opposition. If nothing else, <lb/>
sympathy for his colleague (Mr. Ross) <lb/>
who was quite ill, should have pre<lb break="no"/>vented <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>'s departure from <lb/>
the custom of former years. <lb/></p> 

<cb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> further criticised the <lb/>
proposal in point of the money con<lb break="no"/>sideration involved. He was charged <lb/>
with a mandate to offer the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment land for nothing. Lots of men <lb/>
would be glad of the opportunity to <lb/>
carry on the experiments without <lb/>
charge. Indeed one man was ready <lb/>
to offer $500 for the privilege of secur<lb break="no"/>ing the proposed arrangement. The <lb/>
land which the Government were <lb/>
taking was the poorest kind of land. <lb/>
He knew this because he had himself <lb/>
sold the land last year for $5.00 an <lb/>
acre, and now the Government pro<lb break="no"/>posed to pay $2 an acre yearly rental. <lb/>
It was a good bargain for the Irriga<lb break="no"/>tion Company. The land had been <lb/>
cropped for fourteen years; all the <lb/>
soil was blown off it, and there was <lb/>
nothing left but gravel. Representing <lb/>
the people of Calgary West, he was <lb/>
interested in securing the greatest <lb/>
amount of benefit from the experi<lb break="no"/>mental system. He only asked fair <lb/>
play for his constituents and for him<lb break="no"/>self; and although the station was <lb/>
being established in his district he <lb/>
declared that for the reasons stated his <lb/>
constituents were opposed to the pro<lb break="no"/>ject. Reverting to his allegation that <lb/>
an untrue statement had been placed <lb/>
in the mouth of the Lieut.-Governor, <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> claimed that the annals <lb/>
of history would be searched in vain <lb/>
for any similar instance. He next <lb/>
took up a sometime statement made <lb/>
by the Premier that the policy of the <lb/>
Government was to be found in the <lb/>
statute book, and said he would accept <lb/>
the statement and prove by it that the <lb/>
policy had been one of consistent <lb/>
wobble. The Attorney General had <lb/>
also claimed that no other legislature <lb/>
could show the same record of original <lb/>
legislation. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> ridiculed the <lb/>
claim. New Zealand with its advanced <lb/>
laws was of course not to be compared <lb/>
with this wonderful legislature! Mr. <lb/>
Chamberlain, Lord Salisbury, the <lb/>
Duke of Devonshire and all the Im<lb break="no"/>perial legislators as well as the veteran <lb/>
statesmen of the Canadian provinces <lb/>
were of course but children compared <lb/>
with the original legislators with <lb/>
which these Territories were blessed! <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> took up the record. In <lb/>
1889, 31 Ordinances were passed—7 pub<lb break="no"/>lic, 6 private and 18 amending; 1890—4 <lb/>
public, 3 private and 17 amending; <lb/>
1891-92—12, 11 and 15 (an election com<lb break="no"/>ing on; pretty steady); 1892,—10, 7 and <lb/>
21; 1893—9, 4 and 20 (wobbly again); <lb/>
1894—10, 6 and 25; 1895—11, 7 and 18; <lb/>
1896—6, 2 and 23; 1897—29, 3 and 8; <lb/>
1898—6, 4 and 33. There was the policy <lb/>
of the past—continual wobble. The <lb/>
Government had no policy for the fu<lb break="no"/>ture,—no policy dealing with the actu<lb break="no"/>alities of life. That was the reason <lb/>
there were twenty-one new men in the <lb/>
House. The people were looking to <lb/>
men who would attempt to advantage <lb/>
the country by the tremendous oppor<lb break="no"/>tunities at hand. In ten years the old <lb/>
regime had witnessed the passage of <lb/>
355 Bills—198 amending, 53 private and <lb/>
only 104 public measures including the <lb/>
annual Supply Bills. The claim of <lb/>
originality must be based on the boast <lb/>
of the boy who disclaimed any<lb break="no"/>thing original excepting original sin. <lb/>
(Laughter.) The policy had been large<lb break="no"/>ly one of neglect. If instead of incor<lb break="no"/>porating useless Sales of Goods laws, <lb/>
they had cut the legal fees in two, some <lb/>
benefit would have resulted. The legal <lb/>
fees in this country were a by-word. <lb/>
Business firms in the east preferred to <lb/>
lose their accounts rather than become <lb/>
liable to the fees. The clerks' fees <lb/>
should be cut in two and the advocates' <lb/>
fees split. Executions ought to be <lb/>
made easy. Instead of some such use<lb break="no"/>ful measure, we were to have a law re<lb break="no"/>lating to partnership. Possibly it was <lb/>
fitting when they recollected the case <lb/>
of the hon. Attorney General and the <lb/>
Commissioner of Public Works, yet he <lb/>
thought, looking over the twenty-one <lb/>
new faces, <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> might <lb/>
see something even more appropriate <lb/>
in the proposal for a winding-up Ordi<lb break="no"/>nance. Notwithstanding the recent <lb/>
Consolidation he saw the Judicature <lb/>
Ordinance was to be again amended. <lb/>
If anything should remain constant, it <lb/>
should be the form of procedure in the <lb/>
courts. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> regretted that he had <lb/>
consumed so much of the time of the <lb/>
House. Had the speech been different <lb/>
he should not have spoken at all. But <lb/>
he could not refrain from voicing his <lb/>
opinion that that Assembly was past <lb/>
the stage for dealing with small mat<lb break="no"/>ters. Twenty-five years had gone by. <lb/>
Nothing had been done making for the <lb/>
prosperity of the country. Nothing <lb/>
was being done calculated to satisfy <lb/>
the ambitions of young men. The po<lb break="no"/>tentialities of these Territories no man <lb/>
could measure. When we saw the <lb/>
success which he had shown <lb/>
was crowning the efforts of other <lb/>
countries, the young man was bound <lb/>
to feel that those efforts should be <lb/>
emulated. What the North-West <lb/>
wanted now was men who would <lb/></p>
 <p rendition="simple:centre">MAKE THINGS HAPPEN,</p>
 <p>
and not sit down and be content to <lb/>
drift. The country was on the flood <lb/>
tide of prosperity, but so far as this <lb/>
Government was concerned no one who <lb/>
looked at their policy could fail to see <lb/>
that they were entitled to no credit <lb/>
and were in no wise responsible for any <lb/>
progress being made. (Warm applause.) <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> moved the adjournment <lb/>
of the debate, and the House adjourn<lb break="no"/>ed. <lb/></p> 

<p>One of the first men to congraulate <lb/>
Mr. Bennett upon his speech was <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. <lb/>
Haultain</persName>. <lb/></p>

<p rendition="simple:right">FRIDAY, APRIL 7.</p> 

 <cb/>

<p rendition="simple:centre">DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS <lb/>
RESUMED.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">DR. PATRICK</persName> resumed the ad<lb break="no"/>journed debate on the Address in Re<lb break="no"/>ply. He heartily congratulated the <lb/>
mover and seconder upon the happy <lb/>
and efficient manner in which both <lb/>
had performed difficult duties, and re<lb break="no"/>called that the hon. member for North <lb/>
Qu'Appelle (Mr. McDonald) and him<lb break="no"/>self were the only ones in that Assem<lb break="no"/>bly who had undertaken like duties in <lb/>
circumstances of any similarity. <persName ref="pers:MCDO10">Mr. <lb/>
McDonald</persName>'s and his own case had been <lb/>
even more difficult as they had to <lb/>
speak as entirely new and inexperi<lb break="no"/>enced members before a House of old <lb/>
members, whereas Mr. Villeneuve and <lb/>
Mr. Lake had a majority of members <lb/>
new like themselves to address. With <lb/>
recollection of his own task in 1897 <lb/>
fresh in his memory he quite knew <lb/>
how to sympathise with the mover <lb/>
and seconder, who had performed the <lb/>
task in a highly creditable manner. <lb/>
He considered the mover as especially <lb/>
entitled to credit, inasmuch as he ad<lb break="no"/>dressed the House not in his mother-<lb break="yes"/>tongue. He was entitled to the thanks <lb/>
of the House for waiving his right, out <lb/>
of respect for their feelings, to speak <lb/>
in the language of which he had best <lb/>
command,—a polite consideration char<lb break="no"/>acteristic of the French Canadian race. <lb/>
(Applause.) <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> regretted that <lb/>
there were not more people in Canada <lb/>
capable of using the two languages <lb/>
with equal facility as Mr. Villeneuve <lb/>
had shown. He congratulated also the <lb/>
hon. member from Grenfell, who be<lb break="no"/>gan his speech with some natural <lb/>
trepidation, but soon warmed up to <lb/>
the topics and delivered an admirable <lb/>
address marked by sound sense and <lb/>
devoid of flourish. The speaker said <lb/>
he wished to be brief, and asked the <lb/>
House to consider him as concurring <lb/>
fully with all the regrets and congratu<lb break="no"/>lations which were expressed in the <lb/>
Speech and which had been so eloquent<lb break="no"/>ly expressed by other speakers. He <lb/>
wished to take opportunity of explain<lb break="no"/>ing his own position in the debate. He <lb/>
had not intended to join in. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved with Mr. Lake that a brief and <lb/>
harmonious debate was better and <lb/>
more appropriate. He said that when <lb/>
he sought re-election in Yorkton he <lb/>
made it a condition that he should <lb/>
come trammelled only by his responsi<lb break="no"/>bility to himself and his constituents. <lb/>
He was thus perfectly independent. <lb/>
The position of a representative in the <lb/>
Assembly was fraught with weighty <lb/>
responsibility. The memer's conduct <lb/>
should be guided by more than person<lb break="no"/>al considerations and motives. Public <lb/>
not private reasons should determine <lb/>
his course. He (Dr. Patrick) was <lb/>
perfectly independent, but he would <lb/>
not think it right, simply because <lb/>
of some lack of consideration <lb/>
shown to himself by the Government <lb/>
or for any other personal reason, to <lb/>
seek to obstruct the business of the <lb/>
House or to upset the Government. <lb/>
He wished to say at the outset that he <lb/>
held no brief for the Government. The <lb/>
Executive Councillors were quite cap<lb break="no"/>able of taking care of themselves, if <lb/>
given the ordinary chance. It was the <lb/>
custom in that House as well as in <lb/>
other legislatures to give the leader of <lb/>
the government a chance to answer the <lb/>
chief critic of the administration. It <lb/>
was unfair of the member for West <lb/>
Calgary that on this occasion the lead<lb break="no"/>er had been deprived of this chance. <lb/>
Certainly had <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> known <lb/>
that Mr. Bennett would speak, the <lb/>
former would have deferred his re<lb break="no"/>marks. But when the House resumed <lb/>
last evening Mr. Bennett was not in his <lb/>
place, and he (Dr. Patrick) was himself <lb/>
advised that Mr. Bennett was ill in bed. <lb/>
That Assembly had been used to fair <lb/>
and honorable dealing and he did not <lb/>
think any member would improve his <lb/>
standing there by resorting to tricks. <lb/>
Give the de'il his due, said <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName>, <lb/>
and likewise give the leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment his due. (Laughter.) He  <lb/>
characterised Mr. Bennett's criticism of <lb/>
the Speech as an insult to the intelli<lb break="no"/>gence of the House. He would not <lb/>
take up time comparing the Speech <lb/>
with those given in other Houses. The <lb/>
members all knew what was the result <lb/>
of such comparison. The Speech under <lb/>
consideration was more definite and <lb/>
specific than any speech delievered at <lb/>
any recent session of any Canadian <lb/>
legislature. It might, however, be <lb/>
worth while to compare the Speech <lb/>
with the election address of the mem<lb break="no"/>ber who had declared that the Speech <lb/>
was indefinite and unsatisfactory. <lb/>
There might be need of definiteness in a <lb/>
Speech, but surely there was far more <lb/>
need in the election address of one <lb/>
who sought to be made representative <lb/>
of a constituency for a term of four <lb/>
years. Of course the candidate might <lb/>
contend that he would have opportun<lb break="no"/>ity to declare himself specifically on the <lb/>
hustings; and so a Government could <lb/>
contend that they would be specific <lb/>
on the floor of the House when their <lb/> 

<cb/>

Bills and Estimates came down. Those <lb/>
who heard Mr. Bennett's speech last <lb/>
night would certainly expect that in <lb/>
his address to the electors he would <lb/>
specifically state his position on the <lb/>
great and momentous questions of <lb/>
comparative freight rates, provincial <lb/>
establishment and elevator monopolies. <lb/>
They would be surprised to learn that <lb/>
no reference to these gigantic pro<lb break="no"/>blems could be found in the card of <lb/>
this candidate before the electors of <lb/>
West Calgary. The election address <lb/>
rather than the Speech could be proved <lb/>
to consist of glittering generalities. <lb/>
The hon. member stated to the people <lb/>
of West Calgary that adequate refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the important subjects could <lb/>
not be put into the space of an election <lb/>
card. Now he seemed to think that <lb/>
the space of an opening speech should <lb/>
contain everything. Ah, but in the <lb/>
election card there was <lb/></p>
 <p rendition="simple:centre">ONE GIGANTIC QUESTION</p>
 <p>
that did not escape mention. "The <lb/>
energy and the enterprise of the people <lb/>
of Calgary should be recognised by the <lb/>
establishment of that place as the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial capital!" Mark the great <lb/>
public reason! Not because Cal<lb break="no"/>gary was geographically conven<lb break="no"/>ient for the capital. Not because <lb/>
there was any good sound reason why <lb/>
Calgary should be made the capital, <lb/>
but for a demagogic reason, and for a <lb/>
reason that only a demagogue would <lb/>
use. (Cheers.) The energy and enter<lb break="no"/>prise of the people should be recognised <lb/>
forsooth! Were there no other mem<lb break="no"/>bers with constituents possessing ener<lb break="no"/>gy and enterprise deserving recogni<lb break="no"/>tion? What scale of expenditure was <lb/>
going to be entailed when the only due <lb/>
recognition of energy and enterprise <lb/>
took the form of establishing capitals. <lb/>
(Cheers.) He ( <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> ) himself re<lb break="no"/>presented constituents with energy and <lb/>
enterprise sufficient to guarantee pros<lb break="no"/>perity without having to lean on C.P.R. <lb/>
car shops. (Cheers.) The people of   <lb/>
Yorkton raised and exported cereals <lb/>
and cattle and worked out their own <lb/>
prosperity. The speech of the hon. <lb/>
member for West Calgary had two <lb/>
notable characteristics. There was on <lb/>
the one hand propounded two extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary doctrines, and on the other <lb/>
there was captious criticism. The <lb/>
hon. member argued that we needed <lb/>
provincial establishment because the <lb/>
elevator monopoly was bad. It had <lb/>
surprised <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> to learn that <lb/>
provincial establishment would free us <lb/>
from elevator monopoly. He had be<lb break="no"/>lieved that the question was a federal <lb/>
matter and embraced in the subject <lb/>
of Trade and Commerce. If his recol<lb break="no"/>lection was not wholly bad the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces no more than the Territories <lb/>
were free from elevator monopolies. <lb/>
It was not a happy compliment <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. <lb/>
Bennett</persName> paid the members of the As<lb break="no"/>sembly to show he thought he could <lb/>
bamboozle them with the notion that <lb/>
provincial establishment would give <lb/>
the power to deal with the question of <lb/>
grain trade. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—On my responsibility <lb/>
as a lawyer I state that a province <lb/>
would have such power. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Parick</persName>—Not being a lawyer I <lb/>
will not challenge the statement of the <lb/>
hon. member, but I venture to say at <lb/>
all events that the question of elevator <lb/>
monopoly will have passed into history <lb/>
before negotiations could possibly be <lb/>
completed to admit the Territories <lb/>
into confederation as a province. <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. <lb/>
Patrick</persName> next referred to Mr. Bennett's <lb/>
second argument for establishment, <lb/>
namely, that by it railway competiton <lb/>
could be secured. He said the best <lb/>
thought of the country was now unani<lb break="no"/>mously of opinion that competiton <lb/>
was not an effectual remedy against high <lb/>
freight rates. The best thought of the <lb/>
country was against the construction <lb/>
of railways for the sole purpose of se<lb break="no"/>curing competition. Unless there was <lb/>
need of a railway to serve the uses of a <lb/>
people or a district, no railway should <lb/>
be constructed. <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> in a clear <lb/>
manner presented the argument that <lb/>
if a district had one railway and the <lb/>
one road could handle the trade and <lb/>
freight of the district, it was very un<lb break="no"/>likely that the construction of a second <lb/>
line would permanently reduce rates, <lb/>
because the people of that district <lb/>
would have to meet the running ex<lb break="no"/>penses account and the interest account <lb/>
of two lines instead of one. The result <lb/>
might be competition for awhile, but <lb/>
was most likely to be combination even<lb break="no"/>tually. Public control of railways rath<lb break="no"/>er than competiton was now recog<lb break="no"/>nised as the solution of the freight rates <lb/>
problem. The power to bonus rail<lb break="no"/>ways was a power, and the business <lb/>
of bonusing railways was a business, <lb/>
which might be advantageous and jus<lb break="no"/>tifiable, but demanded extreme care <lb/>
and caution. A great many people in <lb/>
this country would fail to agree with <lb/>
Mr. Bennett that the bonusing power <lb/>
was altogether desirable. <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> <lb/>
read a trenchant comment on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject from "Events," an Ottawa publi<lb break="no"/>cation, claiming that the people of <lb/>
Canada had been "bonus-mad." He <lb/>
averred that sounder reasons than that <lb/>
advanced on the railway question <lb/>
would have to be adduced to warrant <lb/>
provincial establishment. At least it <lb/>
would have to be shown that there was <lb/>
no other way to obtain freight rates re<lb break="no"/>lief, which would mean final admission <lb/>
that the railway company power was <lb/>
supreme in Canada, that the creature <lb/>
was greater than the creator, and that <lb/>
the Government—the public—was not <lb/>
supreme in its own affairs. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Ben<lb break="no"/>nett argued</persName> that provincial establish<lb break="no"/>ment would not lead to direct taxation. <lb/>
If they took Manitoba's case, <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Pat<lb break="no"/>rick</persName> failed to see how the argument <lb/>
could be sustained. Manitoba was <lb/>
paying $100,000 yearly in interest. <lb/>
Some of the municipalities in Manitoba <lb/>
had bankrupted themselves by borrow<lb break="no"/>ing to bonus railways. If the province <lb/>
did not now need to pay the large <lb/>
amounts in interest, the revenue de<lb break="no"/>voted to that purpose could be devoted <lb/>
to municipal purposes, which certainly <lb/>
would lessen the taxation that muni<lb break="no"/>cipalities had to impose on themselves. <lb/>
So <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> thought the matter was <lb/>
as broad as it was long. The system in <lb/>
Manitoba had resulted in taxation. <lb/>
Pledging the public credit to create <lb/>
prosperity was a doubtful or at least <lb/>
serious proceeding, and the last state <lb/>
of a community entering upon such a <lb/>
course was often worse than the first. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MAKING THINGS HAPPEN.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> desired the Government <lb/>
of this country to "make things hap<lb break="no"/>pen." His argument seemed to be <lb/>
that borrowing power was a necessary <lb/>
antecedent to the power to make <lb/>
things happen. Judging from his <lb/>
statistics referring to Dakota, Mon<lb break="no"/>tana, etc., making things happen con<lb break="no"/>sisted chiefly in procuring population. <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> recalled that the province <lb/>
from which Mr. Bennett came (New <lb/>
Brunswick) had had the borrowing <lb/>
power, the power to make things hap<lb break="no"/>pen, for fifty years. Why, he asked, <lb/>
did not Mr. Bennett remain where <lb/>
there was such power ready to be <lb/>
exercised? Well, what had been made <lb/>
to happen in New Brunswick? In the <lb/>
decade ending 1891, the census showed <lb/>
that the population of that province <lb/>
increased by the magnificent number <lb/>
of eleven souls. Things happend with <lb/>
a vengeance. (Applause.) With <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr.  <lb/>
Bennett</persName>'s departure the number was <lb/>
cut down to ten. <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> had <lb/>
read just a day or two ago of a woman <lb/>
in the immigration sheds at Calgary <lb/>
surrounded by a family of eleven child<lb break="no"/>ren all under the age of seven years. <lb/>
This would seem to show that New <lb/>
Brunswick with the borrowing power <lb/>
was not to be compared with the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories lacking such power as a place <lb/>
where things might happen. (Pro<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

longed laughter and cheers.) <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. <lb/>
Bennett</persName> had quoted many United <lb/>
States statistics. He neglected to <lb/>
quote the experience of Kansas, which <lb/>
State with the power to make things <lb/>
happen had loaded itself with a <lb/>
burden of $800,000,000 debt, counting <lb/>
State, municipal and farm mortgages, <lb/>
and from which State men were <lb/>
now fleeing and flocking to this <lb/>
country in scores and hundreds to es<lb break="no"/>cape the results of the power to make <lb/>
things happen. (Cheers.) That was  <lb/>
an example which the people of these <lb/>
Territories would do well to avoid. <lb/>
The speaker would not argue that the <lb/>
public credit should never be pledged, <lb/>
but the proceeding was one demanding <lb/>
the utmost consideration and caution. <lb/>
He admitted that municipalities should <lb/>
be the free act of a free people, as <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. <lb/>
Bennett</persName> stated, but found that it had <lb/>
not always been so in Manitoba. When <lb/>
the public revenues were mortgaged, <lb/>
and large sums had to go out in in<lb break="no"/>terest, the government was deprived of <lb/>
ability to meet certain services through<lb break="no"/>out the country, the result being that <lb/>
the people were obliged to undertake <lb/>
those services themselves,—were com<lb break="no"/>pelled by circumstances to undertake <lb/>
municipal organisation. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">DOES THE END JUSTIFY THE MEANS?</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> took direct issue with <lb/>
Mr. Bennett on his statement of doc<lb break="no"/>trine that the end justifies the means. <lb/>
It was so far as he knew the first time <lb/>
the doctrine had ever been openly pro<lb break="no"/>pounded in a public assembly. There <lb/>
had been men willing to adopt and <lb/>
practise the doctrine, but not before <lb/>
had there been a man unscrupulous <lb/>
enough to boldly announce his belief in <lb/>
such a pernicious doctrine. Dr. Pat<lb break="no"/>rick had been sorry to hear the an<lb break="no"/>nouncement. Alluding to the rusty <lb/>
well borer at Olds, the speaker <lb/>
reminded the House that it was <lb/>
less than two years since the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment became responsible for public <lb/>
works and public property. Formerly <lb/>
individual members had the direc<lb break="no"/>tion and responsibility, and the <lb/>
Government should not be held <lb/>
chargeable for the mis-direction <lb/>
or neglect of members under <lb/>
the discarded system. On the irriga<lb break="no"/>tion experiment matter, <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> <lb/>
thought Mr. Bennett would have acted <lb/>
more appropriately had he abstained <lb/>
from boring the House with the read<lb break="no"/>ing of long correspondence; he could <lb/>
have had the correspondence laid on <lb/>
the Table. There was a principle enun<lb break="no"/>ciated by <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> with which the <lb/>
speaker took issue, namely, that the <lb/>
Government was amenable to the indi<lb break="no"/>vidual member in respect of works un<lb break="no"/>dertaken in his district. That was <lb/>
wrong. The Government was amen<lb break="no"/>able to the House for every expendi<lb break="no"/>ture. Personally he was not ready to <lb/>
accept as proper, expenditures in West <lb/>
Calgary district or in any other dis<lb break="no"/>trict merely because the member repre<lb break="no"/>senting the district approved the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. There had to be for every <lb/>
expenditure a public reason to justify <lb/>
it with the House and the country as a <lb/>
whole. The speaker deprecated con<lb break="no"/>tentious debates on the address, and <lb/>
read another comment from "Events" <lb/>
on that subject, condemning the wast<lb break="no"/>ing of time in discussions which result<lb break="no"/>ed in nothing. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>'s remarks <lb/>
against existing legislation were a re<lb break="no"/>flection upon the old members. Terri<lb break="no"/>torial legislation could well bear com<lb break="no"/>parison. In Manitoba in 1898, 90 per <lb/>
cent. of the legislation consisted of <lb/>
amending bills. A similar percentage <lb/>
would be found in all legislatures. At <lb/>
any rate before 1897 the Government <lb/>
here were not responsible for the legis<lb break="no"/>lation more than other members. In <lb/>
conclusion the speaker exhorted Mr. <lb/>
Bennett to retract his declaration of <lb/>
belief in the doctrine as to the end jus<lb break="no"/>tifying the means. He asked Mr. Ben<lb break="no"/>nett if he would retract it and remove <lb/>
the stigma from the House. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> said he would reiterate <lb/>
the doctrine. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> regretted the reiteration. <lb/>
Such doctrine might lead to anything. <lb/>
If Calgary were made a capital and the <lb/>
hon. member accepted a portfolio in a <lb/>
cabinet;—he believed Mr. Bennett not <lb/>
only thought he was capable of man<lb break="no"/>aging a portfolio, but of distributing <lb/>
such as well;—and if he succeeded in <lb/>
borrowing that $2,000,000 (the speaker <lb/>
said he was only following Mr. Ben<lb break="no"/>nett's example in referring to things <lb/>
transpiring outside the House);—if the <lb/>
hon. member in capacity of minister <lb/>
of Public Works or Treasurer were ap<lb break="no"/>proached by men seeking railway <lb/>
charters and bonuses, and leaned too <lb/>
heavily on that doctrine of the end jus<lb break="no"/>tifying the means,—well such men <lb/>
were believed to be capable of sugges<lb break="no"/>tions and who could say to what the <lb/>
doctrine might lead? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—Order. I propose to <lb/>
let pass no insinuations against my <lb/>
honesty, integrity or honor. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> said nothing was farther <lb/>
from his mind than to insinuate any<lb break="no"/>thing improper. He was merely draw<lb break="no"/>ing the logical deduction of the course <lb/>
of the man who believed in the doc<lb break="no"/>trine. He was sorry that the deduction <lb/>
led to extreme and deplorable lengths. <lb/>
The hon. member should retract it and <lb/>
express regret that he had dared to say <lb/>
that the end justifies the means. It <lb/>
was due to the House, to his constitu<lb break="no"/>ents and to himself that he retract. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>—Conclude. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName>—He does not retract, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker. He adheres to his view. <lb/>
At any rate, continued <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. <lb/>
Patrick</persName>, when he gets the $2,000,000, he <lb/>
will have to provide for repayment <lb/>
and payment of interest. At 4 per cent. <lb/>
that would mean $80,000 in interest <lb/>
yearly, and $40,000 would have to go <lb/>
yearly into sinking fund. The revenues <lb/>
would be charged with those amounts <lb/>
at once, and complex municipal or<lb break="no"/>ganisation would be an immediate <lb/>
necessity. The people of Eastern As<lb break="no"/>siniboia want no two millions borrowed <lb/>
just yet. (Applause.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">AN EXPLANATION.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. BENNETT</persName> moved the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment of the House to make an explana<lb break="no"/>tion. He had been stating the policies <lb/>
of the States to the south and showing <lb/>
the results, and his argument was that <lb/>
the ends they attained justified the <lb/>
means they adopted, and would justify <lb/>
us in adopting the same means. He <lb/>
believed their example was our war<lb break="no"/>rant to dare something, to speculate a <lb/>
little. They believed the end justified <lb/>
the means. "I believe so, too," said <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. <lb/>
Bennet</persName>, "in matters of that kind." <lb/>
He would fling back any insinuation <lb/>
that he could be bought by charter <lb/>
mongers. Because he had hope and  <lb/>
enthusiasm, because he could see great <lb/>
possibilities for this country, he did <lb/>
not think justified any such insinua<lb break="no"/>tion. The man who would insinuate <lb/>
that another man could be bought,— <lb/>
"well, the House knows the proverb," <lb/>
concluded <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName>. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE COMMISSIONER OF AGRI<lb break="no"/>CULTURE TAKES A HAND.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BULY1">MR. BULYEA</persName> said that partly for <lb/>
the reason that the third member of <lb/>
the Executive Council was a subject of <lb/>
the Speech he had not intended joining <lb/>
in the debate, and would not have done <lb/>
so had not certain remarks made by the <lb/>
hon. member for West Calgary de<lb break="no"/>manded reply. The hon. member had <lb/>
made a violent attack upon an act of <lb/>
administration of the department over <lb/>
which he had the honor to preside. <lb/>
First <persName ref="pers:BULY1">Mr. Bulyea</persName> desired to concur in <lb/>
expressions already made respecting <lb/>
Lieut.-Governor Forget, the late Lieut.-<lb break="yes"/>Governor Cameron, the Aberdeens and <lb/>
the new Governor General, Earl Minto. <lb/>
He further was highly pleased to see in <lb/>
the chamber the man who had been <lb/> 

<cb/>

the first lieut.-governor of these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, Hon. David Laird. (Applause.) <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:BULY1">Mr. Bulyea</persName> was sure that Mr. Laird <lb/>
could not fail to note wonderful pro<lb break="no"/>gress since he came into the country <lb/>
twenty-five years ago, despite Mr. Ben<lb break="no"/>nett's complaint that things had not <lb/>
been made to happen. In reality the <lb/>
progress made could well bear com<lb break="no"/>parison with any portion of Canada or <lb/>
even of America. (Applause.) Mr.  <lb/>
Bennett had not come to the House <lb/>
without reputation. His fame as a <lb/>
speaker had preceded him, and his <lb/>
speech on the address had been looked <lb/>
forward to with great interest. As a <lb/>
display of volubility, a flow of words, <lb/>
the speech was no disappointment, but <lb/>
in other respects Mr. Bulyea placed <lb/>
himself in the judgement of the House <lb/>
in saying the speech was a great dis<lb break="no"/>appointment. They had expected the <lb/>
hon. member to treat the public ques<lb break="no"/>tions on a proper and sensible basis, <lb/>
but they found that he permitted no <lb/>
illogical argument, no stretch of ima<lb break="no"/>gination, no contention however ridi<lb break="no"/>culous to stand in his way in his at<lb break="no"/>tempts to score a point. He would <lb/>
even set his opinion above that of the <lb/>
Minister of Justice, for instance on the <lb/>
question of power to control the <lb/>
grain trade. The province of <lb/>
Manitoba had no more power <lb/>
to overcome elevator monopolies than <lb/>
the Territories possessed, and it ill <lb/>
became the hon. member to seek to <lb/>
support the case for provincial estab<lb break="no"/>lishment by such mistaken pleas. Such <lb/>
methods of argument could only find <lb/>
warrant in the doctrine that the end <lb/>
justified the means. (Cheers.) The  <lb/>
hon. member apparently went on the <lb/>
principle that any port was good in a <lb/>
storm. Another rash allegation of the <lb/>
hon. member was the one in which the <lb/>
Government was accused of putting an <lb/>
untrue statement in the mouth of the <lb/>
lieut.-governor. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> went the <lb/>
extraordinary length of <lb/></p>

 <p rendition="simple:centre">BRANDING AS A LIE</p>
 
<p>a statement presented to the House by <lb/>
His Honor. The fact that Mr. Bennett <lb/>
was a young member and a new mem<lb break="no"/>ber, and possibly not quite acquainted <lb/>
with what was proper in an assembly <lb/>
of that kind, not quite cognisant of <lb/>
the decencies of debate, had saved him <lb/>
from being called to order. The covert <lb/>
attack made by the hon. member on <lb/>
the Attorney-General he (Mr. Bulyea) <lb/>
need not refer to. It was quite un<lb break="no"/>necessary for anyone to defend Mr. <lb/>
Haultain in that House. The House <lb/>
would recognise the unfairness of the <lb/>
hon. member in taking a couple of <lb/>
opening sentences,—the preliminary <lb/>
joke by which most good speakers get <lb/>
on good terms with their audience— <lb/>
upon which to base criticism and ridi<lb break="no"/>cule of Mr. Haultain's Calgary speech. <lb/>
If he had wished to citicise it would <lb/>
have been becoming in him to take the <lb/>
lines and arguments of the speech as <lb/>
his text. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BULY1">Mr. Bulyea</persName> had not before that day <lb/>
seen Mr. Bennett's election address. <lb/>
From one who was such a stickler for <lb/>
definiteness he would have expected <lb/>
some definiteness. But in that <lb/>
address the House would find little <lb/>
in line with the stand Mr. Bennett <lb/>
had taken in the House. The ad<lb break="no"/>dress made no attack on the <lb/>
policy of the Government; it even <lb/>
pointed out no fault in the Election <lb/>
Ordinance. If that law was bad now, <lb/>
it was surely as bad four months ago <lb/>
and Mr. Bennett as a candidate failed <lb/>
to point to its badness. Mr. Bulyea <lb/>
was pained at the recklessness of Mr. <lb/>
Bennett's wanton charge that the Or<lb break="no"/>dinance was maintained for a corrupt <lb/>
purpose. That was a kind of state<lb break="no"/>ment which the House as a whole <lb/>
would resent. The hon. member had <lb/>
more to retract than was asked by the <lb/>
member for Yorkton. The complete <lb/>
answer to the charge was that the <lb/>
Ordinance had been revised and con<lb break="no"/>solidated by a commission upon which <lb/>
sat two Supreme Court judges, and <lb/>
that afterwards it was entirely <lb/>
recast by one of those judges, <lb/>
an ornament of the Territorial Bench <lb/>
against whom no man would dare <lb/>
to cast an insinuation. (Applause.) The  <lb/>
Government was accused of dilly-dally<lb break="no"/>ing with the <lb/></p>


<p rendition="simple:centre">QUESTION OF AUTONOMY.</p>
 
 
<p><persName ref="pers:BULY1">Mr. Bulyea</persName> dealt somewhat gingerly <lb/>
with this accusation. He said that it <lb/>
might be that the time has arrived for <lb/>
establishment. It was time to con<lb break="no"/>sider the financial position, and he ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that if no other way could be <lb/>
found of betterment, then the problem <lb/>
of establishment must needs be faced. <lb/>
The step could not be taken in a day. <lb/>
The Territories must first decide what <lb/>
terms were wanted, and then the ne<lb break="no"/>gotiations would be entered upon. The <lb/>
terms were the chief matter of mom<lb break="no"/>ent. Manitoba had gone into confed<lb break="no"/>eration upon terms which soon proved <lb/>
inadequate and unsatisfactory. <persName ref="pers:BULY1">Mr. <lb/>
Bulyea</persName> thought Mr. Bennett's speech <lb/>
indicated that he had forgotten that <lb/>
the election was ended. The speech <lb/>
was of a campaign character compiled <lb/>
for local application; it was entirely <lb/>
unsuited to Eastern Assinisoia. Like <lb/>
many campaign speeches it was full of <lb/>
inaccuracies, as for instance the state<lb break="no"/>ment that Manitoba's population was <lb/>
300,000. <persName ref="pers:BULY1">Mr. Bulyea</persName> showed that the <lb/>
Manitoba Government's own computa<lb break="no"/>tion in an application to Ottawa for <lb/>
increased subsidy, wherein they would <lb/>
surely not underestimate, was in 1898, <lb/>
193,425. The hon. member was not <lb/>
far out,—just a little more than 33 per <lb/>
cent. <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> charged the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment for the fact that the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies had not grown faster. Why did he <lb/>
not hold them guilty for the slow <lb/>
growth of the Dominion? He had <lb/>
quoted United States statistics. <lb/>
The comparison would apply <lb/>
equally to any province in Canada. In <lb/>
all the States population had increased <lb/>
far faster than in any part of Canada. <lb/>
Manitoba would naturally fill up fast<lb break="no"/>er, or at least earlier, than the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories on account of its position be<lb break="no"/>tween us and the sources of immigra<lb break="no"/>tion. Now, however, things are chang<lb break="no"/>ing, and population is flowing into the <lb/>
Territories. He was unable to express <lb/>
his conviction in such glowing and en<lb break="no"/>thusiastic terms as those used by Mr. <lb/>
Bennett, but he hoped within the next <lb/>
four years to see the population of the <lb/>
Territories increase two fold if not <lb/>
three fold. (Applause.) Mr. Bulyea  <lb/>
had thought that the criticism anent <lb/>
the proportionate number of original <lb/>
and amending bills had been killed last <lb/>
fall. Some candidates had then made <lb/>
use of the criticism, and it had been <lb/>
conclusively proved that any compari<lb break="no"/>son with any other legislature showed <lb/>
in favor of the North-West Assembly. <lb/>
The Lieut.-Governor of Ontario assent<lb break="no"/>ed to 91 Bills in 1897, three months <lb/>
after a volume of Consolidation was <lb/>
promulgated, and of the 91 no less than <lb/>
86 were amending Acts. The experi<lb break="no"/>ence of Manitoba would lead the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories to be very cautious with borrow<lb break="no"/>ing powers and chartering railways. <lb/>
The total revenue of the province is <lb/>
$683,705.67, and of this amount $251,<lb break="no"/>944.49 is needed to pay interest on bor<lb break="no"/>rowed money. The Territories so far <lb/>
are in the fortunate position of having <lb/>
no interest to pay. The speaker em<lb break="no"/>phasized the arguments used <lb/>
by Dr. Patrick on this subject, <lb/>
and instanced the experience of <lb/>
the only rural municipalities in <lb/>
the country—those in his own riding, <lb/>
whose residents had made a mistake <lb/>
by too soon adopting the system. One <lb/>
result in one of the municipalities was <lb/>
a debt of $20,000, the proceeds of the <lb/>
bonds going as a bonus to a mill which <lb/>
has not turned a wheel in ten years. <lb/></p>

  <p><unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> the debt remains as a memento. <lb/>
   <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> districts have now reached a <lb/>
   <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> where municipal organisation is <lb/>
   <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>, but they are hampered by the <lb/>
   <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> of the mistake of organising too <lb/>
   <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>. The discussion taking place two <lb/>
years ago when an idea was mooted to <lb/>
   <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> Manitoba have a slice off the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, had served to show that the <lb/>
   people here very well understood the ef<lb break="no"/><unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> of the system prevailing in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. Each school department in the <lb/>
   Territories , and there were 700 or 800 of <lb/>
them in the 450 school districts organ<lb break="no"/>isation, recieve $300 yearly from the <lb/>
Government; whereas the average in <lb/>
Manitoba is only $130. The people <lb/>
aprehend the importance of this <lb/>
   <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> and understand the reason of it. <lb/>
(Applause.) <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BULY1">Mr. Bulyea</persName> next took the States, <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> of which Mr. Bennett had <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>, and showed the disheartening <lb/>
burden bearing on the people in every <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>of them—state and county taxes <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> in the aggregate from 19 to 34 <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> on the dollar. He related a story <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> American visitor at Olds, Alberta, <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> commented upon the num<lb break="no"/>ber of people congregating at <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> stations in this country to meet <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>. In the States when a train <lb/>
reached a station scarce a man was to <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>, the reason being that any train <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> bear the sheriff and in conse<lb break="no"/>quence people "kept dark" until the <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> disappeared. In this country the <lb/>
Sheriff was a terror to but few, a fact <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> to most of our people being filled <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> less optimism and more business <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> than the hon. gentleman from <lb/>
Wesy Calgary. (Applause). <persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr.Ben<lb break="no"/>nett</persName> was distroting the position when <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> said that the presence of twenty <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> members was condemnation of <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> Government. It was true that <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> had in only a few cases been <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>, and the members came un<lb break="no"/><unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> either in support or opposition, <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> throughout the country during the <lb/>
 campaign wherever the policy and enact<lb break="no"/><unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>. As a lawyer, said <persName ref="pers:BULY1">Mr.Bulyea</persName>, <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> hon. member should have escaped <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> mistake of alleging that because <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> was not actually signed and ar<lb break="no"/>rangement could not be termed com<lb break="no"/>mented. But as a lawyer he seemed to <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> to understand some simple consti<lb break="no"/>tutional points. An agreement might <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> binding in law before any lease was <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>. The statement in the Speech <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> at the [...]<lb/>

<cb/>

<persName ref="pers:CROS1">Mr. CROSS</persName> (East Calgary) spoke <lb/>
very briefly. In his judgement on the <lb/>
general lines of policy the Government <lb/>
had been pursuing a course in the best <lb/>
interests of the country. There might <lb/>
be items deserving criticism but as a <lb/>
whole the policy up to the present <lb/>
time had been such as to give satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion. The Speech promised a good <lb/>
 deal of useful legislation—legislation <lb/>
characteristic of the, good and thought<lb break="no"/>ful policy of the Government. Our pre<lb break="no"/>sent institutions were built on a safe, <lb/>
solid foundation, upon which would be <lb/>
reared the provincial structure. And <lb/>
in his opinion the time had come when <lb/>
we should step ahead a little faster; <lb/>
take a step which of course might to a <lb/>
certain extent be termed speculative, <lb/>
and aspire to what was no doubt a more <lb/>
dangerous pinnacle. The prospects war<lb break="no"/>ranted the step. There was no such <lb/>
thing as standing still. We must <lb/>
either progress or retrograde. If the <lb/>
railway rates question could be solved <lb/>
by other means, well and good, but so <lb/>
far it had been proved impossible <lb/>
to control the companies. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada would either have to <lb/>

<cb/>

show its ability to <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">DICTATE TO THE RAILWAY COMPANIES,</p>
  
  <p>
or these Territories would have to gain <lb/>
power to obtain competition as a par<lb break="no"/>tial, if it was only a partial, remedy. If <lb/>
there was any one thing certain, it was <lb/>
that the people here could not much <lb/>
longer and would not much longer bear <lb/>
the injustices of the present position. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Address in Reply carried without <lb/>
division, and the House adjourned. <lb/></p>
