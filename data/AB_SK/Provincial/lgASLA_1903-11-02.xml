<p rendition="simple:centre">THE ADDRESS IN REPLY.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName> (Banff) on rising to move <lb/>
the address in reply to the Speech of <lb/>
the Lieutenant Governor was greeted <lb/>
with cheers. Referring to the refer<lb break="no"/>ence in the Speech to the adverse clim<lb break="no"/>atic conditions prevailing at harvest <lb/>
time, Mr. Fisher said that the farmers <lb/>
of the country were prosperous and <lb/>
better off this year even than last. The <lb/>
increased prices prevailing would more <lb/>
than make up for the decrease in grades. <lb/>
In the ranching country south and west <lb/>
the ranchers had their own difficulties <lb/>
but the House would agree with him <lb/>
that taking everything into considera<lb break="no"/>tion the country as a whole was in a <lb/>
good and prosperous condition. Res<lb break="no"/>pecting the change in the time of call<lb break="no"/>ing the Assembly together Mr. Fisher <lb/>
said that while it might personally <lb/>
inconvenience some of the Members he <lb/>
was sure every Member would agree <lb/>
that they must consider the welfare of <lb/>
the country and the calling of the <lb/>
House together in the fall would place <lb/>
them in a better position than at any <lb/>
other time to find out and consider and <lb/>
meet the needs of the country. <lb/>
(Cheers.) In regard to the increased <lb/>
anthority and powers conferred on the <lb/>
Assembly over the election of their <lb/>
own Members and in matters affecting <lb/>
the administration of justice, he <lb/>
thought all would welcome it. They <lb/>
were all aware that their authority <lb/>
was somewhat curtailed and the sooner <lb/>
we had greater authority the better <lb/>
for the North-West Territories. <lb/>
(Cheers.) The most important question <lb/>
to come before the House would be the <lb/>
decentralisation of work performed by <lb/>
the Government. The time had come <lb/>

<cb/>

when there must be a change. The <lb/>
change, however, must be very simple <lb/>
and economical at the start. The <lb/>
sooner the local improvement system <lb/>
was improved the better for the people <lb/>
at large. As to the establishment of a <lb/>
University he was glad to see that <lb/>
steps were being taken to secure an <lb/>
endowment fund of lands from the <lb/>
Dominion Government for the purpose <lb/>
of establishing a University that the <lb/>
sons and daughters of the Territories <lb/>
might secure the advantages of higher <lb/>
education without going to the east.  <lb/></p>

<p rendition="simple:centre">MR. L. J. A. L.AMBERT.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAMB1">Mr. Lambert</persName>, the newly-elected <lb/>
Member for St. Albert, seconded the <lb/>
motion in a first rate speech. He said <lb/>
he had a difficult task before him, first, <lb/>
by reason of the fact that he was not <lb/>
altogether at home speaking in the <lb/>
English tongue, and, secondly, on <lb/>
account of the very excellent way in <lb/>
which the Member for Banff had moved <lb/>
the Address in Reply. The actual <lb/>
condition of the affairs of the country <lb/>
warranted His Honor in congratulat<lb break="no"/>ing the House on the same. He was <lb/>
thoroughly in sympathy with the <lb/>
aspirations of the House for the immed<lb break="no"/>iate obtaining of provincial powers. <lb/>
(Cheers.) He believed that the opinion <lb/>
of the House on that question reflected <lb/>
the opinion of the great majority of <lb/>
the people. He had been elected to <lb/>
support that policy which had been so <lb/>
unanimuously voiced by the House.  It <lb/>
was only with a modified feeling of <lb/>
satisfaction, therefore, that he referred <lb/>
to the extension of the jurisdiction of <lb/>
the Assembly over the matters referred <lb/>
to in the Speech. He would suggest <lb/>
having much of the work at present <lb/>
done by justices of the peace done by <lb/>
fully qualified police magistrates. <lb/></p> 

<p>Touching on the proposed decentral<lb break="no"/>isation of some of the work at present <lb/>
performed by the Public Works De<lb break="no"/>partment, Mr. Lambert said that the <lb/>
country was too large to permit the <lb/>
Department to deal with the work re<lb break="no"/>quired in different parts of the country <lb/>
and matters, such as roads, should be <lb/>
left to the people themselves. At the <lb/>
same time he could not see that our re<lb break="no"/>quirements demanded any extensive <lb/>
municipal system, or heavy taxation, <lb/>
but some simple method by which the <lb/>
people could elect a board or committee <lb/>
to do the work and which they would <lb/>
be quite willing to pay for. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PREMIER HAULTAIN.</p> 

<p>After a considerable pause <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Premier <lb/>
Haultain</persName> rose. He said that although <lb/>
he was not given the usual lead by <lb/>
some one from the Opposition side of <lb/>
the House he must at least take an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of congratulating the hon. <lb/>
gentlemen who had moved and second<lb break="no"/>ed the Address. He did so not in any <lb/>
formal manner for they had performed <lb/>
in a highly creditable manner the most <lb/>
difficult duty which fell to any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the House. It was easy enough <lb/>
to speak on ordinary matters of busi<lb break="no"/>ness but it was not so easy to make a <lb/>
formal speech on a large amount of <lb/>
general work which is necessarily re<lb break="no"/>ferred to in the Address. He congra<lb break="no"/>ulated both the speakers, and particu<lb break="no"/>larly the seconder of the Address, and <lb/>
in doing so expressed his regret that <lb/>
the members of the House had not all <lb/>
received such an education as to enable <lb/>
them to follow the hon. gentleman if <lb/>
he should address them in his own <lb/>
language. (Cheers.) <lb/></p> 

<p>On the question of the general pros<lb break="no"/>perity of the country there was only <lb/>
one note to be sounded in the House. <lb/>
The climatic conditions unfortunately <lb/>
had not been all that could be desired <lb/>
at harvest time but there was nothing <lb/>
to affect the feelings of hope and aspir<lb break="no"/>ations of the whole of the country for <lb/>
its future. There was no cause for <lb/>
pessimism. There would be lean years <lb/>
and fat years, good harvests and bad <lb/>
harvests, but the adverse conditions <lb/>
which prevailed this year were only <lb/>
another cause to give us confidence <lb/>
that we have the best soil in the world <lb/>
and are destined to become the gran<lb break="no"/>ary of the Empire. (Cheers.) <lb/></p> 

<p>He need not say anything about the <lb/>
holding of the fall session of the House. <lb/>
The previous speakers had given rea<lb break="no"/>sons for the change. In future, ex<lb break="no"/>cept under very extraordinary circum<lb break="no"/>stances, the House would be called <lb/>
together in the fall. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">REQUEST FOR LARGER POWERS.</p> 

<p>With regard to the extension of the <lb/>
powers of the Assembly there seemed <lb/>
to have been some misapprehension in <lb/>
certain quarters as to the conditions <lb/>
under which these had been asked for. <lb/>
The House would understand that in <lb/>
their annual pilgrimages to Ottawa the <lb/>
members of the Government had two <lb/>
duties to perform. In the first place <lb/>
they had the duty of carrying out the <lb/>
wishes of the legislature in the matters <lb/>
on which it had expressed an opinion. <lb/>
On the more important matter, there<lb break="no"/>fore, they had gone down with de<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

mands for provincial autonomy. <lb/>
(Cheers.) They had also to deal with <lb/>
the practical affairs of the day and <lb/>
there was no reason why, while wait<lb break="no"/>ing for the establishment of provincial <lb/>
institutions, they should not get an <lb/>
extension of powers to enable them to <lb/>
more eficiently carry on the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. We pressed for autonomy and <lb/>
asked for additions to our powers, not <lb/>
in lieu of autonomy but while waiting <lb/>
for it. Autonomy might be delayed <lb/>
from week to week and year to year <lb/>
but there was no reason why they <lb/>
should not receive larger powers along <lb/>
certain lines. <lb/></p> <lb/>

<p rendition="simple:centre">PROVINCIAL AUTONOMY</p> 

<p>Although it was not mentioned in <lb/>
the Speech the most important ques<lb break="no"/>tion before them was provincial auto<lb break="no"/>nomy. It must he gratifying to the <lb/>
Members of the House that an impor<lb break="no"/>tant constituency had just recently de<lb break="no"/>clared in favor of the aspirations of the <lb/>
House on this question. In the elec<lb break="no"/>tion in St. Albert both the candidates <lb/>
were agreed on provincial autonomy. <lb/>
There was no necessity to discuss the <lb/>
question at length at the present time. <lb/>
The Legislature had declared itself <lb/>
over and over again on it. Not more <lb/>
than six months ago the House passed <lb/>
an address to the Governor General in <lb/>
Council in the following words: "That <lb/>
the Legislative Assembly, representing, <lb/>
as it does, the unanimous opinion of <lb/>
the people of the Territories, believes <lb/>
that nothing short of that system of <lb/>
government enjoyed by our fellow <lb/>
citizens in the provinces will afford a <lb/>
solution of the legislative and financial <lb/>
difficulties which confront it; therefore <lb/>
we do humbly pray that Your Excel<lb break="no"/>lency in Council will cause such action <lb/>
to be taken as will provide for the <lb/>
present and immediate financial neces<lb break="no"/>sities of the Territories and will further <lb/>
provide for the establishment of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial institutions in the Territories <lb/>
upon fair and just terms analagous to <lb/>
those upon which the old provinces <lb/>
have been dealt with." <lb/></p> 

<p>There has been no change, continued <lb/>
the Premier, in the conditions affect<lb break="no"/>ing this question since the passing of <lb/>
that address. The only difference <lb/>
between now and then is that six <lb/>
months have elapsed. The same <lb/>

<cb/>

reasons which justified action then <lb/>
still exist. The necessities then are  <lb/>
still necessities at the present moment. <lb/>
The population is increasing and will <lb/>
continue to increase. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment must continue to lead in, and the <lb/>
House continue to support, the demand <lb/>
for those institutions and in pressing <lb/>
for the claims that, in the language <lb/>
employed in the address to the <lb/>
Governor General in Council, "is en<lb break="no"/>joyed by our fellow citizens in the <lb/>
provinces and upon fair and just terms <lb/>
analogous to those upon which the old <lb/>
provinces have been dealt with." <lb/>
(Cheers.) <lb/></p> <lb/>

<p>The Address was then ordered to be <lb/>
engrossed and conveyed to His Honor <lb/>
the Lieutenant Governor and the <lb/>
House adjourned. <lb/></p> 

 <!-- IC, 2018-10-31, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

<!--<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 3. <lb/></p> 

<p>DR. PATRICK IS INQUISITIVE. <lb/></p> 

<p>Dr. Patrick gave notice that on Fri<lb break="no"/>day next he will inquire of the Hon<lb break="no"/>ourable the Commissioner of Public <lb/>
Works whether under date of 16th of <lb/>
June, 1903, he addressed from the Ex<lb break="no"/>ecutive Council, Regina, to the Rt. <lb/>
Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, G.C.M.G., <lb/>
Premier of Canada, a letter advising <lb/>
him among other things that he, the <lb/>
Hon. the Commissioner of Public <lb/>
Works, had "advised the federal mem<lb break="no"/>bers representing the Territories" that <lb/>
if the "general representations" made <lb/>
by the said federal members to his (Sir <lb/>
Wilfrid Laurier's Government) were <lb/>
adopted it would reasonably satisfy <lb/>
the general public in the Territories <lb/>
and would put his (Sir Wilfrid <lb/>
Laurier's) candidates in the coming <lb/>
election in a position in which they <lb/>
could "fight with zeal;" and if so, <lb/></p> 

<p>(2) Whether the "general represen<lb break="no"/>tations" referred to in the said letter as <lb/>
having been made by the federal mem<lb break="no"/>bers representing the Territories were <lb/>
such as may fairly be inferred from <lb/>
the general tenor of the speeches made <lb/>
on such of the federal representatives <lb/>
from the Territories as took part in <lb/>
the debate on the amendment to the <lb/>
motion to go into Committee of Sup<lb break="no"/>ply made in the House of Commons on <lb/>
the 13th day of October last past; and, <lb/></p> 

<p>(3) If such may not be fairly inferred <lb/>
what were the " general representa<lb break="no"/>tions " referred to? and, <lb/></p> 

<p>(4) What was meant by the refer<lb break="no"/>ence in the said letter to provincial <lb/>
autonomy as an alternative, and, <lb/></p> 

<p>(5) Whether the said letter was writ<lb break="no"/>ten and forwarded with the knowledge <lb/>
and consent of the Honorable Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner's colleagues on the Executive <lb/>
Council? and, <lb/></p> 

<p>(6) Whether the general tenor of the <lb/>
letter was " strongly approved " over <lb/>
the signatures of Geo. W. Brown, L. <lb/>
Geo. De Veber, J. W. Woolf, W. T. <lb/>
Finlay, C. W. Fisher, A. D. McIntyre, <lb/>
Charles Fisher, A. S. Smith, P. Talbot, <lb/>
B. Prince, R. A. Wallace, J. A. Simp<lb break="no"/>son, A. S. Rosenroll, Thos. MacNutt <lb/>
and Alex. C. Rutherford, members of <lb/>
this House? <lb/></p>
