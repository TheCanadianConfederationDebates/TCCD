Government's Refusal to Grant <lb/>
Provincial Powers—Dr. Patrick <lb/>
Moves a Long Amendment Agree<lb break="no"/>ing With Most of the Terms Asked <lb/>
But Declaring for Two Provinces. <lb/></head> 

<p rendition="simple:right">TUESDAY, April 8th.</p> 

<p>The announcement that Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain would move his resolution express<lb break="no"/>ing regret that the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had not introduced legislation at <lb/>
the present session of Parliament grant<lb break="no"/>ing provincial autonomy to the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories resulted in every member with the <lb/>
single exception of Mr. Greeley, who is <lb/>
ill, being in his seat to-day, and in <lb/>
addition the space reserved for the <lb/>
public was crowded. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SIMP1">Mr. Simpson</persName> (Red Deer), presented a <lb/>
petition to incorporate the Red Deer <lb/>
memorial hospital. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:GILL3">Mr. A. B. Gillis</persName> presented the report <lb/>
of the committee on standing orders <lb/>
recommending that the following <lb/>
petitions be received: To incorporate <lb/>
the National Trust Co.; to amend the <lb/>
Ordinance incorporating Lethbridge: <lb/>
and to grant additional powers to the <lb/>
city of Calgary. The report was con<lb break="no"/>curred in. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SIFT2">Mr. Sifton</persName> moved that the public <lb/>
accounts and the auditor's report be <lb/>
referred to the public accounts com<lb break="no"/>mittee. Agreed. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCKA6">Mr. McKay</persName> asked the Commissioner <lb/>
of Public Works the following ques<lb break="no"/>tions: (1) When did his department <lb/>
first receive information that the <lb/>
bridge on Red Deer Creek between <lb/>
sections 28 and 27, township 47, range <lb/>
26, west of the second meridian was <lb/>
unsafe for traffic? (2) When were in<lb break="no"/>structions for the construction of a <lb/>
new bridge to replace the above-men<lb break="no"/>tioned bridge first issued; (3) Was the <lb/>
said bridge constructed under contract <lb/>
or by a bridge gang: If under con<lb break="no"/>tract, who was the contractor and <lb/>
what was the contract price? If by a <lb/>
bridge gang, who was the foreman? <lb/>
On whose recommendation was this <lb/>
bridge paid for? What was the total <lb/>
cost of the bridge which is mentioned <lb/>
on page 68 of the Public Works An<lb break="no"/>nual Report, 1901, as one of the 113 <lb/>
bridges constructed? (4) Whether, a <lb/>
separate report was submitted by <lb/>
Cyrus Carroll, Esq., L.S.D., on his in<lb break="no"/>vestigation as to the possible drainage <lb/>
of a large slough on section 25, town<lb break="no"/>ship 47, west of the second meridian <lb/>
and if so what was the finding in the <lb/>
said report? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SIFT2">Mr. Sifton</persName> replied: (1) Notice was <lb/>
received on May 8, 1901. (2) Tenders <lb/>
called for June 8, 1901. (3) Bridge was <lb/>
constructed under a contract let to a <lb/>
man named John Courtney, of Prince <lb/>
Albert. Cost $190, but bridge not yet <lb/>
completed and no report has been <lb/>
made upon it. (4) No, he has not sub<lb break="no"/>mitted any report of survey. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PUBLIC WORKS IN YORKTON.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> moved for the correspon<lb break="no"/>dence between the Department of <lb/>
Public Works and all persons on and <lb/>
after March 16, 1901 relative to bridge <lb/>
work over the Little White Sand <lb/>
River, Cussed Creek, Wild's Creek, In<lb break="no"/>singer Creek, and certain other creeks; <lb/>
also as to construction of dam and re<lb break="no"/>servoir on branch of White Sand <lb/>
River and on road allowance between <lb/>
S. 13 and 18, 18-8w2; and as to a large <lb/>
number of road improvements, devia<lb break="no"/>tion surveys and inspection of public <lb/>
works in the Yorkton district; 26 <lb/>
items in all. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> in speaking on this claim<lb break="no"/>ed that the correspondence would <lb/>
show that the Government had not <lb/>
supplied sufficient means for the pub<lb break="no"/>lic works of the country and that what <lb/>
they did spent was not spent in an eco<lb break="no"/>nomical manner. Some bridges which <lb/>
should have heen built early in the <lb/>
season were delayed until there <lb/>
were several inches of frost in the <lb/>
ground. Ample notice had been given <lb/>
and the delay clearly rested with the <lb/>
department. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SIFT2">Mr. Sifton</persName> said he presumed the <lb/>

<cb/>

object of the motion had already been <lb/>
accomplished, which was to show that <lb/>
the Government had not supplied <lb/>
sufficient means for carrying on the <lb/>
public works of the country and had <lb/>
not used them in a proper manner, <lb/>
more especially in the Yorkton district. <lb/>
That object having been attained by <lb/>
the long motion and short but inter<lb break="no"/>esting speech of the member for York<lb break="no"/>ton he did not see any reason why the <lb/>
department should further exhaust the <lb/>
means at its disposal in the prepara<lb break="no"/>tion of a statement of the accounts <lb/>
asked for in this very voluminous mo<lb break="no"/>tion. If all the members of the House <lb/>
had taken the remarkable attitude of <lb/>
the member for Yorkton it would re<lb break="no"/>quire a staff of three or four times the <lb/>
size of the present one to prepare re<lb break="no"/>turns alone, let alone doing some of the <lb/>
work they had been able to do. He ful<lb break="no"/>ly agreed that the Government of the <lb/>
Territories had not sufficient means to <lb/>
do the work for this country. All <lb/>
agreed on that. Every member would <lb/>
also agree that there required and ask<lb break="no"/>ed for a good deal more than they ex<lb break="no"/>pected to obtain with the means at the <lb/>
disposal of the Government. He <lb/>
agreed tat it was their duty to make <lb/>
demands for what they thought was <lb/>
necessary in their constituencies, and <lb/>
they hoped to get a portion of it, but <lb/>
few took the position of the member <lb/>
for Yorkton, who went through his <lb/>
constituency asking the people what <lb/>
they wanted and then published a list <lb/>
in a newspaper stating that he had <lb/>
asked for all these things and threw all <lb/>
the responsibility on the Government. <lb/>
For the same reason he brought up <lb/>
this resolution for the purpose of show<lb break="no"/>ing that he threw the responsibility on <lb/>
the Government. The people knew <lb/>
already that the responsibility was on <lb/>
the Government, and not on the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Yorkton. The district of <lb/>
Yorkton had been treated in a fair <lb/>
mannerWorks had been done there. <lb/>
as far as the means at the disposal of <lb/>
the Government and fairness to other <lb/>
parts of the country would permit. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman got all the work <lb/>
he ought to ask for and certainly all he <lb/>
would obtain. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr.Patrick</persName> in reply said, it had <lb/>
always been his policy to give his pub<lb break="no"/>lic acts that publicity which every <lb/>
man's public nets should have, so he <lb/>
had nothing to be ashamed of. In <lb/>
publishing that list of public works, he <lb/>
also said he would hold the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment responsible not for doing all the <lb/>
work but for what there were good <lb/>
and sufficient reasons should be done. <lb/>
He took the hon. gentleman's remarks <lb/>
as an admission not only that suffic<lb break="no"/>ient ways and means had not been <lb/>
provided but also that his department <lb/>
had not been as efficient as it ought to <lb/>
have been. Dr. Patrick devoted <lb/>
some time to discussing the delays <lb/>
which had taken place. The motion <lb/>
was lost. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> introduced and moved <lb/>
on the first reading of a bill to amend an <lb/>
"Ordinance respecting the Legislative <lb/>
Assembly of the Territories." This is <lb/>
the redistribution bill. It was read a <lb/>
first time and set down for a second <lb/>
reading on Friday. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">The AUTONOMY DEBATE.</p> 

<p>Premier Haultain rose at five min<lb break="no"/>utes after three o;clock and seconded <lb/>
by Mr. Bulyea moved: Whereas the <lb/>
larger powers and income incidental to <lb/>
the provincial status are urgently and <lb/>
imperatively required to aid the de<lb break="no"/>velopment of the Territories and to <lb/>
meet the pressing necessities of a large <lb/>
and rapidly increasing population. Be <lb/>
it resolved the Federal Government has de<lb break="no"/>cided not to introduce legislation at the <lb/>
present session of Parliament, with a <lb/>
view to granting provincial institutions <lb/>
to the Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p>In speaking to this resolution the <lb/>
premier said: Mr. Speaker, in mov<lb break="no"/>ing this resolution and in drafting this <lb/>
resolution I have endeavored to make <lb/>
it as broad as possible and so far as <lb/>
possible non-controversial. In spite of <lb/>
the amendment before the House of <lb/>
portentious length I still have some <lb/>
hopes that before the debate, which <lb/>
will probably arise over this resolution, <lb/>
comes to a conclusion that we will see <lb/>
that this is a subject upon which all <lb/>
can unite in expressing, a general <lb/>
opinion on a general question of large <lb/>
importance, to the Territories, The <lb/>
recital might, I suppose, be considered <lb/>
as non-controversial. I suppose all the <lb/>
members of the House, except the <lb/>
member for Yorkton and the member <lb/>
for Prince Albert East, agree that the <lb/>
time has come for the Territories to be <lb/>
granted these larger powers. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> interrupted that he <lb/>
agreed the Territories required the <lb/>
larger powers. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> —Am I to understand <lb/>
that he agrees with the recital? It <lb/>
then indicates another of those kaleid<lb break="no"/>oscopic changes for, which the hon. <lb/>
member for Yorkton is noted. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.), I would say then, Mr. Speaker, <lb/>
that I certainly have every reason for <lb/>
believing that, notwithstanding the <lb/>
various opinions which the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Yorkton has expressed on this <lb/>
subject up to the present moment, and <lb/>
the hon. member for Prince Albert <lb/>
East has expressed on this question, I <lb/>
have at the present moulent the unami<lb break="no"/>mous consent of the House to the re<lb break="no"/>cital which precedes the resolution. I <lb/>
will go further and say that the reso<lb break="no"/>lution must state the real feeling of <lb/>
every member of the House who gives <lb/>
his consent to the recital (Cries of no, <lb/>
no). This resolution presents the <lb/>
broad statement that provincial institu<lb break="no"/>tions are necessary and immediately <lb/>
necessary in the Territories and that <lb/>
this House regrets that the Dominion <lb/>
Government has not seen fit to bring <lb/>
in legislation at the present session of <lb/>
parliament to grant those institutions. <lb/>
It is not intended in any way to ratify <lb/>
any proposal made by the Government. <lb/>
It is not asking the approval of the <lb/>
House or of any member to the terms <lb/>
we have asked for, or the methods we <lb/>
have adopted in trying to obtain these <lb/>
terms. We are not asking for the <lb/>
judgment of the House now upon <lb/>
what we have asked for. We must <lb/>
look for that and the judgument of the <lb/>
country at the proper time. But what<lb break="no"/>ever differences there may be with <lb/>
regard to details, this Government can<lb break="no"/>not hope to escape from the judgment <lb/>
not only on the general question but on <lb/>
details. The time for that judgment <lb/>
will come before the House and the <lb/>
country at large but not now and not <lb/>
with reference to the resolution I have <lb/>
offered to the House. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">GENERAL DESIRE FOR AUTONOMY.</p> 

<p>Above and beyond all terms of con<lb break="no"/>trovesy and differences of opinion with <lb/>
regard to area and with, regard <lb/>
to other terms upon which these <lb/>
institutions should be granted, there is <lb/>
the general sentiment, the general <lb/>
desire, the general recognition, of the <lb/>
necessity for the establishment of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial institutions in the Territories. <lb/>
No matter what difference of opinion <lb/>
there may be as to details, there is ab<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

solute unanimity over the desirability <lb/>
of granting provincial powers to the <lb/>
Territories. With regard to form <lb/>
there is not unanimity; the country is <lb/>
not unanimous. That is the final mat<lb break="no"/>ter upon which and in regard to which <lb/>
we are not the final arbiters but the <lb/>
Dominion Government are. Again I <lb/>
say in introducing this resolution I <lb/>
have done so in the broadest terms and <lb/>
in such terms that it can be consented <lb/>
to unanimously by members who be<lb break="no"/>lieve in the broad principles I have just <lb/>
laid down. <lb/> </p> 

<p>There are various opinions, in this <lb/>
House with regard to area, but only <lb/>
one as to the institutions themselves. <lb/>
We have the one province men, two <lb/>
sets of two province men, the northern <lb/>
and southern and the eastern and <lb/>
western. We have at least from the <lb/>
hon. gentleman from Yorkton the de<lb break="no"/>claration that the good faith of the <lb/>
Parliament of Canada and the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was pledged to three provinces <lb/>
on the lines of the provisional districts. <lb/>
So we have had one three-province <lb/>
man in the House. There are also <lb/>
those in the country who believe in <lb/>
annexation of a certain part to Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. We have three, four, yes five <lb/>
phases to this question, which if not <lb/>
represented in the House at least have <lb/>
been presented at different times by <lb/>
different people. Unanimity, there<lb break="no"/>fore, is impossible.(Hear, hear). These <lb/>
divergencies of opinion are known not <lb/>
only to every man in this House and <lb/>
Territories but to the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and if there is any necessity <lb/>
for proving that, a simple reference to <lb/>
the correspondence will show that the <lb/>
Dominion Government are alive to it <lb/>
that this is an important question and <lb/>
still more alive that those different <lb/>
opinions are held among the people in <lb/>
various portions of the Territories. <lb/>
Their reply is a comment upon the un<lb break="no"/>desirability when dealing with them of <lb/>
parading our differences. This is a <lb/>
practical question. No member or <lb/>
group of members of this House or the <lb/>
whole House are in a position to settle <lb/>
it. The Dominion Government are <lb/>
the final arbiters and while I believe <lb/>
we will unite in pressing, upon the <lb/>
Dominion Government the immediate <lb/>
necessity of granting provincial insti<lb break="no"/>tutions, it would be a useless waste of <lb/>
time for us to spend a very large am<lb break="no"/>ount of time in discussing these ques<lb break="no"/>tions. I believe that it is desirable <lb/>
that the House should discuss them <lb/>
and it is right that the House should <lb/>
question our way of dealing with the <lb/>
matter, but a resolution which deals <lb/>
exclusively with the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should be dealt with in the man<lb break="no"/>ner it should be dealt with. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">NECESSITY CREATED THE SENTIMENT.</p> 

<p>All are agreed that provincial powers <lb/>
are necessary. It is not necessary to <lb/>
try to convert the hon, member for <lb/>
Yorkton or the hon. member for Prince <lb/>
Albert East. It is not necessary to <lb/>
direct any lengthy argument to this <lb/>
House to prove that the only solution <lb/>
of the problems that are presented to <lb/>
this House and country is the granting <lb/>
of the necessary power to help our<lb break="no"/>selves. The people of the Territories <lb/>
are ready for this movement, and are <lb/>
expecting this movement. I believe <lb/>
that a sentiment has been created and <lb/>
an interest aroused and the expecta<lb break="no"/>tions of the people raised by the dis<lb break="no"/>cussions which have taken place in this <lb/>
Assembly, and by the statements made <lb/>
by ministers at Ottawa, and by state<lb break="no"/>ments of members of the Government <lb/>
in the Assembly and in speeches at <lb/>
public meetings. I will go further and <lb/>
say I believe the very large sentiment <lb/>
is a matter of somewhat recent growth. <lb/>
I believe it has come by the great force <lb/>
of necessity. It has been forced upon <lb/>
the people of this country by necessity, <lb/>
and until these necessities became <lb/>
apparent possibly for years to come <lb/>
there would have been no very large <lb/>
sentiment in favor of a change. The <lb/>
sentiment was created and the opinion <lb/>
made by the fact of the necessity. <lb/>
The question of transportation, the <lb/>
grain blockade, which depends for its <lb/>
solution on the question of transporta<lb break="no"/>tion, the question of our financial <lb/>
position which will be felt very much <lb/>
more acutely before these great ques<lb break="no"/>tions are settled, have forced this <lb/>
matter upon us. The question of <lb/>
transportation is more than a Territor<lb break="no"/>ial question. It is admitted to be the <lb/>
great Canadian question. The boards <lb/>
of trade of Montreal, Toronto and <lb/>
other cities have taken it up and <lb/>
referred to the conditions in the West. <lb/>
I need not make any argument as to <lb/>
the great importance of this question. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">SHOULD PRESENT A UNITED FRONT.</p> 

<p>I will again come back to the origin<lb break="no"/>al theme that with regard to our <lb/>
method of dealing with the Dominion <lb/>
Government this legislature should be <lb/>
unanimous. So I would say then let <lb/>
us so unite in making the general de<lb break="no"/>mand and let us press as we have and <lb/>
will continue to do, trusting to the <lb/>
strength and reasonableness of our <lb/>
case, and forcing our opinion upon the <lb/>
Dominion Government and carrying <lb/>
them through the Dominion House. <lb/>
There is no question about this that an <lb/>
expression of opinion by a large ma<lb break="no"/>jority or a small minority of the <lb/>
Assembly with regard to the provin<lb break="no"/>cial idea or annexation will not help <lb/>
the Dominion Government very largely <lb/>
in coming to a conclusion. As a House <lb/>
in making a general recommendation <lb/>
there would be. If we divide up as <lb/>
one province men, two province men <lb/>
and annexationists, and one used to be <lb/>
for three provinces, if we present our<lb break="no"/>selves in that attitude we are not going <lb/>
to help the Dominion Government <lb/>
very nuch. They know of these differ<lb break="no"/>ences, but I do not believe if we can <lb/>
convince the Government of the nec<lb break="no"/>essity for provincial institutions in the <lb/>
West that the Government would <lb/>
postpone or should postpone the gener<lb break="no"/>al question. The onus for that post<lb break="no"/>ponement must rest where it belongs, <lb/>
at Ottawa. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, as unanimity is, possible on <lb/>
this, then I say that in dealing with <lb/>
the question in our foreign relations, <lb/>
if I may use the term, in our foreign <lb/>
relations with Ottawa we should pre<lb break="no"/>sent as unanimous a front as possible <lb/>
and should take all the steps we can in <lb/>
order to obtain the institutions which <lb/>
we consider are indispensible, and with<lb break="no"/>out regard to areas, and after we have <lb/>
presented these arguments to the <lb/>
Dominion we must take chances its to <lb/>
areas. I believe the overwhelming <lb/>
mass of evidence is in favor of one <lb/>
province. (Hear, hear, and cries of <lb/>
no, no.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WOULD ACCEPT TWO PROVINCES.</p> 

<p>I am so impressed with the necessity <lb/>
of provincial institutions in the west <lb/>
that I consider the question of the <lb/>
area within which provincial institu<lb break="no"/>tions are to be granted and carried out <lb/>
is a question of secondary importance <lb/>
and I am willing to go so far as this. <lb/>
While believing in the one province <lb/>
idea, and while continuing to press for <lb/>
it, I am so convinced of the necessity <lb/>
for provincial institutions in the Ter<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

ritories, that having exhausted all <lb/>
means to obtain this, I would much <lb/>
prefer to see provincial institutions es<lb break="no"/>tablished under two provinces than <lb/>
have provincial institutions indefinite<lb break="no"/>ly postponed in the Territories. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) But let us have one province if <lb/>
we can. The amendment in asking <lb/>
the Dominion Government to give two <lb/>
provinces is making a fatal mistake <lb/>
and those who advocate it are making <lb/>
a great mistake, showing a want of <lb/>
faith in the institutions of the country. <lb/>
But I believe the necessity is so press<lb break="no"/>ing that the worst of two bargains is <lb/>
better than none at all. But I would <lb/>
never agree to annexation. (Cheers). <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE QUESTION OF THE NUMBER.</p> 

<p>Now, hon, gentlemen opposite will <lb/>
say that we have come out for one pro<lb break="no"/>vince. That is perfectly true; we <lb/>
asked for one province. We had to <lb/>
express an opinion (Hear, hear and <lb/>
cries of No.) We were carrying on ne<lb break="no"/>gotiations with the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment making a bargain and we had to <lb/>
make the best we could. Those who <lb/>
say we should have submitted an <lb/>
alternative were recommending a bad <lb/>
policy. They think we should have <lb/>
taken the position of a man selling a <lb/>
horse who asked $100 for it but at the <lb/>
same time said he was willing to take <lb/>
$80. Now that is not the way this <lb/>
Government does their business. We <lb/>
stand out holding strong views as to <lb/>
what is best for this country. We had <lb/>
to admit in our discussions with the <lb/>
Government that there were other <lb/>
opinions in the Territories; at the <lb/>
same time we naturally and properly <lb/>
said we believed in the one province <lb/>
idea. We first had to impress them <lb/>
with the necessity of provincial institu<lb break="no"/>tions, and being impressed would they <lb/>
not have said, "In what area?" Would <lb/>
we have been justified in , saying: <lb/>
"There are a number of other opin<lb break="no"/>ions, therefore, we will not take the <lb/>
responsibility of expressing an opinion?" <lb/>
That is not the position of men going <lb/>
down to negotiate should have taken. <lb/>
It is not the question now. There <lb/>
will be ample opportunity as to the <lb/>
question of the number of provinces of <lb/>
testing the feeling of this House, and <lb/>
before the next year of testing the <lb/>
feeling of the people of the country, in <lb/>
the constituencies on it. At this point <lb/>
we should deal with the larger ques<lb break="no"/>tion and as far as possible present a <lb/>
united front to the federal authorities <lb/>
on the broad question upon which we <lb/>
can all agree. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WHAT THE RESOLUTION MEANS.</p> 

<p>I do not propose to discuss or ask <lb/>
the House to discuss, and the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion does not lead to a discussion of the <lb/>
one, two or three province idea. Nor <lb/>
does it lead to a discussion of out meth<lb break="no"/>ods of approaching the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The question is as presented <lb/>
in the resolution, are these larger <lb/>
powers necessary? Can the Territories <lb/>
go on as at present? Are we in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion, financially or constitutionally to <lb/>
adequately deal with the problems <lb/>
confronting us? There is only one <lb/>
answer to that. I think every man in <lb/>
the House except the two I have nam<lb break="no"/>ed , the hon. members for Yorkton and <lb/>
Prince Albert East, will agree that we <lb/>
are ready—— <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCLE6">Mr. McLeod</persName>—I do not think the hon. <lb/>
gentleman is justified in making that <lb/>
statement. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—Are you ready? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCLE6">Mr. McLeod</persName>—I agree that we are <lb/>
ready, but if we are prepared for one <lb/>
province we are prepared for two or <lb/>
three. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> –Do I understand the <lb/>
hon. gentleman to say that I misrepre<lb break="no"/>sent him as saying that he is not in <lb/>
favor of the immediate granting of <lb/>
provincial instituents? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCLE6">Mr. McLeod</persName>—I am in favor of it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—I am glad to know <lb/>
that the hon. gentleman can make up <lb/>
his mind at the eleventh hour. He <lb/>
had expressed an entirly opposite op<lb break="no"/>inion to his constituents. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCLE6">Mr. McLeod</persName>—Not at all. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>—The hon. gentleman <lb/>
not only stated that he was opposed to <lb/>
the establishment of provincial powers <lb/>
at once but that he had gone to Otta<lb break="no"/>wa to prevent it. I say again that <lb/>
with the exception now of only the <lb/>
hon, gentleman from Yorkton, who is <lb/>
in his ordinary attitude of glorious <lb/>
isolation (Laughter), on this subject in <lb/>
this House there is only one answer. <lb/>
Every man in the House except the <lb/>
hon. member—I regret that I always <lb/>
have to make this exception—must be <lb/>
forced to the conclusion that provin<lb break="no"/>cial powers are necessary. Without <lb/>
going into the method of conducting <lb/>
the negotiations I say that it will be at <lb/>
least admitted that a strong case was <lb/>
made out by the Government for more <lb/>
power and more money, and these are <lb/>
the only questions which should he <lb/>
considered to-day, and even this is not <lb/>
included in the present resolution, <lb/></p> 

<p>With regard to the resolution itself <lb/>
I feel I can confidently ask every mem<lb break="no"/>of the House, whether a one province <lb/>
man or a two province man, or an an<lb break="no"/>nexationist, to sink these minor dif<lb break="no"/>ferences and unanimously concur in a re<lb break="no"/>solution which states our greatest need <lb/>
and formulates our common aspirations. <lb/>
We must all regret that, the Dominion <lb/>
Government has ignored our claim and <lb/>
shut its eyes to the crying need of this <lb/>
country and upon most superficial <lb/>
grounds. I do not propose to go any <lb/>
further but simply repeat what I have <lb/>
said so often. We stand face to face <lb/>
with the greatest problem which con<lb break="no"/>fronts this House in its general aspect, <lb/>
If we differ in detail here and in the <lb/>
country and constituencies, we should <lb/>
at least in pressing this point upon the <lb/>
Dominion Government present a unit<lb break="no"/>ed front on these broad principles. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Haultain resumed his seat amid <lb/>
cheers, having spoken for half an hour. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">DR. T. A. PATRICK.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> on rising to reply was <lb/>
given a good reception by the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion members. He said: Mr. Speaker, <lb/>
I quite agree with the hon. the prime <lb/>
minister that the question we have to <lb/>
deal with today is an exceedingly <lb/>
important, one, because not withstand<lb break="no"/>ing his endeavor to lead us aside from <lb/>
the question, the real question we have <lb/>
to deal with to-day is whether the pro<lb break="no"/>position made to Ottawa, and the <lb/>
circumstances under which it was made <lb/>
were justified by a mandate from the <lb/>
people of this country. Shall we agree <lb/>
in censuring the Minister of the Interior <lb/>
and the Government of Canada in re<lb break="no"/>fusing a particular piece of legisla<lb break="no"/>tion drafted for them by this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment? That is the question. The <lb/>
reply of the Minister of, the Interior <lb/>
raises the question whether these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen had a mandate to make the <lb/>
proposition they made because he says <lb/>
a divergence of opinion exists. <lb/></p> 

<p>I have admired the skill with which <lb/>
the hon. gentleman endeavors to crawl <lb/>
out of the one province idea. He is <lb/>
afraid of the convictions of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House on that question. <lb/>
(Laughter.) He endeavors to get both <lb/>
those who believe in one province and <lb/>
in two provinces to vote for a resolu<lb break="no"/>
 
 <cb/>

tion censuring the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for not granting provincial <lb/>
autonomy on the basis of one province. <lb/>
His distinct request to the Government, <lb/>
at Ottawa was not that legislation <lb/>
establishing provincial institutions <lb/>
should be introduced, but legislation <lb/>
providing for the establishment <lb/>
of one province. Therefore <lb/>
we are quite right in discussing the <lb/>
motion to go further and discuss the <lb/>
demands made and the circumstances <lb/>
under which they were made before <lb/>
we can decide that they were right and <lb/>
justified in refusing at this particular <lb/>
season and time to introduce legisla<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">MR. HAULTAIN</persName>'S YORKTON SPEECH.</p> 

<p>Had they any right to believe that <lb/>
this Government had a mandate to <lb/>
demand one province to be established <lb/>
400,000 square miles in extent, then I <lb/>
would regret, but the Government of <lb/>
Canada had no right to believe that <lb/>
the Government had a mandate. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman has referred to kaleid<lb break="no"/>oscopic views, may I retort in kind. <lb/>
May I direct the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
attention to the fact that in a speech <lb/>
delivered at Yorkton in 1900 he made <lb/>
the statement that he was in favor of <lb/>
incorporating every acre from the <lb/>
international boundary to the North <lb/>
Pole (Laughter), and that is consider<lb break="no"/>ably in excess of 400,000 square miles. <lb/>
He said further in discussing the mat<lb break="no"/>ter at that time that as yet they had <lb/>
no mandate from the people, but that <lb/>
it was the the duty of the legislature <lb/>
to educate the people on this question <lb/>
of entering confederation, and in res<lb break="no"/>ponse to a question he said he would <lb/>
take in every acre and oppose annexa<lb break="no"/>tion, and said further that "at the next <lb/>
meeting of the legislature the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Government would be de<lb break="no"/>voted to bringing these questions before <lb/>
the people. The Government had no <lb/>
mandate from the people to plunge <lb/>
them into a province. It was the <lb/>
Government's duty, to consider and <lb/>
discuss interests which affected the <lb/>
Territories, but now it was a duty to <lb/>
investigate and advise upon terms of <lb/>
confederation and then say, 'will you <lb/>
send us to power to work for these <lb/>
terms.'" <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">HAD NO MANDATE.</p> 

<p>As to that speech made in <lb/>
Yorkton, in my hearing (and <lb/>
in the hearing of every member of this <lb/>
House then present) he admitted the <lb/>
correctness of it, The effect of that <lb/>
speech on the people of the country <lb/>
was this, that he had come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that provincial autonomy was <lb/>
necessary and he was going to the <lb/>
people for a mandate. A man after <lb/>
hearing that speech moved from York<lb break="no"/>ton to Saltcoats for the purpose of con<lb break="no"/>testing that constituency. (Laughter.) <lb/>
But there we have out of the hon. <lb/>
gentleman's own mouth the fact that <lb/>
he had no mandate to discuss the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of provincial autonomy. He had <lb/>
a mandate to educate the people upon <lb/>
it, and that was his attitude, according <lb/>
to his own words, "will you send us <lb/>
back to power on those terms," yet in <lb/>
the face of that he, who had no man<lb break="no"/>date, who expressed himself so decisive<lb break="no"/>ly and changed his mind on it, he who <lb/>
believed every acre from the interna<lb break="no"/>tional boundary to the Pole should be <lb/>
included, he who went further and <lb/>
was going to the foot of the throne to <lb/>
prevent the Yukon being taken away <lb/>
was now willing that only 404,000 <lb/>
square miles should be taken in as one <lb/>
province. His intention was that his <lb/>
own particular view should be incor<lb break="no"/>porated in legislation drafted by him<lb break="no"/>self and foisted upon the people of this <lb/>
country. Notwithstanding he had no <lb/>
mandate, and both at Yorkton and in <lb/>
this House he admitted he had no man<lb break="no"/>date, he demanded autonomy and in a <lb/>
breach of faith with the people of this <lb/>
country he attempts to foist upon them <lb/>
institutions they never asked for, <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">TOLD TO GET A MANDATE.</p> 

<p>That is the reason I cannot regret to­<lb break="yes"/>day that the Minister of the Interior <lb/>
has refused to take action. The Minis<lb break="no"/>ter would have been a traitor to the <lb/>
country had he done so. He knew <lb/>
that the hon. gentleman had no man<lb break="no"/>date, no authority, and was acting <lb/>
without authority or instructions, and <lb/>
for that reason he sends him back and <lb/>
refuses to consider his proposition, and <lb/>
practically tells him to "go way back." <lb/>
and get a mandate from the people of <lb/>
this country, and that is the reason he <lb/>
will have to ask for a mandate from <lb/>
the people, that he had endeavored to <lb/>
force these institutions upon the <lb/>
people. <lb/></p> 

<p>I admit very freely the right of the <lb/>
Dominion to carve the country into <lb/>
one, two or three provinces. These <lb/>
rights are very fairly set out. But <lb/>
there are rights theoretical and prac<lb break="no"/>tical. There are rights the exercise of <lb/>
which are highly inexpedient and un<lb break="no"/>desirable, and though the Dominion <lb/>
Government has the right to pass legis<lb break="no"/>lation legally making a province or <lb/>
provinces in this country, they will <lb/>
not do so without having the opinion <lb/>
of the people of this country. If it <lb/>
were otherwise what would be the use <lb/>
of discussion? If it were otherwise <lb/>
why express any regret: For these <lb/>
reasons we are justified in going into <lb/>
the terms which the hon. gentleman <lb/>
proposed in his draft bill and in asking <lb/>
if the terms are such as will justify the <lb/>
members of this House in regretting <lb/>
that action was not taken. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">AGREES WITH THE TERMS.</p> 

<p>With respect to certain of the terms <lb/>
sought by them in the draft bill, some <lb/>
of them meet with my unqualified <lb/>
approval and some my disapproval. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman's claim, on behalf <lb/>

<p>believe we have a right to ask for the <lb/>
absolute control of the school lands. <lb/>
We have a right to ask for them as a <lb/>
trust. They have been set apart for a <lb/>
sacred purpose I helieve the owner<lb break="no"/>ship of them should be vested in the <lb/>
province and also the administration <lb/>
of them as a trust. I may say also that <lb/>
I am quite in accord with the hon. <lb/>
gentleman in respect to compensation <lb/>
for lands alienated for federal purposes. <lb/>
That is a complement to the other <lb/>
proposition, that we should have the <lb/>
crown lands. Also with respect to <lb/>
compensation for the impairment of <lb/>
the right tax we are agreed. As to <lb/>
the matter in respect of irrigation, I <lb/>
have no fault to find, nor in asking <lb/>
that the powers possessed by the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories with reference to the prohibi<lb break="no"/>tion of the liquor traffic should be <lb/>
continued in the provinces which may <lb/>
be formed. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">VALUE OF WILD LANDS.</p> 

<p>But, sir, this man who was not going <lb/>
to yield a claim to a stick, straw or <lb/>
stone is willing now to yield up the <lb/>
greater part of the territory of Atha<lb break="no"/>basca. Why should our provincial <lb/>
area not extend as far north at least as <lb/>
British Columbia. If that province <lb/>
has a right sofar north we have surely <lb/>
a right. That north country is a mar<lb break="no"/>ket to a certain extent for the people <lb/>
living on the frontier of the country. <lb/>
It is now a market to the Edmonton <lb/>
country. A commissioner of this Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment went through to Athabasca <lb/>
to report on that country and his <lb/>
going was justified on the ground that <lb/>
it was under our legislative jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion. From a provincial point of view <lb/>
those parts of the country which are <lb/>
likely to be sparsely inhabited are <lb/>
often the most productive of revenue. <lb/>
In the provinces of Ontario and Quebec <lb/>
that revenue is realized but from <lb/>
the wild lands, timber royalties, etc., <lb/>
and from a provincial point of view we <lb/>
should have as much of that wild land <lb/>
as we can get. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">LARGE VS. SMALL PROVINCES.</p> 

<p>Now we come to another important <lb/>
question, the question of a large pro<lb break="no"/>vince, the question whether 404,000 <lb/>
square miles is to large for one pro<lb break="no"/>vince, or whether 279,000 or 239,000 <lb/>
square miles is not large enough. The <lb/>
area comprised within the provisional <lb/>
districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan and, Athabasca is ap<lb break="no"/>proximately 550,000 square miles in <lb/>
extent. I will make a few com<lb break="no"/>parisons of that with other local <lb/>
governments, and we will find <lb/>
that the area of the Territories is quite <lb/>
large enough to divide into two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces which would have approximat<lb break="no"/>ely 275,000 square miles. The largest <lb/>
state in the United States is 262,000 <lb/>

<cb/>

square miles, while the average State <lb/>
is about 54,000 square miles; Ontario <lb/>
has 220,000 square miles. The area of <lb/>
each of the two provinces would be <lb/>
four times as large as the New Eng<lb break="no"/>land States, five times as large as New <lb/>
Brunswick and Nova Scotia together, <lb/>
and, having regard to their size, each <lb/>
would be quite large enough to enjoy <lb/>
any advantages thought to belong <lb/>
to large areas. <lb/></p> 

<p>I requested the hon. gentleman the <lb/>
other day to establish this proposi<lb break="no"/>tion, which underlies his claim for one <lb/>
province, that a large province could <lb/>
be more cheaply administered than a <lb/>
small one. The hon. gentleman has <lb/>
not done that. <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> — Does the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man want me to establish the proposi<lb break="no"/>tion that it costs more to run a large <lb/>
province than a small one? <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> — Relatively. <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> — To what? <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> — Cost per head. Take <lb/>
New Brunswick and Ontario. <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> — Are conditions the <lb/>
same? <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> — Not exactly. They are <lb/>
both administered by a local govern<lb break="no"/>ment but in one case the province has <lb/>
supplied what the other province has <lb/>
not supplied. If you add the cost of <lb/>
local government you have got to add <lb/>
the cost of district government. the <lb/>
province of Prince Edward Island does <lb/>
practically the whole of the municipal <lb/>
work in that province. Nova Scotia <lb/>
and New Brunswick do a very con<lb break="no"/>siderable amount of work that in On<lb break="no"/>tario and Quebec devolves on the <lb/>
municipalities. The system of district <lb/>
government is very much cheaper <lb/>
than the system in Ontario and Quebec. <lb/>
The township councils of Ontario alone <lb/>
cost more than seven times as much <lb/>
as the government and legislature of <lb/>
New Brunswick each year. They have <lb/>
had to create township councils in On<lb break="no"/>tario because they are a large province, <lb/>
and three institutions were found <lb/>
necessary because of the enormous <lb/>
amount of work to be dealt with. <lb/>
These institutions alone cost seven <lb/>
times as much as the New Brunswick <lb/>
government and legislature and they <lb/>
do not serve seven times as many people <lb/>
nor seven times the area. If you take <lb/>
the cost of civil government in this <lb/>
province, or any province, you will <lb/>
find that it may fairly be divided into <lb/>
   two kinds,—the actual work and the <lb/>
supervision of the work. The amount <lb/>
expended for supervision differs in <lb/>
different provinces. Nova Scotia has <lb/>
an attorney-general and he has no <lb/>
deputy, though his department is <lb/>
charged with the administration of <lb/>
criminal justice. Ontario has an at<lb break="no"/>torney-general who also has a deputy. <lb/>
His department has several other <lb/>
branches over which other offices pre<lb break="no"/>side. <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> — Does that not merely <lb/>
prove to your mind that the province <lb/>
of Nova Scotia is better administered <lb/>
than is Ontario? <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> — Not altogether. In <lb/>
Nova Scotia 5 7-10 cents per head per <lb/>
year; 7 1-2 cents in Ontario and 13 <lb/>
cents in Quebec is the cost of <lb/>
legislation and executive supervi<lb break="no"/>sion. Where there are large <lb/>
areas there is a large amount of <lb/>
expenditure and where there is a large <lb/>
amount of expenditure there is a large <lb/>
amount of supervision. The larger the <lb/>
provincial areas are, the more extrava<lb break="no"/>gantly they are administered because <lb/>
the people are not able to maintain <lb/>
that close supervision over them which <lb/>
is essential to economical administra<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> - Is extravagance inev<lb break="no"/>itable? <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> — Yes, by my observation <lb/>
of it under the present government in <lb/>
the Territories it is inevitable. <lb/>
(Laughter.) I will make a comparion <lb/>
between Nova Scotia and the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. The Attorney-<lb break="yes"/>General of Nova Scotia is Hon. J. <lb/>
W. Longley, with 550,000 people in the <lb/>
province. His department is entrusted <lb/>
with the administration of criminal <lb/>
justice and he has a reputation quite as <lb/>
large, broad and extensive as the <lb/>
Attorney-General of these Territories, <lb/>
yet he manages without a deputy, and <lb/>
also without a private secretary. So <lb/>
it would appear that if extravagance is <lb/>
not inevitable it is at least fairly <lb/>
certain. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WHY NOT INCLUDE ALL CANADA?</p> 

<p>Out of these Territories we can make <lb/>
two provinces each as large as Ontario <lb/>
and quite large enough for all local <lb/>
purposes. They can borrow money <lb/>
just as cheaply. I believe from the <lb/>
point of view of the Dominion, and <lb/>
that is the point of view from which <lb/>
the matter must be dealt with, <lb/>
it is a desirable thing that the <lb/>
provinces should be of an ap<lb break="no"/>proximately equal area. I am <lb/>
hot taken with the idea of one grand <lb/>
predominating and overshadowing <lb/>
province. It is contrary to the spirit <lb/>
of our federal constitution. If I could <lb/>
put on the hon. gentleman's politic<lb break="no"/>al spectacles and look over these <lb/>
Territories and say I do not see <lb/>
where one system of govern<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

ment, should begin and another <lb/>
should end, then I might also say I do <lb/>
not see why one system should begin <lb/>
at range 30 and another end at range <lb/>
29 west of the first meridian; I do not <lb/>
see why we should have two govern<lb break="no"/>ments to govern Manitoba and the <lb/>
Territories. Why not annex Manitoba <lb/>
and make the whole thing into one? <lb/>
Why not go further? Why stop at <lb/>
English River? Why not take in the <lb/>
whole of Ontario and the whole of the <lb/>
Dominion as one province? It would <lb/>
save duplication of machinery accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the hon, gentleman. <lb/></p>

<p rendition="simple:centre">CURSE OF SECTIONALISM.</p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> —I only desire to show <lb/>
that the hon, gentleman is not guided <lb/>
by the spirit of confederation.I be<lb break="no"/>lieve the federal system is the best <lb/>
system, yet devised. I believe in the <lb/>
principle of local government for <lb/>
localities, and in general government <lb/>
for the whole. The Dominion of Cana<lb break="no"/>da has pronounced on the question of a <lb/>
legislative union. That has been set<lb break="no"/>tled for all time. The question is not <lb/>
shall there be a legislative union. The <lb/>
question is shall we be true to the fed<lb break="no"/>eral principle upon which our govern<lb break="no"/>ment is founded. A large province is <lb/>
contrary to that principle. The trouble <lb/>
is that when provinces are too large <lb/>
there is too much sectionalism. We <lb/>
already have too much Quebecism and <lb/>
too much Ontarioism, to much one­<lb break="yes"/>provinceism. Sectionalism is the curse <lb/>
of Canada. What we want in Canada <lb/>
is less sectionalism and more Canadian<lb break="no"/>ism . Let us be true to the federal <lb/>
principle. It may be objected that the <lb/>
federal areas of Australia are larger <lb/>
but is that a case in point? Why do <lb/>
we hear murmurs that the Common<lb break="no"/>wealth is not any too strong? The <lb/>
fact is that the weakness of the units <lb/>
of a confederation are the measure of <lb/>
its strength. Switzerland, the mother <lb/>
of confederations, was founded because <lb/>

The same, was true of the early his<lb break="no"/>tory of the United States. It was <lb/>
founded because its states were too <lb/>
weak to stand alone. Wherever pos<lb break="no"/>sible these units should be of approxi<lb break="no"/>mately equal area. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">CAUSE OF MANITOBA's DEMAND.</p> 

<p>This claim for one predominating <lb/>
province has had a certain result. In <lb/>
Manitoba men who disagree on almost <lb/>
every subject are agreeing and agree<lb break="no"/>ing unanimously in imaking a demand <lb/>
that a part of this country should be <lb/>
annexed to Manitoba and the one pro<lb break="no"/>vince agitation is the reason for it. It <lb/>
was the hon. gentleman's claim for <lb/>
one grand, overshadowing, predomin<lb break="no"/>ating province that first moved the <lb/>
people of Manitoba to this action. <lb/>
They have no desire to be overshadow<lb break="no"/>ed and to have a predominating pro<lb break="no"/>vince next to them would have that <lb/>
effect and that is the reason for their <lb/>
demand. He who clamors for one pro<lb break="no"/>vince, is putting arguments into the <lb/>
mouths of the people of Manitoba. <lb/>
Are we weaker than Manitoba in that <lb/>
parliament which must deal with that <lb/>
matter? If we recognise the fact that <lb/>
it must be dealt with from a national <lb/>
point of view, and parliament would <lb/>
not do otherwise, then the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of Manitoba will have a voice in <lb/>
the matter. Have we a representa<lb break="no"/>tive in the cabinet or they? Is our re<lb break="no"/>presentation, larger or smaller than <lb/>
theirs? Is their position and influence <lb/>
weaker? If not have we any right to <lb/>
place in their mouths arguments in <lb/>
favor of that annexation? This gives <lb/>
the Dominion Government, the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of saying: "We will make one <lb/>
province and annex the reminder to <lb/>
Manitoba." I say that I firmly believe <lb/>
that the only alternative is two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces or annexation. <lb/> </p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:SIFT2">HON. MR. SIFTON</persName>'SOPINION.</p> 

<p>The hon. gentleman has conferred <lb/>
with the Government at Ottawa. <lb/>
Now I feel justified in referring <lb/>
to what he said to the member <lb/>
for Saltcoats privately , in 1898. <lb/>
He told us that it was his opinion, <lb/>
that it was Mr. Clifford Sifton's opin<lb break="no"/>ion, that annexation to Manitoba was <lb/>
the proper thing to be done. I did not <lb/>
intend to refer to this, but the hon. <lb/>
gentleman, has transgressed the rules <lb/>
of this House, and the canons of good <lb/>
taste in referring to a private conver<lb break="no"/>sation of the hon. member for Prince Al<lb break="no"/>bert East, and I say that the hon. <lb/>
gentleman did say to us privately that <lb/>
he knew that was the opinion enter<lb break="no"/>tained by the Minister of the Interior. <lb/>
My suggestion to him at the time was <lb/>
that he should take a stand to prevent <lb/>
it. Two provinces would do it. The <lb/>
idea of a predominating province would <lb/>
if pressed give us an antagonistic <lb/>
Manitoba, while two provinces <lb/>
would conciliate that province and we <lb/>
could co-operate, with Manitoba in <lb/>
matters where we have a common in<lb break="no"/>terest. The transportation question is <lb/>
one of these. One large province may <lb/>
do much to solve this problem but two <lb/>
or three co-operating can do more. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">TRIED TO GET TOO MUCH.</p> 

<p>The reply of the Minister, of the <lb/>
Interior is an indication that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada is not in a hurry to <lb/>
consider provincial autonomy. In 1900 <lb/>
the hon. gentleman said he did not <lb/>
expect to get all he asked. He believed <lb/>
he would not get all. His action was <lb/>
like that of the boy and the jug of nuts. <lb/>
The boy put his hand in the jug and <lb/>
grabbed a handful and them discovered <lb/>
he could not get his hand out, but by <lb/>
taking the nuts out one at a time he <lb/>
secured them. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
attempted to grab too much at once; <lb/>
My opinion in respect of this provincial <lb/>
autonomy question is to practice the <lb/>
line followed by the boy. There are <lb/>
certain things we can get if we ask for <lb/>
them, and there are certain things we <lb/>
cannot get until we have force. We <lb/>
should not go asking for everything; <lb/>
we should not go making an absurd <lb/>
proposition, (cries of no, no,) and to <lb/>
enter into secret deals and negotiations, <lb/>
and should not attempt or profess to <lb/>
do what we have no power to do. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PROPER ATTITUDE TO TAKE.</p> 

<p>I believe that the proper course to <lb/>

<cb/>

take is a public course in which the <lb/>
propositions shall be made in the light <lb/>
of day. I believe that in the next leg<lb break="no"/>islature a bill of rights should be <lb/>
prepared claiming everything to which <lb/>
we are entitled. There is little dis<lb break="no"/>agreement in that respect. And then <lb/>
we should say to the Dominion author<lb break="no"/>ities we recognise that we are not in a <lb/>
position to make a contract. We are <lb/>
creatures, you the creator. You are <lb/>
the strong one: you can wipe us <lb/>
out. We have no power to <lb/>
make a bargain, no power <lb/>
to make a contract. Naturally after <lb/>
we are created a province then we will <lb/>
be in a position to make bargains and <lb/>
get our rights and cannot be starved <lb/>
into submission, and it is no new <lb/>
thing for a province to approach the <lb/>
Government of Canada for better <lb/>
terms. Manitoba did it twice. It <lb/>
made two bargains with the Dominion <lb/>
but in the last one unfortunately for <lb/>
itself admitted it to be a final one. The <lb/>
Quebec conference is a case in point, <lb/>
and the matter of the new terms <lb/>
recently granted to Prince Edward <lb/>
Island is another case in point. It is <lb/>
folly to talk of doing things that you <lb/>
have no power to do. I ask the hon. <lb/>
gentleman what right have we to make <lb/>
a bargain? We have a right to make <lb/>
our demand, but is not our proper <lb/>
attitude to adopt the high and mighty <lb/>
methods of the hon. gentleman. It is <lb/>
not to go down on a false pretense; <lb/>
not to go down on a pretense that we <lb/>
have power to do certain things we <lb/>
have no power to do. We should act <lb/>
through our representatives at Ottawa. <lb/>
We should incorporate our views in a <lb/>
bill of rights and ask for the help of <lb/>
our representatives at Ottawa. We <lb/>
should press upon them our rights and <lb/>
what the people want. But to express <lb/>
regret because the propositions that <lb/>
were made under the false pretense <lb/>
that we had the right to negotiate <lb/>
when we had not; to regret that the <lb/>
result of this autocratic mission with<lb break="no"/>out a mandate, this misrespresentation, <lb/>
this hole in the corner business, is to <lb/>
place ourselves in a false position. To <lb/>
say to the Dominion Government you <lb/>
are to obey the behests of this man who <lb/>
because he has a fine gift of sarcasm: <lb/>
this man whom the Creator has endow<lb break="no"/>ed with a most extraordinary ability <lb/>
(hear, hear,) and offset it with a most <lb/>
extraordinary indolence (Opposition <lb/>
cheers), to say you must do as he says: <lb/>
to regret that he did not get what he <lb/>
had no authority to ask for; to regret <lb/>
that the Government did not do what <lb/>
he had no right to ask them to do, <lb/>
because he was told to "go 'way back <lb/>
and sit down," and ask the people of <lb/>
the Territories, for a mandate, to go <lb/>
and find out if they wanted one pro<lb break="no"/>vince or two, and that is practically <lb/>
what it amounts to do, is, I say, to <lb/>
place ourselves in a false position. <lb/>
Because he went down on false <lb/>
pretences we are asked to regret that <lb/>
the mission failed. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">DOES NOT REGRET DOMINION'SACTION.</p> 

<p>Personally I do not regret; I rejoice <lb/>
that it failed. I would regret to go <lb/>
back to my constituents and say, I am <lb/>
so under the thumb of Mr. Haultain, I <lb/>
am so scared of election patronage, I <lb/>
am so frightened of his power to re<lb break="no"/>distribute the constituency, send me <lb/>
back as an approver of this dictator. <lb/>
I would be a traitor to the trust re<lb break="no"/>posed in me. I feel that I would be <lb/>
misrepresenting the opinions of a very <lb/>
large number of the people of this <lb/>
country. They believe that any action <lb/>
should be taken through their repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives in Parliament. Had this <lb/>
been done than I might have regretted. <lb/>
I regret the delay in provinciol autono<lb break="no"/>my. I regret that when the hon. <lb/>
gentleman came to the conclusion that <lb/>
autonomy was the only solution of our <lb/>
difficulties that he did not formulate <lb/>
some bill of rights and then go back <lb/>
to the people as he said he would. I <lb/>
regret that he did not do what he <lb/>
should have done. Some believe in <lb/>
provincial autonomy yet do not agree <lb/>
with the hon. gentleman. I believe <lb/>
the Government should act as if they <lb/>
realised that they are the servants <lb/>
and not the masters of the people of <lb/>
this country. I believe in acting under <lb/>
the representative system of govern<lb break="no"/>ment under which we live and I be<lb break="no"/>lieve in provincial autonomy. There <lb/>
is room for differences of opinion and <lb/>
there are differences of opinion and it <lb/>
rests with the people of this country <lb/>
to say through the next legislature <lb/>
when they have put up candidates in <lb/>
each constituency that they declare <lb/>
for one province or two as the case <lb/>
may be. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">NEGOTIATIONS WERE SECRET.</p> 

<p>These negotiations were secret and <lb/>
kept out of the public press. There is <lb/>
always some reason for suspicion when <lb/>
secretthings are done and a govern<lb break="no"/>ment is afraid of publicity for its acts. <lb/>
I can understand that people might ex<lb break="no"/>pect that the asking for one province <lb/>
would result in annexation to Mianitoba <lb/>
and if the annexation should follow <lb/>
and people were forced into Manitoba <lb/>
against their will as a result of the <lb/>
hon. gentleman's negotiations in se<lb break="no"/>cret, when election time came the <lb/>
people could not punish him for this <lb/>
result of his conduct. <lb/></p> 

<p>I hope an opportunity will be given <lb/>
to the people to express an opinion on <lb/>
these questions. This is a busy coun<lb break="no"/>try and this is an especially busy year <lb/>
and season and these are days of rapid <lb/>
development and, extraordinary pro<lb break="no"/>gress. I hope the busy season will be <lb/>
allowed to elapse before the opinions <lb/>
of the people are asked. Nothing can <lb/>
be done until the next session of the <lb/>
Dominion Parliament and it would be <lb/>
a good time in October or November <lb/>
to take the will of the people of this <lb/>
country. I hope that the people hav<lb break="no"/>ing been kept in the dark will be given <lb/>
time to make up their minds as to <lb/>
one province or two. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">FINANCIAL BENEFITS OF TWO <lb/>
PROVINCES.</p> 

<p>This reminds me of a fact I have <lb/>
overlooked. If we have two provinces <lb/>
we have a right to $50,000 for an extra <lb/>
legislature. The Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment over and above any subsidy gives <lb/>
$50,000 for the support of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and legislature of a province. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman asked for $50,000 <lb/>
for his province. That is what Mani<lb break="no"/>toba gets. If he had asked for two <lb/>
provinces he could have asked for <lb/>
$50,000 for each of them. As each <lb/>
would have as large an area as Ontario <lb/>
it would have been entitled to as large <lb/>
an amount as Ontario gets, which is <lb/>
$80,000. This was sacrificed to the hon. <lb/>

<cb/>

gentleman's ambition of being prime <lb/>
minister of a vaster province than has <lb/>
been. (Hear, hear.) I admit we have <lb/>
to pay our share of that. But $50,000 <lb/>
among over 5,000,000 people in <lb/>
 Canada is less than a cent per <lb/>
head, and one of the results <lb/>
of the hon. gentleman's plan, is that <lb/>
rather than place a burden of less than <lb/>
one cent per year on each person, he <lb/>
would rather have the predominating <lb/>
province asked for and lose the $50,000. <lb/></p> 

<p>Again in the draft bill submitted by <lb/>
the hon. gentleman it is proposed that <lb/>
the per capita grant be on the same <lb/>
population as Ontario, 1,369,000. Had <lb/>
he asked for two provinces, each larger <lb/>
than Ontario, he would have had a per<lb break="no"/>fect right to ask that we should have <lb/>
that grant of 80 cents per head on <lb/>
twice that number of people, and his <lb/>
action in asking for one province <lb/>
means that the people of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies will ultimately lose $1,116,000 per <lb/>
year. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">SHOULD WORK FOR COMMON INTERESTS</p> 

<p>I have heard some statements from <lb/>
men in the west that if they lived in <lb/>
the east they would for two provinces <lb/>
but that annexation did not affect <lb/>
them. That is not the view that should <lb/>
be taken. All should have the view of <lb/>
having our rights and all should work <lb/>
together for our common interests. <lb/></p> 

<p>I have also heard the insinuation <lb/>
made that those advocating two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces want possession of office. I <lb/>
believe after the next election the <lb/>
Opposition will occupy the treasury <lb/>
benches, but it is because we believe <lb/>
that two provinces is the proper and <lb/>
only solution of this question that we <lb/>
are advocating two provinces. We <lb/>
must win the treasury benches of the <lb/>
Territories first. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE POSITIONS CONTRASTED.</p> 

<p>I have proved the breach of faith on <lb/>
the part of the prime minister of this <lb/>
country with the people out of his own <lb/>
mouth, by his own words, and I wish <lb/>
to say in conclusion that on the one <lb/>
hand we have one province, on the <lb/>
other hand two provinces; on the one <lb/>
hand annexation as the inevitable re<lb break="no"/>sult, on the other hand a policy of <lb/>
political identity; on the one hand an <lb/>
antagonised province of Manitoba, on <lb/>
the other hand a conciliated province <lb/>
of Manitoba: on the one hand the <lb/>
federal principle violated, on the other <lb/>
had the federal principle maintained: <lb/>
on the one hand a dual municipal <lb/>
system as a necessary result of the <lb/>
large province: on the other hand <lb/>
cheap district government; on the one <lb/>
hand extravagance, which results from <lb/>
ineffective supervision of the affairs of <lb/>
the country and lack of close inspec<lb break="no"/>tion of expenditures, on the other hand <lb/>
economy as a result of that closes super<lb break="no"/>vision; on the one hand one great <lb/>
province reaching the seaboard on <lb/>
neither side with a lone hand in trans<lb break="no"/>portation, on the other hand co-opera<lb break="no"/>tion in transportation between two or <lb/>
three provinces: on the one hand fu<lb break="no"/>tile, negotiations with junketing trips <lb/>
back and forth to Ottawa, on the other <lb/>
hand effective demands through our <lb/>
representatives in parliament; on the <lb/>
one hand secrecy, on the other hand <lb/>
publicity: one the one hand a breach <lb/>
of faith with the people and a false <lb/>
pretense of the right to negotiate. on <lb/>
the other hand a mandate from the <lb/>
people and everything free and open <lb/>
and an admission that we have no <lb/>
power to make a bargain: on the one <lb/>
hand, a dangerous course, on the other <lb/>
hand a safe course; on the one <lb/>
hand the sacrifice of a portion of <lb/>
Athabasca, on the other hand <lb/>
no sacrifice but the retaining of <lb/>
the whole of Athabasca; on the one <lb/>
hand unreasonable demands made on <lb/>
the people of Canada, on the other <lb/>
hand reasonable demands on federal <lb/>
principles. <lb/></p> 

<p>The people have been given no <lb/>
chance to consider this question and <lb/>
they should be given every chance to <lb/>
consider all the points that they will <lb/>
have to vote on that they may cast an <lb/>
intelligent vote. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE AMENDMENT.</p> 

<p>Under these circumstances I feel <lb/>
constrained to say that I do not regret <lb/>
the action taken by the Minister of the <lb/>
Interior and the Government of Cana<lb break="no"/>da. The result of that action will be <lb/>
to force the hon. gentleman to go to <lb/>
his constituency and get a mandate. I, <lb/>
therefore, Mr. Speaker move, seconded <lb/>
by Mr. Bennett, that all words af<lb break="no"/>ter the word "population" where it <lb/>
first occurs in the motion be struck out <lb/>
and that the following be substituted <lb/>
 therefor:—<lb/> </p> 

<p>"While maintaining that the claims <lb/>
of these Territories against the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion will never be settled and satisfied <lb/>
until provinces have been established, <lb/>
on a plan of equality with the provinc<lb break="no"/>es of Ontario and Quebec in respect of <lb/>
ordinary provincial powers, including <lb/>
ownership of all Crown lands, mines, <lb/>
minerals, timber and royalties, except <lb/>
such lands as have been reserved for <lb/>
the use of Indians, or reserved for and <lb/>
earned by any person or corporation or <lb/>
entered for as homesteads or pre-emp<lb break="no"/>tions and not granted, or reserved to <lb/>
provide a fund in aid of schools: and <lb/></p> 

<p>Until such provinces have been vest<lb break="no"/>ed with the ownership in trust, of all <lb/>
school lands and revenues therefrom; <lb/>
and <lb/></p> 

<p>Until such provinces have been com<lb break="no"/>pensated for such lands as have been <lb/>
alienated otherwise than as free grants <lb/>
to settlers or in settlement of Half-<lb break="yes"/>Breed claims; and <lb/></p> 

<p>Until in addition to the ordinary per <lb/>
capita grant, such allowances shall <lb/>
have been granted them for the sup<lb break="no"/>port, of their respective governments <lb/>
and legislatures, and for "Debt Capit<lb break="no"/>al" as are fair and just: and <lb/></p> 

<p>While believing that it is expedient <lb/>
and necessary that the exclusive power <lb/>
to make laws in relation to Irrigation <lb/>
should be granted to each such pro<lb break="no"/>vince: and that, such provinces will <lb/>
desire for their legislatures a continu<lb break="no"/>ance of such power to legislate in <lb/>
relation to prohibition of intoxicants as <lb/>
is now possessed by the Legislature <lb/>
of the Territories: <lb/></p> 

<p>Nevertheless this House also believes <lb/>
That the people of these Territories <lb/>
have never given to this Government <lb/>
and Legislature any instruction, dir<lb break="no"/>ection or authority to ask for the es<lb break="no"/>tablishment of the area hetween the <lb/>
western boundary of Manitoba, and <lb/>
British Columbia, and between the in<lb break="no"/>ternational boundary and the 57th <lb/>
parallel of north latitude as one pro<lb break="no"/>vince: and that in unanimously pass<lb break="no"/>ing in its session of 1900, a resolution <lb/>
praying His Excellency, the Governor <lb/>
General "to cause enquiries to be made <lb/>
and accounts taken with a view to the <lb/>
settlement of the terms upon which <lb/>
the Territories, or any part thereof <lb/>
shall be established as a province" <lb/>
this House did so on the distinct under<lb break="no"/>standing and condition that before any <lb/>
such province was established oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity should be given to the people of <lb/>
the Territories to consider and discuss <lb/>
such terms and conditions; and fur<lb break="no"/>ther believes <lb/></p> 

<p>That the people of these Territories <lb/>
have a right to ask that the northern <lb/>
boundaries of the provinces established <lb/>
for their local government should ex<lb break="no"/>tend at least as far north as does the <lb/>
province of British Columbia; that is <lb/>
to say near to the 60th parallel of north <lb/>
latitude; and   <lb/></p> 

<p>That the area comprised within the <lb/>
provisional districts of Assiniboia, Al<lb break="no"/>berta, Saskatchewan and Athabasca is <lb/>
approximately 550,000 square miles in <lb/>
extent and should be divided into two <lb/>
provinces of approximately equal area <lb/>
each of which would be more than 59,<lb break="no"/>000 square miles larger than Ontario; <lb/>
would be more than five times as large <lb/>

<cb/>

as the aggregate area of Nova Scotia <lb/>
and New Brunswick; would be more <lb/>
than twice as large as the aggregate <lb/>
area of the British Isles, more than <lb/>
four times as large as the aggregate <lb/>
area of all the New England States; <lb/>
would be larger than the largest State <lb/>
in the United States; would be large <lb/>
enough to enjoy whatever advantages <lb/>
in the way of economical government <lb/>
large provinces may be thought to <lb/>
possess; would be large enough to <lb/>
borrow at the very lowest rate of <lb/>
interest, whatever sums may be deem<lb break="no"/>ed necessary for their proper develop<lb break="no"/>inent: and quite large enough to <lb/>
satisfy all aspirations and ambitions of <lb/>
their inhabitants consistent with their <lb/>
proper relation to the other provinces <lb/>
and the Dominion, and <lb/></p> 

<p>That all the arguments used by the <lb/>
Territorial Governinent in favor of the <lb/>
establishment in these Territories of <lb/>
"One predominating and overshadow<lb break="no"/>ing province," are really arguments <lb/>
against having any provinces at all <lb/>
and are, in the ultimate analysis, <lb/>
arguments in favor of one government <lb/>
and legislature for the whole Dominion <lb/>
and as such are opposed to the spirit <lb/>
and purpose of our federal constitution <lb/>
and to the principle that the states of a <lb/>
confederation should, where possible, <lb/>
be of approximately equal area; and <lb/></p> 

<p>That the opinions hitherto, from <lb/>
time to time, expressed by members of <lb/>
the Territorial Government, in favor of <lb/>
the establishing of one predominating <lb/>
and overshadowing province has called <lb/>
forth expressions of dissent from pub<lb break="no"/>lic men in other provinces, and has led <lb/>
the legislature of Manitoba to pass <lb/>
unanimously resolutions expressing its <lb/>
consent and wish that the Parliament <lb/>
of Canada extend the boundaries of <lb/>
that province in a westerly and north<lb break="no"/>erly direction in order that the great <lb/>
central plain of Canada may be fairly <lb/>
divided between the enlarged province <lb/>
of Manitoba and the new province: <lb/>
and that the result of this action of the <lb/>
Manitoba legislature is to vest in the <lb/>
Dominion Parliament full power to <lb/>
pass an Act extending the boundaries <lb/>
of that province; and that the said <lb/>
Parliament will necessarily deal with <lb/>
any requests made by the people of <lb/>
the Territories for the establishment of <lb/>
provincial institutions, not, from a <lb/>
local, but from a national point of <lb/>
view and that, before exercising its <lb/>
powers, it will necessarily listen to and <lb/>
consider the objections raised against <lb/>
the establishment of "one predomin<lb break="no"/>ating and overshadowing province," <lb/>
and that in the event of the annexa<lb break="no"/>tion of a portion of these Territories <lb/>
to Manitoba the inhabitants of the area <lb/>
annexed will have no constitutional <lb/>
remedy and no means of holding the <lb/>
Territorial Government responsible <lb/>
thereafter, and <lb/></p> 

<p>That if, on the other hand, at the <lb/>
next election a legislative assembly be <lb/>
returned with instructions to prepare <lb/>
a bill of rights demanding that the <lb/>
ptovisional districts of Assiniboia, Al<lb break="no"/>erta, Saskatchewan and Athabasca <lb/>
be established as two provinces of ap<lb break="no"/>proximately equal area, neither Mani<lb break="no"/>toba nor any other province of Canada <lb/>
will have any reasonable right to ob<lb break="no"/>ject, nor can; it be urged that the es<lb break="no"/>tablishment of two provinces would be <lb/>
inconsistent with the interests of the <lb/>
confederation as a whole; and <lb/></p> 

<p>That the establishment of two such <lb/>
provinces would not, as alleged, result <lb/>
in a complete duplication of the mach<lb break="no"/>inery of local government, but on the <lb/>
contrary, the records of the smaller <lb/>
provinces show , them to be more <lb/>
cheaply governed owing to the closer <lb/>
supervision over provincial expendi<lb break="no"/>ture by the electorate, affording a more <lb/>
effective check on official extravagance <lb/>
than is possible in the larger provin<lb break="no"/>ces: and <lb/></p> 

<p>That two such provinces, each larger <lb/>
than Ontario, should each be entitled <lb/>
at the outset to a grant of eighty cents <lb/>
per head on an estimated popu<lb break="no"/>lation of <lb/></p> 

<p>and thereafter on their actual popu<lb break="no"/>lation until such time as that popula<lb break="no"/>tion reaches the number upon which <lb/>
this grant is paid to Ontario, which <lb/>
would ultimately yield to such provin<lb break="no"/>ces an aggregate maximum grant twice <lb/>
as large that received by Ontario <lb/>
or $1,116,872.80 more per annum than <lb/>
is claimed by the Territorial Govern<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

ment in its draft bill to establish one <lb/>
province; and <lb/></p> 

<p>That, in any case, two provinces <lb/>
would receive from the Dominion over <lb/>
and above every other allowance, sub<lb break="no"/>sidy, and source of income, a special <lb/>
grant of at least $50,000 each per an<lb break="no"/>num for the support of their respective <lb/>
governments and legislatures while all <lb/>
that the Territorial Government has <lb/>
asked, in its proposed bill by way of <lb/>
special grant for the support of the <lb/>
government and legislature of its pro<lb break="no"/>posed one province is $50,000 per an<lb break="no"/>num and that therefore the cost of <lb/>
whatever additional machinery two <lb/>
provinces might be believed to entail, <lb/>
would be borne by the Dominion while <lb/>
the people of these provinces would re<lb break="no"/>ceive the advantage of the more effi<lb break="no"/>cient service that two governments <lb/>
would provide, and the further advan<lb break="no"/>tage of that more effective supervision <lb/>
of provincial expenditures which is <lb/>
ever desirable in the interests of econo<lb break="no"/>my: and would prevent the desire of <lb/>
division which the establishment of <lb/>
province would necessarily entail; <lb/>
and  <lb/></p> 

<p>That, the establishment of two such <lb/>
provinces, would pave the way for <lb/>
united action with Manitoba to secure <lb/>
a fair and equitable settlement of our <lb/>
common claims against the Dominion <lb/>
for "better terms" and for co-opera<lb break="no"/>tion in the great and necessary work <lb/>
of providing facilities for the trans<lb break="no"/>portation of our products to the mark<lb break="no"/>ets of the world; and <lb/></p> 

<p>That with our present small repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in the Parliament of Canada. <lb/>
we may not obtain at the outset, a <lb/>
fair and equitable settlement of all the <lb/>
claims of these Territories against the <lb/>
Dominion, and moreover, owing to the <lb/>
fact that our provincial boundaries are <lb/>
not determined and that the Territor<lb break="no"/>ial government and legislature, is, in <lb/>
the ultimate resort, not only depend<lb break="no"/>ent on the Parliament of Canada for <lb/>
the greater part of their revenue, but <lb/>
also for their very existence, and ow<lb break="no"/>ing to their having no status or capaci<lb break="no"/>ty to make a final bargain with the <lb/>
Dominion, the only practical and ef<lb break="no"/>fective way to secure prompt recogni<lb break="no"/>tion of their rights is with the co-opera<lb break="no"/>tion of the Territorial representatives <lb/>
in the Parliament of Canada, through <lb/>
whom, the action will be given that <lb/>
publicity which has hither to been <lb/>
denied; <lb/></p> 

<p>Therefore be it resolved that this <lb/>
House repudiates the action of the <lb/>
Territorial Government in asking <lb/>
without the sanction of the people, <lb/>
that one province should be established, <lb/>
more especially as there exists "a <lb/>
divergence of opinion respecting the <lb/>
question whether there should be one <lb/>
province only, or more than one pro<lb break="no"/>vince" and declares <lb/></p> 

<p>That it will be the duty of the next <lb/>
legislature to adopt a Bill of Rights <lb/>
demanding on behalf of the people of <lb/>
these Territories that the Parliament <lb/>
of Canada pass Acts establishing in <lb/>
the area comprising Assiniboia, Alber<lb break="no"/>ta, Saskatchewan and Athabasca two <lb/>
provinces approximately equal in size <lb/>
and provided that adequate subsidies <lb/>
be granted them pending the final <lb/>
settlement of all claims in dispute be<lb break="no"/>tween such provinces and the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion; and further declares <lb/></p> 

<p>That it will also be the duty of the <lb/>
said legislature to request the several <lb/>
members of Parliament who represent <lb/>
constituencies in these Territories to <lb/>
use all constitutional means to place on <lb/>
the Government and Parliament of <lb/>
Canada full and undivided responsibili<lb break="no"/>ty for refusing or delaying to grant its <lb/>
demands. <lb/></p>

<head>Speeches Delivered by Dr. Elliott and <lb/>
Messrs. McKay, Gillis, Villeneuve <lb/>
and Smith — Expressions of Regret <lb/>
and Rejoicing Over the Dominion <lb/>
Government's Action — The Ques<lb break="no"/>tion of a Mandate.</head> 

<p>The report of the debate on provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy in the Legislative Assem<lb break="no"/>bly on April 8th, which arose on Mr. <lb/>
Haultain's motion of regret that the <lb/>
Dominion Government had decided <lb/>
not to introduce legislation at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent session of Parliament with a <lb/>
view to granting provincial institu<lb break="no"/>tions to the Territories, is continued <lb/>
below. <lb/>
Dr. Elliott (Wolseley) followed Dr. <lb/>
Patrick. In rising to support the <lb/>
resolution he said he could not but <lb/>
express his surprise at some of the <lb/>
statements made by the hon. member <lb/>
for Yorkton. That hon. gentleman <lb/>
knew full well that this question of <lb/>
provincial autonomy had been discus<lb break="no"/>sed not only in the House but through<lb break="no"/>out the country, and in almost every <lb/>
constituency was brough before the <lb/>
electors. Even in the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
own constituency of Yorkton it was <lb/>
brought prominently before the elect<lb break="no"/>ors, and every member of the House <lb/>
knew that the Government did have a <lb/>
mandate from the people to deal with <lb/>
the question, and if hon. gentlemen <lb/>
opposite had only taken the trouble to <lb/>
feel the pulse of the people they would <lb/>
have found that there is a strong and <lb/>
general desire that the Government <lb/>
should deal with it and at once. If <lb/>
there was one point raised it was be<lb break="no"/>cause the Government had not pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded rapidly enough in their nego<lb break="no"/>tiations with the federal government <lb/>
and had not succeeded in getting <lb/>
provincial institutions before this time. <lb/>
The little annexation feeling <lb/>
which existed had been worked up <lb/>
because the local government had not <lb/>
proceeded more rapidly than they had <lb/>
in getting the desired institutions. <lb/>
The most prominent agitators in that <lb/>
annexation movement had said that it <lb/>
was purely for the purpose of getting <lb/>
provincial institutions. One stroke of <lb/>
the pen would put them into Manitoba <lb/>
and then railways could be built in a <lb/>
very short time. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">A DIVIDED OPPOSITION.</p> 

<p>He, the speaker, would like very <lb/>
much to know where the gentleman of <lb/>
the Opposition stood on this as on <lb/>
other questions. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
from Yorkton had believed in one <lb/>
province and in two provinces. He <lb/>
had stated that we should have pro<lb break="no"/>vincial powers 25 or 26 years hence. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> —I never made any such <lb/>
statement. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ELLI1">Dr. Elliott</persName> —I refer the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man to reports of his speeches in this <lb/>
House in 1899. He can find them in <lb/>
the records if he will look them up and <lb/>
if I have made a false statement I will <lb/>
be pleased to apologise for having done <lb/>
so. Do the hon. gentlemen opposite <lb/>
believe in provincial autonomy and do <lb/>
they want it at the present time or at <lb/>
some indefinite time in the future? <lb/>
They are not riding one valuable horse <lb/>
to death, neither two, but a whole <lb/>
band of bronchos travelling in differ<lb break="no"/>ent directions at the same time. <lb/>
(Laughter.) They are divided in two <lb/>
instead of being united. Had the hon. <lb/>
gentleman from Yorkton forgotten <lb/>
his scheme of three provinces with one <lb/>
legislature governing all three? <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. gentleman believed in two <lb/>
provinces that we might save the <lb/>
whole Dominion of Canada. If the <lb/>
Dominion could be saved by being <lb/>
divided into two provinces; if such an <lb/>
immense benefit would be derived <lb/>
by being two provinces, why <lb/>
not a much greater benefit by <lb/>
being divided into four or <lb/>
into eight. The hon. gentleman said <lb/>
the weakness of the present confedera<lb break="no"/>tion was too much Quebecism and too <lb/>
much Ontarioism and that the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should be approximately of equal <lb/>
size. Then, why should they not be <lb/>

<cb/>

the size of Prince Edward Island? If <lb/>
the small provinces could administer <lb/>
their affairs so successfully, cheaply <lb/>
and satisfactorily was it not a great <lb/>
pity to divide into two instead of 102? <lb/>
But when the hon. gentleman attempt<lb break="no"/>ed to prove that small provinces were <lb/>
administered more economically than <lb/>
large ones he took a few figures and <lb/>
drew deductions from them which could <lb/>
not be drawn if he followed a careful <lb/>
science of reasoning. One would think <lb/>
to hear the hon. gentleman speak that <lb/>
he was the representative of eastern <lb/>
Canada or Manitoba when he said that <lb/>
they would not permit of one province <lb/>
being formed. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">ALL WORKING FOR CANADA'S BENEFIT</p>
  <p>
The Dominion Government had not <lb/>
refused to comply with the demand of <lb/>
the local Government but had simply <lb/>
postponed the matter for the present, <lb/>
giving the flimsy excuse of a divergence <lb/>
of opinions as a reason for their action. <lb/>
If they waited for unanimity they <lb/>
would never get it until the millenn<lb break="no"/>ium. It was said that the Dominion <lb/>
would not allow one great overwhelm<lb break="no"/>ing province. Why should a large <lb/>
province endanger the rest of the <lb/>
Dominion? They were Canadians and <lb/>
quite willing to do their duty as <lb/>
citizens of the country and were not <lb/>
desirous of getting any mean advan<lb break="no"/>tage over the other provinces of Can<lb break="no"/>ada. Throughout Canada the people <lb/>
were Canadians and not Ontarioites, <lb/>
Quebecites, Nova Scotians. They were <lb/>
working for the benefit of Canada as a <lb/>
whole. Of course there were some of <lb/>
the narrow minded individuals who <lb/>
could not see past the township in <lb/>
which they lived. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon, member for Yorkton had <lb/>
told them that if they had one province <lb/>
they would have an antagonised Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, and if two provinces, a satified <lb/>
Manitoba ready to fall in and help <lb/>
both provinces. But then the hon. <lb/>
gentleman proposed to add the whole <lb/>
area of Athabasca and then divide into <lb/>
two parts and form provinces three <lb/>
times as large as Manitoba. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) He did not think that the people <lb/>
of Manitoba who would be so excited <lb/>
over the formation of a province four <lb/>
times their size would be satisfied with <lb/>
two provinces, three times as large as <lb/>
they were. The Assembly was not <lb/>
there to act to suit the people of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, but to work for themselves, and <lb/>
work out their own salvation. Their <lb/>
duty was to propose to the Dominion <lb/>
Parliament what was necessary and <lb/>
then let it take the responsibility of <lb/>
saying what it would do. If the <lb/>
Dominion Government had made a <lb/>
proposition to the local Government <lb/>
that they would give them two provin<lb break="no"/>ces upon the terms asked for one, then <lb/>
the Government would have been call<lb break="no"/>ed upon to consider it, but it would <lb/>
have been foolish to go and say: <lb/></p> 

<p>"Give us one province, but if you are <lb/>
not satisfied to do that, give us two or <lb/>
more." <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">NEGOTIATIONS WERE NOT SECRET.</p> 

<p>He (Elliott) did not think the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada did their duty in <lb/>
sending such a reply after what the <lb/>
House and country had been led to <lb/>
expect by members of that Government. <lb/>
He considered it unwise of the member <lb/>
for Yorkton to speak of the negotia<lb break="no"/>tions having been done in secret. <lb/>
Should the premier have taken all the <lb/>
members with him when he made his <lb/>
demands, or wired to each individual <lb/>
or newspaper in the Territories what <lb/>
he said in the negotiations? The de<lb break="no"/>mands made by the premier were there <lb/>
and were known to every reading man <lb/>
in the Territories before they were <lb/>
laid on the table. They were contain<lb break="no"/>ed in the different speeches made by <lb/>
the premier and in the budget speeches <lb/>
made by the late commissioner of public <lb/>
works, and on several occasions had <lb/>
been stated by the present commission<lb break="no"/>er of public works. It ill became any <lb/>
member to charge the premier with <lb/>
attempting to make secret deals and <lb/>
as being insincere, as the member for <lb/>
Yorkton had done in regard to this <lb/>
matter. Every member of the House <lb/>
knew there was nothing secret about <lb/>
it but that all was open and above <lb/>
board, and that the demands made on <lb/>
behalf of the people of this country <lb/>
were known to the people. The hon. <lb/>
member for Yorkton had spoken <lb/>
of the exorbitant demands made by <lb/>
the premier in his bill to Ottawa. <lb/></p>
  <p>
<persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> —I did not say that. <lb/></p>
  <p>
<persName ref="pers:ELLI1">Dr. Elliott</persName> —I will think of the word <lb/>
later. It was "unjust" I think. <lb/></p> 

<p>Continuing Dr. Elliott said this mat<lb break="no"/>ter and that it must be dealt with <lb/>
in a clear and definite manner. The <lb/>
premier of Canada asked the premier <lb/>
of the Territories to put his terms in a <lb/>
clear and definite statement and all <lb/>
must be agreed that they could not <lb/>
have been put more clearly or definite<lb break="no"/>ly than they were in that draft bill. <lb/>
Every member knew that it was a <lb/>
clear and plain statement and he sup<lb break="no"/>posed that it would be charged against <lb/>
the prime minister that there was <lb/>
nothing new in it. There was nothing <lb/>
new in the demands made in that bill. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman from Yorkton had <lb/>
referred to the speech made by the <lb/>
premier in Yorkton in 1890. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> —1900. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ELLI1">Dr. Elliott</persName> —If the hon. gentleman <lb/>
for Yorkton were only ten years be<lb break="no"/>hind the times he would be much bet<lb break="no"/>ter informed than he is to-day. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) <lb/></p> 

<p>If the hon. gentleman referred to <lb/>
the speech made in 1900, and if the <lb/>
man who sold out his business in York<lb break="no"/>ton and moved to Saltcoats for the <lb/>
purpose of contesting that constituency <lb/>
based his conclusions on that speech, <lb/>
then he (the speaker) must say that if <lb/>
this man had no better idea of that <lb/>
speech than the hon. gentleman had <lb/>
he did not wonder that he drew <lb/>
erroneous conclusions from it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> —It was not a conclusion; <lb/>
it was a direct statement by the <lb/>
speaker. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PEOPLE PREPARED FOR AUTONOMY.</p> 

<p>Dr. Elliott continuing said the people <lb/>
were demanding provincial institutions <lb/>
at once. They must have power to <lb/>
build railways, etc. They had given a <lb/>
mandate to the Government. In the <lb/>
last general election they had express<lb break="no"/>ed confidence in the Government, and <lb/>
in the members of the House, and it was <lb/>
not the duty of members to appeal to <lb/>
the people on every flimsy excuse that <lb/>
might come up. They knew the people <lb/>
were prepared for provincial autonomy <lb/>
on the lines laid down by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The hon gentleman form York<lb break="no"/>ton said the school lands should be <lb/>
held in trust. They certainly would <lb/>
be. He also agreed with everything <lb/>
proposed in the memorial to Ottawa, <lb/>
except that the Territories should be <lb/>
divided into two provinces instead of <lb/>
one. The hon. gentleman changed his <lb/>
mind so frequently that he should not be <lb/>
taken very seriously when he proposed <lb/>
two provinces. He might be back the <lb/>
next week to three provinces, <lb/>
or follow the suggestion he (the <lb/>
speaker) had made and ask for <lb/>

<cb/>

14, 15 or 500 provinces in this country. <lb/></p> 

<p>They had been told that things were <lb/>
being done in secret and that members <lb/>
of the Government had abandoned the <lb/>
stand they had taken in speeches <lb/>
made on other occasions. This was <lb/>
not so. The Government had taken <lb/>
the most manly course and expressed <lb/>
its opinion on the question and made <lb/>
a definite statement which nobody <lb/>
could say they could not understand. <lb/>
Everybody knew exactly what had <lb/>
been asked for. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">TERMS THE IMPORTANT POINT.</p> 

<p>Much had been heard about one <lb/>
overwhelming, predominating pro<lb break="no"/>vince. They proposed to make one <lb/>
province that would be a prosperous, <lb/>
successful province an honor to the <lb/>
Dominion, and would supply the <lb/>
necessaries of life to millions of people <lb/>
yet unborn. Why should they be <lb/>
putting it before the people of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba that the proposed province is so <lb/>
many times the size of Manitoba when <lb/>
that province again is so many times <lb/>
the size of Prince Edward Island? They <lb/>
had able men to look after their <lb/>
own interests. The most important <lb/>
point was not whether there should be <lb/>
one province or two provinces, but <lb/>
on what grounds were they <lb/>
going to be admitted into con<lb break="no"/>federation, whether they were <lb/>
going to be allowed compensation <lb/>
for the lands taken away and compen<lb break="no"/>sation for the exemption from taxation <lb/>
of a very large portion of the country, <lb/>
and what allowance they were going <lb/>
to receive to meet the responsibilities <lb/>
they would have to assume. These <lb/>
were the most vital questions to the <lb/>
country which overshadowed to a very <lb/>
large extent the question of one pro<lb break="no"/>vince or two provinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>If a member of the House had made <lb/>
up his mind as to the number of pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and was in favor of two, he <lb/>
should give the approximate boundar<lb break="no"/>ies of those provinces. Would the <lb/>
gentlemen opposite say the question of <lb/>
northern and southern provinces, or <lb/>
eastern and western should be left for <lb/>
future consideration and then when <lb/>
the question came up to be decided as <lb/>
to how the Territories were to be <lb/>
divided would they say to the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion: "We do not know; you will have <lb/>
to take the responsibility?" If it was <lb/>
time to know that the Territories <lb/>
should be divided into two provinces it <lb/>
was time they knew how it should be <lb/>
done. (Hear, hear.) This should have <lb/>
been discussed in the speech made by <lb/>
the hon. member for Yorkton. He <lb/>
compared the demands made by the <lb/>
Territorial Government on the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion Government to the boy trying to <lb/>
get a whole jugful of nuts at once. He <lb/>
thought they should take one by one. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman was probably <lb/>
thinking of the time when he thought <lb/>
they should get full provincial powers <lb/>
about 26 years from the present time. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">GOVERNMENT DEMANDS REASONABLE.</p> 

<p>Dr. Elliott said he did not wish to go <lb/>
any further with the question. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman had taken up so many <lb/>
things and gone over them in his <lb/>
characteristic and erratic manner that it <lb/>
was very difficult to follow him. (Hear, <lb/>
hear and laughter.) If his conclusions <lb/>
had been founded on facts and arrived <lb/>
at by proper methods of reasoning it <lb/>
would not have been a difficult task, <lb/>
but when he proposed to form a pro<lb break="no"/>vince containing 220,000 square miles <lb/>
and said the provinces should be ap<lb break="no"/>proximately equal in area he was making <lb/>
a very grave statement, when Prince <lb/>
Edward Island was only an insignifi<lb break="no"/>cant area compared with the one he <lb/>
proposed. Manitoba was only a third <lb/>
the size of the province he proposed. <lb/>
It was not wonder, therefore, that a <lb/>
man could not follow the reasoning of <lb/>
the hon. gentleman. That gentleman <lb/>
also claimed that the demands made <lb/>
were unreasonable demands. If this <lb/>
was so it was his duty to tell him in <lb/>
what respect. He knew full well that <lb/>
the demands were reasonable and <lb/>
would receive the sanction of the <lb/>
people, and he agreed with everything <lb/>
except to say that a large area should <lb/>
be added to the territory demand<lb break="no"/>ed and then be divided into two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>It was time, continued the speaker, <lb/>
that the Territories had provincial <lb/>
institutions. Last year the census <lb/>
had been taken and the ground work <lb/>
was these upon which to build. There <lb/>
would be no more favorable time. The <lb/>
people were almost animous in favor <lb/>
of one province and the vast predom<lb break="no"/>inance of opinion against annexation. <lb/>
He believed the Ordinances of the <lb/>
Territories were more suitable to con<lb break="no"/>ditions here than were those of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. He was anxious to go forward <lb/>
and build up a large, prosper<lb break="no"/>ous province. (Cheers.) It being 5:30 <lb/>
o'clock the Speaker left the chair. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">EVENING SESSION.</p> 

<p>When the House re-assembled at <lb/>
eight o'clock all the available space in <lb/>
the chamber was occupied by an in<lb break="no"/>terested and expectant audience. <lb/>
Many ladies occupied seats within the <lb/>
bar of the House. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCKA6">Mr. Thos. McKay</persName> (Prince Albert <lb/>
West) immediately resumed the debate. <lb/>
He said there could be no differences <lb/>
of opinion as to the great necessity of <lb/>
obtaining full provincial powers, not <lb/>
only because of the increased financial <lb/>
assistance thus obtained, but greater <lb/>
even, so as to be given power to grap<lb break="no"/>ple with the questions with which they <lb/>
had to deal. The great question was <lb/>
the transportation question and unless <lb/>
they got full provincial powers they <lb/>
would be unable to grapple with it. It <lb/>
was quite true the federal authorities <lb/>
were grappling with it to a certain <lb/>
extent but they themselves could do it <lb/>
much more effectively if they had the <lb/>
power, and that was one of the great <lb/>
problems with which they came face to <lb/>
face every year. It had been almost <lb/>
impossible during the past few years <lb/>
to get a fair remuneration for their <lb/>
crops. It was all very well to produce <lb/>
large crops and have an increased <lb/>
acreage but it was useless unless they <lb/>
could get a good price for it. He de<lb break="no"/>sired to discuss the question from the <lb/>
standpoint of the farmer, for being a <lb/>
farmer himself it appealed to him very <lb/>
strongly in that way. They were on <lb/>
the eve of great changes. People were <lb/>
coming in from all parts of the world. <lb/>
There was no large vacant lands to the <lb/>
south as there were a few years ago <lb/>
and Canada was now advertised and <lb/>
known throughout the world. The <lb/>
question of transportation, therefore, <lb/>
was one that would have to be dealt <lb/>
with. All were aware of the serious <lb/>
loss sustained through lack of trans<lb break="no"/>portation during the past year but that <lb/>
was only a beginning of what would <lb/>
have to be faced. The growth of pop<lb break="no"/>ulation would be much greater than <lb/>
the growth of railway development <lb/>
and the only way to grapple with the <lb/>
question was to obtain full provincial <lb/>
powers on the same conditions as the <lb/>
other provinces. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">EXCEEDED THEIR AUTHORITY.</p> 

<p>The second part of the resolution he <lb/>

<cb/>

could not agree with because he be<lb break="no"/>lieved the Government exceeded its <lb/>
authority and asked too much in their <lb/>
negotiations with the federal authori<lb break="no"/>ties. It was quite true the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were authorised by the House to <lb/>
negotiate with the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It derived its authority from <lb/>
the resolution passed on May 2, 1900. <lb/>
The latter part of that resolution said: <lb/>
"We do most humbly pray that Your <lb/>
Excellency will be graciously pleased <lb/>
to order enquiries to be made and <lb/>
accounts taken with a view to the <lb/>
settlement of the terms and conditions <lb/>
upon which the Territories or any part <lb/>
thereof shall be established as a pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and that, before any such pro<lb break="no"/>vince is established, opportunity should <lb/>
be given to the people of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies, through their accredited repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, of considering and discuss<lb break="no"/>ing such terms and conditions." It <lb/>
appeared to him that the Government <lb/>
went about the matter in a wrong way <lb/>
by assuming too much and exceeded <lb/>
the authority given it under that reso<lb break="no"/>lution. After going to Ottawa and <lb/>
suggesting the conditions and terms <lb/>
which they thought advisable, it was <lb/>
their duty to come back to the legisla<lb break="no"/>ture and submit those conditions and <lb/>
terms to the legislature and people and <lb/>
ask for their approval. He believed in <lb/>
conducting business by the people for <lb/>
the people. The Government had ex<lb break="no"/>ceeded its authority in this matter and <lb/>
could not say that a mandate was given <lb/>
to deal with the question of provincial <lb/>
autonomy. <lb/></p> 

<p>It had been said by some previous <lb/>
speakers that the subject was discussed <lb/>
in every part of the Territories before <lb/>
the last election. It might have been <lb/>
in some parts but the Territories were <lb/>
large and speaking for the part he re<lb break="no"/>presented, he would say that it was <lb/>
not discussed there and he would chal<lb break="no"/>lenge any member from north of the <lb/>
Saskatchewan to contradict him. As <lb/>
far as he was concerned it was not <lb/>
brought up. He thought it was time <lb/>
we should lead up to it but he also <lb/>
thought that before we were given full <lb/>
provincial powers the people should <lb/>
have an opportunity of discussing it at <lb/>
another election. He had said then <lb/>
that it was the duty of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to negotiate and see what could <lb/>
be obtained and then ask the people for <lb/>
their approval, and that if they did not <lb/>
do so there would be at least one con<lb break="no"/>stituency which would have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of expressig their opinion <lb/>
on the matter, because he would resign <lb/>
his seat in the House if such a mea<lb break="no"/>sure were forced on the people. He <lb/>
had also made that statement in the <lb/>
House. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">A DYING LEGISLATURE.</p> 

<p>He could not understand by what <lb/>
process of reasoning the premier came <lb/>
to the conclusion that he had a man<lb break="no"/>date, more especially for a dying legis<lb break="no"/>lature to deal with such an <lb/>
important question. Such an action <lb/>
would be very unwise. A year's delay <lb/>
was all that was asked for and what <lb/>
was a year in the lifetime of a nation. <lb/>
The people might have to suffer the <lb/>
disadvantages under which they were <lb/>
placed but he was prepared to do so <lb/>
rather than have that legislature deal <lb/>
with the subject when another election <lb/>
would be held in a short time. <lb/></p> 

<p>The premier in speaking to the reso<lb break="no"/>lution in 1900 had said that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was not one that could be settled <lb/>
in a day nor possibly within less than <lb/>
a year or two. He was bringing it <lb/>
down to be discussed. He had also <lb/>
said that that the Government had no <lb/>
mandate to plunge the people into a <lb/>
province. Therefore it was very im<lb break="no"/>proper that the Assembly should deal <lb/>
with it, having no mandate to do so, <lb/>
more especially on the eve of a general <lb/>
election. It was quite right and proper <lb/>
to discuss it in the House and lead up <lb/>
to it gradually but they had no cause <lb/>
to complain that the federal authori<lb break="no"/>ties did not grant what was asked for <lb/>
last session. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE QUESTION OF LANDS.</p> 

<p>As to the terms the Government pro<lb break="no"/>posed there ought to be no difference <lb/>
of opinion but unfortunately there had <lb/>
been a difference of opinion and it had <lb/>
come from a quarter from which <lb/>
it should not have come. In the budget <lb/>
last year it was claimed that the land <lb/>
question was settled and that we had <lb/>
no lands. This statement had not been <lb/>
made on the spur of the moment but <lb/>
after mature consideration for the <lb/>
Territorial Treasurer had gone to the <lb/>
trouble of getting a map from Ottawa <lb/>
highly colored to prove that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the the lands had been settled <lb/>
once and forever. It was quite proper <lb/>
that there should be differences of <lb/>
opinion between the members of the <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> but under our constitutional <lb/>
 <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> Government there should be <lb/>
no differences of opinion in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment itself. Now they claimed <lb/>
there were lands worth asking <lb/>
for. Such differences of opinion <lb/>
weaken the lands of those who were <lb/>
making the request and to a much <lb/>
greater extent than a mere difference <lb/>
of opinion in the House. <lb/></p> 

<p>The premier when speaking to the <lb/>
resolution which gave him authority <lb/>
to deal with this question, at the close <lb/>
of his remarks said: "I hope, sir, I have <lb/>
established a sufficient ground for <lb/>
asking this House to say that enquiries <lb/>
should be made and accounts taken <lb/>
with a view to the settlement <lb/>
of the terms and conditions upon <lb/>
which the Territories or any part <lb/>
thereof shall be established as a pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and that a proposition should be <lb/>
submitted to the people of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, through their representatives, <lb/>
before any final action is taken." It <lb/>
appeared that the premier must have <lb/>
changed his opinion because he asked <lb/>
the federal authorities to take final <lb/>
action. What use would it have been <lb/>
for the House to discuss it if the <lb/>
federal Government had passed what <lb/>
was asked for? They might discuss it <lb/>
for all time and it would make no <lb/>
difference to them, but it would <lb/>
have made a difference if the <lb/>
proposition made was laid <lb/>
before the Houes and people after <lb/>
the premier's return from Ottawa. <lb/>
Therefore, they had no ground for <lb/>
complaint when the federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment failed to agree to pass that legis<lb break="no"/>lation. One of the principal reasons <lb/>
why the people should be given theself <lb/>
local Government which they were <lb/>
asking for, was that they might govern <lb/>
themselves as they saw fit and work <lb/>
out their own salvation, but owing to <lb/>
the way in which the Territorial <lb/>
Government had dealt with the people <lb/>
the Dominion Government may have <lb/>
thought that the people were not <lb/>
capable of governing themselves, for <lb/>
on every possible occasion the local <lb/>
Government took self-government <lb/>
from the people and governed them <lb/>
from Regina. The clause of the Public <lb/>
Works Ordinance with reference to <lb/>
small local improvement districts did <lb/>
not show that the Territorial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment thought the people were capable <lb/>
of self-government. If they did think <lb/>

<cb/>

so it was a very poor way of showing it. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">FEDERAL GRANT FOR GOVERNMENT.</p> 

<p>The hon. member for Wolseley <lb/>
thought that if it was good to have two <lb/>
provinces it was better to have half a <lb/>
dozen. Well, if they could convince <lb/>
him, and he thought they could, to <lb/>
have two instead of one he was quite <lb/>
at liberty to have them cut up <lb/>
into a dozen. They were not <lb/>
asking too much in asking <lb/>
for two provinces. True it would <lb/>
mean a larger expenditure from federal <lb/>
sources for government but it must be <lb/>
remembered that they were asking for <lb/>
this not for nothing. They would <lb/>
have to give up something for it. The <lb/>
provinces had to give up the right to <lb/>
levy customs taxes which now amount<lb break="no"/>ed to something like $40,000,000, an <lb/>
average of $7.50 per head of the <lb/>
population. Thus the Territories had <lb/>
given up the right of collecting $1,200,<lb break="no"/>000 and their population was only <lb/>
160,000. <lb/></p> 

<p>When anyone advocated cutting up <lb/>
the Territories into a dozen provinces <lb/>
they were asking for an absurdity. <lb/>
They might as well ask for townships <lb/>
to be formed into provinces. It had <lb/>
been asked where the Opposition stood <lb/>
on this question. The amendment <lb/>
outlined their provincial autonomy <lb/>
platform at the present time. It de<lb break="no"/>clared for two provinces, was clear cut <lb/>
with nothing unreasonable about it. <lb/></p> 

<p>A voice from the Government <lb/>
benches—Which two? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCKA6">Mr. McKay</persName>—I will answer you in the <lb/>
words of your leader. He says the <lb/>
Government wishes there should be <lb/>
unanimity on this question and they <lb/>
wish to avoid all controversial sides to <lb/>
this question. (Hear, hear, cheers and <lb/>
laughter.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS.</p> 

<p>He admitted frankly that when the <lb/>
division of the Territories came it was <lb/>
quite possible there would be a diverg<lb break="no"/>ence of opinion on the Opposition side, <lb/>
but at present they would do as the <lb/>
premier had asked and avoid all con<lb break="no"/>troversial subjects. If that was a good <lb/>
answer for the Government to give, it <lb/>
was certainly good when given by the <lb/>
Opposition. But, continued Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Kay when we occupy the treasury <lb/>
benches if there are controversial ques<lb break="no"/>tions we will be prepared to fight it <lb/>
out. (Hear, hear.) <lb/></p> 

<p>We voted for the resolution in 1900 <lb/>
unanimously for we did not wish <lb/>
to weaken the attitude taken <lb/>
by the Government, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, we were prepared to <lb/>
vote that they should go as far as the <lb/>
resolution indicated and in accordance <lb/>
with the explanation of the Attorney <lb/>
General that the resolution did not <lb/>
commit any person to one, two or <lb/>
three provinces. There are contro<lb break="no"/>versial aspects to this question but in <lb/>
its most important aspect it is not. <lb/>
We take the same attitude; it is a <lb/>
reasonable attitude and the only one <lb/>
that can be taken. The controversial <lb/>
questions have got to be threshed out. <lb/>
In the face of his explanation and get<lb break="no"/>ting the House to vote unanimously <lb/>
on that resolution the premier went to <lb/>
Ottawa and drafted a bill and asked <lb/>
the federal authorities that this large <lb/>
area should be erected into one pro<lb break="no"/>vince. We take exception to that, <lb/>
because we did not expect it would be <lb/>
done and we are, therefore, not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to vote for this resolution. We <lb/>
accordingly submit an alternative and <lb/>
are prepared to fight the next election <lb/>
out on that ground and the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men can bring it on just as soon as they <lb/>
like. (Hear, hear.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MANITOBA'S UNFAIR ATTEMPT.</p> 

<p>I think questions of this kind should <lb/>
be approached very slowly. It is very <lb/>
important and however great <lb/>
we may feel the necessity of <lb/>
dealing with the question we should <lb/>
first give the people an opportunity of <lb/>
discussing it. This is a large country <lb/>
and the people are scattered over a <lb/>
very wide area. I believe that the <lb/>
members of this House at one time <lb/>
were prepared to see a portion annexed <lb/>
to Manitoba, but if so they have <lb/>
changed their minds. The asking for <lb/>
such a large area would be a good ex<lb break="no"/>cuse for the Dominion Government to <lb/>
give Manitoba a part. By asking for <lb/>
two provinces it would do away with <lb/>
any grounds for giving it to her. We <lb/>
must admire the attitude of Manitoba <lb/>
in desiring a portion of the Territories. <lb/>
They know it is a good country and <lb/>
that the people would give just as good <lb/>
an account of themselves as the Mani<lb break="no"/>tobans. We do not wish to antagonise <lb/>
Manitoba but to gain Manitoba's sym<lb break="no"/>pathy, and I believe that the proposi<lb break="no"/>tion submitted by the Government and <lb/>
Opposition would help to that extent <lb/>
by leaving out the northern part. It <lb/>
was unfair of that province to try and <lb/>
steal our property when we were not <lb/>
in a position to say yes or no. If we <lb/>
were a province the federal authorities <lb/>
would have no power to take away our <lb/>
territory, but unfortunately as we are <lb/>
we have nothing to say in the matter, <lb/>
only protest. <lb/></p> 

<p>In dealing with this question as we <lb/>
have done, the people will be well <lb/>
satisfied with the attitude we have <lb/>
taken as we propose to give them an <lb/>
alternative proposition. Hitherto <lb/>
they have had only one before them. <lb/>
The Opposition have now adopted a <lb/>
platform on provincial autonomy and <lb/>
the people have an opportunity of <lb/>
having an alternative. If they are <lb/>
satisfied with the proposition given by <lb/>
the Government I will be quite satisfied <lb/>
to abide by it, but if they adopt ours I <lb/>
will be still better satisfied. (Cheers.) <lb/></p>

<p rendition="simple:centre">(Continued from page 1)</p> 

<p>every member to at least give an ex<lb break="no"/>pression of opinion on the matters re<lb break="no"/>lative to provincial autonomy. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman from Prince Albert <lb/>
West had referred to the question of <lb/>
transportation and he quite agreed <lb/>
with him that it was the most import<lb break="no"/>ant question. The experience of the <lb/>
past year had taught them a lesson in <lb/>
that respect and the matter must be <lb/>
dealt with without delay. After stat<lb break="no"/>ing this the hon. gentleman had gone on <lb/>
to say that he could not agree with the <lb/>
resolution brought in, which regretted <lb/>
the action of the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in refusing to grant powers <lb/>
necessary to deal with this question. <lb/>
To say the least, he considered the hon. <lb/>
gentleman's position inconsistent. <lb/></p> 

<p>The member for Prince Albert West <lb/>
had also stated that the Commissioner <lb/>
of Public Works said that there were <lb/>
no public lands left. True, there were <lb/>
few lands left, but the Commissioner <lb/>
had not said there were no lands. The <lb/>
proposition made by the Government <lb/>
asked for the lands that were left over <lb/>
and above those alienated. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">AN EXTRAORDINARY POSITION.</p> 

<p>As to the statement that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had no mandate, and the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the member for Prince Albert <lb/>
West that if the autonomy question <lb/>
took any definite shape during the <lb/>
term of this legislature he would <lb/>
resign. Mr. Gillis said this was an <lb/>
extraordinary stand to take, to resign <lb/>
his seat to show that he was opposed <lb/>
to taking any steps in that direction <lb/>
yet he voted for the resolution to enter <lb/>
into full negotiations with the Ottawa <lb/>
Government. this was a most extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary stand to take. <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:MCKA6">Mr. McKay</persName> — I said that it is time to <lb/>
lead up to this question, but if the <lb/>
legislature was to plunge the people <lb/>
into the matter and create us into a <lb/>
a province during the term of this legis<lb break="no"/>lature, I would resign my seat and the <lb/>
people of Prince Albert West would <lb/>
at least have an opportunity of ex<lb break="no"/>pressing an opinion on the matter. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:GILL3">Mr. Gillis</persName> was pleased the hon, <lb/>
gentleman had made the explanation <lb/>
but it did not alter the case one iota. <lb/>
No time was fixed in the resolution and <lb/>
the Government were empowered by <lb/>
the unanimous vote of the House to <lb/>
enter into negotiations for our entering <lb/>
confederation. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
should have moved a resolution that <lb/>
the Government should not have done <lb/>
so before an appeal to the people. <lb/>
That was the proper course and the <lb/>
one he should have taken. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">DR. PATRICK'S STRIDES.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:GILL3">Mr. Gillis</persName> then said he desired to con<lb break="no"/>gratulate the hon. member for York<lb break="no"/>ton upon the strides he was making in <lb/>
the House. Up to a few days ago that <lb/>
gentleman had occupied a seat on the <lb/>
back benched but now he had taken a <lb/>

<cb/>

step forward and occupied the third <lb/>
position in the Opposition ranks which <lb/>
meant that he would occupy a position <lb/>
of eminence and prominence in this <lb/>
great conutry if the Opposition ever <lb/>
got to the treasury benches. He did <lb/>
not wish to build up any false hopes, <lb/>
however. That hon. gentleman in his <lb/>
speech referred to the draft bill submit<lb break="no"/>ted by this Government to the federal <lb/>
government and went on and recited <lb/>
several of the principal provisions of that <lb/>
bill, discussed them carefully and agreed <lb/>
with the main principles all the way <lb/>
through. (Hear, hear.) He agreed <lb/>
with all that and then went on and <lb/>
moved his extraordinary amendment. <lb/>
If he had read his amendment and <lb/>
said nothing the country would have <lb/>
been just as wise. (Laughter.) <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member for Yorkton dwelt <lb/>
at length on the subject that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had no mandate. He (the <lb/>
speaker) quite agreed with the hon. <lb/>
gentleman from Wolseley that pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy was the live question <lb/>
at the last election. In his district it <lb/>
was the prominent question and it was <lb/>
thought iliat during the life of this <lb/>
Assembly it would have to be decided. <lb/>
The premier at the last meeting in <lb/>
Whitewood had stated that during the <lb/>
life of this Assembly it would be dis<lb break="no"/>cussed and in all probability full ar<lb break="no"/>rangements made. As far as he knew <lb/>
in the other districts in Eastern <lb/>
Assiniboia the candidates also had this <lb/>
plank in their platforms and were agreed <lb/>
that it would be a question which this <lb/>
Assembly would have to discuss. The <lb/>
statement that the Government find <lb/>
no mandate was contrary to the actual <lb/>
facts in the districts he knew of. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE MISSION TO OTTAWA.</p> 

<p>The hon. gentleman from Yorkton <lb/>
also objected strongly to the manner <lb/>
in which the local Government ap<lb break="no"/>proached the federal Government on <lb/>
this question, and claimed that they had <lb/>
no right to go to the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment and Parliament but should have <lb/>
done it through the Territorial repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives at Ottawa. What was the <lb/>
premier elected to this House for if not <lb/>
to look after their own business. It <lb/>
was the duty of the federal representa<lb break="no"/>tives to look after Canada in general, <lb/>
and it was the duty of the local legis<lb break="no"/>lature to look after their own interests, <lb/>
and in going to Ottawa the <lb/>
premier did nothing but what <lb/>
was right and his duty, and noth<lb break="no"/>ing but what would have to be <lb/>
done by the present or any other gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in the Territories. It was a <lb/>
local question that must be dealt with <lb/>
by them. One would imagine to hear <lb/>
the hon. gentleman talk about secret <lb/>
negotiations that the draft bill was <lb/>
something new and the principles in it <lb/>
unknown to the people. Everyone <lb/>
knew them and yet the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man spoke of secret negotiations which <lb/>
were not divulged when they ought to <lb/>
have been. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:GILL3">Mr. Gillis</persName> stated that on the question <lb/>
of the number of provinces he had <lb/>
always held certain definite viewes <lb/>
which he had expressed in the House <lb/>
and his constituency, and that was that <lb/>
when they came to be a province they <lb/>
should enter confederation on the lines <lb/>
laid down in the draft bill. He had <lb/>
heard nothing to lead him to change <lb/>
his opinion. The conclusions of the <lb/>
member for Yorkton had very little <lb/>
weight. The question they had to <lb/>
deal with was a practical one. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">LET US DOUBLE EVERYTHING.</p> 

<p>The change the hon. gentlemen who <lb/>
occupied the Opposition benches had <lb/>
taken was a marvellous one. Last year <lb/>
when it was proposed to increase the <lb/>
salaries of the hon. gentlemen occupy<lb break="no"/>ing the treasury benches a great howl <lb/>
was raised by the Opposition: and <lb/>
only a few years ago one hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man up site advocated cutting off the <lb/>
small allowance of $500 to the Speaker. <lb/>
It was all right to economise but that <lb/>
was carrying it too far. They had <lb/>
changed their front entirely and now <lb/>
said in effect that the country was too <lb/>
cheaply governed. They said instead <lb/>
of one lieutenant governor let us have <lb/>
two: instead of three or four paid <lb/>
ministers let us have seven or eight; <lb/>
instead of five or six deputy heads let <lb/>
us have ten or twelve: let the civil <lb/>
service be multiplied by two and let us <lb/>
double everything. If, said Mr. Gillis, <lb/>
we have two provinces it will cost just <lb/>
double and that is one thing the people <lb/>
of this country will not for a moment <lb/>
tolerate. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">AN ECONOMICAL GOVERNMENT.</p> 

<p>There wasa reference made to the <lb/>
amount of $50,000 they would receive <lb/>
as the grant made to each province <lb/>
from the Dominion for legislative pur<lb break="no"/>poses. A cent a head was not much <lb/>
but the item would be considered in <lb/>
bulk. They had examples in eastern <lb/>
Canada but he did not think a compar<lb break="no"/>ison could be fairly made between <lb/>
conditions prevailing there and here. <lb/>
In this country they hail a system of <lb/>
their own intended to cover and meet <lb/>
all requirements and deal out proper <lb/>
treatment to all parts of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies. The people were wisely and <lb/>
economically governed and no matter <lb/>
how far away they were, they enjoyed <lb/>
the same privileges as those near <lb/>
Regina or any other central point, and <lb/>

<cb/>

it would be unwise, therefore, to make <lb/>
any changes in that respect. Under <lb/>
their system of overnment they had <lb/>
built up in th a country the most <lb/>
economical system of any province in <lb/>
Canada. In one large local improve<lb break="no"/>ment district it cost less than $50 to <lb/>
collect $4,500 in taxes, while it cost $600 <lb/>
to collect the same amount in the <lb/>
municipality of Indian Head. No part <lb/>
of the country suffered or was being <lb/>
ill-treated, and, therefore, they should <lb/>
endeavor as far as possible to continue <lb/>
that form of government. <lb/></p> 

<p>Who wanted two provinces? The <lb/>
farmers did not, and the only answer <lb/>
that occurred to him was a few ambi<lb break="no"/>tious politicians. The majority of the <lb/>
people were strongly and very strongly <lb/>
opposed to two provinces. Our duty, <lb/>
concluded Mr. Gillis is to get together <lb/>
and establish a system by which this <lb/>
country can be well and economically <lb/>
governed. (Cheers.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:VILL1">MR. P. VILLENEUVE</persName></p> 

<p>was the next speaker. He said the <lb/>
question had been brought so <lb/>
suddenly on the people that they were <lb/>
not quite read to discuss it in all its <lb/>
important details. The Government <lb/>
did not want to proceed on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion last year without the sanction of <lb/>
the Assembly and yet they had done <lb/>
exactly the opposite of what they <lb/>
promised, and although he was in <lb/>
favor of provincial autonomy as soon <lb/>
as possible he could not express any <lb/>
regret at the refusal of the Dominion <lb/>
Government to grant it without the <lb/>
people having been consulted by a <lb/>
general election. or a referendum <lb/>
(laughter), or by the premier taking the <lb/>
advice of the members of the House. <lb/>
The Government party had told the <lb/>
country that the members of the <lb/>
Opposition took no interest in <lb/>
this question or even thought about <lb/>
it. They practically said to the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Yorkton: "You should not <lb/>
have spoken. You did not clear off <lb/>
the deck and you did not enlighten the <lb/>
member for Whitewood or the member <lb/>
for Wolseley. <lb/></p> 

<p>There were, howeverm going to move <lb/>
now and if it came a little late it was <lb/>
the fault of the Attorney General who <lb/>
for the first time had come before the <lb/>
House with a regular and straight an<lb break="no"/>nouncement of his policy of one pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The resolution of May, 1900, was <lb/>
never intended to give the Government <lb/>
authority to go to Ottawa and pledge <lb/>
the Assembly or people of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies to accept whatever proposal the <lb/>
Government of the country wished to <lb/>
present them without first asking the <lb/>
approval of the House or people. The <lb/>
last paragraph of the resolution of 1900 <lb/>
said. "and that a proposition should <lb/>
be submitted to the people of the <lb/>
Territories, through their representa<lb break="no"/>tives, before any final action is taken." <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THEIR DUTY TO GIVE ADVICE.</p> 

<p>Have we, the accredited representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the people, asked Mr. Villen<lb break="no"/>euve, been consulted and asked some <lb/>
advice? (Laughter.) The premier <lb/>
never condenscends to ask advise from <lb/>
us. Well, we have a right to give it to <lb/>
him. (Loud laughter.) I hope he will <lb/>
take my advice in the same sense of <lb/>
duty I give it. I give it as a duty to <lb/>
myself, my district, the Territories and <lb/>
Canada, because I consider that this <lb/>
question must be approached by a <lb/>
western man not only as a resident <lb/>
of the Territories but as a <lb/>
Canadian who has not only the <lb/>
interest of the Territories them<lb break="no"/>selves at heart, but at the same time <lb/>
Canada as a whole, and it is in this <lb/>
frame of mind I intend discussing a <lb/>
few of the proposals. <lb/></p> 

<p>In the resolution of May 1900, the <lb/>
premier had asked them to drop all <lb/>
controversial questions. It was not <lb/>
one, two or three provinces but the <lb/>
provincial autonomy question, and <lb/>
before it came to the front they had to <lb/>
make an enquiry into their accounts <lb/>
and see how they stood with the feder<lb break="no"/>al Government and whether they were <lb/>
in the good column or not, and on <lb/>
what terms the Territories should <lb/>
enter confederation, and then at that <lb/>
time the Assembly would have occasion <lb/>
to discuss them. Had they? No, the <lb/>
Government went to Ottawa and pre<lb break="no"/>sented their memorial purporting to be <lb/>
the ideas set forth by the assembly but <lb/>
which they were not because they <lb/>
certainly were not discussed there. <lb/>
They had been discussed in an exactly <lb/>
contrary manner. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ELLI1">Dr. Elliott</persName>—You should have done <lb/>
your duty and discussed them. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">A CAUSE FOR REJOICING.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:VILL1">Mr. Villeneuve</persName> said that was what <lb/>
they did. He said no advice had been <lb/>
given at all by the House. to <lb/>
the Government. The only instruc<lb break="no"/>tion that was given—and that had <lb/>
been taken a little rashly by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment— was when the House decided <lb/>
that the boundaries of Manitoba shonld <lb/>
not be extended westward. That was <lb/>
the only instruction given and since <lb/>
then they had never been asked for <lb/>
any. Why should they regret because <lb/>
that proposal was not accepted? <lb/>
lnstead of regretting they should <lb/>
rejoice. When he saw the sad face of <lb/>
the Commissloner of Agriculture he. <lb/>
too, should rejoice with them for in the <lb/>
event of a general Dominion election <lb/>
he might have to support some of the <lb/>
candidates of this Government they <lb/>
were asked to condemn. (Laughter.) <lb/>
He thought the Federal Government <lb/>
did right in refusing to entertain Mr. <lb/>
Haultain's proposal. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WOULD ACCEPT THREE PROVINCES.</p> 

<p>He agreed with the Opposition in <lb/>
declaring for two provinces. He was <lb/>
not against three provinces and if the <lb/>
Federal Government granted them it <lb/>
would only be following the idea of the <lb/>
Government when the provisional <lb/>
districts were made. Sir ohn Mac<lb break="no"/>donald thought there should be three <lb/>
provinces and if the member for Wol<lb break="no"/>seley ridiculed the idea he (Villeneuve) <lb/>
could stand with Sir John Macdonald. <lb/>
But that was not the question now. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member for Whitewood <lb/>
had referred to economy. If the <lb/>
Government at Ottawa were prepared <lb/>
to give the money for two legislatures <lb/>
western people should not object. The <lb/>
people of the north were for two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. and a representative was to re<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

present the ideas of the people and as <lb/>
his constituents were in favor of two <lb/>
provinces he must come there and <lb/>
state the facts, and again the eastern <lb/>
provinces would never allow the <lb/>
equilibrium of the confederation to be <lb/>
broken. Was it possible that Ontario <lb/>
and the other provinces would say that <lb/>
fifty vears hence the country west of <lb/>
Lake Superior will control the rest of <lb/>
Canada? No, they would say: "We will <lb/>
make it into provinces so that while <lb/>
they will have some general common <lb/>
interests they will not have that over<lb break="no"/>whelming influence one province <lb/>
would possess. The Opposition <lb/>
were pledged to two provinces and <lb/>
would give evidence that it was fight<lb break="no"/>ing a good fight, and whatever the re<lb break="no"/>sult of their battles everyone would be <lb/>
satisfied that the Opposition had been <lb/>
working for the best interests of the <lb/>
people. (Cheers) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">MR. A. S. SMITH.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SMIT7">Mr. A. S. Smith</persName> (Moosomin) said for <lb/>
some years this had been a very im<lb break="no"/>portant question but this session was <lb/>
the first time that they had any indica<lb break="no"/>tion that the Opposition had an opinion <lb/>
on it. The people expected the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to have opinions. He had <lb/>
discussed this question through every <lb/>
portion of his district and he consider<lb break="no"/>ed it the duty not only of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but of the Opposition as well to <lb/>
lay before the people their ideas so <lb/>
that public opinion would be educated <lb/>
up to the position of being able to vote <lb/>
at the elections this year. If the people <lb/>
were not familiar with the question, <lb/>
the different members of the House <lb/>
were responsible for that condition of <lb/>
things, and the Opposition seemed to <lb/>
say that the people were not prepared <lb/>
for the step the Government had <lb/>
taken. One of the first questions dealt <lb/>
with in the House after he had a seat <lb/>
in it was the provincial autonomy <lb/>
question, and since then it had been <lb/>
taken up at every session, and last <lb/>
session the Government introduced a <lb/>
resolution which went to Ottawa ask<lb break="no"/>ing for provincial powers. If the Op<lb break="no"/>position were not acquainted with it <lb/>
they would find when they went to the <lb/>
country that the people were quite <lb/>
acquainted with the conditions the <lb/>
local Government had laid before the <lb/>
federal Government. The member for <lb/>
St. Albert said this was very sudden, <lb/>
but he feared that hon. gentleman had <lb/>
not been in the Territories for a year <lb/>
or more if that was the position he <lb/>
took. Every paper in the Territories <lb/>
had been discussing the question and he <lb/>
failed to see where there was anything <lb/>
very sudden in it. <lb/></p> 

<p>He was surprised that some gentle<lb break="no"/>men should say they were in favor of <lb/>
two provinces but were unable to state <lb/>
in what shape they would have them. <lb/>
Some would have the Territories cut <lb/>
from north to south: others from east <lb/>
to west. As he was not in favor of <lb/>
two provinces it did not make much <lb/>
difference to him, but when the Op<lb break="no"/>position went so far it was regrettable <lb/>
they did not tell the people what shape <lb/>
the provinces would be. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had been quite frank in taking <lb/>
the people and the House into their <lb/>
confidence on this question, although <lb/>
there were some gentlemen who state <lb/>
they have not been taken into the con<lb break="no"/>fidence of the Government but every <lb/>
member of the House knew that that <lb/>
was not the fact. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">CANADA WAS OVER-GOVERNED.</p> 

<p>Here in Canada We were over-gov<lb break="no"/>erned. There were too many local <lb/>
legislatures and in the opinion of him<lb break="no"/>self and many other men it would be <lb/>
better if the eastern provinces were <lb/>
united. It would be a benefit to the <lb/>
whole Dominion. The argument <lb/>
brought before the House that after<lb break="no"/>noon that it was cheaper to govern <lb/>
small provinces than large ones would <lb/>
be a revelation to the business men of <lb/>
Canada, and of the Territories in par<lb break="no"/>ticular. It was like cutting a farm of <lb/>
100 acres up into two-farms of 50 acres. <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> — Take the Bell farm. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SMIT7">Mr. Smith</persName> contended the Bell farm <lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:SMIT7">Mr. Smith</persName> went on to state that the <lb/>
hon. gentleman put himself up to <lb/>
educate the people on business matters <lb/>
in this country. The large financial <lb/>
and commercial institutions were <lb/>
amalgamating and putting them under <lb/>
one head and management. For what <lb/>
 purpose!— For the purpose of cheapen<lb break="no"/>ing the management. <lb/></p> 

  <p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> — To squeeze the people. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SMIT7">Mr. Smith</persName> replied that Dr. Patrick <lb/>
was referring to monopolies, he was <lb/>
not. The trend of times was along the <lb/>
line of increasing amalgamations, and <lb/>
putting all lines of business under a <lb/>
proper head so that one man could <lb/>
look after the whole of it and do it <lb/>
more cheaply. This applied to the <lb/>
business of Government, and if it was <lb/>
done properly it could be done more <lb/>
cheaply. The argument used by the <lb/>
hon. gentleman would have no weight <lb/>
with the business men of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories and other parts of Canada. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">ECONOMICAL CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.</p> 

<p>He would refer the House to the <lb/>
Government of the Territories and by <lb/>
the last returns in the Public Works <lb/>
report he found that the percentage of <lb/>
cost was 3.86 for the expenditure of <lb/>
money in the Territories, and he claim<lb break="no"/>ed the people should be prouid of the <lb/>
economical conduct of business in the <lb/>
North-West. It was further stated <lb/>
that in the large local improvement <lb/>
districts taxes were collected and all <lb/>
services done for 2.5 cents on the dollar. <lb/>
That was a marvellous thing and it <lb/>
must be very gratifying to the people <lb/>
of the Territories to find that the <lb/>
money of the country had been spent <lb/>
so well. The percentage of cost for <lb/>
expenditure on superintendence and <lb/>
inspection was 2-16. It was a most re<lb break="no"/>markable thing from a business stand<lb break="no"/>point that the Government were able <lb/>

<cb/>

to give such a service for a small an <lb/>
expenditure. If they took the Financial <lb/>
Year car Book of the Dominion they would <lb/>
find that no province in the Dominion <lb/>
spent money so cheapl as the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. This was very <lb/>
gratifying to him and be was sure it <lb/>
must be even to the members of the <lb/>
Opposition. <lb/></p> 

<p>He thought when the time came the <lb/>
hon. gentlemen who had been asking <lb/>
for two provinces would find that the <lb/>
people had pronounced ideas <lb/>
on the question, They had <lb/>
been giving it their consideration <lb/>
for some time and realised the <lb/>
fact that this country must be develop<lb break="no"/>ed. He regretted that the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who preceded him was not <lb/>
sorrv that the Government had been <lb/>
blocked and that the time for the es<lb break="no"/>tablishment of a province was in the <lb/>
future. <lb/></p> 

<p>They had a great deal of trouble and <lb/>
loss over the grain blockade. They <lb/>
felt that something must be done; that <lb/>
transportation facilities must be <lb/>
provided; there must be a <lb/>
better way of getting the grain <lb/>
out of the Territories and if that was <lb/>
the case the local Government had <lb/>
a part to play and a responsibility, <lb/>
and the Assembly had a responsibility <lb/>
at the back of the Government, <lb/>
and it must in every way see that <lb/>
proper transportation facilities are <lb/>
given to the people who were develop<lb break="no"/>ing this great country. They were <lb/>
only on the eve of a great development. <lb/>
If they sat down and said they were <lb/>
glad at the action of the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment he would leave the responsibili<lb break="no"/>ty to those who said it, but for himself <lb/>
he was sorry that the Territorial <lb/>
Government had not been placed in a <lb/>
position to be able to take hold of that <lb/>
great question and give the relief the <lb/>
people expected. They needed rail<lb break="no"/>ways and needed them quickly. They <lb/>
could not wait for four or five years <lb/>
and leave their grain in grainaries. <lb/>
They must have railways and at once. <lb/>
With the immigration that was pour<lb break="no"/>ing in, and the responsibility thus <lb/>
placed on the local Government, it was <lb/>
amazing that the Opposition was so <lb/>
glad that the Government could do <lb/>
nothing, and it would find that the <lb/>
people did not sympathise with it. <lb/></p> 

<p>He had noticed in a newspaper report <lb/>
of a meeting held in Prince Albert that <lb/>
the member for Prince Albert West had <lb/>
said that the people of the Territories <lb/>
were not as well fitted to govern them<lb break="no"/>selves as the people of Manitoba were <lb/>
when they entered confederation. He <lb/>
thought this a remarkable statement, <lb/>
that the people were not qualified to <lb/>
govern the country and thought pos<lb break="no"/>sibly the hon. gentleman had come to <lb/>
that conclusion not by travelling <lb/>
through the Territories, but by staying <lb/>
at home. He certainly was not speak<lb break="no"/>ing for any of the eastern districts and <lb/>
he was sure that the western country <lb/>
was on a par with the east as far as <lb/>
development was concerned. When <lb/>
Manitoba, nearly 30 years ago, entered <lb/>
confederation the people had not the <lb/>
training to start out with the people <lb/>
in the Territories had. Here they had <lb/>
a provisional government for many <lb/>
years, and the people were as well <lb/>
qualified to govern themselves as were <lb/>
the people of any province in the <lb/>
Dominion. He hoped the member for <lb/>
Prince Albert West was wrongly re<lb break="no"/>ported but he had not said he was or <lb/>
was not. The Territories had very <lb/>
nearly all legislative powers except <lb/>
to borrow money on the public credit. <lb/>
That was about the only difference. <lb/></p> 

<p>The question had been fully discussed <lb/>
from all points of view. If the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion were sincere in their views it was all <lb/>
right. and if they had taken the same <lb/>
stand two years ago he would have <lb/>
thought they were going in the right <lb/>
direction. At that late date the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition said they had a policy and their <lb/>
amendment was the policy. It was <lb/>
not quite completed yet as they did <lb/>
not know how they would cut the <lb/>
Territories up. They would have to <lb/>
fight that out amongthemselves and <lb/>
the people would also have something <lb/>
to say about it. (Cheers.) <lb/></p>

<p>Following are reports of the speeches <lb/>
by Mr. R. B. Bennett (West <lb/>
Calgary and Mr. A. L. Sifton, Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Public Works, in the <lb/>
Assembly on provincial autonomy: <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. R. B. Bennett</persName> said: Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, it is quite unnecessary for me <lb/>
to say that I approve of provincial <lb/>
autonomy and that I desire it as much <lb/>
as anything in this world. You will <lb/>
recollect that some three years ago I <lb/>
stated in this House the time had ar<lb break="no"/>rived for the Government to take some <lb/>
action to better conditions in the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. I have never changed the <lb/>
opinion then held, and it is a source <lb/>
of some satisfaction to me to find an <lb/>
unanimous opinion in the House to-day <lb/>
that there is a necessity to take <lb/>
some action along the lines of provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy. I am, however, this <lb/>
afternoon face to face with a difficult <lb/>
problem and am asked to vote yea or <lb/>
nay on a resolution, the preamble of <lb/>
which I fully approve, it is clothed in <lb/>
better language than I could have put <lb/>
it and expresses in concrete form the <lb/>
opinion I have expressed, and gives <lb/>
voice to the sentiments I then held and <lb/>
still have, and then follows these <lb/>
momentous words: "Be it resolved <lb/>
that this House regrets that the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral Government has decided not to <lb/>
introduce legislation at the present <lb/>
session of Parliament with a view to <lb/>
granting provincial institutions to the <lb/>
Territories." <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">ONE OF TWO MEANINGS.</p> 

<p>Sir, that means one of two things. <lb/>
Leave not for the sophistry of the At<lb break="no"/>torney General or his cunningly de<lb break="no"/>vised arguments. It means that we <lb/>
regret that the Parliament of Canada <lb/>
did not pass legislation founded on the <lb/>
draft bill presented by this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment or that they did not give us <lb/>
anything they liked on this question. <lb/>
Edefy the gentlemen on the treasury <lb/>
benches, and I challenge hon. mem<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

bers, to deny that we are asked to re<lb break="no"/>gret that the Dominion Government <lb/>
did not pass the draft bill laid before it, <lb/>
or that we regret that the Parliament <lb/>
of Canada did not without consulting <lb/>
us, asking our opinion, or giving us a <lb/>
right to be heard pass any legislation <lb/>
they saw fit. I cannot agree to either <lb/>
of these propositions. I say it with <lb/>
regret. I would have liked to have <lb/>
that unanimity continue to prevail <lb/>
until this question had passed out of <lb/>
existence so far as this country is con<lb break="no"/>cerned. I should have wished that. <lb/>
And yet, sir, I think it is no fault of <lb/>
myself, or any hon. gentleman on this <lb/>
side of the House, that that condition <lb/>
of affairs did not prevail, and in order <lb/>
that I might make perfectly clear <lb/>
the opinion I have and the faith that is <lb/>
within me, I propose to take some little <lb/>
time to discuss, go over and review the <lb/>
history of these negotiations in order <lb/>
that it may never be afforded to any <lb/>
hon. gentleman to go on the hustings <lb/>
or by deliberately false statements or <lb/>
misrepresentations to say that on any <lb/>
act or word of mine any construction <lb/>
could be placed other than that what<lb break="no"/>ever could be done should be done to <lb/>
solve this problem with which is wrap<lb break="no"/>pred up the future of this land. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Attorney General referred to <lb/>
the transportation question and my <lb/>
mind was carried back to some years <lb/>
ago and I found that I once, in lang<lb break="no"/>uage almost identical with the lang<lb break="no"/>uage of the hon. member for Mooso<lb break="no"/>min, said that the question of trans<lb break="no"/>portation should be dealt with by this <lb/>
legislature. I said the questions of <lb/>
of grain combines and elevators were <lb/>
questions of vital importance, and <lb/>
while we might discuss local questions, <lb/>
that over and above and beyond all <lb/>
these questions there was that great <lb/>
question of transportation, which was <lb/>
placed before us, and in our hands for <lb/>
solution, and that as we solved or failed <lb/>
to solve it the people would give us  <lb/>
credit or mete out disapproval. I do<lb break="no"/>not propose to go over that question <lb/>
and review it at length, but in order <lb/>
that no misrepresentation may exist I <lb/>
desire to draw attention to these facts <lb/>
and say them again. I have nothing <lb/>
to retract, nothing to apologize for. <lb/>
My only regret, my keenest regret, is <lb/>
that I cannot support the demands of <lb/>
the Government in the resolution they <lb/>
have placed upon the order paper, be<lb break="no"/>cause I regard it as of utmost impor<lb break="no"/>tance and greatest moment, to the <lb/>
people of the Territories that we should <lb/>
have unanimity in all these matters <lb/>
which are in controversy and which <lb/>
deal with the future of this great <lb/>
land given us by Providence, and in <lb/>
order to make this clear I desire to <lb/>
look over the history of this subject. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WAS DISCUSSED IN ALBERTA.</p> 

<p>I do not hold the same opinions as some <lb/>

<cb/>


gentlemen on this side. I will be per<lb break="no"/>fectly frank. I do not propose to in<lb break="no"/>dulge in recriminations or to descend <lb/>
to the level of personalities, but on <lb/>
this question at least I do not wish to <lb/>
be misinterpreted in endeavoring to <lb/>
arrive at an honest conclusion. As to <lb/>
whether or not provincial autonomy <lb/>
was an issue in the elections of 1898 <lb/>
there may be a difference of opinion. <lb/>
I know nothing of what took place in <lb/>
Saskatchewan, or Eastern or Western <lb/>
Assiniboia, but I do know of the con<lb break="no"/>stituencies surrounding Calgary and <lb/>
up and down the line in Alberta. It <lb/>
was discussed,—the hon. gentleman <lb/>
from Wolseley knows nothing about <lb/>
it, though—it was discussed incidentally <lb/>
by the Attorney General in the city of <lb/>
Calgary. The members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were dealing rather with the <lb/>
record of the Government and giving <lb/>
an account of their stewardship, but in <lb/>
a speech then made the premier point<lb break="no"/>ed out that the time had almost arrived <lb/>
when some great constitutional <lb/>
changes would have to come and it <lb/>
would be necessary to deal with them <lb/>
as men, and in the Speech from the <lb/>
Throne at the opening of the session <lb/>
that followed the general elections it <lb/>
was said we were then 25 years of age <lb/>
and had attained to that large dignity <lb/>
and sense of responsibility that brought <lb/>
with it the necessary of grappling <lb/>
with the question of a provincial con<lb break="no"/>stitution and provincial Government. <lb/>
I will say frankly that in the speeches <lb/>
I made in my constituency. I did as <lb/>
strongly as possible advocate provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy as a relief from the ills <lb/>
from which we were suffering. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now following that up, in the session <lb/>
of 1899 no reference was made in the <lb/>
Speech from the Throne to this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. The question of our future <lb/>
status was not dealt with. A slight <lb/>
reference was made in the budget <lb/>
speech for some relief wherewith to <lb/>
meet our pressing necessities. There <lb/>
were no public utterances by ministers <lb/>
of the crown, but in the fall of 1899 the <lb/>
first minister was in various sections <lb/>
of this country and at Yorkton and <lb/>
Carnduff he gave voice to the senti<lb break="no"/>ment that the time had arrived when <lb/>
representations should be made to the <lb/>
Dominion Government, and pointed out <lb/>
that we had not power to deal with <lb/>
the transportation question or pledge <lb/>
the public credit. From these speeches <lb/>
a certain amount of public opinion be<lb break="no"/>gan to circulate, and people met and <lb/>
discussed them, and I believe that from <lb/>
those speeches a certain large public <lb/>
opinion grew up in relation to this <lb/>
matter. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THE EARLYSTAGES REVIEWED.</p>

<p>When the legislature met in 1900 in <lb/>
the Speech from the Throne the follow <lb/>
ing language was used: <lb/></p> 

<p>"It is gratifying for me to be able to <lb/>
inform you that the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has proposed to Parliament now <lb/>
in session a moderate increase to your <lb/>
annual grant and a large special vote <lb/>
for the purpose of restoring public <lb/>
works destroyed by the floods. In spite <lb/>
of this very substantial increase to the <lb/>
revenue, my Government can only <lb/>
look upon it as affording a temporary <lb/>
and partial amelioration of otherwise <lb/>
impossible financial conditions, and <lb/>
will ask you to take action leading to <lb/>
the earliest practicable solution of <lb/>
Territorial financial and administrative <lb/>
problems." <lb/></p> 

<p>In these words His Honor met the <lb/>
legislature. On May 2, 1900, a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion was passed by the Assembly which <lb/>
called, not for the establishment of <lb/>
provincial institutions in these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, but for certain well defined and <lb/>
positive things to which I will call the <lb/>
attention of the House. Had the first <lb/>
minister asked for power to commit <lb/>
these Territories to the provincial <lb/>
status, then I say that the action he <lb/>
has taken would have been <lb/>
justified, but he did not do so. <lb/></p> 

<p>In the concluding portion of the fif<lb break="no"/>teenth paragraph of that resolution, as <lb/>
printed and published in the speech <lb/>
delivered by the premier on that occa<lb break="no"/>sion, these words will be found: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>His Excellency also be prayed to order en<lb break="no"/>quiries to be made and accounts taken with a <lb/>
view to the settlement of the terms and condi<lb break="no"/>tions upon, which the Territories or any part <lb/>
thereof shall be established as a province,— <lb/></p> 
</quote>
  
<p>and now you will observe that there <lb/>
are a few words in conclusion that call <lb/>
for most careful scrutiny, <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>and that before any such province is established <lb/>
opportunity should be given to the people of the <lb/>
Territories through their accredited representa<lb break="no"/>tives of considering and discussing such terms <lb/>
and conditions. <lb/></p> 
</quote>
  
<p>This resolution the premier moved <lb/>
in a speech of great ability in which he <lb/>
reviewed at great length the history of <lb/>

<cb/>

this country so far as the tenure of <lb/>
lands was concerned. That speech <lb/>
divides itself into two heads. Any <lb/>
gentleman who has read it over care<lb break="no"/>fully will remember that there are two <lb/>
distinct heads: first, that he did not <lb/>
commit himself to a province or pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and desired to eliminate from <lb/>
the discussion all controversial matters. <lb/>
I think that is a perfectly fair state<lb break="no"/>ment of what was done. It was not <lb/>
contentious and did not deal with the <lb/>
question of a province or provinces, <lb/>
and that the people were to be consult<lb break="no"/>ed before a final action was taken. If I <lb/>
understand the English language it <lb/>
must follow that these two are the <lb/>
heads of that speech: first, avoiding <lb/>
all contentious matters, never mining <lb/>
the question of a province or pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and, secondly, there must <lb/>
be a reference to the peoplele <lb/>
or their accredited representa<lb break="no"/>tives before any final action is taken <lb/>
by his Government. I think that is a <lb/>
fair summary of that speech. Turn to <lb/>
page 9 of that speech and you will <lb/>
that I was fearful that the Attorney <lb/>
General might bring in words which <lb/>
would be construed as an expression of <lb/>
opinion as to the number of provinces <lb/>
and that I asked the question: <lb/></p>

 <p>
Mr. Haultain: But this is not the way it is <lb/>
intended, and if it is so taken it is a mistake. <lb/>
However, if it is so I am perfectly willing to do <lb/>
away with the misapprehension by stating <lb/>
frankly that there was no such intention. <lb/></p> 

</quote>
  
  
  
  
<p>I, therefore, took it that the Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General was anxious, that there <lb/>
should be no misapprehension on the <lb/>
part of the country and members as to <lb/>
the impression he intended to convey, <lb/>
that he did not intend this resolution <lb/>
in any way to express his private or <lb/>
public opinion as to how the Territories <lb/>
should be divided. You will find that <lb/>
on page 16 he also makes the same <lb/>
statement practically. He says: "I <lb/>
need hardly dwell again on the neces<lb break="no"/>sity for unanimity. If we are not un<lb break="no"/>animous we are not going to accom<lb break="no"/>plish much. Our individual opinion will <lb/>
not be of much use unless backed up by <lb/>
a strong public opinion. The duty of <lb/>
every member of this House is to de<lb break="no"/>velop that public opinion by discussion <lb/>
and to bring these matters before the <lb/>
people of the country in order to show <lb/>
them that there are large interests at <lb/>
stake, and that they have many claims <lb/>
and rights which it may be they have <lb/>
hitherto not realized, and which can <lb/>
only be established by the fullest en<lb break="no"/>quiry and negotiation. Exaggerated <lb/>
claims may be made, and possibly <lb/>
have been made, but the matters which <lb/>
I have referred to are not matters of <lb/>
fancy or speculation. We have an <lb/>
enormous country with tremendous <lb/>
interests and an almost boundless <lb/>
future. We should not be staggered <lb/>
by the realisation of the splendid <lb/>
heritage we are entitled to but should <lb/>
rather be uplifted and urged on to try <lb/>
to establish these rights and have these <lb/>
claims satisfactorily adjusted." <lb/></p> 

<p>So you see at the close of his speech <lb/>
he said there was nothing controver<lb break="no"/>sial in it and that unanimous consent <lb/>
should be given. <lb/></p> 

<p>As to the second point that the people <lb/>
were to be consulted you will find <lb/>
this: <lb/></p> 

<p>"Afterall, we are not assuming on the <lb/>
part of the people of the Territories, <lb/>
if this resolution is accepted, the right <lb/>
to make an agreement. We are ask<lb break="no"/>ing simply that negotiations should be <lb/>
opened. In fact the most important <lb/>
side of this question at the present <lb/>
time, the most important result, that <lb/>
will follow from this resolution being <lb/>
introduced at this stage, and from the  <lb/>
discussion which may follow it, will <lb/>
be further discussion which wil <lb/>
take place throughout the country. The <lb/>
people of the Territories need to have <lb/>
explained to them what are the actual <lb/>
conditions under which we are work<lb break="no"/>ing and what would be the position <lb/>
under the only further extension we <lb/>
can look forward to." <lb/></p> 

<p>There are other references but I take <lb/>
it that the references I have read es<lb break="no"/>tablish abundantly the summary I <lb/>
have already made. <lb/></p> 

<p>I say further that the people of this <lb/>
country accepted that opinion. I stat<lb break="no"/>ed, and other members stated, that <lb/>
they so understood that resolution as <lb/>
authorizing, directing, instructing the <lb/>
Government to take such steps to deal <lb/>
with this large question. That, I think <lb/>
was the spirit in which the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment itself entered upon the negotia<lb break="no"/>tions, for I find that when <lb/>
they met the House in 1901 they had <lb/>
been unable to arrange a meeting with <lb/>
the Privy Council owing to the elect<lb break="no"/>ors. This excuse was not an unreason<lb break="no"/>able one in view of the circumstances <lb/>
that then prevailed. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WHAT HE EXPECTED.</p> 

<p>I would like to bring the correspon<lb break="no"/>dence of 1901l to the attention of the <lb/>
House for a moment. It was pointed <lb/>
out by this Government that some<lb break="no"/>thing must be done to provide facili<lb break="no"/>ties for the new people coming in. <lb/>
Then we have the answer of the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior suggesting a con<lb break="no"/>ference to consider the question. On <lb/>
March 30th a reply was sent accepting <lb/>
the suggestion. The next step I think <lb/>
the Government had a right to take, <lb/>
but my complaint against the Admin<lb break="no"/>istration commences at this point, and <lb/>
I think it is a fair one. I expected and <lb/>
the country expected, and had a right <lb/>
to expect, that to supplement the res<lb break="no"/>olution passed in 1900 they would have <lb/>
conne and asked for instructions as to <lb/>
what terms they should ask. What <lb/>
might be urged is that I did point out <lb/>
certain demands to be made, and there <lb/>
would not be so much objection to the <lb/>
action of the Government if the hon. <lb/>
gentleman had left out that one point <lb/>
which was controversial, and which <lb/>
has brought about the downfall of <lb/>
these negotiations, and has set back <lb/>
this matter I know not how long. <lb/>
They asked for no instructions from <lb/>
this House as to what they should ask <lb/>
for or do at Ottawa. The House was <lb/>
told there would be a conference in <lb/>
which it was hoped this large question <lb/>
would be dealt with by the first minis<lb break="no"/>ter and his colleague and the Privy <lb/>
Council. and so we have before us the <lb/>
next correspondence of 1902. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">ACTED WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS.</p> 

<p>We find from that correspondence <lb/>
that certain telegrams passed as to the <lb/>
time and place of holding this confer<lb break="no"/>ence and that it was ultimately held. <lb/>
What authority had this legislature <lb/>
given these gentlemen before they <lb/>
went to Ottawa? No man can go and <lb/>

<cb/>

open negotiations without producing <lb/>
his authority, and I take it that the <lb/>
Minister of the Interior, being an <lb/>
astute man, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier <lb/>
and other astute members of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment knew just what the instruc<lb break="no"/>tions of these men were. They were <lb/>
also negotiating and had their instruc<lb break="no"/>tions, powers and privileges, jurisidiction, <lb/>
and they knew to a nicety just what <lb/>
authority the hon. gentlemen had to <lb/>
bind these Territories. Why did they <lb/>
know it? Because they had the mem<lb break="no"/>orial of May, 1900, and the speech of <lb/>
the hon. gentleman in moving it. <lb/>
These documents explain themselves. <lb/>
These gentlemen were limited in <lb/>
their powers: they admitted it <lb/>
when they asked that this <lb/>
memorial be passed. They had <lb/>
 power to deal with the non-controver<lb break="no"/>sial matters. If language means any<lb break="no"/>thing,— and if any gentleman has the <lb/>
ability to use language to make his <lb/>
meaning clear, the hon. gentleman <lb/>
 has,— just what did it convey to the <lb/>
ordinary reader and hearer? That the <lb/>
gentlemen composing this executive, <lb/>
representing this House and country, <lb/>
had authority to enter into negotia<lb break="no"/>tions to have accounts taken and <lb/>
enquiries made and placed before the <lb/>
people of this country. And I chal<lb break="no"/>lenge any hon. gentleman who may <lb/>
follow me to point out in any written <lb/>
document any authority that this <lb/>
House gave no such authority and I <lb/>
defy any person to show it. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman himself was so particular <lb/>
and anxious to avoid any possible con<lb break="no"/>flict of public opinion that he framed <lb/>
his resolution so carefully and said it <lb/>
was a matter of extraordinary diffcul<lb break="no"/>ty to avoid all controversial subjects <lb/>
and deal with the matter as one man. <lb/>
Therefore, I say that this Government <lb/>
had a right to make their demands <lb/>
with relation to the lands, mines, min<lb break="no"/>erals, compensation for alienated lands <lb/>
and for exemptions from taxation, con<lb break="no"/>trol of school lands, and the non-con<lb break="no"/>troversial matters dealt with in the <lb/>
speech and resolution, but they had no <lb/>
power to plunge this country into the <lb/>
step they did, and which the hon. <lb/>
gentleman himself says is a controver<lb break="no"/>sial uestion. I challenge the Attorney <lb/>
General, the Commissioner of Public <lb/>
Works, or any man who supports them <lb/>
to show any authority this House has <lb/>
given to pledge this country to one <lb/>
province. Is it here in any statute <lb/>
books or Journals? Let the men who <lb/>
will tonight stand up and vote yea <lb/>
show where any authority exists in <lb/>
writing, which is the only way it could <lb/>
exist, to say that these great Territor<lb break="no"/>ies should be erected into one province. <lb/>
If they do no it proves my case. <lb/></p> 

<p>If the Government had not come to <lb/>
the House in the first place and asked <lb/>
for express powers the doctrine that <lb/>
they had the power might prevail, but <lb/>
having come and asked for express <lb/>
powers, and those express powers being <lb/>
to deal with non-controversial matters, <lb/>
it follows that there were only two <lb/>
ways in which the other powers could <lb/>
follow, either by an appeal to the coun<lb break="no"/>try or to the legislature. Under our <lb/>
system of Government these were the <lb/>
only ways but they preferred to take. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL WAY.</p> 

<p>They went to the Government of <lb/>
Canada and asked to be made into one <lb/>
province. Sir, had they come to this <lb/>
House and asked for and got that <lb/>
authority by a bare majority of one <lb/>
they would have possesed it and would <lb/>
have been authorised to make the pro<lb break="no"/>position they did. But they did not <lb/>
do it. They went down and said: <lb/>
"We are the people." (Laughter.) The <lb/>
hon. gentleman may think he is the <lb/>
people but there are some few people <lb/>
in Canada who hold the opinion that <lb/>
he is not the people. (Hear, hear). Of <lb/>
course it is very much to be regretted <lb/>
that there are a few people who feel <lb/>
that the hon, gentleman is not the <lb/>
people, but so long as constitutional <lb/>
methods prevail, so long will there he <lb/>
people who hold up their heads and say <lb/>
we do not think Mr. Haultain is the <lb/>
people. (Laughter) <lb/></p> 

<p>It was not necessary for this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to declare for one province to <lb/>
carry on negotiations. They could <lb/>
have laid claim to all the things set up <lb/>
in the draft bill for they are alike com<lb break="no"/>mon to one or two provinces. There<lb break="no"/>fore I submit the argument must <lb/>
be convincing that they had no power <lb/>
to plunge this country into the discus<lb break="no"/>sion of a controversial question, and <lb/>
that in dealing with the question of <lb/>
the lands, mines, etc., they had no <lb/>
need to go into it. That is my position <lb/>
and the documents warrant it. <lb/></p> 

<p>What follows? They did undertake <lb/>
to speak for this country. Now, I hold <lb/>
a different opinion to what some have <lb/>
said. Some have said they no mandate. <lb/>
I think this Government had a man<lb break="no"/>date from this House to open these <lb/>
negotations, We gave them the <lb/>
authority They are the servants of <lb/>
this House: we are the principals. But <lb/>
we gave them no authority to ask for <lb/>
one province. It was not necessary to <lb/>
do so to deal with these non-controver<lb break="no"/>sial matters. They did exceed their <lb/>
authority and have permitted the <lb/>
Dominion Government to take advan<lb break="no"/>tage of them. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">IGNORANT OF FAILURE.</p> 

<p>The little conference took place, <lb/>
they put their views in writing, and <lb/>
sent them to Ottawa enclosing a draft <lb/>
bill. Then certain telegrams followed <lb/>
urging an answer, I do not impute <lb/>
bad faith but I heard two months ago <lb/>
that these negotiations had failed. Yet <lb/>
the premier apparently has been <lb/>
travelling over the country with the <lb/>
Minister of the Interior in his private <lb/>
car— <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> –Pardon time, I never <lb/>
travelled either in a private car or <lb/>
with the Minister of the Interior on a <lb/>
train. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. Bennett</persName> —I withdraw the state<lb break="no"/>ment. But the hon. gentleman meet<lb break="no"/>ing the Minister of the Interior as he <lb/>
did and discussing thes, matters with <lb/>
him must have known something of <lb/>
the minister's mind in dealing with <lb/>
these questions. Do you mean that <lb/>
you can discuss several matters and <lb/>
not get an intimation of what their <lb/>
mind was? On March 27, 1902 we find <lb/>
the Minister of the Interior sending <lb/>
to the first minister of this country: <lb/>
"I presume, however, that you would <lb/>
have gathered our views from the <lb/>
expressions of opinion which took <lb/>
place during our interviews, and our <lb/>
conclusions will not, therefore, I trust <lb/>
come in the way of a surprise." Now, <lb/>
sir, that answer was inadequate and J <lb/>
think the reply sent by the first <lb/>
minister is a rather conclusive reply, <lb/>
and he met every argument fairly, <lb/>
but unfortunately he had no authority <lb/>
to put in the controversial matter. <lb/>
The agent exceeded his authority. The <lb/>
other men new it andsaid we do not <lb/>
know you, consequently there was no <lb/>
bargain. <lb/></p> 

<p>It is a significant thing that while <lb/>
the Attorney General was exercising <lb/>

<cb/>

his mind about this matter the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Public Works did not <lb/>
trouble much about it. All I can point <lb/>
out is the day this reply was sent to <lb/>
Ottawa, the Commissioner of Public <lb/>
Works was in Calgary, and it was, <lb/>
therefore, the reply of the premier, <lb/>
binding his colleague so one would <lb/>
imagine that after all it was <lb/>
not such a surprise. The Minister <lb/>
of the Interior says it will be no sur<lb break="no"/>prise: the Attorney General says it <lb/>
was not only a surprise but a deep dis<lb break="no"/>appointment. I have no opinion to ex<lb break="no"/>press: it is not my business. There <lb/>
exists a very well developed opinion <lb/>
that so far as it being a suprise is con<lb break="no"/>cerned they knew well what the answer <lb/>
would be, and the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior gave them the cold steel by <lb/>
saying it will be no suprise at all <lb/>
(Laughter). I am not expressing my <lb/>
opinion but only stating one I have <lb/>
heard. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">A POLITICAL FOOTBALL.</p> 

<p>There exists another opinion among <lb/>
a large number of people that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of provincial autonomy is only a <lb/>
political football to advance the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of one party. It has been said in <lb/>
public print that it is being used in <lb/>
order to work to the advantage of one <lb/>
set of men over another, and to re<lb break="no"/>dound to the credit of one man belong<lb break="no"/>ing to one great political party. I can<lb break="no"/>not believe that is so. There exists <lb/>
again another opinion that a portion <lb/>
are in favor of annexation to Manitoba. <lb/></p> 

<p>I think I have laid down some good <lb/>
reasons why I am unable to support <lb/>
the resolution of the Attorney General. <lb/>
I regret I cannot support it because <lb/>
upon the records, documents and cor<lb break="no"/>respondence this delegation went to <lb/>
Ottawa and attempted to do what they <lb/>
had no authority to do, and the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion Government took advantage of <lb/>
that. If that draft, bill had passed the <lb/>
Parliament of Canada what chance <lb/>
would the people or the members of <lb/>
this House have had of discussing it? <lb/>
No man can assume to take the reports <lb/>
of Speeches. The Attorney General <lb/>
said the people had a moral right to <lb/>
discuss it, but they have had no chance. <lb/>
Because the Government have under<lb break="no"/>taken to do what they said they would <lb/>
not do they have committed a breach <lb/>
of faith. It is a breach of faith to say <lb/>
on May 2, 1900, that the people have a <lb/>
right to discuss the matter and on Dec. <lb/>
7, 1901, to say that it should be one <lb/>
province. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">ONE PROVINCE NOT EXPEDIENT.</p> 

<p>By this resolution I either vote for <lb/>
one province or I vote that the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion Government can do as they like <lb/>
with the people. As I understand the <lb/>
resolution I believe I have no alterna<lb break="no"/>tive but to say whether I am in favor <lb/>
of one province or two. I would bave <lb/>
wished to avoid doing so. When I <lb/>
came here and saw the copies of this <lb/>
correspondence and resolution I re<lb break="no"/>gretted that this controversial matter <lb/>
of one province or two had been thrown <lb/>
into this Assembly for discussion, but <lb/>
sooner or later every man must give <lb/>
voice to his convictions. The conclu<lb break="no"/>sion I have arrived at may be errone<lb break="no"/>ous and the hon, gentleman's correct: <lb/>
then his judgment is better than mine, <lb/>
but I wish to be distinctly understood <lb/>
as saying that I do not de<lb break="no"/>sire in any way to embar<lb break="no"/>rass the Administration or the <lb/>
carrying on of these negotiations. I <lb/>
have coine to a conclusion from rea<lb break="no"/>sons which the House may consider as <lb/>
wholly inadequate. I trust they will <lb/>
accept my convictions as my honest <lb/>
belief, as much as I do that they have <lb/>
arrived at theirs in the same manner. <lb/>
There has been much said about con<lb break="no"/>sistency. Consistency sometimes <lb/>
means narrowmindedness. A man <lb/>
who retains the saine views for 25 <lb/>
years is a fossil, a Rip Van Winkle. <lb/>
Times come when men must change <lb/>
their opinions. A man may, hold an <lb/>
opinion today which he condemned yes<lb break="no"/>terday. The vice of today is that men <lb/>
hold opinions without study or consid<lb break="no"/>eration. The opinion I have arrived at <lb/>
on this matter, and it may be <lb/>
good or bad, is that it is <lb/>
not expedient that the Territories <lb/>
should be erected into one pro<lb break="no"/>vince. I have given it much consider<lb break="no"/>ation and have arrived at the conclu<lb break="no"/>sion that we cannot in this country at <lb/>
this time commit ourselves to one pro<lb break="no"/>vince without violating the principles <lb/>
upon which this confederation is <lb/>
founded. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WOULD FAVOR ANNEXATION.</p> 

<p>It has been said that I declared my<lb break="no"/>self as supporting the annexation of a <lb/>
portion of the Territories to Manitoba. <lb/>
I never did so, except in the course of a <lb/>
private conversation I said it would be <lb/>
better if Eastern Assiniboia and Man<lb break="no"/>itoba were to come together and the <lb/>
rest of the Territories be erected into <lb/>
one province. I repeat that if Manito<lb break="no"/>ba and Eastern -Assiniboia could unite <lb/>
it would be a happy solution of an <lb/>
intricate question. Much as I would <lb/>
like to see that, not so long as I have a <lb/>
vote or a voice to express my views <lb/>
will I consent to a country being an<lb break="no"/>nexed against its will and put in <lb/>
another province (Hear, hear), and any <lb/>
gentleman who says I ever favored <lb/>
annexation against the wishes of the <lb/>
people of that country does me grev<lb break="no"/>ious wrong, I never said it. Every <lb/>
time I have spoken I have said that <lb/>
the wishes of the people themselves <lb/>
should prevail. It may be that some <lb/>
people have been allured by a solution <lb/>
of the transportation problem, but <lb/>
much as they would appreciate that I <lb/>
believe that the people of Eastern <lb/>
Assiniboia do not desire to become a <lb/>
part of Manitoba, and since they do <lb/>
not we have to consider the question <lb/>
whether these Territories shall become <lb/>
one great province or more than one <lb/>
province. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">VIEW IT AS A CANADIAN.</p> 

<p>I am not going to review the econ<lb break="no"/>omical arguments tonight: the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Yorkton has done that. But I <lb/>
propose to ask the House to consider <lb/>
the matter from a national standpoint. <lb/>
It is said that every man loves his <lb/>
village or country or province or land <lb/>
of adoption, and I yield to none in <lb/>
faith in this great country and its fut<lb break="no"/>ture. But I am a Canadian and al<lb break="no"/>though I do owe my first duty to my <lb/>
community and the land of my adop<lb break="no"/>tion I owe a larger and a greater duty <lb/>
to the great confederation of Canada. <lb/>
The men who framed this confedera<lb break="no"/>tion were inspired with the thought <lb/>
that the various provinces, might live <lb/>
in harmony, and yet I find to the east <lb/>
today there is a little province and the <lb/>
language of this Government has <lb/>
alarmed the people. What has caused <lb/>
the attention of the people all over <lb/>
Canada to be diverted to this question? <lb/>
It is the use of the words "one grand, <lb/>
predominating, overwhelming pro<lb break="no"/>vince." Sir. I would rather be a citizen <lb/>
of two provinces work together in <lb/>
harmony and unity than of one doing <lb/>
violence a to the spirit of confederation: <lb/></p>

<p rendition="simple:centre">(Continued from page 1.)</p>

  <p>Every man must remember that we <lb/>
owe some degree of toleration to other <lb/>
men. No intolerant man ever left his <lb/>
mark on a country. <lb/></p> 

<p>I submit that by reason of the area <lb/>
of 404,000 square miles, the largest of <lb/>
any province in confederation, <lb/>
being formed into one province, there <lb/>
would follow jealousies and friction <lb/>
which would make it impossible for <lb/>
provinces to work together in <lb/>
unity. Let me give you the author<lb break="no"/>ity of a greater than I, Mr. Haultain. <lb/>
In his reply to the Minister of the <lb/>
Interior he said: "With regard to a <lb/>
divergence of opinion as to one or <lb/>
more provinces, I might say that that <lb/>
is a difficulty which will always exist <lb/>
and which any postponement of action <lb/>
will not remove." <lb/></p> 

<p>Then, sir, this House is to be asked <lb/>
to do something to plunge the people <lb/>
into a difference which will always <lb/>
exist. These local differences will <lb/>
become so strong and so insistent by <lb/>
time that they could only result in <lb/>
injury to confederation. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman knows of the resources of <lb/>
the country and that it will contain <lb/>
the wealth producing class. The de<lb break="no"/>velopment of these resources involve <lb/>
the expenditure of large sums of <lb/>
money, and as there were divisions <lb/>
between New Brunswick and Nova <lb/>
Scotia and between Upper and Lower <lb/>
Canada, we would have ultimately <lb/>
that difference of opinion which woudd <lb/>
bring about a division into two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and I submit that in the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of harmony we should pronounce <lb/>
for two provinces and avoid this <lb/>
friction. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">A PREDICTION.</p> 

<p>I have arrived at these conclusions <lb/>
deliberately and although they may <lb/>
wrong I venture this prediction. <lb/>
In so far is the organised districts are <lb/>
concerned, and you may include <lb/>
Athabasca, they will never be directed <lb/>
as one province, and if not in the <lb/>
nature of two provinces that portion <lb/>
to the east will ultimately go to Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. <lb/></p> 

<p>In conclusion I wish to say that I <lb/>
regret as much as the Attorney Gener<lb break="no"/>al that we have a motion on the order <lb/>
paper tonight that will not permit of <lb/>
that unanimity which I would like to <lb/>
see when we approach the Dominion <lb/>
Government. We desire to go upon <lb/>
record on this point and we have in<lb break="no"/>corporated into our amendment a <lb/>
declaration of unanimity with the <lb/>
Government on every non-controver<lb break="no"/>sial matter they introduce. We have <lb/>
met them and declare for everything <lb/>
they ask for, but now that you have <lb/>
introduced this controversial matter <lb/>
we put the responsibility where it <lb/>
belongs by saying that in so far as <lb/>
these matters are concerned we will <lb/>
agree, but in regard to the controver<lb break="no"/>sial matter we have an opinion con<lb break="no"/>trary to yours. <lb/></p> 

<p>There would be no province anyway. <lb/>
now until after the next general <lb/>
election. The Dominion Government <lb/>
has said it will not introduce legislation <lb/>
and this House will have expired and a <lb/>
new House will pass on the matter <lb/>
after receiving direct authority from <lb/>
the people to do so, and they will have <lb/>
an opportunity, of expressing them<lb break="no"/>selves for one or two provinces. There <lb/>
will be that direct mandate from the <lb/>
people which every government should <lb/>
have, and it may be that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment's opinion may prevail, but it does <lb/>
not follow that the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will carry it out. Some say two <lb/>
provinces will mean annexation. Our <lb/>
only safety is to divide into two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. As to the question of extrava<lb break="no"/>gances, I do not propose to deal with it. <lb/>
We should get as much as possible out <lb/>
of the Federal treasury. <lb/></p> 

<p>When the Attorney General moved <lb/>
his resolution in May, 1900, in closing <lb/>
he pointed to that table and said there <lb/>
sat around that table the Fathers of <lb/>
Confederation, and tonight, when the <lb/>
question of the division of the area of <lb/>
these Territories is before us let the <lb/>
ghosts and memories of those great <lb/>
men rise up before us and let their <lb/>
aspirations be with us. It was no local <lb/>
considerations that influenced Tupper, <lb/>
Macdonald, Brown and Tilley. Let us <lb/>
remember this and with a broad mind<lb break="no"/>ed desire to do justice to all men let us <lb/>
ever remember that this country was <lb/>
not given to us pioneers to work out its <lb/>
future for our own ends but as a great <lb/>
inheritance and legislating today we <lb/>
are legislating for posterity. Let us <lb/>
not be influenced by considerations of <lb/>
a great overwhelming, overshadowing <lb/>
province. Let us be national in our <lb/>
aspirations and not sectional in our <lb/>
ambitions. Let us remember that we are <lb/>
are all Canadian subjects of a great <lb/>
sovereign. (Loud cheers.) <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:SIFT2">Mr. A.L. Sifton</persName>, who was received <lb/>
with cheers on raising, followed and <lb/>
said: Before this question finally <lb/>
comes to a vote I would like to address <lb/>
a few words to the House. It is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion that has been of very deep inter<lb break="no"/>est to me for many years. There are <lb/>
some gentlemen throughout the coun<lb break="no"/>try who have been talking about the <lb/>
rights and privileges of this country. I <lb/>
am glad having been interested in this <lb/>
question for such a length of time, that <lb/>
the last remaining doubt has been <lb/>

<cb/>

swept away in reference at least to <lb/>
this one question,— that the time has <lb/>
arrived that it should be settled in <lb/>
some manner. We have at least <lb/>
reached a stage where we can work <lb/>
together in that matter; also in regard <lb/>
to another matter. I have been inter<lb break="no"/>ested for some time as to what was the <lb/>
particular policy upon which the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Opposition in this House <lb/>
would be able to unite. During the <lb/>
somewhat limited time I have been a <lb/>
member of this House it has only been <lb/>
upon a very few occasions they have <lb/>
been able to unite on any question, <lb/>
their numbers varying from three to ten <lb/>
on various questions. I was, therefore, <lb/>
curious as to what policy they would <lb/>
unite on on this great question. I do <lb/>
not wish to consider any member of <lb/>
this House my enemy, but on reading <lb/>
this 2,000 word amendment I was re<lb break="no"/>minded of the saying of Scripture <lb/>
"Oh that my enemy would write a <lb/>
book." (Laughter.) We have here <lb/>
expressed the condensed feelings of <lb/>
the members of the Opposition on this <lb/>
great question. After years of con<lb break="no"/>sideration on the part of some after <lb/>
months some others have taken and <lb/>
in after days some two or three have <lb/>
taken we have this document, and in <lb/>
regard to this matter although the <lb/>
speeches of hon. gentlemen have <lb/>
varied, although all have a different <lb/>
reason for opposing the resolution, <lb/>
they are willing to unite before the <lb/>
House and country on this amendment <lb/>
and to say that although we have done <lb/>
wonderful things in going against the <lb/>
constitutional privileges of Canada, and <lb/>
the Territories in the action we have <lb/>
taken in this matter and committed <lb/>
many transgressions, they are willing <lb/>
to condone everything except the ask<lb break="no"/>ing for one province, while in their <lb/>
amendment they ask for two <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">NO OBJECTION TO THE PROPOSALS.</p> 

<p>I am thankful that we have so much <lb/>
the confidence of the members of the <lb/>
Opposition when they are united. In<lb break="no"/>dividually they have not got that con<lb break="no"/>fidence, but when united they have at <lb/>
least, that much confidence in us to say <lb/>
that we asked for everything this <lb/>
country was entitled to, for there has <lb/>
not been one single objection raised as <lb/>
to the draft bill with reference to ask<lb break="no"/>ing less than the rights of this country <lb/>
and the people of this country are <lb/>
satisfied that the Government, have <lb/>
looked after their interests, and if they <lb/>
were able to get provincial autonomy <lb/>
tonight they would be pleased to get it. <lb/>
on the terms of the bill presented by <lb/>
this Government. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Opposition say the principal <lb/>
objection is that there is no, mandate <lb/>
with reference to the particular matter <lb/>
of the number of provinces. The re<lb break="no"/>solution of May, 1900, certainly did give <lb/>
this Government the right to discuss <lb/>
and negotiate with the Dominion <lb/>
Government. I would like to ask the <lb/>
gentlemen who have spoken to say <lb/>
what we have done that this <lb/>
House did not authorise. They knew <lb/>
they were stating matters that were <lb/>
not of any interest to the people but <lb/>
simply to make some charge. When <lb/>
they could not say anything against <lb/>
the proposals they had to say some<lb break="no"/>thing against the manner in which <lb/>
they were made. They also complain <lb/>
that the negotiations were carried out <lb/>
in secret. A good many people will <lb/>
not blame the Government that they <lb/>
did not take newspaper reporters with <lb/>
them when they went to Ottawa and <lb/>
the conference took place with the <lb/>
ministers of the cabinet, and not the <lb/>
Minister of the Interior. It is not <lb/>
necessary to go over the conversations <lb/>
which took place but the Ottawa <lb/>
ministers did take an interest and did <lb/>
negotiate with the representatives of <lb/>
your Government, notwithstanding <lb/>
their limited authority and no objec<lb break="no"/>tion was made to their authority in <lb/>
regard to that matter. They knew, <lb/>
just as we knew and as the members <lb/>
of this House knew and as the electors <lb/>
knew, that we had no authority to <lb/>
bind this country or House. And we <lb/>
would never do it had we the express <lb/>
authority to bind the people. That <lb/>
was legally, entirely and absolutely <lb/>
under their control and they had abso<lb break="no"/>lute power to consider and settle it <lb/>
without regard to the people of the <lb/>
Territories if they saw fit, but instead <lb/>
of taking that position they treated us <lb/>
with courtesy and said we are willing <lb/>
to discuss it and they did. <lb/></p> 

<p>No absolute answer was given to this <lb/>
Government until that letter arrived <lb/>
the other day. We may have had <lb/>
suspicions as to what they were going <lb/>
to do but they never gave us an answer <lb/>
verbally or otherwise. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">SECRECY CHARGE EXPLODED.</p>

<p>As to the charge of trying to keep <lb/>
this matter secret and doing business <lb/>
behind their backs and trying to de<lb break="no"/>ceive the people. The Government <lb/>
took the only possible action that <lb/>
could be taken to bring it before the <lb/>
attention of the people and House <lb/>
before it could be introduced. This <lb/>
House was summoned in order that it <lb/>
might meet before any bill could pos<lb break="no"/>sibly have become law so that we <lb/>
would be in a position to meet this <lb/>
House and discuss this matter, to ob<lb break="no"/>ject if any members saw fit in regard to <lb/>
any legislation and to express the <lb/>
views of their constituents whether <lb/>
they were members of the Op<lb break="no"/>position or supporters of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and they have the right and <lb/>
would have had the right had any bill <lb/>
been introduced. Parliament is still in <lb/>
session and probably will be after the <lb/>
members of this House have gone home. <lb/>
And that is the reason when we <choice><sic>cal</sic><corr>call</corr></choice> <lb/>
this House, we are told we intended <lb/>
to settle it behind their backs. <lb/>
We did submit a bill to the members <lb/>
of the Dominion Government which in <lb/>
the estimation of the members of this <lb/>
House was in the interest of this coun<lb break="no"/>try. We did it at the request of the <lb/>
council that they might have before <lb/>
them in concrete form the ideas of this <lb/>
Government. It is no secret that I <lb/>
have expressed opinions on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject at various places throughout the <lb/>
country. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PROVINCES FOR EACH AND ALL.</p> 

<p>The question is not so much as to <lb/>
one or two provinces, but to settle it in <lb/>
some form as speedily as possible. <lb/>
The Oppression say the people should <lb/>
have an opportunity of settling in a <lb/>
concrete form the question as to which <lb/>
particular set of ideas as to the shape <lb/>
of the province would suit them best. <lb/>
But that would not satisfy hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Opposition on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. There are some people in East<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

ern Assiniboia who desire an eastern <lb/>
province; there are some people in the <lb/>
neighborhood of Calgary that would <lb/>
like a western province; there are <lb/>
people in Saskatchewan who would <lb/>
like a northern province, and the <lb/>
people of St. Albert would like another <lb/>
northern province. Each one of them <lb/>
can go to his constituents and say we <lb/>
will have a province right here and run <lb/>
it ourselves. One province in the east, <lb/>
one in the west, one in the north, one <lb/>
in the south. Is it that each member <lb/>
can claim: that the policy of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion is the policy of the people? That is <lb/>
the perfectly clear cut proposition that <lb/>
members of the Opposition have. More <lb/>
power to them if they think this ques<lb break="no"/>tion can be settled in that manner and <lb/>
the people deceived. But they say <lb/>
wait until we are elected and then we <lb/>
will say whetherthe provinces are to <lb/>
be east and west or north and south. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">THAT NORTHERN PROVINCE.</p> 

<p>I would gather that the three gentle<lb break="no"/>men living to the north would favor a <lb/>
northern province and the other three <lb/>
would be the other way, but when we <lb/>
consider a division I fear that the three <lb/>
gentlemen, with those who might favor <lb/>
a northern province, have got a little <lb/>
the worse of the matter. I fear that <lb/>
if they try to persuade the people up <lb/>
there to their view they will have a <lb/>
hard time of it, as there are some <lb/>
pretty clever people up there. They <lb/>
will begin to examine the question and <lb/>
will find that the area proposed of 550,<lb break="no"/>000 square miles is to constitute, acc<lb break="no"/>ording to the amendment, two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of approximately equal area. <lb/>
The three districts of Alberta, Assin­ <lb/>
iboia and Saskatchewan as now repres<lb break="no"/>ented consist of 296,000 square miles. <lb/>
Each of these two provinces is to con<lb break="no"/>sist of 275,000 square miles so that the <lb/>
southern province would take 275,000 <lb/>
square miles off of the area of the <lb/>
whole of Assiniboia, the whole of <lb/>
Alberta, the whole of Saskatch<lb break="no"/>ewan and what would it leave? 21,000 <lb/>
square miles of the northern end of <lb/>
Alberta and Saskatchewan to make <lb/>
the northern province. (Cheers) I am <lb/>
afraid that the genius of the members <lb/>
for Yorkton and North Qu'Appelle has <lb/>
been rather too much for the northern <lb/>
men. (Laughter and cheers). 21,000 <lb/>
square miles! When you come to get <lb/>
the long length of that country it <lb/>
stretches out a long way east and west. <lb/>
These hon. gentlemen would have <lb/>
found had they examined the map that <lb/>
Prince Albert. Edmonton and St <lb/>
Albert would be included in the south<lb break="no"/>ern, province, that even the North <lb/>
Saskatchewan river, that even Atha<lb break="no"/>basca Landiug would be included in <lb/>
the southern province (Loud laughter <lb/>
and cheers), and that out of the whole <lb/>
immense territories of Northern <lb/>
Saskatchewan and Northern Alberta. <lb/>
only a little strip four townships wide <lb/>
would be included in that northern <lb/>
province. It would be better almost to <lb/>
take one province for then they would <lb/>
have a little of that, valuable northern <lb/>
country at least in the province and <lb/>
would have their constituents to vote <lb/>
for or against them. (Hear, hear) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WHICH SIZE TO COPY?</p> 

<p>Some attempt to argue that the <lb/>
smaller you make the provinces the <lb/>
better, and even claim that the whole <lb/>
history of Canada and the principles <lb/>
upon which the confederation of these <lb/>
provinces was founded, show that the <lb/>
provinces should be almost one size. <lb/>
One would have imagined that after <lb/>
considering the differences in sizes that <lb/>
already exist such statements would <lb/>
not have been made. The provinces <lb/>
vary from 2,000 square miles in extent <lb/>
to considerably over 200,000 square <lb/>
miles, so one would think that the <lb/>
whole principles of confederation <lb/>
would have been smashed to atoms <lb/>
long ago. The Opposition have not <lb/>
met the question as to which we should <lb/>
copy were we to be confined to any one <lb/>
of them. The province of Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island has been held up as an ex<lb break="no"/>ample by the hon. member for Yorkton <lb/>
and I do not wonder at it in view of the <lb/>
fact that he constituency of Yorkton <lb/>
would nake two Prince Edward <lb/>
Islands. (Laughter) He would not have <lb/>
to come down here any more as the <lb/>
hon. gentleman himself could be lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant governor of one and premier of <lb/>
the other. (Loud laughter.) When we <lb/>
come to size we find that the 404,000 <lb/>
square miles of the Territories would <lb/>
make 202 provinces the size of Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, and if the argument <lb/>
as to economical administration is <lb/>
good as to Prince Edward Island why <lb/>
not have 202?Carry out the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's argument to its legitimate <lb/>
conclusion and we should form <lb/>
these 202 provinces and then <lb/>
our hon. friend from Medicine <lb/>
Hat would have 20 provinces in his con<lb break="no"/>stituency (laughter). He would have <lb/>
a lively time of it advocating 20 pro<lb break="no"/>vinces among his constituents. Some <lb/>
ranchers think that one is more than <lb/>
they want. What was done unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately a good many years ago with <lb/>
reference to Prince Edward Island we <lb/>
have as people of Canada to accept, <lb/>
but we need not repeat such a mistake. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WATCH OUR OWN INTERESTS.</p> 

<p>We have heard a good deal to-night <lb/>
about looking on this question in a <lb/>
broad statesmanlike manner as people <lb/>
of Canada. This is to a certain extent <lb/>
right. We should take an active part <lb/>
with reference to the affairs of Canada. <lb/>
But the Government of Canada and <lb/>
the members of Parliament, are men <lb/>
who can safely be entrusted to look <lb/>
after their side of the bargain, even as <lb/>
the people of Manitoba, can be entrust<lb break="no"/>ed to look after their own interests, <lb/>
and the people of the other provinces <lb/>
to look after their local affairs. This <lb/>
House and Government has been hon<lb break="no"/>ored with the confidence of the people <lb/>
not for the purpose of looking after <lb/>
the interests of Manitoba or Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, but to devote our best <lb/>
time and ability to looking after the <lb/>
Affairs of these Territories, not with <lb/>
reference to the far northern portion <lb/>
or the eastern, western or southern <lb/>
portions, but in reference to the affairs <lb/>
of the whole people of these Territories <lb/>
whenever their interests are involved. <lb/></p> 

<p>Supposing the representatives in <lb/>

<cb/>

this House passed a unanimous resolu<lb break="no"/>tion in favor of one or two provinces <lb/>
would that authorise us to accept it <lb/>
and say the people had no right to pass <lb/>
on it? It is their duty to say whether <lb/>
we have exceeded the jurisdiction repos<lb break="no"/>ed in us and whether in our negotia<lb break="no"/>tions we have neglected a single inter<lb break="no"/>est of the people of this country. How <lb/>
are they going to say it? How in re<lb break="no"/>gard to two provinces? By electing re<lb break="no"/>presentatives in favor of two provinces <lb/>
who do not know where those provinces <lb/>
are going to be? or electing represent<lb break="no"/>atives supporting this Government? <lb/>
or by taking the opinions of the mem<lb break="no"/>ers of Parliament from the North-<lb break="yes"/>West? It is the duty of the Dominion <lb/>
Parliament to come to a conclusion <lb/>
upon this important matter, —import<lb break="no"/>ant not only for us but for the whole <lb/>
Dominion,—with all the evidence they <lb/>
can get from all sources. <lb/></p> 

<p>I hope the Opposition will spread <lb/>
this amendment of theirs broadcast all <lb/>
over the Territories and if they will <lb/>
only guarantee to go along and give <lb/>
the explanations they have given to <lb/>
this House tonight, give their different <lb/>
reasons for their conduct and make <lb/>
their diverse speeches, the members of <lb/>
the Government and the members <lb/>
supporting the Government need have <lb/>
no fear. We would be quite safe in <lb/>
leaving it to the judgement of the <lb/>
electors. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PEOPLE HAVE SELF GOVERNMENT.</p> 

<p>We have been told that we have <lb/>
taken away self-government from the <lb/>
people in the large local improvement <lb/>
districts. It is unfortunate that state<lb break="no"/>ments should be made which are liable <lb/>
to create an impression that this coun<lb break="no"/>try is not a self governing community. <lb/>
The fact that we are here shows that <lb/>
the people of this country are govern<lb break="no"/>ing themselves so far as local matters <lb/>
are concerned and shows that up to <lb/>
the present time the people have had <lb/>
confidence in us, and the fact that the <lb/>
Opposition are not governing the coun<lb break="no"/>try does not show they have not self­<lb break="yes"/>government but that the people have <lb/>
shown a certain annount of discretion <lb/>
in selecting those who will govern <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) <lb/></p> 

<p>As to the statement of Mr.Bennett <lb/>
that the reply sent by Mr. Haultain to <lb/>
the Minister of the Interior was his <lb/>
own reply sent, while the Commissioner <lb/>
of Public Works was in Calgary, Mr. <lb/>
Sifton said he had seen the communi<lb break="no"/>cation and agreed with it before it was <lb/>
sent. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">WOULD ACCEPT OTHER SOLUTIONS.</p>

<p>With reference to the final settle<lb break="no"/>ment of the question of the number of <lb/>
provinces Mr. Sifton said they never <lb/>
would be unanimous. No important <lb/>
question had ever yet been settled by <lb/>
the unanimous opinion of the people <lb/>
and never would be and so long as the <lb/>
people of Canada retained their intel<lb break="no"/>ligence so long would they differ on <lb/>
public questions. Mr. Sifton contin<lb break="no"/>ued: I have expressed an opinion that <lb/>
although I would be prepared to ac<lb break="no"/>cept other solutions, and although, as <lb/>
I told members of the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in council that I would be <lb/>
prepared, as Mr. Haultain told them <lb/>
he would be prepared, to accept a dif<lb break="no"/>ferent solution, our individual opinions <lb/>
were the one province would be to the <lb/>
advantage of the people of this coun<lb break="no"/>try, and we told them then and there <lb/>
that not only now but always would it <lb/>
be impossible to secure an unanimous <lb/>
opinion, and although I am of that <lb/>
opinion yet I do think it is the duty <lb/>
of every member of this House to <lb/>
carefully consider before he casts his <lb/>
vote. And I say that the people who have <lb/>
come to this country, no matter what <lb/>
portion, should seriously consider this <lb/>
question before they vote on the <lb/>
amendment which has been brought <lb/>
in by the Opposition for the first <lb/>
time. <lb/></p>

<p>There has never been any complaint <lb/>
that any legislation has been to benefit <lb/>
one section and to the disadvantage of <lb/>
another, or that the spending of money <lb/>
has not been fairly distributed.It <lb/>
is a very poor argument that the <lb/>
people of the Territories could not <lb/>
agree and get along in regard to <lb/>
these affairs. It is an argument that <lb/>
will not appeal to the people. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">OPPOSITION AMBITIONS.</p> 

<p>Although the Opposition talk about <lb/>
national considerations and look at the <lb/>
rights of other provinces and never <lb/>
mind our own, they all want the pro<lb break="no"/>vince nearest to themselves. It would <lb/>
prevent quarreling because it would <lb/>
separate them one from the other. <lb/>
They have had experience and know <lb/>
they are not safe together. (Laughter <lb/>
and cheers.) Again they say: "These <lb/>
two provinces will be quite large <lb/>
enough to satisfy all aspirations and <lb/>
ambitions of their inhabitants." <lb/>
(Laughter.) That ought to satisfy the <lb/>
people of these Territories that we will <lb/>
have the ambitions and aspirations of <lb/>
these gentlemen satisfied. In order <lb/>
to do that, however, we will have to <lb/>
have four provinces as we cannot have <lb/>
four premiers in one province. The <lb/>
eastern and western might go to the <lb/>
members foe Yorkton and West Cal<lb break="no"/>gary and the northern and southern <lb/>
to the members for St. Albert and <lb/>
North Qu'Appelle. We would have <lb/>
have these four provinces to satisfy the <lb/>
reasonable ambitions of the inhabit<lb break="no"/>ants (Laughter.) We do not need to <lb/>
bring to the people of the Territories <lb/>
the fact that we cannot agree and live <lb/>
amicably together. <lb/></p>
  
  <p rendition="simple:centre">SETTLE IT FOR ALL TIME.</p> 

<p>When the question is settled it will <lb/>
probably be settled for all time to <lb/>
come. The statement has been made <lb/>
that we should have a sort of tempor<lb break="no"/>ary province and take what we can <lb/>
get. They say, have the Territories <lb/>
created into one province or provinces <lb/>
and then go down and fight for better <lb/>
terms year after year: other provinces <lb/>
have done it. Yes, those little pro<lb break="no"/>vinces by the sea have had an interest<lb break="no"/>ing time in the past. It has been the <lb/>
case of one government after another, <lb/>
as in Manitoba, to win election after <lb/>
election on the cry that they were <lb/>
going to get better terms from the <lb/>
Dominion for the local Government. <lb/>
This is the policy of the Opposition <lb/>
would like get a province and then <lb/>
keep on fighting and fight year after <lb/>
year. That is not the policy of this <lb/>
Government and not the policy I hope <lb/>
will be adopted by the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I hope it will be settled on <lb/>
terms equal to those of the great pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Ontario and Quebec. We <lb/>
have asked for nothing less and so far <lb/>
as we are concerned we are willing to <lb/>

<cb/>

accept nothing less than has been <lb/>
granted to those provinces. (Hear <lb/>
hear) Those provinces have got better <lb/>
terms by holding up the Dominion <lb/>
Government but is that the kind of <lb/>
policy that will appeal to the people <lb/>
who settle here? We can better afford <lb/>
to suffer for a few years longer the <lb/>
privations some people have suffered <lb/>
and continue our campaign and see <lb/>
that the question is settled on terms <lb/>
that will be of ultimate benefit to this <lb/>
country and not on terms that we will <lb/>
have to be continually fighting for <lb/>
year after year. That is the policy we <lb/>
advocate, that when this matter is <lb/>
settled it shall be for all time to come <lb/>
so that we shall be prepared to settle <lb/>
down and do the work of this province <lb/>
for the benefit of the country, not in <lb/>
fighting for better terms but in legis<lb break="no"/>lating fro the people and endeavoring <lb/>
to build up a province that will be the <lb/>
pride, not only of the people here but <lb/>
of Canada and of all the provinces: <lb/>
that in time to come the people of all <lb/>
the provinces will be proud that they <lb/>
have a province here second to none, <lb/>
not endeavoring to exercise a pre<lb break="no"/>eminent place in Canada, but taking <lb/>
the position that the members of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment who will be elected from here <lb/>
in time to come will demand for her. <lb/></p> 

<p>I hope the members will consider <lb/>
this question seriously, not from the <lb/>
standpoint of any particular town <lb/>
which might desire to be the capital, <lb/>
or of a district that desire to be a <choice><sic>prov<lb break="no"/>vince</sic><corr>province</corr></choice>, or of a man who might desire to <lb/>
be a premier; but froma broad point <lb/>
of view to build up a country such as <lb/>
no other country on the face of the <lb/>
globe ever had. (Loud cheers.) <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:MCDO10">Mr. D. H. McDonald</persName>, leader of the <lb/>
Opposition followed Mr. Sifton in <lb/>
the debate on provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy, and took up a line of argu<lb break="no"/>ment similar to that followed <lb/>
by previous Opposition speakers. He <lb/>
declared theOpposition to be in favor <lb/>
of provincial autonomy but not in favor <lb/>
of having certain terms put upon the <lb/>
people unless those terms received the <lb/>
consent and approval of the people. <lb/>
The premier by introducing a contro<lb break="no"/>versial matter into the negotiations, <lb/>
had to a certain extent deceived the <lb/>
members of the House. As to the <lb/>
Sifton banquet at Prince Albert Mr. <lb/>
McDonald said that the Commissioner <lb/>
of Public Works knew full well that <lb/>
the people of that country were unani<lb break="no"/>mously in favor of two provinces and <lb/>
consequently he failed to express the <lb/>
opinion of the Government or himself <lb/>
on the question then before the House. <lb/></p> 

<p>The speaker refuted the idea that <lb/>
the members of the Opposition wanted <lb/>
two provinces in order that they might <lb/>
hold office. The firmly believed that <lb/>
it was for the best interests of Canada <lb/>
that there should be two provinces. If <lb/>
the policy of advocating one province <lb/>
was persisted in it would drive a large <lb/>
portion of Eastern Assiniboia into <lb/>
Manitoba. The Opposition desired <lb/>
that those people should remain in the <lb/>
Territories as long as they desired <lb/>
to do so. It was a mistake to think <lb/>
that any large number of people were <lb/>
agitating for annexation to Manitoba. <lb/>
They had not so declared themselves pub<lb break="no"/>licly and had on no occasion expressed <lb/>
themselves as desirous of joining Man<lb break="no"/>itoba. There might be a certain am<lb break="no"/>ount of feeling that the people of Man<lb break="no"/>itoba were in a better position to carry <lb/>
out their wheat. This was a fact and <lb/>
it was largely due to the inactivity of <lb/>
the present Territorial Government in <lb/>
pressing for the construction of rail<lb break="no"/>ways in this country. <lb/></p> 

<p>It was well that the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had seen that there was a div<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

ergency of opinion as to one or more <lb/>
provinces as it was possible that other<lb break="no"/>wise the terms submitted by the local <lb/>
Government might have been forced <lb/>
on the people of the Territories. There <lb/>
was even now some jealousy in some <lb/>
provinces that other provinces had too <lb/>
much influence and was it advisable <lb/>
that they should stir up that unfriend<lb break="no"/>ly feeling which might lead to a still <lb/>
worse feeling? The only question be<lb break="no"/>fore the House was whether the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories should be formed into one or <lb/>
two provinces. The Opposition laid be<lb break="no"/>fore the House their views in favor of <lb/>
two provinces and on those views they <lb/>
were prepared to go to the country and <lb/>
on them they asked that the vote be <lb/>
taken. (Cheers) <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:BROW6">Mr. G. W. Brown</persName> followed. He did <lb/>
not propose to take up much of the <lb/>
time of the House at that <lb/>
hour, and while he did not impute the <lb/>
motive for a number of provinces to <lb/>
be that the political ambitions of hon. <lb/>
gentlemen opposite might be satisfied, <lb/>
he would congratulate their leader on <lb/>
the manner in which he distributed <lb/>
amongst his followers the work which <lb/>
generally fell to the leader himself. <lb/></p> 

<p>In view of the fact that, while the <lb/>
leader of the Opposition was complain<lb break="no"/>ing that the Government had not ac<lb break="no"/>complished more with reference to this <lb/>
important subject, the member for <lb/>
West Calgary was speaking of steam <lb/>
boiler inspection, etc., and forgetting <lb/>
entirely the great question his leader <lb/>
was trying to impress on the House, <lb/>
the people must come to the conclu<lb break="no"/>sion that so far as they were concerned <lb/>
there had been no great deal of atten<lb break="no"/>tion given to what the policy of the <lb/>
Opposition should be. They had the <lb/>
humble confession of the leader of the <lb/>
Opposition that for two years he had <lb/>
expressed no opinion on it. Then after <lb/>
the member for West Calgary had de<lb break="no"/>voted his time to his private affairs <lb/>
and the hon. member for Yorkton had <lb/>
time to make up his mind, the House and <lb/>
 public had that wonderful document — <lb/>
 the, amendment. Just imagine those <lb/>
hon. gentlemen who had expressed <lb/>
such divergent opinions at so late a <lb/>
date, within 2 hours formulating a <lb/>
policy for the people and coming down <lb/>
here to ask fro a short respite to pro<lb break="no"/>duce that document. (Laughter.) <lb/>
There was no agreement among them <lb/>
yet. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">DR. PATRICK'S UNUSUAL POSITION.</p> 

<p>Talk about the Government exceed<lb break="no"/>ing their duties and introducing a <lb/>
question which did not belong in the <lb/>
negotiations. When the estimates were <lb/>
being voted in a previous year had not <lb/>
the member for Yorkton asked if there <lb/>

<cb/>

was sufficient money to call a special <lb/>
Session and pay for a deputation to go to <lb/>
Ottawa? He knew last year the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were going to Ottawa to treat <lb/>
with reference to this question exactly <lb/>
as they did treat with it. Knowing <lb/>
this, and that the House could be call<lb break="no"/>ed together, he obtained a specific <lb/>
promise from the leader of the House <lb/>
that there would be funds enough to <lb/>
bring the House together, and then he <lb/>
came there to-day and said that the <lb/>
Government had no mandate. This <lb/>
was a very unusual position to take. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. gentleman opposite declared <lb/>
for two provinces but claimed it was <lb/>
not necessary to say what they should <lb/>
be. The hon. member for West Cal<lb break="no"/>gary had said that New Brunswick and <lb/>
Nova Scotia could not agree, neither <lb/>
could Ontario and Quebec, and that <lb/>
the same state of affairs would exist <lb/>
out here. If the hon. gentleman was <lb/>
any exponent of the views of the <lb/>
people he represented then he (Brown) <lb/>
would like to know if these people <lb/>
were going to be linked in with eastern <lb/>
and western Assiniboia. The realreason <lb/>
for not stating where these provinces <lb/>
should be was given by one hon, mem<lb break="no"/>ber when he explained they wished to <lb/>
be in a position to change front when<lb break="no"/>ever they liked. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">AN ANNEXATION ARGUMENT.</p> 

<p>As to the cost of governing small <lb/>
provinces Mr. Brown pointed out that <lb/>
Prince Edward Island was running <lb/>
behind and getting deeper in the hole <lb/>
all the time. The claim for two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces instead of being a reason for not <lb/>
annexing a portion to Manitoba was <lb/>
an argument in favor of it. It was the <lb/>
Opposition who were suggesting it and <lb/>
the Dominion Government might say <lb/>
if there is too much for one province <lb/>
then we will give a portion to Manito<lb break="no"/>ba and make the balance into one <lb/>
province. <lb/></p> 

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Brown said the <lb/>
smaller province had all the rights and <lb/>
privileges of the larger provinces but <lb/>
they had not the ability to undertake <lb/>
large schemes for the benefit and wel<lb break="no"/>fare of the people which the larger <lb/>

  <!-- IC, 2018-10-30, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

<!--<p>WEDNESDAY, April 9th. <lb/></p> 

<p>Speaker Eakin took the chair at half <lb/>
past two. Mr. A. B. Gillis, chairman <lb/>
of the committee on standing orders <lb/>
reported in favor of a petition for <lb/>
incorporating the Red Deer Memorial <lb/>
hospital. <lb/></p> 

<p>Premier Haultain in reply to Mr. <lb/>
Villeneuve said that the permits for <lb/>
the sale of liquor in the organized <lb/>
Territories and the amounts received <lb/>
were as follows: 1899 (84) $253; 1900 <lb/>
(72) $179; 1901 (142) $325; 1902 to April <lb/>
8 (54) $143. <lb/></p> 

<p>Premier Haultain in answer to Mr. <lb/>
Villeneuve said no members of the edu<lb break="no"/>cational council had been appointed <lb/>
since the last meeting of the assembly. <lb/>
The government did intend to make <lb/>
such appointments but he could not <lb/>
exactly say when. <lb/></p> 

<p>Hon. A. L. Sifton in reply to Mr. C. <lb/>
Fisher said that 2,740 quarter sections <lb/>
in Batoche electoral district had been <lb/>
included in Prince Albert's local im-<lb break="maybe"/></p>

<milestone type="unknown"/> <lb/>
 <lb/>

<p>provement district but neither the hon. <lb/>
member nor any one else was consulted <lb/>
in the matter. <lb/></p> 

<p>MR. A. E. CROSS. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. A. E. Cross (East Calgary) re<lb break="no"/>sumed the debate on provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy. He was thoroughly in accord <lb/>
with Mr. Haultain's motion expressing <lb/>
regret that the Dominion Government <lb/>
had not agreed to pass legislation giv<lb break="no"/>ing the Territories provincial establish<lb break="no"/>ment. The amendment was a sort of <lb/>
snap-shot, want of confidence in the <lb/>
Government. It was not his intention <lb/>
to vote for two provinces till he knew <lb/>
where they were to be, and he would <lb/>
rather vote for one province than for <lb/>
two if they were to be divided up into <lb/>
northern and southern provinces. If, <lb/>
as stated, they were to be divided more <lb/>
or less equally in area it would place <lb/>
the northern province in a most ridic<lb break="no"/>ulous light. He did not think anybody <lb/>
would vote for it. If they threw off <lb/>
the northern part which was not popu<lb break="no"/>lated and then divided the remainder <lb/>
there would be a province consisting <lb/>
of a long thin line along the interna<lb break="no"/>tional boundary largely populated with <lb/>
people from the United States and <lb/>
coming in with agressive ideas and <lb/>
looking down more or less on our <lb/>
country. He had lived in the United <lb/>
States and knew something of their <lb/>
ideas and if the House invited that con<lb break="no"/>dition of affairs they were not only do<lb break="no"/>ing a wrong to the country but a great <lb/>
injustice to every man in it. By intro<lb break="no"/>ducing that long thin province they <lb/>
would create a wedge of discord right <lb/>
in the heart of Western Canada, and <lb/>
in the future these people might make <lb/>
a demand on Ottawa which was unrea<lb break="no"/>sonable and could not be granted. <lb/>
There would follow an agitation and <lb/>
an appeal to Washington and the first <lb/>
thing they knew they would have an <lb/>
international question on their hands. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Cross said he was in favor of two <lb/>
provinces and would go further and <lb/>
state where they should be, which was <lb/>
more than members of the Opposition <lb/>
had courage to do. He believed in <lb/>
an eastern and western province. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Bennett—Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Cross—They should be divided <lb/>
almost equally in area and I do not <lb/>
think any controversial, questions <lb/>
should arise if they are so divided. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Bennett Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Cross said the western province <lb/>
would find its best market in the west, <lb/>
while the eastern province would be <lb/>
contributary to the east, as the chief <lb/>
product, wheat went to the seaboard. <lb/></p> 

<p>As far as the area of two provinces <lb/>
was concerned Mr. Cross claimed it <lb/>
was not fair to make comparisons <lb/>
with other provinces where, much of <lb/>
the land would support neither man <lb/>
nor animal, whereas the Territories <lb/>
was composed of arable land capable <lb/>
of producing all kinds of agricultural <lb/>
products and live stock. Consequently <lb/>
they would be in a position to support <lb/>
a very much larger population than <lb/>
the other provinces, and if they were <lb/>
divided into two provinces they would <lb/>
eventually be larger provinces, than <lb/>
any in the Douminion. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
He had that much conſidence in the <lb/>
west. (Hear, hear.) The outcome <lb/>
would be the formation of the greatest <lb/>
and most powerful provinces with the <lb/>
people in the front rank. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
He, therefore, regretted that the <lb/>
amendment had not come before the <lb/>
people in a reasonable and fair way so <lb/>
that honest and intelligent people <lb/>
could judge for themselves and say <lb/>
they either had confidence in the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition or they had not. The amend<lb break="no"/>ment was really no amendment at all, <lb/>
but in fact a motion. He was perfect<lb break="no"/>ly in accord with Mr. Haultain's <lb/>
motion and could not vote for the <lb/>
amendment even if it came up as a <lb/>
motion. <lb/></p> 

<p>MR. ANNABLE'S POLICY. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. G. M. Annable (MooseJaw) <lb/>
claimed that a majority of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment supporters were in favor of two <lb/>
provinces. He had taken an independ<lb break="no"/>ent stand in the House voting with <lb/>
one side as much as the other. He <lb/>
congratulated the Opposition on gett<lb break="no"/>ing out a platform on one plank of <lb/>
which he could stand. He was in favor <lb/>
of two provinces, and when they were <lb/>
formed he thought the boundary lines <lb/>
would be in sympathy with the ideas <lb/>
of the member from East Calgary. <lb/></p> 

<p>Dealing with the negotiations car<lb break="no"/>ried on by the local Government, Mr. <lb/>
Annable said: "If I was a member of <lb/>
that Government I would give the <lb/>
Dominion Government 30 days to grant <lb/>
our demands. I would say I <lb/>
want this subsidy or I will resign and <lb/>
you can run the show." (Hear, hear', <lb/>
and cheers.) Continuing he said no<lb break="no"/>body knew better than the Dominion <lb/>
Government, the extent of the influx of <lb/>
immigration into this country and yet <lb/>
the local Government was expected to <lb/>
build roads, bridges, schools, etc., and <lb/>
make these people happy on $300,000 a <lb/>
year. If the local Government would <lb/>
give the Dominion Government 30 days <lb/>
notice and then resign iſ their request <lb/>
was not acceded to they need not be <lb/>
afraid that the lieutenant governor <lb/>
would call on any three other men to <lb/>
form a Government because they could <lb/>
not be elected. (Laughter). These <lb/>
were not hard times and the Dominion <lb/>
Government did not know what to do <lb/>
with their money. (Laughter.) <lb/></p> 

<p>MR. A. S. ROSENROLL. <lb/></p> 

<p>was the next speaker. The question <lb/>
of one or two provinces had found <lb/>
their fullest expression. The hon. <lb/>
member for Yorkton had not quite <lb/>
proved his case as to the cost of ad<lb break="no"/>iministering large and small provinces. <lb/>
He (Rosenroll) had had a little experi<lb break="no"/>ence himself last summer. For a few <lb/>
months he had to keep up two house<lb break="no"/>holds as his wife and faimily were in <lb/>
one province, while he had to keep up <lb/>
his house at his place of business at <lb/>
Wetaskiwin. Two governments, he <lb/>
declared, were twice as expensive as <lb/>
one. That was as clear as that twice <lb/>
two makes four. The world was get­ <lb/>
ting smaller and distances shorter all <lb/>
the time, and government of a large <lb/>
area was much easier and more econo<lb break="no"/>mical in Canada, now than twenty <lb/>
years ago. The tendency all over the <lb/>
world was for combination in the poli<lb break="no"/>tical as well as the commercial world. <lb/>
The smaller nations of Europe had <lb/>
been wielded together into large and <lb/>
powerful nations such as Germany and <lb/>
taly. In all branches of human acti<lb break="no"/>vity instead of dividing forces people <lb/>
were uniting them. The people of the <lb/>
Territories should conform to the spirit <lb/>
of the times and unite and have one <lb/>
great, prosperous province. <lb/></p> 

<p>Another objection to two provinces <lb/>
would be the obstacles thus placed in <lb/>
the way of professional men. Why <lb/>
build a Chinese wall hetween two sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the country. So far they <lb/>
had grown up together under the same <lb/>
institutions and they formed a national <lb/>
character peculiar to the North-West. <lb/>
Still another reason was that as one <lb/>
province they would assimilate <lb/>

<cb/>

foreign races such as the Galicians and <lb/>
Doukhobors more easily. These people <lb/>
were enjoying privileges unknown to <lb/>
them before they came to Canada; <lb/>
they were poor in there own land as <lb/>
our grandparents were here; they were <lb/>
becoming prosperous and would make <lb/>
good patriotic citizens but the process <lb/>
of assimilation would be more rapid <lb/>
in one province. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Minister of the Interior had <lb/>
stated at a public meeting in Winni<lb break="no"/>peg that it was not desirable to increase <lb/>
the present number of provinces. The <lb/>
hon. member for Yorkton only as late <lb/>
as last year was in favor of the ex<lb break="no"/>tension of Manitoba's boundaries and <lb/>
justified his contention by a lengthy <lb/>
speech. It had been said that one great <lb/>
overshadowing province would be a <lb/>
future danger to confederation. What <lb/>
did that mean? It meant that if there <lb/>
existed no danger of annexation that <lb/>
danger had since been created by the <lb/>
arguments of the gentlemen on the op<lb break="no"/>posite side of the house. <lb/></p> 

<p>Dr. Patrick explained that he did not <lb/>
advocate the extension of Manitoba <lb/>
westward. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Rosenroll—I did not say north<lb break="no"/>ward or westward. The facts are that <lb/>
he practically said that Manitoba, was <lb/>
too small a province. He admitted <lb/>
that it should be made larger. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Haultain—But he was willing to <lb/>
state the boundaries. (Laughter) <lb/></p> 

<p>MR. J. B. SHERA. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. J. B. Shera (Victorial contented <lb/>
that the motion did not mean that they <lb/>
should have been made into, one pro<lb break="no"/>vince, but that they regretted that the <lb/>
Dominion Government had not grant<lb break="no"/>ed provincial institutions. He regret<lb break="no"/>ted that and he thought the people did, <lb/>
and taking that ground he was willing <lb/>
to support the resolution. He believed <lb/>
it was nothing more than right and he <lb/>
did so conscientiously. He might <lb/>
suffer for it as the people in the north<lb break="no"/>ern country were in favor of two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>SOUTH REGINA'S REPRESENTATIVE. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. J. B. Hawkes (South Regina) <lb/>
said he was in favor of one province. <lb/>
Some people said the time had not <lb/>
yet arrived when the Territories should <lb/>
come into provincial rights but he <lb/>
claimed the time had fully arrived and <lb/>
the sooner they were formed into a <lb/>
province the better it would be for all <lb/>
parties concerned. They had also <lb/>
heard that the Government had no <lb/>
mandate to go to Ottawa and treat <lb/>
to form a province. He did not look <lb/>
at it in that way. The Government <lb/>
had started to bring the matter as <lb/>
near it as possible before consulting <lb/>
the House so that if the Dominion <lb/>
Government was willing to grant their <lb/>
request the House would be in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to close the bargain. He could <lb/>
see no reason why they could not get <lb/>
along as one province quite as well as <lb/>
two and it could be managed just as <lb/>
economically. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Hawkes referred to Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Leod's Prince Albert speech in which <lb/>
that gentleman claimed the Opposition <lb/>
were working together to hold this <lb/>
matter in abeyance. The speaker said <lb/>
that while he had belonged to that <lb/>
Opposition no man could say that he <lb/>
ever, endeavored to hold the question <lb/>
in abeyance. The sooner they got <lb/>
provincial autonomy the better. Quot<lb break="no"/>ing further from Mr. McLeod's speech <lb/>
in which that gentleman was reported <lb/>
to have said he was satisfied the <lb/>
Dominion Government would not <lb/>
grant autonomy for some years and <lb/>
that they were better as they were, <lb/>
Mr Hawkes said he thought the hon. <lb/>
gentleman did not know what he was <lb/>
talking about. With the very worst <lb/>
terms they could possibly get they would <lb/>
be better than they were today. If they <lb/>
were made into a province today they <lb/>
would have a better chance to develop <lb/>
the resources of the country. Pioneers <lb/>
were now paying for all the improve<lb break="no"/>ments while in a province the pay<lb break="no"/>ments would be extended over many <lb/>
years; they could fix the country up <lb/>
and newcomers would pay their share <lb/>
of the burden. It was a well known <lb/>
fact that the Government had not the <lb/>
money to do necessary work. He had <lb/>
asked for work to be done which he felt <lb/>
sure would have been done if the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Publie Works had had the <lb/>
money at his disposal. <lb/></p> 

<p>A contented settler, Mr. Hawkes <lb/>
claimed, was the best possible immigra<lb break="no"/>tion agent. It was therefore of the <lb/>
utmost importance that the Terri<lb break="no"/>ories should be formed into a province <lb/>
and thus be able to build roads and <lb/>
bridges, carrying on tests for water, <lb/>
and develop the resources of the <lb/>
country. <lb/></p> 

<p>PROUDOF THE GOVERNMENT . <lb/></p> 

<p>He believed the Government were <lb/>
working not for the interests of <lb/>
Regina, Calgary, Macleod, but for the <lb/>
Territories as a whole. Did the pro<lb break="no"/>position it sent Ottawa sound as if it <lb/>
had no interest in the country or its <lb/>
development? It did not. Every <lb/>
member supporting the Government <lb/>
should be proud of the position it had <lb/>
taken and he was very proud of it, and <lb/>
he felt sure every member would regret <lb/>
the way in which the Government had <lb/>
been treated. The Opposition had <lb/>
formulated their policy and he could <lb/>
follow them no longer. (Cheers.) He <lb/>
would give the Government all the <lb/>
support he could give them until their <lb/>
policy of one province was carried out. <lb/>
(Cheers) <lb/></p> 

<p>Dr. De Veber (Lethbridge) supported <lb/>
the resolution. Although it did not <lb/>
declare for one province he was in <lb/>
favor of one province. Some of the <lb/>
arguments advanced against one pro<lb break="no"/>vince were very poor, and the argu<lb break="no"/>ment that the larger the province the <lb/>
more it cost per capita would not ap<lb break="no"/>peal to anyone of sense. <lb/></p> 

<p>MR. R. S. LAKE. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. R. S. Lake (Grenfell) expressed <lb/>
his approval of the proposal of the exe<lb break="no"/>cutive. The opposition were unani<lb break="no"/>mous in favor of the recital of the <lb/>
motion , but they were nearly all at <lb/>
variance as to the motion itself. For <lb/>
his own part, however, the motion <lb/>
was very simple. It was merely a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of regret that legislation of some <lb/>
kind was not introduced into the <lb/>
Dominion parliament and he could not <lb/>
see why the opposition even holding <lb/>
the views they did, could not vote for <lb/>
the motion. Coming to the reasons <lb/>
given by the Minister of the Interior <lb/>
for postponing the question, he said <lb/>
that if the population was too sparse <lb/>
for one province, surely it was too <lb/>
sparse for two provinces. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
It was evident when the conference <lb/>
was arranged, that the Dominion <lb/>
government meant business, but some­ <lb/>
thing had evidently happened, he did <lb/>
not know what, which had changed <lb/>
that intention. He concluded by ex<lb break="no"/>pressing his approval of the actions and <lb/>
methods of the executive and said it <lb/>
would be inconsistent with the federal <lb/>
principle if the new province was not <lb/>
treated on an equal plane with the <lb/>
older provinces. Otherwise confedera<lb break="no"/>tion would totter and fall to the <lb/>

<cb/>

ground. He was a one province man <lb/>
on the principle that union is strength, <lb/>
and as one province they could work <lb/>
out the solution of the transportation <lb/>
problem so much more easily. The <lb/>
varied climate and resources of the <lb/>
several districts might be an argument <lb/>
against, but there were many good rea<lb break="no"/>sons favoring one large province. He <lb/>
was opposed to annexation with Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. <lb/></p> 

<p>CAPTAIN MEYERS. <lb/></p> 

<p>Capt. Meyers (Kinistino) opposed the <lb/>
amendment. Some of the people to <lb/>
the north wanted two provinces with <lb/>
the dividing line between Assiniboia <lb/>
and Saskatchewan from Manitoba to <lb/>
British Columbia. He ridiculed the <lb/>
idea of carrying the boundary line so <lb/>
far north as the northern boundary of <lb/>
British Columbia, which would further <lb/>
carry the dividing line some hundreds <lb/>
of miles north. If the proposed boun<lb break="no"/>daries were clearly defined he might <lb/>
have seen his way clear to support the <lb/>
amendment, but as it was he must say <lb/>
he had greater faith in one province <lb/>
although it might be large than in two <lb/>
provinces with uncertain boundaries. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. M'CAULEY. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. M. McCauley thought the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was not so much one of one pro<lb break="no"/>vince or two provinces, as a question of <lb/>
terms, Edmonton and IPrince Albert <lb/>
Boards of Trade had passed resolutions <lb/>
in favor of a northern and southern <lb/>
province, but obviously they had been <lb/>
influenced by the question of capital. <lb/>
Such resolutions were a little previous, <lb/>
and he thought the real question was <lb/>
one of terms. Personally he was in <lb/>
favor of one province, on the score of <lb/>
economy. <lb/></p> 

<p>MR. FISHER. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. C. Fisher said that he had al<lb break="no"/>ways been a one-province man, but <lb/>
seeing that the Dominion Government <lb/>
had refused, and had postponed the <lb/>
question for two years, he should, <lb/>
when that time elapsed, be prepared to <lb/>
vote for two provinces. If, however, <lb/>
there were to be a northern and a <lb/>
southern province, he would like to <lb/>
know how they were to be divided. <lb/>
He joined, however, in the expression <lb/>
of regret in the resolution, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, he should support it. <lb/></p> 

<p>MR.M'DIARMID. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. McDiarmid believed that the <lb/>
time was not ripe for provincial auton<lb break="no"/>nomy, but when it did come, he was a <lb/>
one-province man. <lb/></p> 

<p>MR. CONNELL. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. J. W. Connell considered that <lb/>
