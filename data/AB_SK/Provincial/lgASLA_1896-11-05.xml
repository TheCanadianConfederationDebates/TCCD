    Present Shortage of Moneys.</head>
    
    <p>The following is the Memorial to the <lb/>
      Governor-General in Council, adopted by <lb/>
      the <supplied><persName ref="pers:ANON1">Assembly</persName></supplied>, and which gave rise to the <lb/>
      "secession" debate which will be pub<lb break="no"/>lished later:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Legislature Assembly begs leave to <lb/>
      present to Your Excellency a statement <lb/>
      of their constitutional and financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion, and to suggest such amendments in <lb/>
      the North-West Territorial Act and other <lb/>
      Acts affecting the Territories and such in<lb break="no"/>crease in their grant or subsidy, as will <lb/>
      enable them to fulfil the duties they are <lb/>
      called upon to perform for the proper <lb/>
      government of the North-West Territo<lb break="no"/>ries in local matters. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      They beg to remind you that at various <lb/>
      times petitions and memorials on these and <lb/>
      kindred subjects have been sent down to <lb/>
      Your Excellency, or to one or more of <lb/>
      your advisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are glad to say that the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada has been willing partly to <lb/>
      accede from time to time to some of their <lb/>
      just requests, so that at present they exer<lb break="no"/>cise control over certain funds put at the <lb/>
      disposal of the Lieutenant Governor of the <lb/>
      Territories, and have larger powers of <lb/>
      legislation; but they find that they are <lb/>
      not in a position to use the limited powers <lb/>
      they do possess to the best advantage, and <lb/>
      that their legislation on subjects coming <lb/>
      strictly within the duties of the Territorial <lb/>
      Assembly has not the necessary quality of <lb/>
      security or completeness. As, besides the <lb/>
      right of dissallowance which Your Excel<lb break="no"/>lency in Council possesses over their legis<lb break="no"/>lation as well as over that of provinces, <lb/>
      the legislation of the Assembly is also <lb/>
      "subject to any Act of Parliament at any <lb/>
      time in force in the Territories." Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, consequently, often passes Acts <lb/>
      diminishing the legislative powers of the <lb/>
      Assembly over parts of subjects ostensibly <lb/>
      <cb/>
      reserved for their control, and at other <lb/>
      times over-riding Ordinances passed by <lb/>
      them and approved of by Your Excellency <lb/>
      in Council. It is unnecessary to point <lb/>
      out how such concurrent powers will lead <lb/>
      to insecurity and conflict. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Assembly is of opinion that to <lb/>
      remedy this undesirable state of affairs it <lb/>
      is not necessary to have recourse to the <lb/>
      granting of a full provincial status. They <lb/>
      believe that till the time arrives, which <lb/>
      may be at a not distant day, when the <lb/>
      Territories should be taken into Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation (as one or more provinces) the pass<lb break="no"/>ing of a few amendments to the North<lb break="no"/>West Territories Act will allow them, <lb/>
      subject to disallowances of their Ordinan<lb break="no"/>ces, "to exclusively make laws in relation <lb/>
      to matters" already within their legisla<lb break="no"/>tive jurisdiction. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      They believe that such amendments <lb/>
      should be supplemented by a few further <lb/>
      changes. While they do not ask for some <lb/>
      rights inherent to provinces, notably the <lb/>
      rights to raise money on the public credit, <lb/>
      the chartering of railways, and the admin<lb break="no"/>istration of justice with relation to criminal <lb/>
      matters, they can see no good reason why <lb/>
      other privileges of a territorial or provin<lb break="no"/>cial nature should be withheld from their <lb/>
      administration. They may point out that <lb/>
      during the last five years they have exer<lb break="no"/>cised most of the rights of provincial <lb/>
      assemblies, and, in their opinion, have <lb/>
      proven themselves equal to the task. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      They further are of opinion that the <lb/>
      time has come that their executive govern<lb break="no"/>ment should be put on a firmer basis by <lb/>
      substituting for the Executive Committee <lb/>
      an Executive Council. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The North-West Territories Act makes <lb/>
      provision for a Committee of the Assem<lb break="no"/>bly "to advise the Lieutenant Governor in <lb/>
      "relation to the expenditure of Territorial <lb/>
      "funds, and of such portion of any mon<lb break="no"/>"eys appropriated by Parliament for the <lb/>
      "Territories, as the Lieutenant Governor <lb/>
      "is authorised to expend by and with the <lb/>
      "advice of the Legislative Assembly, or of <lb/>
      "any Committee thereof." But it does <lb/>
      not provide for any responsible body <lb/>
      whose business it should be to advise the <lb/>
      Lieutenant-Governor in Executive matters. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident that the Assembly having <lb/>
      the power to vote money for distinct ser<lb break="no"/>vices should have the right to control the <lb/>
      proper carrying out of its intentions. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the present more developed state <lb/>
      of the country, which has as much or more <lb/>
      need for an intelligent administration and <lb/>
      supervision of its sources and requirements <lb/>
      as any other part of Canada, it is impossi<lb break="no"/>ble for the Assembly to act as an execu<lb break="no"/>tive council; they have been obliged to <lb/>
      make provision in their several ordinances <lb/>
      to entrust the duty of administering their <lb/>
      laws to the Lieutenant-Governor, acting <lb/>
      by and with the advice and consent of the <lb/>
      committee, created by federal law for the <lb/>
      purpose of advising with relation to ex<lb break="no"/>penditure only. They cannot, however, <lb/>
      be sure that in taking the only possible <lb/>
      steps within their power to meet the <lb/>
      necessity, they have not exceeded their <lb/>
      powers. Besides, the present machinery <lb/>
      does not admit of development, as for <lb/>
      instance in the direction of division into <lb/>
      departments with responsible heads. The <lb/>
      Executive Committee also has not the <lb/>
      right to advise the Lieutenant-Governor <lb/>
      in matters not contained in the Ordinan<lb break="no"/>ces, notably the appointment of Justices <lb/>
      of the Peace, and the convening and dis<lb break="no"/>solving of an Assembly, &amp;c., &amp;c. And in <lb/>
      general, the Assembly is of opinion that <lb/>
      for purposes of government a permanent <lb/>
      committee of the House has no advantage <lb/>
      over an Executive Council. The first is a <lb/>
      creation without precedent to guide it and <lb/>
      lacks the well-defined constitutional status <lb/>
      which political development during a long <lb/>
      course of time in Great Britain and her <lb/>
      colonies has given to Executive Councils. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of the foregoing the Legislative <lb/>
      Assembly would, therefore, respectfully <lb/>
      recommend the following amendments to <lb/>
      be submitted to the Parliament of Canada <lb/>
      at its next sitting: <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Amend the section of the N.W.T. <lb/>
      Act of 1891 (54 55 Vict) which is substi<lb break="no"/>ted for sec. 13 of the N.W.T. Act, Chap<lb break="no"/>ter 50 R.S.C., so as to read:—<lb/>
    </p>
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
    <p>
      "The Legislative Assembly shall exclu<lb break="no"/>"sively have power to make Ordinances <lb/>
      "for the government of the organised <lb/>
      "Territories in relation to the classes of <lb/>
      "subjects next hereinafter mentioned, <lb/>
      "that is to say."
    </p>
    </quote>
    <p>
        <hi rendition="simple:italic">Note</hi>—While Parliament cannot divest <lb/>
      itself of its paramount right of legislation <lb/>
      in the Territories, it is desirable that it <lb/>
      should not, as it has often done uninten<lb break="no"/>tionally, perhaps, by legislation partly or <lb/>
      wholly affecting the Territories, conflict <lb/>
      with existing Ordinances, unless such is <lb/>
      their distinct intention. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Add a clause to the N.W.T. Act giv<lb break="no"/>ing power to the Assembly notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing anything in this Act, or any other Act <lb/>
      of the Parliament of Canada, to repeal the <lb/>
      "Territories Real Property Act," so far <lb/>
      as it applies to the organised Territories, <lb/>
      and also to re-enact the said Act or any <lb/>
      part of it, or substitute other provisions <lb/>
      in lieu thereof. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <hi rendition="simple:italic">Note</hi>—Though it is within the compet<lb break="no"/>ence of the Assembly to legislate with <lb/>
      regard to property and civil rights and <lb/>
      they necessarily passed Ordinances affect<lb break="no"/>ing real property, as among others, relat<lb break="no"/>ing to Mechanics' Liens, Expropriation of <lb/>
      Lands, Tax Sales, and other official sales, <lb/>
      the question must frequently arise in how <lb/>
      far such ordinances are in harmony with <lb/>
      the Territories Real Property Act or can <lb/>
      be enforced with due reference thereto. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Repeal section 17 of the N.W.T. Act <lb/>
      of 1894 and insert instead: <lb/>
    </p>
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
    <p>
      "There shall be a Council to aid and <lb/>
      "advise in the Government of the Terri<lb break="no"/>"tories, to be styled 'The Executive <lb/>
      "Council of the Territories,' and such <lb/>
      "Council shall be composed of such per<lb break="no"/>"sons and under such designations as the <lb/>
      "Lieutenant-Governor shall from time to <lb/>
      "time think fit." <lb/>
    </p>
    </quote>
    <p>
      4. Repeal sub-clause (c) of subsection <lb/>
      (7) of said section 13 re "Insurance Com<lb break="no"/>panies." <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <hi rendition="simple:italic">Note</hi>—There is no reason why the As<lb break="no"/>sembly should not have power to incor<lb break="no"/>porate insurance companies with Territo<lb break="no"/>rial objects, notably, hail-insurance com<lb break="no"/>panies, stock insurance companies, &amp;c. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Insert a clause in the N.W.T. Act <lb/>
      giving to the Lieutenant-Governor in <lb/>
      Council the power to appoint Sheriffs, <lb/>
      Clerks of the Court, Deputy Sheriffs, and <lb/>
      Deputy Clerks of the Court, anything <lb/>
      contained in the Act notwithstanding. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <hi rendition="simple:italic">Note</hi>—The N.W.T. Act states that the <lb/>
      Assembly may define by Ordinance the <lb/>
      powers, duties and obligations of Sheriffs <lb/>
      and Clerks, and their respective Deputies <lb/>
      (subsection 4 of section 8 of 1891) and may <lb/>
      determine the places where such Sheriffs <lb/>
      and Clerks shall appoint Deputies. The <lb/>
      Assembly also prescribes the fees which <lb/>
      are allowed these officers in civil matters <lb/>
      which constitute nearly all their emolu<lb break="no"/>ments. Notwithstanding the fact that the <lb/>
      Assembly makes provision for both the <lb/>
      duties and the payment of these officers <lb/>
      their appointment remains in the hands of <lb/>
      the Federal Government. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Insert, subject to conditions herein <lb/>
      after explained, the following sub-section: <lb/>
    </p>
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
    <p>
      "The establishment, maintenance and <lb/>
      "management of hospitals, asylums, <lb/>
      "charities and eleemosynary institutions <lb/>
      "in and for the Territories"; and <lb/>
    </p>
    </quote>
    <p>
      Repeal sections 103, 104 and 105 of <lb/>
      chapter 50 R.S.C., in so far as they are <lb/>
      inconsistent with the powers asked for. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <hi rendition="simple:italic">Note</hi>—Lunatics from the Territories are <lb/>
      sent under an agreement expiring in 1898, <lb/>
      between the federal authorities and the <lb/>
      <cb/>
      Province of Manitoba, to the asylums of <lb/>
      the province. At present there are in <lb/>
      such asylums 74 persons, costing one dol<lb break="no"/>lar per day. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Assembly is of opinion that they <lb/>
      could perform such service as well and <lb/>
      more cheaply. On account of the extra <lb/>
      distances travelled by transport to Mani<lb break="no"/>toba the expenses are increased. The As<lb break="no"/>sembly, however, would only desire to <lb/>
      undertake the care of lunatics if the <lb/>
      federal authorities would provide the <lb/>
      necessary buildings, and make such in<lb break="no"/>crease in the grant or subsidy as would <lb/>
      pay for the maintenance of patients and <lb/>
      staff. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards hospitals the Assembly do <lb/>
      already provide, as far as their insufficient <lb/>
      means allow, for the assistance of hos<lb break="no"/>pitals built and kept by private charity. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Repeal section 21 of the N.W.T. <lb/>
      Act of 1894 and introduce an Act respect<lb break="no"/>ing "Roads and Road Allowances in the <lb/>
      North-West Territories," with similar <lb/>
      provisions to those contained in chapter <lb/>
      49 R.S.C., respecting Roads and Road <lb/>
      Allowances in Manitoba. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <hi rendition="simple:italic">Note</hi>—This would do away with the <lb/>
      uncertainties and difficulties now connect<lb break="no"/>ed with the laying out and improving <lb/>
      roads and acquiring road by expropri<lb break="no"/>ation and it would give to the Assembly <lb/>
      the right to delegate such power to muni<lb break="no"/>cipalities. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Add a clause giving to the Assembly <lb/>
      the power to repeal, alter, vary or re<lb break="no"/>enact the provisions for appointment of <lb/>
      Justices of the Peace and their qualifi<lb break="no"/>cations. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <hi rendition="simple:italic">Note</hi>—Only an Executive belonging to <lb/>
      and being in touch with the Assembly <lb/>
      has the facilities for judging the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of appointments to the commission of <lb/>
      the Peace and the eligibility of the per<lb break="no"/>sons to be appointed. Section 7 of the <lb/>
      N.W.T. Act of 1894 provides a property <lb/>
      qualification for Justices of the Peace con<lb break="no"/>sisting in the ownership in fee simple of <lb/>
      land of a certain value. In new settle<lb break="no"/>ments where few or not patents for home<lb break="no"/>steads have been issued it is impossible to <lb/>
      find suitable persons who can be appoint<lb break="no"/>ed. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Repeal section 16 of the N.W.T. <lb/>
      Act of 1888 and enact a clause giving the <lb/>
      Assembly complete control as regard to <lb/>
      appointment, duties and salary of the <lb/>
      Clerk of the Assembly. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p rendition="simple:centre">FINANCES</p>
    <p>
      Regarding the financial position of the <lb/>
      Territories the Assembly must reiterate <lb/>
      in part their memorial of January 1892:— <lb/>
    </p>
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
    <p>
      "That the necessities of local govern<lb break="no"/>"ment in the North-West Territories de<lb break="no"/>"mand that instead of the annual vote by <lb/>
      "the Parliament of Canada of an indefin<lb break="no"/>"ite sum for expenses of government, a <lb/>
      "fixed amount in the nature of a subsidy <lb/>
      "should be granted to the Territories," <lb/>
      and "owing to the rapid increase of the <lb/>
      "population in the North-West the <lb/>
      "amount of subsidy should be fixed for a <lb/>
      "term of not more than four years." <lb/>
    </p>
    </quote>
    <p>
      The revenues of the Assembly are ob<lb break="no"/>tained from local sources and the grant <lb/>
      from the Parliament of Canada. As re<lb break="no"/>gards the local revenues they are and al<lb break="no"/>ways will be very slight as they are made <lb/>
      up of amounts received for granting <lb/>
      licenses for such occupations as the Assem<lb break="no"/>bly is allowed to regulate by legislation. <lb/>
      These revenues amounted in 1895 to 30,<lb break="no"/>000 dollars. All the assets which the <lb/>
      Provinces [except Manitoba, which has <lb/>
      been compensated for the lack of them] <lb/>
      possess, are retained by the Parliament of <lb/>
      Canada, who own and administer, with <lb/>
      power to roll, or grant to railway com<lb break="no"/>panies, their public lands, their hay lands, <lb/>
      their timber and their minerals. The <lb/>
      Assembly, however, is expected to pro<lb break="no"/>vide for educating the young, caring for <lb/>
      the sick and destitute, rendering the <lb/>
      country habitable by improving roads, <lb/>
      bridging rivers, protecting against prairie <lb/>
      fires, increasing the water suppply, etc., <lb/>
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to the vast area of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories and the widely scattered nature of <lb/>
      the settlement all the business of the <lb/>
      local government is rendered more expen<lb break="no"/>sive proportionately to population than in <lb/>
      any province. As regards roads this is <lb/>
      apparent, but with respect to schools it <lb/>
      will be found equally true. By consider<lb break="no"/>ing that under the most favorable circum<lb break="no"/>stances less than half the area in each <lb/>
      township is available for homesteading <lb/>
      and that as a rule only a small amount is <lb/>
      taken up, it will not create surprise to see <lb/>
      that in 1895 it took 341 schools with 401 <lb/>
      teachers to educate 11,972 enrolled pupils, <lb/>
      with a daily average attendance of 6,600, <lb/>
      and that out of these schools 223 were on<lb break="no"/>ly open during the summer months with a <lb/>
      daily average attendance of 11. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The most cursory review of the increase <lb/>
      of population and the very small increase <lb/>
      during the same period of the grant from <lb/>
      Parliament for the government of the <lb/>
      Territories (which stands in the same posi<lb break="no"/>tion as the subsidies allowed to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces), will afford a convincing proof of <lb/>
      the utter inadequacy of their resources. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1891 the population was 66 799, the <lb/>
      number of schools in operation was 224 <lb/>
      (for that year no separate amount was <lb/>
      out at the disposal of the Assembly. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1892 the number of schools in oper<lb break="no"/>ation was 237, and the Parliamentary <lb/>
      grant for government was $208,700 <lb/>
      ($193,200 and $15,500). <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
     In 1895 the number of schools was 34.1 <lb/>
     being an increase in four years of over 52 <lb/>
     per cent.
   </p>
    <p>
      In 1896 the population is 104,331 (10 <lb/>
      per cent. per year added to census of 1894 <lb/>
      being the ratio of increase between 1891 <lb/>
      and 1894) and the grant from Parliament <lb/>
      is $242,879 (not including $25,000, supple<lb break="no"/>mentary vote to recoup the Assembly for <lb/>
      relief expenditure undertaken for and on <lb/>
      account of the Dominion Government), <lb/>
      being an increase in five years in popu<lb break="no"/>lation of 56 per cent, and in annual grant <lb/>
      during last four years of 16 per cent. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
     As the conditions of Government in the <lb/>
      Territories are somewhat analagous to <lb/>
      those in the Province of Manitoba, a com<lb break="no"/>parison between the amount voted to the <lb/>
      Territories, and the amount, calculated on <lb/>
      the same items, on which the subsidy to <lb/>
      Manitoba is based, would be fair and just. <lb/>
      Such an amount would be determined on <lb/>
      the following considerations: <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      1. That the population of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies, according to the census of 1891, was <lb/>
      66,799 ; according to the census taken by <lb/>
      <cb/>
      the North-West Mounted Police in 1894 <lb/>
      it was 86,851, and that, according to that <lb/>
      ratio of increase, viz., thirty per cent., it <lb/>
      will be, in 1897, 112,906. That if treat<lb break="no"/>ed on the same basis as Manitoba, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to sub-section (b) of section 5 of chap<lb break="no"/>ter 46 R.S.C., the per capita grant would <lb/>
      be calculated on an approximate estimate <lb/>
      of the population two and a half years <lb/>
      from 1897, which at the known rate of in<lb break="no"/>crease (of ten per cent every year) would <lb/>
      be 141,132. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That on capita grant, therefore, the <lb/>
      amount would be at 80 cents a head on <lb/>
      141,132 the sum of $112,905. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That on debt account on a presum<lb break="no"/>ably actual population in 1897 of 112,906 <lb/>
      the amount would be five per cent. on <lb/>
      $32 44 per head, making the sum of $183,<lb break="no"/>133. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      4. That a grant for the support of the <lb/>
      Governmetn and Legislature in Manitoba <lb/>
      of $50,000 is allowed, and that such a <lb/>
      grant for the Territories should at least <lb/>
      be as liberal, making the sum $50,000. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      5. That as Manitoba has been held to <lb/>
      be entitled to an indemnity for the want <lb/>
      of public lands of $100,000, and as the <lb/>
      Territories have a stronger claim for com<lb break="no"/>pensation is as much as besides the land <lb/>
      grants to railways in and for the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, a great part of their public lands <lb/>
      have been given to railway companies in <lb/>
      aid of construction, not for the benefit of <lb/>
      the Territories, but <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) For the general benefit of Canada, <lb/>
      and for the special benefit of the Eastern <lb/>
      Provinces and British Columbia. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) For railways constructed for and in <lb/>
      Manitoba for which no sufficient land <lb/>
      grant could be found within that province; <lb/>
      and <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Inasmuch as a very much larger total <lb/>
      amount of land is retained in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories for the benefit of the whole Domin<lb break="no"/>ion of Canada than the amount of land <lb/>
      retained in the much smaller province of <lb/>
      Manitoba ; and <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the province of Manitoba has been <lb/>
      given all lands designated as swamp <lb/>
      lands, <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      They feel they are entitled to a compaara<lb break="no"/>tively larger amount than was allowed to <lb/>
      Manitoba, the exact figure of which they, <lb/>
      however, are not prepared to estimate un<lb break="no"/>til such time as they enter confederation. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      If treated as regards a subsidy on a <lb/>
      similar system as Manitoba the Assembly <lb/>
      recognize that it would be just to deduct <lb/>
      from such calculated amount  such sums as <lb/>
      would defray the expenses which they, as <lb/>
      a Territorial Government,  are not called <lb/>
      upon to pay, notably the expense of the <lb/>
      administration of the criminal law: <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, they find that it has <lb/>
      been the practice of Palriament to charge <lb/>
      votes for Lieutenant-Governor's Office, the <lb/>
      Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, Legal <lb/>
      Adviser, Registrars of Land Titles Offices, the <lb/>
      up to the Territories without giving them <lb/>
      the control over such moneys. They be<lb break="no"/>lieve that they could perform the services <lb/>
      for which such votes were given as well <lb/>
      and better, and that such service and votes <lb/>
      should be put under their control. They <lb/>
      also find that votes for services in unor<lb break="no"/>ganized territory (as for instance $5,000 <lb/>
      for schools in such unorganized territory) <lb/>
      appear among votes for the North-West <lb/>
      Territories, increasing thereby the appar<lb break="no"/>ent liberality of Parliament towards them. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Legislative Assembly believes that <lb/>
      with the foregoing requests for legislation <lb/>
      and for subsidy they have given good and <lb/>
      sufficient ground for your Excellency's <lb/>
      advisers to recommend to the Parliament <lb/>
      of Canada ot deal in a liberal spirit with <lb/>
      their just complaints: <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      And they will ever pray &amp;c, &amp;c. <lb/>

<p>The Memorial to the Governor-General <lb/>
in Council endorsed by the Assembly, <lb/>
setting forth the position of the Territo<lb break="no"/>ries and our immediate requirements, was <lb/>
published in full in THE LEADER last <lb/>
week. This week we commence the <lb/>
report of the debate on the question. THE <lb/>
LEADER possesses the only accurate and <lb/>
complete report of this debate that exists <lb/>
or was taken. It was probably the most <lb/>
important debate that has taken place in <lb/>
the Assembly for years, and, as such, is <lb/>
    deserving of the space which will be de<lb break="no"/>voted to it:— <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:ROSS11">MR. ROSS</persName></p>
    
    <p>
in moving that the House go into com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the whole to consider the drafted <lb/>
memorial from the special committee, <lb/>
setting forth the legislate and financial <lb/>
position of the Assembly, suggested that <lb/>
if discussion were to take place on the <lb/>
contents of the memorial, asking for Ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial autonomy as against provincial <lb/>
autonomy, it would be better for it to <lb/>
take place at once rather than in commit<lb break="no"/>tee where questions of principle ought not <lb/>
to be dealt with. Having already made a <lb/>
lengthy speech regarding the subject, he <lb/>
need say nothing now, except to express <lb/>
his pleasure that the memorial practially <lb/>
was along lines he had suggested. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:BRET1">MR. BRETT</persName></p>
    
    <p>
(Banff) said he agreed the time for pre<lb break="no"/>senting the memorial had arrived. The <lb/>
present question was probably the most <lb/>
important the House had before it for con<lb break="no"/>sideration. While, however, it was <lb/>
only a temporary measure the memorial asked <lb/>
for, he was onle of those who believed the <lb/>
time had come when they should with no <lb/>
uncertain sound tell the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, or indicate to them in what <lb/>
position they would like the Territories <lb/>
placed. He was not going to state that <lb/>
the memorial should indicate that a more <lb/>
radical change than was asked for therein <lb/>
should take place at once. It was a serious <lb/>
thing to too rapidly get to an advanced <lb/>
condition if the conditions of the country <lb/>
would not warrent it; still at the same <lb/>
time it was equally bad that they should <lb/>
linger along and not do that which they <lb/>
considered was for the best advancement <lb/>
of the country. In considering that <lb/>
question they were called upon to consider <lb/>
two great principles. In the first place <lb/>
should they ask for responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and if they did hould they ask it <lb/>
for the Territories as a whole? He did <lb/>
not think that was somehting they could <lb/>
arrive at very suddenly, nor did he think <lb/>
it was probably wise to take his ideas or <lb/>
opinions on the matter, for everyone <lb/>
should be prepared to give his own views, <lb/>
and have good reasons for these views. <lb/>
There was no use disguising the fact that if <lb/>
the people of the Territories as a whole <lb/>
were asked "Do you want the Territories <lb/>
errected into a privince such as Ontario, <lb/>
or any other province in the Dominion?" <lb/>
he believed a large majority would at once <lb/>
exclaim "No!" (Hear, hear.) That <lb/>
answer would be very largely due to the <lb/>
fact that many people were not sufficiently <lb/>
educated on what it was really meant to get <lb/>
provincial powers and to be established <lb/>
into a province. Many people were <lb/>
laboring under mistaken ideas with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the expenses that would naturally <lb/>
attach to the erection of a province. Some <lb/>
had the idea that immediately on the <lb/>
erection of a province they would be <lb/>
forced to form municipalities. That would <lb/>
not be necessary. It was true that in <lb/>
Manitoba and other provinces muni<lb break="no"/>cipalities had been formed. British <lb/>
Columbia, however, was an exception. <lb/>
The Territories had just as much power <lb/>
to-day in forming municipalities as they <lb/>
would have, had they full responsible <lb/>
government. In British Columbia they <lb/>
had a less number of municipalities than <lb/>
there were in the Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>: they have direct taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>: So far as direct taxation is <lb/>
concerned we possess all the powers to-<lb break="yes"/>day of direct taxation of any province of <lb/>
the dominion. The direct taxation in <lb/>
British Columbia was poll tax, and the <lb/>
Territories could have the same thing. <lb/>
But it did not follow that if the Territo<lb break="no"/>ries were formed into a province, these <lb/>
powers would be exercised any more than <lb/>
now. He thought that would dispose of <lb/>
that objection. There were sufficient <lb/>
other considerations for them to think of <lb/>
in debating their present conditions. Was <lb/>
it going to be any advantage to them? If <lb/>
it was going to cost more than now, if <lb/>
they were going to have less money to <lb/>
expend on the industries of the country, <lb/>
and on improvements in the country, <lb/>
under provincial formation of government, <lb/>
that would probably be one of the strong<lb break="no"/>est reasons that iw was not advisable. If <lb/>
they were going to undertake a responsi<lb break="no"/>bility they did not think they could carry <lb/>
out, that was probably another reason <lb/>
why they should give it due consideration. <lb/>
As the memorial sets out, they are not <lb/>
now receiving as much money as they are <lb/>
entitled to. It was fair to assume, then, <lb/>
that so far as their financial position was <lb/>
concerned they would be better off were <lb/>
they in the form of a province, than they <lb/>
are now. The next thing for considera<lb break="no"/>tion was, were they prepared to under<lb break="no"/>take the responsibilities? He claimed <lb/>
that the Territories, with the present <lb/>
population, were as well qualified to <lb/>
assume responsibility as was the province <lb/>
of Manitoba, when she undertook full <lb/>
    provincial government — as was the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of British Columbia (hear, hear). <lb/>
Another point was in what position would <lb/>
it place the Territories with reference to <lb/>
the making of laws? He believed in a <lb/>
better. Another question was, had the <lb/>
time arrived when they should take this <lb/>
step? Some whould say the time had not <lb/>
arrived because they were not strong <lb/>
enough to assume the responsibilities. <lb/>
They were not strong enough to go to the <lb/>
Dominion Government and make a con<lb break="no"/>tract with them. He was not unmindful <lb/>
of the fact that there was a great deal in <lb/>
being strong. The stronger they were the <lb/>
better bargain they could make. <lb/>
But as he understood the matter in <lb/>
which portion of the Domion had been <lb/>
taken into confederation and established <lb/>
as provinces, they entered in on a basis <lb/>
which was stated in the British North <lb/>
America Act and which no government <lb/>
could go behind. If the Territories were <lb/>
taken into confederation to-day they <lb/>
would only received the same amount pre <lb/>
capita as they would were they ten times <lb/>
stronger. They would certainly receive <lb/>
more as population grew for the expenses of <lb/>
government. That amount was regulated <lb/>
according to population. Manitoba re<lb break="no"/>ceived $35,000 for expenses of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, while latterly a better arrange<lb break="no"/>
    
    <cb/>

ment was made them, and now they <lb/>
get $50,000. The same thing would at<lb break="no"/>tach to the Territories. Another question <lb/>
    to consider was, — as to the amount of <lb/>
money that should be claimed in lieu of <lb/>
lands over which they had no control. <lb/>
That resolved itself into the quesiton of <lb/>
making a bargain. They could state an <lb/>
amount they were willing to begin with, <lb/>
and the bargain ned not be made in a <lb/>
manner that finally settled it, so that <lb/>
later they could go to the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and ask for a greater amount in <lb/>
lieu of their lands. Another objection, to <lb/>
undertake great responsibilities now, was <lb/>
that business was depressed, and we had <lb/>
hard times; wait until there was a reviv<lb break="no"/>al of trade, and so on. Times had been <lb/>
bad all over the world, and the sooner <lb/>
they could help themselves, all the sooner <lb/>
they would relieve themselves of the de<lb break="no"/>pressed conditions. They would not, of <lb/>
course, interfere with the cause that had <lb/>
made the depression so general, but they <lb/>
    could during depressed times, — if they <lb/>
    had it within their power, — go on with <lb/>
public works, do things that in other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were doing good for the people. <lb/>
Thus, he said, they would be hastening <lb/>
the time when they would not be suffer<lb break="no"/>ing from the effects of these hard times. <lb/>
The question of the Territories remaining <lb/>
as they are must come to an end some<lb break="no"/>time, and it was for the House very <lb/>
largely to determine whether it should <lb/>
come now or be deferred. He believed <lb/>
that so long as they curtailed their demands <lb/>
simply to a portion of what they were <lb/>
entitled to, they would receive less and <lb/>
less every year. The time had come <lb/>
when they should tell the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in unmistakable terms that at <lb/>
    the expiration of this Assembly, — two <lb/>
    years hence, — they would expect full pro<lb break="no"/>vincial powers would be given to the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, either as a whole or divided. He <lb/>
had state there were no provincial taxes <lb/>
in Manitoba, nor would it be necessary to <lb/>
have them here. He might be asked,— <lb/>
In what way are you going to raise the <lb/>
revenue to carry on the Government? In <lb/>
the first place they would get a grant of <lb/>
money sufficient for the expenses of <lb/>
Government as they do in British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia. then they would have in their pow<lb break="no"/>er the collection of other taxes, license <lb/>
fees, and so forth, as in British Columbia. <lb/>
He would now refer more particularly to <lb/>
Alberta. If provincial government would <lb/>
be a good thing for the whole of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, he claimed it would not be unfair <lb/>
for a portion of the Territories to ask for <lb/>
it. The time had come not only for the <lb/>
Territories as a whole to ask for provin<lb break="no"/>cial powers, but is was high time some<lb break="no"/>thing should be done in the direction of <lb/>
giving to the western portion of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories full provincial powers. The con<lb break="no"/>ditions of the eastern and western por<lb break="no"/>tions of the Territories were quite differ<lb break="no"/>ent in many respects. In the west there <lb/>
were resources which would greatly assist <lb/>
the country generally if properly develop<lb break="no"/>ed. They had ranching, grain growing, <lb/>
minerals, coal, industries in coal oil and <lb/>
so on, which under proper conditions <lb/>
would make that protion of the country <lb/>
one of the richest, if not the richest part of <lb/>
the whole of the Territories. With proper <lb/>
railway facilities those cola fields would <lb/>
immediately be go into active operation. <lb/>
That would largely incrase the popula<lb break="no"/>tion in those parts. Those people would <lb/>
furnish a local market for those who rais<lb break="no"/>ed cattle, grain and vegatables to the <lb/>
north of them. They had diversified in<lb break="no"/>terests there but that made them stronger <lb/>
because they could deal with each other. <lb/>
The benefits they would obtain from <lb/>
having a provincial form of government <lb/>
would be that they would have power to <lb/>
to do as they thought best for the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of the country. Nearly every mem<lb break="no"/>ber of that Assembly must have a feeling <lb/>
of disappointment with reference to the <lb/>
North-West Territories. They had been <lb/>
    standing still — marking time. He did <lb/>
not think the best efforts had been made <lb/>
in their behalf. The powers of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince would make them progress much <lb/>
more rapidly than it had. British Col<lb break="no"/>umbia to-day was attracting the attention <lb/>
of the world. They had not got the rich <lb/>
mines in the western part of the Territo<lb break="no"/>ries as in British Columbia, but they had <lb/>
mines which if developed, they did not <lb/>
know but what they might be as valuable <lb/>
as those in British Columbia. The mines <lb/>
being developed in British Columbia <lb/>
would not be developed were it not <lb/>
that the B.C. government had made good <lb/>
roads, and so made it possible for the <lb/>
people to get into the mountainous dis<lb break="no"/>tricts. Had British Columbia been de<lb break="no"/>pendent year after year as the Territories <lb/>
were, and asking for somehting and only <lb/>
getting a small amount, that province <lb/>
would not have progressed as it had done. <lb/>
There was another thing which might be <lb/>
an argument in support of his contention <lb/>
for provincial powers for Alberta. There <lb/>
was a good deal in a name. The name <lb/>
"The Territories," had an altogether <lb/>
different sone to intending immigrants <lb/>
than that of a "province." They did not <lb/>
dissociate in their minds the United States <lb/>
territories from the North-West Territo<lb break="no"/>ries. It was a cold, inhospitable name. <lb/>
The Territories was thought ot be a land <lb/>
of cold and snow for about two-thirds of <lb/>
the year. He had heard many people say <lb/>
the name was bad, and retarded immigra<lb break="no"/>tion. People said they would try "a <lb/>
province." It was a more civilized name, <lb/>
    — a more congenial name. Were they a <lb/>
province, the name of "The province" <lb/>
would enhance their chances of getting <lb/>
immigrants above what they were now. <lb/>
He hoped the House would amend the <lb/>
terms of the memorial by recommending <lb/>
to the Dominion Govenrment, that at the <lb/>
expiration of thta Assembly the time <lb/>
would have arrived when Alberta and <lb/>
Athabasca should be erected into a pro<lb break="no"/>vince. he hoped the House would <lb/>
remember he was speaking for Alberta. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>: What part of Alberta? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>: I am speaking for that <lb/>
portion as I understand it, and for that <lb/>
portion where my interests lie. Some <lb/>
might say, Why ask for Alberta to be set <lb/>
apart? The eastern and western parts <lb/>
of Assiniboia had not such a large popula<lb break="no"/>tion as Alberta. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr. Insinger</persName>: No, no; the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is very much out there. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName> thought if the hon. member <lb/>
would carry out the figures as they wre <lb/>
in the memorial he would find that Albert<lb break="no"/>
    
    <cb/>

ta had a larger population that the <lb/>
Assiniboias. No, (continued Mr. Brett, <lb/>
looking at a paper crowded with figures) <lb/>
the two Assiniboias hat a pupulation of <lb/>
about 10 per cent. more than Alberta, <lb/>
carrying out the figures on the same lines <lb/>
as was done in the memorial. Some <lb/>
might say, why have not Assiniboia and <lb/>
Saskatchewan asked to be made into a <lb/>
province? He had never seen a stronger <lb/>
appeal made than Saskatchewan was mak<lb break="no"/>ing some time ago for some form of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial government. He would now speak <lb/>
for Alberta as he understood it; not for <lb/>
the whole of Alberta but a portion of it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>: Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>, continuing, said if they <lb/>
would look at the increase of population <lb/>
as figured out in the memorial they would <lb/>
find out that in the years 1891-94 it was <lb/>
57 per cent., much larger than in Assini<lb break="no"/>boia. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PAGE3">Mr. Page</persName>: Does the hon. member con<lb break="no"/>tend that the increase has been the same <lb/>
during the last two years, that it was <lb/>
during the three preceding years? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Dr. Brett</persName> replied that the was discussing <lb/>
a memorial which had been placed before <lb/>
the House, and he dared say it had been <lb/>
prepared very carefully and with due re<lb break="no"/>gard to absolute correctness. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>: But that is Territorial <lb/>
increase. <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
<persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>: Yes, that is certainly Terri<lb break="no"/>torial increase, but if in 1891-94 Alberta <lb/>
increased 57 per cent. there was no reason <lb/>
to his mind, why that incrase had not <lb/>
gone on since then. The increase of 40 <lb/>
per cent. claimed for the whole of the <lb/>
Territories in the memorial was based on <lb/>
the figures that Alberta had increased 57 <lb/>
per cent., Eastern Assiniboia 35 per cent., <lb/>
Western Assiniboia 24 per cent., Saskat<lb break="no"/>chewan 33 per cent Taking that as a <lb/>
basis the increase during 1891-97 would <lb/>
be Alberta 90 per cent., the two Assini<lb break="no"/>boias 92 per cent., and Saskatchewan 110 <lb/>
per cent. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr. Insinger</persName>: How does the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber compute these calculations out of the <lb/>
memorial? I know a little about the <lb/>
figures there, and I don't see how under <lb/>
any cicrumstances the deductions can be <lb/>
drawn from the memorial. The increases <lb/>
in the memorial are based on the whole <lb/>
population, but to jump from that to the <lb/>
incrase that happened in different parts <lb/>
is something a little absurd. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName> answred that he would stand <lb/>
    accused of being absurd, — but the figures <lb/>
showed a general increase in 1892-95 of <lb/>
57 per cent., and in the Territories of 40 <lb/>
per cent., and there was no reason to show <lb/>
that Alberta had not increased as much <lb/>
since. He obtained his figures in the <lb/>
office, and he believed they were absolute<lb break="no"/>ly correct. They were from the census <lb/>
returns taken by the N.W.M. Police. If <lb/>
the hon gentleman who composed the <lb/>
committee to draft the memorial were <lb/>
warranted in saying that the whole of the <lb/>
Territories had increased at the rate of <lb/>
40, that was ten per cent a year, it was <lb/>
fair to assume, in the absence of anything <lb/>
to the contrary, that Alberta had increas<lb break="no"/>ed in the same rate since 1894 (Hear, <lb/>
hear) That was a fair thing. He might <lb/>
appear ridiculous, but he certainly didn't <lb/>
realized to a very large extent that he was <lb/>
ridiculous in make a computation of <lb/>
that kind. He was simply giving a rea<lb break="no"/>son, why, as a representative of Alberta, <lb/>
he was justified in asking the House to <lb/>
indicate to the Dominion Government <lb/>
that the time had arrived when it and <lb/>
Athabasca should be set apart as a pro<lb break="no"/>vince by itself. While the population <lb/>
was increasing, and they had been getting <lb/>
an increased grant year by year, it was <lb/>
found that Alberta had been contributing <lb/>
much more to the local revenues than <lb/>
other parts of the Territories. Of the <lb/>
total revenue contributed by the Territo<lb break="no"/>ries (30,040) Alberta contributed 56 per <lb/>
cent, and eastern and western Assiniboia 37 <lb/>
per cent. that made only 93 per cent. The <lb/>
other portions was made up of moneys he <lb/>
could not compute. Alberta contributed <lb/>
a good deal more than all the rest of the <lb/>
Territories. He would give a few items. <lb/>
The liquor license was $24,907. Of that, <lb/>
Alberta contributed $25,178; the balance <lb/>
of the Territories showed $9,729. that <lb/>
showed Alberta contributed the most, <lb/>
(Laughter, and an hon. member: "And <lb/>
it is a sign of progress!") The cost of <lb/>
collecting that $9,729 in the two Assini<lb break="no"/>boias and Saskatchewan was $4,076, so <lb/>
that the new amount contributed by <lb/>
those portions was $5,652; while to <lb/>
collect $15,178 in Alberta it only cost <lb/>
$1,849, so in that respect Alberta's net <lb/>
contribution was $13,329. Looking at it <lb/>
in that way Alberta contributed 78 per <lb/>
cent. of the net revenues of the Territo<lb break="no"/>ries. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) He <lb/>
knew those figures were rather startling. <lb/>
(Renewed laughter.) <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>: What is the magnificent <lb/>
total of the revenue? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>; The magnificent total of <lb/>
the revenue is $30,040. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>; What is this net reve<lb break="no"/>nue? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>: For licenses under the <lb/>
Liquor Ordinance, the only item I can <lb/>
give the hon. gentleman, the gross reve<lb break="no"/>nue is $24,908. The expenditure attend<lb break="no"/>ing the collection of that is $5,926, leav<lb break="no"/>ing a net revenue of $18,982. That is <lb/>
outside the expenses of the chief license <lb/>
inspector and so on. In it were not in<lb break="no"/>cluded the meetings of the commissioners, and <lb/>
so on. Proceeding, the hon. gentleman <lb/>
remareked, some might say the magnificent <lb/>
sum, as the hon. member for Macleod <lb/>
called it, was only $30,040, but even in <lb/>
that small amount if there was a very large <lb/>
disparity between the amount contributed <lb/>
by one partner in the firm with the <lb/>
amount he got out of it, he was justified <lb/>
in looking around for some remedy. <lb/>
Someone might ask, what if Alberta did <lb/>
contribute 78 per cent of the net revenue, <lb/>
what had that to do with it? Noting, if <lb/>
78 per cent. was spent in Alberta of the <lb/>
firm's money. But they found that Al<lb break="no"/>berta came out at the wrong end there. <lb/>
Last year Alberta received about 30 per <lb/>
cent. of the full amount paid for schools <lb/>
in the Territories. It might be said, <lb/>
whose fault was that? If Alberta had <lb/>
had a greater number of schools establish<lb break="no"/>ed she would have had a larger proportion <lb/>
of the money. He presumed that as many <lb/>
schools were required were established <lb/>
there; he did not know anything to the <lb/>
contrary. then the expense of spending <lb/>
that money was five times greater in <lb/>
    
    <cb/>

Assiniboia and Saskatchewan than in <lb/>
Alberta. Then on roads and bridges Al<lb break="no"/>berta had had a little over one-third the <lb/>
total money, having contributed over <lb/>
three-fourths of the net revenues from <lb/>
local sources. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName>: The net revenue ex<lb break="no"/>pended upon roads and bridges? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>: No. While Alberta had <lb/>
contributed over three-fourths of the new <lb/>
local revenue, they had received less than <lb/>
one-third in schools and only a trifle over <lb/>
a third in the full amount expended for <lb/>
roads and bridges. that condition of <lb/>
affairs justified him, as one representative <lb/>
of Alberta, to ask that Alberta should be <lb/>
relieved, and placed in a position of col<lb break="no"/>lecting its own revenues and doing as it <lb/>
liked. In conclusion the hon. member <lb/>
further argued that Alberta was entitled <lb/>
to provincial status on the ground of ex<lb break="no"/>cess in increase of population, and also of <lb/>
extent of acreage. He could understand <lb/>
it was not going to be an easy matter to <lb/>
get the sanction of the House. It was <lb/>
not anything the House would voluntarily <lb/>
tender to Alberta. He did not think the <lb/>
Territories were sufficiently tired of Alber<lb break="no"/>ta, or sufficiently discontented with the <lb/>
part Alberta played with reference to the <lb/>
contributions to the general fund and so <lb/>
on. He could not readily understand, as <lb/>
was always the case in secession, or one <lb/>
part seeking to be relieved from another <lb/>
portion, there always would be some ob<lb break="no"/>jection taken. But he thought the time <lb/>
would soon come when there would be <lb/>
unanimity of feeling that the course he <lb/>
proposed was the best thing not only for <lb/>
Alberta but also for several portions of <lb/>
the Territories to be constructed into a <lb/>
province. (Hear, hear.) <lb/></p>

<p>
  (Yorkton) remarked that certain reasons <lb/>
  were given a week or more ago by the <lb/>
  hon. member for Moose Jaw (Mr. Ross) <lb/>
  why it was necessary to reconsider their <lb/>
  position with regard to their constitution<lb break="no"/>al status. It was stated that their powers <lb/>
  were not sufficient, and that the powers <lb/>
  they had been ostensibly given were in<lb break="no"/>complete. The hon. member further <lb/>
  brought on the point which whould appeal <lb/>
  more strongly to the House, perhaps, than <lb/>
  anything else, that they should ask for <lb/>
  more money. That was a very tangible <lb/>
  question, and appealed not only to mem<lb break="no"/>bers of that House but to every man in <lb/>
  this country. If they could in justice put <lb/>
  in a claim for more funds from the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Parliament, if they could show <lb/>
  that the Territories were entitled to re<lb break="no"/>ceive more from the Dominion treasury, <lb/>
  they would be remiss in their duty if they <lb/>
  did not make some kind of a claim. He <lb/>
  believed the present to be a favorable time <lb/>
  to reconsider their position. As early as <lb/>
  1885 they made a similar petition, but <lb/>
  then they hadn't the same knowledge no r<lb/>
  the same experiences of legislation. The <lb/>
  requests they then made were premature. <lb/>
  When they asked for responsibility in <lb/>
  1885 and 1888 they asked for something <lb/>
  that probably had they get it they would <lb/>
  not have been in a position to use. But <lb/>
  they had now been administering the <lb/>
  affairs of this country nearly as much as <lb/>
  any of the provinces, and he thought they <lb/>
  could claim to have administered those <lb/>
  affairs, with no discredit to themselves, <lb/>
  and quite as well as the affairs of any pro<lb break="no"/>vince were administered. He therefore <lb/>
  thought they could put in a good claim, <lb/>
  with a good conscience, to the Dominion <lb/>
  Government for more powers and for more <lb/>
  funds. There was another reason why <lb/>
  to-day they were in a better position than <lb/>
  formerly. There had been a change of <lb/>
  Government on a certain date in June. <lb/>
  He did not want to say for a moment <lb/>
  that one side of the House was more fav<lb break="no"/>orable to the Territories than the <lb/>
  other side, and it was well known that <lb/>
  many members of the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, when in opposition, made proposi<lb break="no"/>tions to give the Territories more powers <lb/>
  than had been given them. Mr. Davies, <lb/>
  now a member of the Government at <lb/>
  Ottawa in 1893 declared that it was the <lb/>
  duty of the Government in amending the <lb/>
  North-West Territories Act to give them <lb/>
    certain rights wholesale,—not to quibble <lb/>
  about and take back with one hand what <lb/>
    they give with the other. He (Mr. In<lb break="no"/>singer) — thought they could now go <lb/>
  to the Cabinet and remind its members of <lb/>
  certain statements made by them when in <lb/>
  opposition. They had now a member in <lb/>
  the House at Ottawa, who was more able <lb/>
  than any member they had had there be <lb/>
  fore, to present the claims of the Territo<lb break="no"/>ries before Parliament. He referred to <lb/>
  Mr. Oliver. It was not only his ability, <lb/>
  but by his long experience he was better <lb/>
  posted on the requirements of this coun<lb break="no"/>try, on their laws and general constitu<lb break="no"/>tional standing, than perhaps any other <lb/>
  member of that House. Then, too, he <lb/>
  was with the Territories on the present <lb/>
  question. But to proceed. A certain <lb/>
  day was appointed to draft a memorial to <lb/>
  consider the matter and to bring in a re<lb break="no"/>port accordingly. The mover of the mo<lb break="no"/>tion (Mr. Ross) made a speech in which <lb/>
  he laid down the lines in which he thought <lb/>
  the House should restrict itself in asking <lb/>
  for Territorial autonomy, and he gave his <lb/>
  reasons therefor. Every one in the <lb/>
  House thought they were in unison with <lb/>
  the expressions of the hon. member for <lb/>
  Moose Jaw. These members who it now <lb/>
  seemed were not kept silent and by their <lb/>
  silence assented in the expressions of the <lb/>
  hon. member for Moose Jaw. But as <lb/>
  soon as the committee met it was found <lb/>
  that that unanimity did not remain, and <lb/>
  from many parts came different opinions <lb/>
  upon the subject. He was not sorry that <lb/>
  that was so. It was made apparent there <lb/>
  were three possible propositions that <lb/>
  could be laid before the House. One <lb/>
  was to make one province of the whole of <lb/>
  the Territories and ask for full provincial <lb/>
  rights. Another proposition was to <lb/>
  divide the country into more than one <lb/>
  province, and make one province of Al<lb break="no"/>berta; the third proposition was to ask <lb/>
  that the powers they already had should <lb/>
  be completed and put beyond doubt, and <lb/>
    ask for more money, — or Territorial auto<lb break="no"/>nomy. He did not intend to follow the <lb/>
  hon. member and calculations, because he <lb/>
  simply couldn't. He did not think it <lb/>
  possible to follow the hon. gentleman into <lb/>
  anything that went to the bottom of his <lb/>
  heart, and that touched his sensibilities <lb/>
  keenly, because then his imagination ran <lb/>
  a little wild. The hon. gentleman at first <lb/>
  seemed to be under the impression that I <lb/>
  was rather premature to ask provincial <lb/>
  rights, but he blossomed slowly out into a <lb/>
  champion for provincial rights of the <lb/>
  Territories, and then he bloomed right <lb/>
  out into a champion for Alberta being <lb/>
  made into a province. He based his <lb/>
  claim on the consideration of the local <lb/>
  revenues; that a very large part came <lb/>
  from Alberta, and a very small part went <lb/>
  to Alberta. He showed that they had <lb/>
  more liquor drunk in Alberta, and that <lb/>
  there were more criminals in Alberta, and <lb/>
  that there were more people contributing <lb/>
  to the local revenue in Alberta by means <lb/>
  of fines. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>: What I did point out was <lb/>
  this, that the greater amount contributed <lb/>
  by fines came from the rest of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Out of about $400, only $40 came <lb/>
  from Alberta. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr. Insinger</persName> was very glad to hear the <lb/>
  disclaimer by the hon. gentleman. There <lb/>
  was more hope for Alberta than the hon. <lb/>
  member had given hope for. It struck <lb/>
  him (Mr. Insinger) as a very peculiar <lb/>
  claim that Alberta should be held out by <lb/>
  one of its representatives as being a place <lb/>
  where more liquor was drunk than any<lb break="no"/>where else. Then the hon. member <lb/>
  pointed to the schools. Certainly it was <lb/>
  a very strange claim to put forward that <lb/>
  Alberta was a more ignorant place than <lb/>
  any other part of the Territories. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) The hon. gentleman had shown <lb/>
  that population had it creased in Alberta, <lb/>
  and he must know that the establishment <lb/>
  of schools would always be a few years <lb/>
  behind the incoming of the population. <lb/>
  So if the hon. member would only rest his <lb/>
  soul in patience, say for a year or so, he <lb/>
  (Mr. Insinger) had sufficient confidence in <lb/>
  the intelligence of the people of Alberta <lb/>
  to believe they would have the full num<lb break="no"/>ber of schools, and that they would before <lb/>
  long make a full drain upon the Territo<lb break="no"/>rial resources for payment of schools. <lb/>
  Another claim for the autonomy of Al<lb break="no"/>berta was made on the ground of popula<lb break="no"/>tion. The hon. member went into points <lb/>
  which he clearly did not understand, and <lb/>
  the parts he did understand he clearly <lb/>
  did not comprehend. (Laughter.) Any <lb/>
  body who knew Alberta knew what the <lb/>
  hon. member for Banff ought to know, <lb/>
  <cb/>
  but did not seem to know, namely, that <lb/>
  in Alberta, they had special immigration <lb/>
  in the years 1891-94, and that that special <lb/>
  immigration there is not going on now. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:BRET1">Mr. Brett</persName>: It is going on yet. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr. Insinger</persName>: It may be going on, but <lb/>
  if so, it is a very silent trend. What we <lb/>
  hear is only the rumbling of the wheels, <lb/>
  as it were, of the people who are going <lb/>
  out. (Laughter.) Still he believed there <lb/>
  always would be a certain number of peo<lb break="no"/>ple going into Alberta, but the calculation <lb/>
  made by the hon. member was utterly <lb/>
  wrong, and he knew it, or he ought to <lb/>
  know it. He must know that on the build<lb break="no"/>ing of the colonization railroad there was <lb/>
  a large influx of population, and that that <lb/>
  influx had stopped. So the large increase <lb/>
  shown to have taken place then had not <lb/>
  continued. Then the hon. member ought <lb/>
  to know, and he did know, that of the in<lb break="no"/>crease of population that went in during <lb/>
  those few years quite a number had gone <lb/>
  out, and the hon. member did know that <lb/>
  the population of Alberta had not in<lb break="no"/>creased in the same ratio in the last few <lb/>
  years as it had increased before. He (Mr. <lb/>
  Insinger) must therefore refuse to believe <lb/>
  any conclusions based on the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber ought not to make claims for rights <lb/>
  from the Dominion Parliament based on <lb/>
  figures which he knew were belied by <lb/>
  facts. Were the Assembly to allow that <lb/>
  to be done, it would make them the <lb/>
  laughing stock of the whole country. <lb/>
  When the hon. member speaks about the <lb/>
  development of industries, he must know <lb/>
  that in one large Territory they had more <lb/>
  industries, and of course larger chances of <lb/>
  development and would have more power <lb/>
  of development, and would have more <lb/>
  credit for their developments than any <lb/>
  particular portion of it would have. He <lb/>
  did not want to create an impression in <lb/>
  the mind of the hon. member that he <lb/>
  (the speaker) did not fully realize the <lb/>
  great importance and richness of Alberta. <lb/>
  There was no doubt that it was one of the <lb/>
  fairest parts they had, but that was not a <lb/>
  sufficient reason why it should be separat <lb/>
  ed from the rest of the Territories. In<lb break="no"/>deed it was a very good reason it should <lb/>
  stay in with the rest. But really the <lb/>
  point upon which the hon. member put <lb/>
  the most stress was because of his, well, <lb/>
    call it sentimental reason; — the senti<lb break="no"/>mental reason that the idea in the minds of<lb/>
  intending immigrants was that the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories was a country of continual snow. <lb/>
  How a territory should create an impres<lb break="no"/>sion of snow he could not see, but he did <lb/>
  know that Alberta would create an im<lb break="no"/>pression of snow upon the mountains in <lb/>
  the mind of anyone who knew anything <lb/>
  about it. Why did not the territories in <lb/>
  the United States create an impression <lb/>
  of snow in the United States? There was <lb/>
  this difference between the territories, and <lb/>
  it was to our advantage,   that this side the <lb/>
  border the Territories had the rights of <lb/>
  provinces, and on the other side the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories had not the rights of the states. <lb/>
  But if there really was anything in the <lb/>
  sentimental, and the main, reason of the <lb/>
  hon. gentleman, and if it would act as a <lb/>
  balm to soothe the wounds of his bleeding <lb/>
  heart, he (Mr. Insinger) saw no reason <lb/>
  why the conceding so small a thing as the <lb/>
  change of a name should not be granted. <lb/>
  He did not object to have the name <lb/>
  "Territories" taken away, and to calling <lb/>
  the whole of this country Alberta. If any <lb/>
  little thing like that would satisfy the <lb/>
  hon. gentleman he would have no more <lb/>
  objection to the Territories being tacked <lb/>
  on to Alberta than he would to Alberta be<lb break="no"/>ing tacked on to the Territories. (Hear, <lb/>
  hear.) By that, sentiment might be ap<lb break="no"/>peased and the hon. gentleman's heart <lb/>
  by at rest for a little time. He <lb/>
  (Mr. Insinger) had never yet met the immi<lb break="no"/>grant who was scared from coming into <lb/>
  this country because it was a <lb/>
  Territory. He found as a rule <lb/>
  that when people came to this coun<lb break="no"/>try they knew very little about it at all. <lb/>
  They knew that they came to America, and <lb/>
  if they were very clever they knew they <lb/>
  were coming to Canada, and that was <lb/>
  about the extent of their knowledge. He <lb/>
  was sorry the hon. member stated an <lb/>
  amendment might be brought in, but that <lb/>
  he was not going to bring it in now. This <lb/>
  was the proper time to bring in any <lb/>
  amendment if the amendment was draft<lb break="no"/>ed, for really, to give "home rule" to Al<lb break="no"/>berta was an amendment which attacked <lb/>
  the principle of the memorial. The mem<lb break="no"/>orial was drafted for the distinct purpose <lb/>
  of obtaining Territorial autonomy and <lb/>
  would not fit on to a province of Alberta. <lb/>
  It would certainly expedite matters if the <lb/>
  hon. member for Banff would bring on <lb/>
  his amendment in the full House. It <lb/>
  showed a certain amount of want of cour<lb break="no"/>age in not bringing his amendment down <lb/>
  to the full House when particularly asked <lb/>
  by the mover of the memorial to do so. <lb/>
  If it was meant that by becoming a pro<lb break="no"/>vince they should have the right of char<lb break="no"/>tering railways, that was a matter for <lb/>
  serious consideration. The hon. member <lb/>
  for Banff had spoken about making a con<lb break="no"/>tract, or bargain, with the Dominion <lb/>
  Government. On going to the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion Government, say they made a <lb/>
  contract, and a contract was supposed to <lb/>
  be binding. For the hon. member <lb/>
  to say they could enter into a contract <lb/>
  and consider the contract would only bind <lb/>
  the other side simply showed that the <lb/>
  hon. member did not know what the <lb/>
  word "contract" meant. The question <lb/>
  was, were they sufficiently strong to go <lb/>
  into the position to make a full contract, <lb/>
  and if they had the full power to make <lb/>
  these demands? Unless they had suffi<lb break="no"/>cient interest at Ottawa to enforce their <lb/>
  side of the question they would, to use a <lb/>
  vernacular expression, "get left" on the <lb/>
  contract. They had only four members <lb/>
  at present, although they might have five <lb/>
  in a short time. Were the Territories in <lb/>
  a position to fight all the other parts of <lb/>
  Canada, because fight they must. Would <lb/>
  the Parliament at Ottawa give them full <lb/>
  consideration for the large amount of pub<lb break="no"/>lic lands which had been taken from them <lb/>
  for the general benefit of Canada? The <lb/>
  Parliament at Ottawa would simply give <lb/>
  what they thought proper, and not what <lb/>
  the Territories wanted. More than 30 <lb/>
  millions of acres had been taken away <lb/>
  from the Territories for the C.P.R. <lb/>
  Could they put a price on that land? A <lb/>
  great part of that land at present had no <lb/>
    value. If this country developed, — as <lb/>
    it had, slowly it was true, but it had de<lb break="no"/>veloped, — surely that land would get a <lb/>
  larger value, and the Territories would be <lb/>
  in a better position a few years hence to <lb/>
  make a demand for compensation better <lb/>
  than they were now; and if they did <lb/>
  make a demand now they would get left. <lb/>
  Rather than that he would possess his <lb/>
  soul in patience a few years longer. <lb/>
  Reference had been made to the position <lb/>
  of Manitoba at the time it entered into <lb/>
  confederation. The Territories were not <lb/>
  in the same position as was Manitoba. <lb/>
  Manitoba was not made a province be <lb/>
  cause the people there wanted or liked it. <lb/>
  They were simply made a province because <lb/>
  they were compelled to; it was through <lb/>
  necessity. And when they wanted to <lb/>
  make a change in a few years <lb/>
  they found it would cost them a <lb/>
  rebellion nearly to shake off their con<lb break="no"/>tract and make a new one. The Terri<lb break="no"/>tories were not forced by force of circum<lb break="no"/>stances. When they went into a province <lb/>
  <cb/>
  they would do it with a free will, and with <lb/>
  power to make contracts which would be <lb/>
  binding upon their heirs forever. Con<lb break="no"/>sidering the lands here would have an <lb/>
  enormous value in a few years, and con<lb break="no"/>sidering that if they were to put a price <lb/>
  upon those lands now they would be do<lb break="no"/>ing a great injustice to the people who are <lb/>
  to come after; when they considered their <lb/>
  position, that they were not able to force <lb/>
  their claims, he thought they should halt <lb/>
  before entering into a binding contract. <lb/>
    The hon. member seemed to think — and <lb/>
    perhaps many people had expressed simi<lb break="no"/>lar opinions — that as soon as a province <lb/>
  was formed the revenue at once fell in, <lb/>
  be he (Mr. Insinger) did not know <lb/>
  from where. Probably from the sky, or <lb/>
  some other place equally remote. The <lb/>
  estimated revenue for the province of <lb/>
  Manitoba last year was $800,000. The <lb/>
  idea of having a province was to develop. <lb/>
  If they wanted to go into the developing <lb/>
  business they had to get the money, and <lb/>
  the whole thing hinged upon the fact that <lb/>
  when they became a province it would <lb/>
  give them more money. He did not <lb/>
  think that was the fact. If the hon. <lb/>
  member would look up the revenues of <lb/>
  Manitoba he would find that the estimat<lb break="no"/>ed revenue consisted in the first place of a <lb/>
  Dominion grant of $50,000. So far as <lb/>
  the Dominion grant was concerned the <lb/>
  Territories were making a claim for some <lb/>
  similar consideration. On that ground, <lb/>
  therefore, the province was in no better <lb/>
  position than the Territories. In the <lb/>
  next place the Manitoba revenue consist<lb break="no"/>ed of the magnificent sum of $6,000 local <lb/>
  revenues. These were the the same local <lb/>
  revenues as the Territories could levy <lb/>
  with the exception of a law stamp levy, <lb/>
  which brought in $12,000. The Territories <lb/>
  however, could bring in similar legislation <lb/>
  to provide for the same purposes, but up <lb/>
  to the present they had not thought fit to <lb/>
  do so. The balance of those revenues was <lb/>
  made up of fees which were not of par<lb break="no"/>ticular benefit to a province. They found <lb/>
    that Manitoba as a province — and the <lb/>
  Territories would be in the same position <lb/>
    — did not increase their revenue by <lb/>
  one single cent on the amount they would <lb/>
  get as a territory. Therefore the province <lb/>
  had no advantage over a territory. The <lb/>
  hon. member for Banff had stated that in <lb/>
  British Columbia they had local taxation, <lb/>
  but they had no municipal taxation ; and <lb/>
  in Manitoba they had municipal taxation <lb/>
  but no provincial taxation. From that he <lb/>
  seemed to infer that they would be the <lb/>
  same as British Columbia. Surely the <lb/>
  hon. member must see that because Mani<lb break="no"/>toba did not raise its money by provincial <lb/>
  taxation, and British Columbia raises its <lb/>
  money by a local taxation, that we could <lb/>
  do without either of them. But if the <lb/>
  Territories, as a province, went in for large <lb/>
  plans surely they must go in for some <lb/>
  taxation. Where was money to come <lb/>
  from? Was it to come from heaven, or <lb/>
  from England, or where, and bring in <lb/>
  capital and they never pay interest on it? <lb/>
  In Manitoba they had a local taxation for <lb/>
  the maintenance and building of their <lb/>
  Court houses, only they did not raise it <lb/>
  for the province, but divided it amongst <lb/>
  the municipalities, but after all it was ex<lb break="no"/>actly the same thing as provincial tax<lb break="no"/>ation. It was not necessary for the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories to go in for being made a province <lb/>
  in order to get what they were seeking; <lb/>
  the same object could be obtained by go <lb/>
  ing in for territorial autonomy, and with <lb/>
  the distinct advantage that the demand <lb/>
  for larger Territorial powers was on the <lb/>
  face of it, not a contract, but only an <lb/>
  arrangement that would hold good for a <lb/>
  few years, or until such time as they <lb/>
  might want something else. Another <lb/>
  great advantage the asking for Territorial <lb/>
  autonomy would have over asking <lb/>
  the erection of a province, was <lb/>
  that they had a great deal more chance of <lb/>
  getting it. The hon. member for Banff <lb/>
  seemed to think that in politics by asking <lb/>
  for a great deal more than you expect <lb/>
  you would get a little. A mistake of <lb/>
  that kind was worse than a mistake. It <lb/>
  was simply prejudicing the whole case. <lb/>
  If they went to Ottawa and showed that <lb/>
  they asked for more than they expected, <lb/>
  that they were asking for what they did <lb/>
  not want; if they went and asked for <lb/>
  things in the lump and did not know that <lb/>
  they had a distinct knowledge of the <lb/>
  items, he thought they ran a great chance <lb/>
  of getting nothing at all. Their principle <lb/>
  should be to go and ask for those things <lb/>
    in detail;— show why they wanted those <lb/>
  things, and prove that they really wanted <lb/>
  them. If they showed that they under<lb break="no"/>stood what they wanted, and that they <lb/>
  knew how to handle it, they stood a very <lb/>
  good chance of getting it. He did not <lb/>
  believe in asking for a whole lot of things <lb/>
  in the chance of getting a little. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved they should follow the lines laid <lb/>
  down in the memorial. In asking for <lb/>
  Territorial autonomy they did not ask for <lb/>
  the power to charter railways. The pow<lb break="no"/>er of chartering railways was absolutely <lb/>
  useless to them unless they were in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to go and grant them the credit of a <lb/>
  country, and that they could not do. <lb/>
  Another power they did not ask for in <lb/>
  the memorial was the administration of <lb/>
  justice in criminal matters. That was a <lb/>
  point upon which a certain amount of <lb/>
  difference of opinion should be allowed. <lb/>
  He was inclined to ask that administration <lb/>
  of justice be given them, but it was found <lb/>
  there were certain very heavy charges <lb/>
  against the administration of justice, and <lb/>
  it would be foolish to take upon their <lb/>
  shoulders such a very large debt unless <lb/>
  there was a very good reason shown in <lb/>
  favor of it. In the memorial they asked <lb/>
  for certain amendments. First they ask<lb break="no"/>ed that the powers which were given un<lb break="no"/>der the North-West Territories Act, and <lb/>
  which were now subject to any Act of the <lb/>
  Parliament of Canada, should be secured <lb/>
  to the Assembly. That means that <lb/>
  the moment the Assembly had passed a <lb/>
  law in any subject some member of Par<lb break="no"/>liament might turn round and make some <lb/>
  bill in which one clause perhaps affected <lb/>
  the Territories, and therefore put aside <lb/>
  their ordinance. They had been in such <lb/>
  danger several times. For instance there <lb/>
  was the Animals Infections Acts. They <lb/>
  had the same danger when they brought <lb/>
  into that House a bill regarding the in<lb break="no"/>spection of coal mines. When they <lb/>
  brought in a bill respecting irrigation they <lb/>
  did not know whether they had power or <lb/>
  not to deal with the subject. The mem<lb break="no"/>orial asked that the powers they had, and <lb/>
  such other powers as they asked for, <lb/>
  should be given to them the same as to <lb/>
  any province in Canada. It was also <lb/>
  asked that the Executive Committee <lb/>
  should be changed for an Executive Coun<lb break="no"/>cil. An Executive Council had all the <lb/>
  political precedents of England and Can<lb break="no"/>ada to show it its way. An Executive <lb/>
  Committee never knew what it was at. <lb/>
  The memorial also asked that the Assem<lb break="no"/>bly should have powers to incorporate <lb/>
  insurance companies; that the appoint<lb break="no"/>ments of sheriffs and clerks should be put <lb/>
  in their hands; and they asked for other <lb/>
  powers which would not be of any great <lb/>
  value to them, but it certainly would be <lb/>
  policy to have them. They made a claim <lb/>
  for more funds for the reasons that they <lb/>
  stood greatly in need of more money, and <lb/>
  that the Parliament of Canada was respon<lb break="no"/>sible for the due administration of edu<lb break="no"/>cation in this country; as long as they <lb/>
  were a territory and not a province the <lb/>
  Parliament of Canada was responsible for <lb/>
  <cb/>
  the full government of affairs in this coun<lb break="no"/>try. They had also shown that if they be <lb/>
  allowed to make an analogy of what was <lb/>
  due to them, and what to the province, <lb/>
  they could show a very great claim for a <lb/>
  greater amount of money, but they did <lb/>
  not in the memorial want to base their <lb/>
  claim on that, and they did not want to <lb/>
  put a distinct figure on the subsidy they <lb/>
  might claim for compensation for lands. <lb/>
  He thought there were few occasions when <lb/>
  they, as a House, had to state their posi<lb break="no"/>tion as a House, and when those occasions <lb/>
  did arise it was their duty to give unre<lb break="no"/>servedly expression to their opinions, so <lb/>
  that not only the House but the country <lb/>
  should know exactly where they were. <lb/>
  He did not think it was their duty to <lb/>
  slowly follow public opinion, but to lead <lb/>
  public opinion. The Territories needed <lb/>
  more funds, and they had a right to more <lb/>
  funds. They contributed as much as any <lb/>
  province in Canada, and there was no <lb/>
  reason why other men in Canada should <lb/>
  be given fifty cents back out of every dol<lb break="no"/>lar they contributed, while they of the <lb/>
  Territories should be sent back only <lb/>
  ten or fifteen cents of the dollar they con<lb break="no"/>tributed. (Applause.) <lb/>
</p>
<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:MAGR1">MR. MAGRATH</persName>.</p>
<p>
  (Lethbridge) stated that as the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who had just sat down had sugges<lb break="no"/>ted there should be an amendment before <lb/>
  the House on the lines the hon. member <lb/>
  for Banff had spoken, he rose to propose <lb/>
  such an amendment, which was seconded <lb/>
  by the hon. member for Banff (Mr. Brett.) <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  It was in connection with the following <lb/>
    clause of the memorial:— "The Assembly <lb/>
  is of opinion that to remedy this undesir<lb break="no"/>able state of affairs it is not necessary to <lb/>
  have recourse to the granting of a full <lb/>
  provincial status. They believe that till <lb/>
  the time arrives, which may be at a not <lb/>
  distant day, when the Territories should <lb/>
  be taken into Confederation (as one or <lb/>
  more provinces) the passing of a few <lb/>
  amendments to the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories Act will allow them, subject to dis<lb break="no"/>allowance of their ordinances, to exclus<lb break="no"/>ively make laws in relation to matters al<lb break="no"/>ready within their legislative jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion." <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName> said that according <lb/>
  to that clause they did not <lb/>
  appear to have fully made up their <lb/>
  minds as to whether that day was at an <lb/>
  early period or not. The next point was <lb/>
  as to whether they felt they "should be <lb/>
  taken into Confederation as one or more <lb/>
  provinces." The amendment he would <lb/>
  move simply meant that they should more <lb/>
  forcibly point out that it was the opinion <lb/>
  of the House that this country should be <lb/>
  taken into Confederation as two provinces <lb/>
  at a very early period, otherwise it did <lb/>
  not disturb the memorial in any matter <lb/>
  whatever. He did not follow the hon. <lb/>
  gentleman from Banff, but he did hear <lb/>
  the levity with which the hon. member <lb/>
  from Yorkton referred to Alberta. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr. Insinger</persName>: I didn't refer to Alber<lb break="no"/>ta with any levity at all. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>: I certainly accept the <lb/>
  hon. gentleman's view of the matter, but <lb/>
  it appeared to me in his referring to Al<lb break="no"/>berta that he did do so, and that, subse<lb break="no"/>quently, he made amends by asserting <lb/>
  that Alberta was after all one of the fair<lb break="no"/>est provinces. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr. Insinger</persName>: I might have referred <lb/>
  to the views expressed by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Banff, but there is a difference be<lb break="no"/>tween the views expressed by the hon. <lb/>
  member for Banff respecting Alberta, and <lb/>
  Alberta itself. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>: I am glad to hear the <lb/>
  explanation. I feel the time will come <lb/>
  when we must enter Confederation as a <lb/>
  province. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:PAGE3">Mr. Page</persName> (Cannington): As a province? <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>: I say as a province. He <lb/>
  considered the interests in the Territories <lb/>
  were entirely different. In the west <lb/>
  they had to look to the west for their <lb/>
  trade, while in the east the trade was <lb/>
  largely diverted, or largely flowed towards <lb/>
  the east, and in that it appeared to him <lb/>
  there was a wide difference. As to being <lb/>
  created into a full province at the present <lb/>
  time he did not think it was desirable or <lb/>
  necessary. It was an unfortunate thing <lb/>
  in Canada to day, that they were over<lb break="no"/>governed. (Hear, hear.) There were <lb/>
  too many institutions in Canada, but he <lb/>
  felt, if they thought their interests were <lb/>
  going to be different in this country, that <lb/>
  they should emphasize their views in re<lb break="no"/>
    <cb/>
  lation to that so far as the creation of more <lb/>
  than one province was concerned. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Half past five having arrived Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er left the chair, leaving the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man in possession of the floor. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The House re-assembled at eight o'clock. <lb/>
  In the greater part of the evening the <lb/>
  chair was occupied by Mr. Deputy Speak<lb break="no"/>er Page, in the absence of the Speaker. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>, resuming, said the ques<lb break="no"/>tion for consideration was not a question <lb/>
  as to the importance of the memorial at <lb/>
  large; it was merely a question as to the <lb/>
  expression of opinion contained in one <lb/>
  clause of that memorial. He, and those <lb/>
  who held the same views as he did, wish<lb break="no"/>ed to go further than the memorial. <lb/>
  There was the difference. They all agreed <lb/>
  that the time would come when the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories would be taken into Confederation <lb/>
  (hear, hear.) They were a unit on that. <lb/>
  (Hear, hear.) But it had occurred to <lb/>
  those who held the same opinions as him<lb break="no"/>self that the memorial did not emphasize <lb/>
  that fact strongly enough. They had <lb/>
  never approached the Federal Government <lb/>
  on matters pertaining to the welfare of <lb/>
  this country that were conceded to them <lb/>
  when asked for. Were they going to wait <lb/>
  until the time had arrived when they <lb/>
  considered the time was ripe for the en<lb break="no"/>tering of the Territories into Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation before they brought the matter <lb/>
  strongly to the attention of the Federal <lb/>
  Government as they should? He did not <lb/>
  think that was desirable. There had <lb/>
  been a good deal of talk about educating <lb/>
  the country. He thought they had some <lb/>
  education to do in reference to this mat<lb break="no"/>ter. It was their duty to commence the <lb/>
  education, and commence it on vigorous <lb/>
  lines. He did not for a moment imagine <lb/>
  if they presented the memorial to the <lb/>
  Federal Government that it would be re<lb break="no"/>ceived, and that they would be received <lb/>
  with open arms. He also thought that <lb/>
  they should bring the matter very forcibly <lb/>
  before the Government, not that he <lb/>
  thought they were going to have it grant<lb break="no"/>ed, but that they might keep pressing it <lb/>
  from time to time. If they were satisfied <lb/>
  that the Federal Government would take <lb/>
  the memorial into consideration and act <lb/>
  upon it then he and his friends would sit <lb/>
  down. But their experience had been <lb/>
  otherwise, and for that reason they had <lb/>
  considered it necessary to draw attention <lb/>
  to that portion in one clause of it. There <lb/>
  was no diversity of opinion as to the main <lb/>
  point in that part of the amendment. <lb/>
  The next point he understood was they <lb/>
  considered that when the time did arrive <lb/>
  for the Territories to be taken into Con<lb break="no"/>federation, that the section of the country <lb/>
  from which he and his friends came should <lb/>
  be set apart as a province. They did not <lb/>
  presume to try to educate the House as to <lb/>
  what should be done with the rest of the <lb/>
  Territories. That remained for the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people of the balance of <lb/>
  the Territories. He thought he could <lb/>
  state confidently, that when the time had <lb/>
  arrived, the larger portion of Alberta <lb/>
  would be found a unit on that question. <lb/>
  (Hear, hear.) They had to bear in mind <lb/>
  that a portion of Alberta had already dis<lb break="no"/>cussed this matter. It had not been dis<lb break="no"/>cussed in his section. From the discus<lb break="no"/>sions that took place there was no ques<lb break="no"/>tion in his mind that the people of that <lb/>
  section of country had stated positively <lb/>
  and emphatically that they wished to be <lb/>
  set apart as a province. As to the other <lb/>
  sections it was a matter of question. He <lb/>
  believed if Alberta was canvassed to-day <lb/>
  that they would vote against provincial <lb/>
  institutions. (Mr. Haultain: "Hear, <lb/>
    hear.") — because they were frightened, he <lb/>
  thought, largely from the fact that there <lb/>
  was no question but there was too much <lb/>
  government in Canada. (Hear, hear.) It <lb/>
  was hardly possible to walk down any by <lb/>
  alley without meeting someone who was <lb/>
  in the business. So people for that rea<lb break="no"/>son, he considered, had just cause to feel <lb/>
  alarmed. But that did not alter the fact <lb/>
  that they were coming to it, that they had <lb/>
  got to come to it, and the question then <lb/>
  would be with the people of Alberta, <lb/>
  whether they wanted one or two provin<lb break="no"/>ces. When that time came, he was posi<lb break="no"/>tive that 90 per cent of the people of Al<lb break="no"/>berta would ask for Alberta being set <lb/>
  apart as one province. (Hear, hear.) It <lb/>
  might be argued that the Territories are <lb/>
  not as large as some of the provinces in <lb/>
  Canada. He was reminded the other day <lb/>
  that what was good for Ontario and else<lb break="no"/>where, it did not necessarily follow it was <lb/>
  good for this country, and he concurred <lb/>
  with that statement, although it did not <lb/>
  possibly suit his views at that time. But <lb/>
  the cases were not parallel. Ontario was <lb/>
    very large, probably much larger in ex<lb break="no"/>tent than were the Territories, — at least <lb/>
  much longer. But the populated portion <lb/>
  of Ontario was not, nor ever would be, as <lb/>
  large as the portions of the Territories <lb/>
  that were capable of population, and that <lb/>
  would be populated in due time. There <lb/>
  were good reasons that could be advanced <lb/>
  on the part of the people of Alberta which <lb/>
  it might not be desirable to advance, as <lb/>
  he might be accused of being narrow in <lb/>
  his views, but they all looked after their <lb/>
  own interests first, and although he be<lb break="no"/>longed to Alberta he was a Canadian, and <lb/>
  if he thought the portion of the country <lb/>
  to which he belonged, by having provin<lb break="no"/>cial rights of its own would be of, advan<lb break="no"/>tage not only to itself but to Canada, he <lb/>
  thought no one should blame him for hav<lb break="no"/>ing that wish. (Hear, hear.) The hon. <lb/>
  member from Banff had made quite a <lb/>
  lengthy speech in which he brought down <lb/>
  some figures. He (Mr. Magrath) did not <lb/>
  say he endorsed the ideas the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber advanced. He had no doubt the fig<lb break="no"/>ures were correct, but the hon. member <lb/>
  for Yorkton, in referring to them, stated <lb/>
  the figures were not fact, but he did not <lb/>
  try to dispute them, and he did not add <lb/>
  that figures don't lie. He (Mr. Magrath) <lb/>
  did not think the criticism of the hon. <lb/>
  member for Yorkton had the force he <lb/>
  would like the House to believe. There <lb/>
  were other matters referred to by the <lb/>
  <cb/>
  hon. members which he (Mr. Magrath) <lb/>
  need not reply to because he was good <lb/>
    enough to withdraw— <lb/></p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr. Insinger</persName>: I beg your pardon; <lb/>
  I didn't withdraw a single statement I <lb/>
  made. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>: I certainly understood <lb/>
    you to withdraw— <lb/></p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">The Speaker</persName>: He withdrew nothing. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>: I accept the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's correction. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr. Insinger</persName>: I accept the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's apology. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>: I have a distinct recol<lb break="no"/>lection that the hon. gentleman referred <lb/>
  to several matters in Alberta deduced <lb/>
  from figures the hon. member for Banff <lb/>
  adduced. The deductions he drew were <lb/>
  that the tippling proclivities of the people <lb/>
  of Alberta were noted, and he made other <lb/>
  statements in reference to the Albertan's <lb/>
  ability for consuming liquor. (Laughter.) <lb/>
  As a representative from Alberta, of <lb/>
  course I don't like that. (Hear, hear) <lb/>
  I presume there are other representatives <lb/>
  from Alberta who are going to speak to<lb break="no"/>night, who are more capable of looking <lb/>
  after Albertan interest than I am, and I <lb/>
  leave it to them to either endure, if they <lb/>
  see fit, the expressions that the hon. <lb/>
  gentleman chose to make in reference to <lb/>
  that matter, or refute them if they think <lb/>
  it desirable. I therefore beg to move, <lb/>
  seconded by the hon. member for Banff, <lb/>
  "That the report be referred back to the <lb/>
  select committee with instructions to <lb/>
  strike out the first clause of the section <lb/>
  referred to, and insert in lieu thereof <lb/>
  the following: The Assembly is of the <lb/>
  opinion that until the Territories are ad<lb break="no"/>mitted into Confederation as two or more <lb/>
  provinces which they consider is necessary <lb/>
  at an early date for the compact govern<lb break="no"/>ment on local lines of such a vast country, <lb/>
  that the passage of a few amendments at <lb/>
  the first session of the Parliament of Can<lb break="no"/>ada to the North-West Territories Act <lb/>
  will allow them, subject to disallowance <lb/>
  of their ordinances, to exclusively make <lb/>
  laws in relation to matters already within <lb/>
  their legislative jurisdiction." (Applause.) <lb/>
</p>
<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:FEAR1">MR. FEARON</persName>,</p>
<p>
  (Medicine Hat) said he was in the em<lb break="no"/>barassing position of agreeing in part with <lb/>
  promoters of the memorial and in part <lb/>
  with the framers of the amendment. He <lb/>
  agreed with the first part of the question <lb/>
  as to whether the time had arrived that <lb/>
  steps should be taken towards admitting <lb/>
  the Territories into the Confederation as <lb/>
  a province. The framers of the memorial <lb/>
  as interpreted by the hon. member from <lb/>
  Yorkton seemed to infer that the time <lb/>
  had not yet arrived. The position they <lb/>
  took was that they would leave matters <lb/>
    as they are,—in the same indefinite man<lb break="no"/>ner as now exists. It was there that he <lb/>
  differed from them. He considered the <lb/>
  time had arrived that at least steps <lb/>
  should be taken to frame events which <lb/>
  would speedily allow the Territories to be <lb/>
  taken into Confederation as a province. <lb/>
  The hon. member from Yorkton, in giv<lb break="no"/>ing his reasons why he considered it pre<lb break="no"/>mature that such a step should be taken <lb/>
  gave as one, that even with an increased <lb/>
  subsidy the difference between the amount <lb/>
  of money coming to them as a province <lb/>
  and now, would not be sufficient to more <lb/>
  than bear the expenses of the Territories, <lb/>
  and that it would be absolutely necessary <lb/>
    to carry on the government,—that was on <lb/>
  the lines that a province should be carried <lb/>
    on to develop the resources of the coun<lb break="no"/>try,—that means would be taken to bor<lb break="no"/>row money. Mr. Insinger consider<lb break="no"/>ed it would be premature to do so. The <lb/>
  point then to be considered was, if, with <lb/>
  a population of 112,000 in the Territories, <lb/>
  that was not sufficient, when would they <lb/>
  arrive at that point? If with a member<lb break="no"/>ship in the Dominion Parliament of four <lb/>
  members they were not sufficient, how <lb/>
  many should they have before they would <lb/>
  be in a position to compel the Dominion <lb/>
  Government to grant the Territories terms <lb/>
  as favorable as they could desire? It was <lb/>
  constantly brought forward that admission <lb/>
  into Confederation as a province would <lb/>
  necessitate the borrowing of money. He <lb/>
  believed it would, but he did not consider <lb/>
  it so much of a bugbear as it was popular<lb break="no"/>ly supposed to be. They were in the <lb/>
  position of a business house, or a farmer, <lb/>
  who by cultivating part of his farm was <lb/>
  able to pay expenses. He had natural <lb/>
  resources in a large area, but he did not <lb/>
  attempt to cultivate simply because he <lb/>
  had not the means to do so. Was it better <lb/>
  for him to continue indefinitely only pay<lb break="no"/>ing expenses, or to borrow money, deve<lb break="no"/>lop his farm and make it a dividend pay<lb break="no"/>ing concern? That was the position they <lb/>
  were in regarding the Territories. Wheth<lb break="no"/>er would it be better for them to go on <lb/>
  for an indefinite period simply paying ex<lb break="no"/>penses, allowing their natural resources <lb/>
  to remain dormant, or whether it would <lb/>
  be better to borrow money and develop <lb/>
  the resources? The hon. member from <lb/>
  Yorkton, in speaking of British Columbia <lb/>
  and Manitoba, as the different systems of <lb/>
  carrying on municipal or provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, showed it was absolutely neces<lb break="no"/>sary that some taxes had to be levied in <lb/>
  British Columbia, but he said the taxes <lb/>
  were levied by a provincial tax. That <lb/>
  was correct. But that tax in rural dis<lb break="no"/>tricts, other than municipalities, this year <lb/>
  was only 10 mills on the dollar. There <lb/>
  was a poll tax of $3 per head for all who <lb/>
  were not otherwise assessed. As he said, <lb/>
  the tax was only 10 mills on the dollar, <lb/>
  but they should bear in mind the provin<lb break="no"/>cial government paid all the expenses of <lb/>
    the scholl system,—that it included what <lb/>
  in the Territories was their school tax,<lb break="no"/>he asked did they consider that a very <lb/>
  high tax? How many school districts <lb/>
  were there in the Territories whose assess<lb break="no"/>ment was lower than 10 mills on the dol<lb break="no"/>lar? So that to-day they were assessing <lb/>
  themselves nearly as high as British Col<lb break="no"/>umbia assessed itself. British Columbia <lb/>
  had developed from a population of <lb/>
  20,000 to a population of 80,000 during <lb/>
  the last 15 years. British Columbia came <lb/>
  into confederation as a crown colony. But <lb/>
  supposing B.C. had been an undeveloped <lb/>
  portion of the North-West Territories, <lb/>
  and instead of going into confederation as <lb/>
  a province had simply been formed into a <lb/>
  local government on the lines of the <lb/>
  North-West Territories, what would have <lb/>
  been her position to-day? The amount <lb/>
  of money she would have had to expend <lb/>
  would only have been sufficient to pay <lb/>
  expenses, consequently they would have <lb/>
  had no money to make their roads and to <lb/>
  make the necessary improvements that <lb/>
  had produced that increase. British <lb/>
  Columbia not being an agricultural coun<lb break="no"/>try, it might be said the N.W.T had <lb/>
  increased in the same ratio, but with this <lb/>
    difference,—the Territories had an asset <lb/>
  that could be realized, upon agricultural <lb/>
  <cb/>
  lands ; British Columbia had none. So if <lb/>
  British Columbia had been in the position <lb/>
  of a Territoryshe would have been to-day <lb/>
  with very few more in population than <lb/>
  she was then. It was only by borrowing <lb/>
  money she was able to develop her natural <lb/>
  resources that made it possible for a <lb/>
  population of 8,000 or 9,000 to exist at <lb/>
  Cariboo, 300 miles from the railroad, and <lb/>
  made it possible for millions of money to <lb/>
  be invested there. It was not a danger <lb/>
  to have the power vested in a provincial <lb/>
  government to borrow money; it was only <lb/>
  by that means that it was possible to de<lb break="no"/>velop the uatural resources of the country. <lb/>
  He hoped he hd made himself clear on <lb/>
  that point. The first part of the question <lb/>
  was that he was distinctly in favor in the <lb/>
  near future of the best efforts being made <lb/>
  to admit the Territories into confederation <lb/>
  as a province. <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr.Insinger</persName>: One province? <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  <persName ref="pers:FEAR1">Mr. Fearon</persName>: That was where he agreed <lb/>
  with the framers of the memorial, and <lb/>
  where he differed with them in not going <lb/>
  far enough. Where he differed from the <lb/>
  framers of the amendments was where they <lb/>
  laid down that the Territories should be <lb/>
  admitted as two or more provinces. If <lb/>
  they entered as two provinces they would <lb/>
  enter as three. Was it desirable that the <lb/>
  Territories should be divided into three <lb/>
  provinces? He thought not. That would <lb/>
  be a state of affairs only parallel to the <lb/>
  Maritime provinces to-day, where there <lb/>
  was a movement to consolidate the three <lb/>
  provinces into one. The hon. member <lb/>
  from Banff spoke of the amount of money <lb/>
  paid into the local revenue fund from <lb/>
  Alberta. The amounts were small and <lb/>
  unimportant for the very reason that <lb/>
  they might from year to year alter the <lb/>
  amount of money obtained from licenses, <lb/>
  registration of companies; and other <lb/>
  sources of revenue were such that at any <lb/>
  time the case might be reversed. There <lb/>
  was no argument advanced why Alberta <lb/>
  should be separated from the Territories <lb/>
  and formed into a province that could not <lb/>
  be advanced in favor of any other part of <lb/>
  the Territories. In fact it was disintegra<lb break="no"/>tion, a principle opposed to the spirit of <lb/>
  the age. He was opposed to any division <lb/>
  of the Territories. There were many <lb/>
  arguments why they should remain united. <lb/>
  First, that as a whole they certainly would <lb/>
  be of more importance than they would be <lb/>
  divided. The hon. member for Lethbridge <lb/>
  (Mr. Magrath) thought the Territories <lb/>
  would be too large, and as evidence ad<lb break="no"/>vanced that the territories to the south <lb/>
  had recognized the principle and divided <lb/>
  as small as possible. It would be found, <lb/>
  however, that the territories, which are <lb/>
  now States, like Dakota, Texas and others <lb/>
  were as large or larger than the North<lb break="no"/>West Territories. It had not been shown <lb/>
  that there had ever been any difficulty <lb/>
  about the machinery of the Territories. <lb/>
  If it was possible for the Executive Com<lb break="no"/>mittee in a sparsely populated country, <lb/>
  now to manage the machinery of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the North-West Territories under <lb/>
  present conditions he did not see how but <lb/>
  a provincial cabinet ought to be able to do <lb/>
  it with increased facilities. He would <lb/>
  have preferred seeing an amendment <lb/>
  brought in which would more clearly have <lb/>
  answered his position, but as it remained <lb/>
  at present between voting for the memor<lb break="no"/>ial as it stood, which left it in doubt, and <lb/>
  the amendment proposed, which distinctly <lb/>
  stated that two or more provinces should <lb/>
  be formed, he must vote against the <lb/>
  amendment and in favor of the memorial. <lb/>
  (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
</p>
<p>
  The debate will be continued in next <lb/>
  issue. <lb/>

<p>In the "Memorial" debate in the Assem<lb break="no"/>bly, Messrs Brett and Insinger spoke in <lb/>
the afternoon. At half-past five Mr. <lb/>
Magrath had the floor. He continued <lb/>
speaking half an hour after recess, and <lb/>
was followed by Mr. Fearon, whose <lb/>
speech was printed last week. It was <lb/>
about nine o'clock when the leader of the <lb/>
House rose to combat the plea of the <lb/>
secessionists. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">MR. HAULTAIN</persName></p> 

<p>said that after the debate which took <lb/>
place in the afternoon he ha not thought <lb/>
of taking up any of the time of the House, <lb/>
but it had taken a peculiar turn by rea<lb break="no"/>son of the amendment which had been <lb/>
    put in, — a turn which had a particular <lb/>
personal application to several members of <lb/>
the House on account of their coming <lb/>
from Alberta, and considering the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of the question at issue. He would <lb/>
refer to the amendment first and then <lb/>
proceed to make a few remarks with regard <lb/>
to the general line of debate which had <lb/>
been taken. The amendment was to the <lb/>
effect that the Assembly was of the opin<lb break="no"/>ion that until the Territories were admit<lb break="yes"/>ed into confederation as two or more <lb/>
provinces, which they considered was <lb/>
necessary at an early date for the compact <lb/>
government on local lines of such a vast <lb/>
country, that the passage of a few amend<lb break="no"/>ments at the first session of the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of CAnada to the N.W.T. Act would <lb/>
allow them, subject to disallowance of <lb/>
their ordinances to exclusively make laws <lb/>
in relation to matters already within their <lb/>
legislative jurisdiction. The amendment <lb/>
involved two questions. IN the first place <lb/>
was the statement that the Territories should <lb/>
be divided into two provinces at an early <lb/>
    date not particularly certain, — almost as <lb/>
vague as the words of the memorial; and <lb/>
in the second place that until that event <lb/>
    became a fact, — until the Territories were <lb/>
divided into two provinces, they should <lb/>
practically remain as they were. He did <lb/>
not know whether the hon. gentleman <lb/>
who had framed the amendment had alto<lb break="no"/>gether followed out exactly what he <lb/>
meant. The memorial asked that they <lb/>
should remain as they were with regard <lb/>
to their legislative jurisdiction, but that <lb/>
they should have that jurisdiction consid<lb break="no"/>erably extended in many important mat<lb break="no"/>ters. So that the amendment, in its pro<lb break="no"/>phetic allusion, was progress so far as <lb/>
the practical question with which the <lb/>
House was concerned; but in the other <lb/>
part the amendment was a stand still, if <lb/>
not retrograde, and for that reason he <lb/>
would have to oppose the amendment. <lb/>
They had a large number of powers <lb/>
which at present were not complete, and <lb/>
in which, so far as those powers were con<lb break="no"/>cerned, and so far as other things which <lb/>
at present generally came with their <lb/>
legislative jurisdiction, they must look <lb/>
    for an immediate extension, — not for a <lb/>
remote extension at the time when a pro<lb break="no"/>vince or provinces may be established. <lb/>
The memorial was the practical suggestion <lb/>
of a practical body with regard to the <lb/>
actual present needs of the Territories. <lb/>
The amendment said they wanted a cer<lb break="no"/>tain number of provinces at an indefinite <lb/>
period, and then proceeds to state they <lb/>
really did not want anything more in the <lb/>
way of extension to their legislative juris<lb break="no"/>diction, but were perfectly satisfied to re<lb break="no"/>main as they were in that respect, except <lb/>
that present jurisdiction should be round<lb break="no"/>ed out as far as it stands at present and <lb/>
be made complete. To his mind the <lb/>
    amendment nullified one fo the most im<lb break="no"/>portant parts of the memorial, — that part <lb/>
which asked for the extension of their <lb/>
legislation jurisdiction, and for that rea<lb break="no"/>son could not commend itself to the House. <lb/>
No matter what the hon. member, the <lb/>
mover of the amendment, might believe <lb/>
with regard to what number of provinces <lb/>
they should have at a future day; no mat<lb break="no"/>ter what any hon. member might believe <lb/>
to be the proper way of stating their <lb/>
position with regard to the legislative rights <lb/>
and financial claims, he could not accept <lb/>
the position of the amendment which said <lb/>
they did not want anything more than <lb/>
they had now. The amendment was not <lb/>
practical, it did not settle anything, but <lb/>
it left everything for the considereation of <lb/>
the future. The whole subject connected <lb/>
with the memorial had been very suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently and very fully discussed during <lb/>
    the afternoon — so far as the speech of <lb/>
the hon. gentleman from Yorkton was <lb/>
concerned, more fully and more ably dis<lb break="no"/>cussed than any question he ever heard <lb/>
debated in that House. Therefore he <lb/>
(Mr. Haultain) would not attempt to take <lb/>
up the time of the House in dealing with <lb/>
the details of the memorial, or in dealing <lb/>
with their financial position. Those were <lb/>
fully set out in the memorial, and with <lb/>
which they all pretty well agreed. The <lb/>
question so far as the amendment was <lb/>
concerned, so far as any differenece of <lb/>
opinion with the memorial was concerned, <lb/>
was a question of what should their insti<lb break="no"/>tutions be? He went further and said it <lb/>
was a question of what should their insti<lb break="no"/>tutions be now? not what they should be <lb/>
at some future date. That involved the <lb/>
questin of whether they should have a <lb/>
single province, or whether they should <lb/>
debate the system proposed in the memor<lb break="no"/>ial of a gradual development of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Territorial system until they arrived <lb/>
at such a point that they would be albe to <lb/>
slide into confederation almost without <lb/>
knowing it. That question had been com<lb break="no"/>plicated by the amendment which meant <lb/>
that Alberta should be established into a <lb/>
province itself. As a member represent<lb break="no"/>ing an Albertan constituency, he must <lb/>
take exception to the position assumed by <lb/>
the hon. member for Banff in undertaking <lb/>
to represent the views of Alberta. He <lb/>
(Mr. Haultain) denied any right on the <lb/>
part of the hon. gentleman to attempt to <lb/>
represent what the opinions of the pepole <lb/>
of Alberta were except so far as those <lb/>
people were confined to the limits of his <lb/>
own electoral district. He might tell <lb/>
him, and other hon. gentlemen from Al<lb break="no"/>berta, that he did not believe Alberta <lb/>
wished to be made a province. He did <lb/>
not believe there had been a proper state<lb break="no"/>ment of the feeling of Alberta to-day. He <lb/>
agreed with what the hon. gentleman from <lb/>
Lethbridge (Mr. Magrath) said, that if a <lb/>
poll were taken to-day in Alberta on the <lb/>
question of whether Alberta should be set <lb/>
aside as a province there would be a very <lb/>
large majority against it in spite of the <lb/>
efforts of the Alberta autonomy movement <lb/>
in Calgary. That movement originated <lb/>
in the town of Calgary in one sense. It <lb/>
was a very praiseworthy movement in so <lb/>
far as it called attention to certain impor<lb break="no"/>tant public matters and gave opportunity <lb/>
to consider the larger question of the form <lb/>
of government in the Territories. But <lb/>
on the other side, if he might judge from <lb/>
the propaganda of the movement in the <lb/>
    
    <cb/>

shape of pamphlets, and from the speeches <lb/>
he had heard from prominent advocates <lb/>
of the movement, after all the movement <lb/>
was largely a very local one. They ap<lb break="no"/>pealed largely to the desparate condition <lb/>
into which certain portions of Alberta had <lb/>
unfortunately fallen. He heard of large <lb/>
and visionary schemes on provincial lines <lb/>
by which millions of dolars were going to <lb/>
be raised in the money markets of the <lb/>
world, by which large public works were <lb/>
going to be undertaken, and in fact, under <lb/>
the expenditure of which sums everyone <lb/>
was going to get work to be rich; to say <lb/>
nothing of the incidental fact that Cal<lb break="no"/>gary was going to be established as the <lb/>
capital of the future province, that public <lb/>
buildings were going to be built there; that <lb/>
the Assembly, or something like the pre<lb break="no"/>sent one, or better, was going to be estab<lb break="no"/>lished there; that there would be a com<lb break="no"/>pletely planned civil service, and that Cal<lb break="no"/>gary should blossom out from its present <lb/>
condition into a full blown capital. That <lb/>
was the most practical argument he heard, <lb/>
but it was not a practical argument that <lb/>
appealed to him, or that should appeal to <lb/>
the members of the House, or to the <lb/>
people of Alberta when asked to take <lb/>
such an important step as to separate <lb/>
from the Territories. As a member from <lb/>
Alberta he was not prepared to advocaate <lb/>
any scheme which meant the division of <lb/>
Alberta from the rest of the Territories <lb/>
and making it into a province. Consider<lb break="no"/>ing the practical interests of the country, <lb/>
considering the practical work they had <lb/>
to do, he did not feel disposed to be ask<lb break="no"/>ed to express an opinion upon the subject. <lb/>
The gentlemen who had advocated Alberta <lb/>
autonomy that day in the House did not <lb/>
go any nearer than saying it was some<lb break="no"/>thing to be hoped for in the near future, <lb/>
whatever that might be. Why, therefore, <lb/>
should the House be asked to spoil a <lb/>
memorial which dealt with their present <lb/>
needs; which dealt with their undoubted <lb/>
rights and the righteous demands they <lb/>
wished to make with regard to their <lb/>
immediate surroundings and their every<lb break="no"/>day institutions? Why should he be call<lb break="no"/>ed upon to express an opinion with regard <lb/>
to something which was simply anticipat<lb break="no"/>ory of a movment which might take place <lb/>
at some future date, as the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man put it in his amendment. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman from Banff referred to the <lb/>
present connection of Alberta as a part<lb break="no"/>nership in a firm, and said that member <lb/>
of the firm wished to withdraw. He (Mr. <lb/>
Haultain) did not know exactly what the <lb/>
hon. member meant when he spoke of a <lb/>
partnership existing between what was <lb/>
one single united country, and he believ<lb break="no"/>ed it would remain so. The diversity of <lb/>
interests which existed between various <lb/>
parts of the Territories had been spoken <lb/>
of as giving a good and strong ground for <lb/>
dividing the Territories up. What sort <lb/>
of a province did the hon. gentleman wish <lb/>
it to be? Did they want to have one <lb/>
sheep farm, or one wheat field, or one <lb/>
sort of a field devoted to some other sort <lb/>
of industry which their own insignificance <lb/>
would allow them to describe? If they <lb/>
wished to have a good strong province, <lb/>
strong in its own resources, they should <lb/>
have a diversity of resources (hear, hear.) <lb/>
Much better than having a comparatively <lb/>
small amount of land devoted to one or <lb/>
two interests would it be if they could <lb/>
have a very large area such as the organ<lb break="no"/>ized Territories were to-day with their <lb/>
diversity of interests, but not conflict of <lb/>
interests. They should look forward to <lb/>
having a very much stronger and better <lb/>
province than there would be if they ha <lb/>
to be divided up. Was there as much <lb/>
diversity of interest or conflict of interest, <lb/>
if they liked to use the expression, between <lb/>
the most remote portions of the Territoreis <lb/>
as there was between any sections of the <lb/>
older provinces? There was no conflict. <lb/>
He did not think any member of the <lb/>
House could state that at any time in the <lb/>
history of the House there was any con<lb break="no"/>flict of interest between those portions of <lb/>
the Territories known as Alberta, Assini<lb break="no"/>boia and Saskatchewan. He believed <lb/>
there was a Saskatchewan question at one <lb/>
time, but that lost a large amount of its <lb/>
significance in the comprehesive term <lb/>
"in other respects," so he was <lb/>
safe in saying there was no conflict of in<lb break="no"/>terest, at least very apparent. Hon. <lb/>
gentlemen who had argued with regard to <lb/>
the establishment of a small and weak <lb/>
province such as ALberta would be, look <lb/>
at the analogous case of Manitoba, Bri <lb/>
tish Columbia and other provinces. In <lb/>
the first place they were not analogous. <lb/>
Manitoba was not taken into confeder<lb break="no"/>ation under the same circumstances as the <lb/>
Territories would be taken into confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. Manitoba was taken in as a <lb/>
political necessity. In one sense they <lb/>
hoped the Territories to be taken in as a <lb/>
political necessity, but not in the same <lb/>
sense. In talking of two sides to a bar<lb break="no"/>gain, British Columbia when taken into <lb/>
confederation had a distinct say as to the <lb/>
terms upon which they would enter. On <lb/>
the other hand when they of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories were talking about two sides to a <lb/>
bargain, their position now and for a long <lb/>
time to come would be that, although <lb/>
they were in one sense one of the con<lb break="no"/>tracting parties, in reality the other con<lb break="no"/>tracting party had all the say, because it <lb/>
had all the power; so that the analogy <lb/>
between the terms of entrance into con<lb break="no"/>federation either between British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia or Manitoba did not hold good. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman had referred to direct tax<lb break="no"/>ation. If they did not have direct tax<lb break="no"/>ation they certainly could not have enough <lb/>
money for carrying on their business. <lb/>
They either had to have direct taxation <lb/>
or they mjust hae a municipal form of <lb/>
government under which people would <lb/>
levy the burdens upon themselves, if they <lb/>
would be a successful province. It was <lb/>
very easy to take, as the hon. gentleman <lb/>
from Banff did, a sheet of paper and with <lb/>
a few figures make a fortune out of them. <lb/>
The figures did not lie, but the average <lb/>
man who relied on the figures was very <lb/>
apt to find he was very much mistaken. <lb/>
The figures did not lie, but all the practi<lb break="no"/>cal questions involved in those figures <lb/>
had to be taken into consideration. Upon <lb/>
the credit of what, would any large sums <lb/>
of money be raised in the proposed <lb/>
province of Alberta? Not upon <lb/>
lands, because there were not going to be <lb/>
any lands; not upon minerals, because <lb/>
the mineral went with the lands and <lb/>
were already taken up by Federal <lb/>
authorities; so that when the hon. gentlemen <lb/>
indulged in fanciful figures in regard to <lb/>
large loans of money they should take one <lb/>
step further and explain exactly how they <lb/>
expected to raise those large sums of <lb/>
money. He did not think practical men <lb/>
living in Alberta had had any large oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of seeing that capital was particu<lb break="no"/>larly anxious to flow into the Territories. <lb/>
When hon. gentlemen talked about bor<lb break="no"/>rowing large sums of money they were <lb/>
simply begging the question and ignoring <lb/>
the practical side which precluded the <lb/>
possibility of any such loads being raised <lb/>
for a very long time to come. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman's argument with regard to the <lb/>
compactness of the province or provinces, <lb/>
and with regard to the desirability of <lb/>
having comparatively small areas formed <lb/>
into provinces, might e considered. The <lb/>
reference to the policy of the United <lb/>
States with regard to their Territories, <lb/>
was not a reference which should have <lb/>
great weight in that House. So far as <lb/>
they knew anything about American in<lb break="no"/>
    
    <cb/>

situations, he (Mr. Haultain) thought that <lb/>
was not exactly the part of the world to <lb/>
which they were going to look for prece<lb break="no"/>dents. If the States like to cut up their <lb/>
country into comparatively small terri<lb break="no"/>tories, presumably they did so for some <lb/>
reason, but not, he thought, for the rea<lb break="no"/>son advanced by the hon. member for <lb/>
Lethbridge. At what points were they <lb/>
going to draw an arbitrary line and say <lb/>
"at this point facility for governing this <lb/>
country ceases?" There were no great <lb/>
natural obstacles to communication in <lb/>
this country. They could communicate <lb/>
with the most remote parts in a rapid <lb/>
manner either by railroad or telegraph, so <lb/>
at what points would they draw that ima<lb break="no"/>ginary line? for after all it was a geograph<lb break="no"/>ical line drawn arbitrarily without any <lb/>
reference to any known number at all, and <lb/>
no position involving such a division <lb/>
could commend itself to that House as <lb/>
being based upon any sound principle, or <lb/>
even on good common sense. The argu<lb break="no"/>ment with regard to those narrow limits, <lb/>
and the special rights which exist within <lb/>
those norrow limits, seemed to be a de<lb break="no"/>cidedly provincial argument. He used the <lb/>
expression advisedly. He was not oppos<lb break="no"/>ed to the formation of a province, but he <lb/>
hoped hon. gentlemen who went in for <lb/>
the formation of a province would not <lb/>
take the other meaning of the term and <lb/>
indulge in arguments which could only be <lb/>
called both narrow and provincial. If <lb/>
they were going to confine themselves at <lb/>
once to the particular rights or particular <lb/>
claims of smaller portions of this country <lb/>
they might take the position proposed by <lb/>
the hon. members from Banff and Leth<lb break="no"/>bridge, and cut the whole country into <lb/>
small plots so that every man might be a <lb/>
province unto himself with three acres <lb/>
and a cow. But it seemed to him they <lb/>
should take the larger point of view, and <lb/>
not be bound by the narrow selfish inter<lb break="no"/>ests and claims, so-called, of any particu<lb break="no"/>lar portions of the Territories. The hon. <lb/>
member from Lethbridge referred repeat<lb break="no"/>edly to the fact that they were over-gov<lb break="no"/>erned. He (Mr. Haultain) believed the <lb/>
hon. gentleman was perfectly right. <lb/>
(Laughter.) They had heard about the <lb/>
movement going on now in the maritime <lb/>
provinces. He had not heard that it had <lb/>
taken any very definite shape, but he be<lb break="no"/>lieved there was a feeling in the maritime <lb/>
provinces at least that they were over-<lb break="yes"/>governed; that having three small pro<lb break="no"/>vincial governments instead of one strong <lb/>
government weakened their influence. <lb/>
But the hon. member from Lethbridge, <lb/>
when telling them about that state of be<lb break="no"/>ing over-governed in the Dominion, pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded, not in the most logical way, to <lb/>
recommend that they should follow the <lb/>
analogy of other parts of the Dominion <lb/>
by cutting up these Territories necessarily <lb/>
into a large number of small areas for the <lb/>
purposes of government. It would simply <lb/>
mean duplication, or triplication, or some <lb/>
other quantity of governments, or legisla<lb break="no"/>tures, of institutions of all sorts. In fact <lb/>
all of the larger institutions of the machine <lb/>
would simply be increased just so many <lb/>
times as the number of provinces it was <lb/>
decided there should be, without, so far <lb/>
as had been shown, any benefit being de<lb break="no"/>rived from it. For that reason, then, why <lb/>
should they have two or more small pro<lb break="no"/>vinces when one good strong province <lb/>
would do for all the Territories when the <lb/>
time for a province had come? He be<lb break="no"/>lieved they should have one province, but <lb/>
that they need not have it yet. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved they should go on, as they had <lb/>
been going on, with the gradual develop<lb break="no"/>ment of their present institutions, here <lb/>
and there gaining a little more power, <lb/>
here and their extending their jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion, here and there getting more money. <lb/>
There were the practical questions for <lb/>
consideration, and that very discussion <lb/>
showed that they were not prepared to <lb/>
make any definite claim with regard to <lb/>
provincial questions. The very fact that <lb/>
there were three sets of opinions express<lb break="no"/>ed in the House showed they were not <lb/>
prepared to discuss the provincial ques<lb break="no"/>tion with a view to its immediate institu<lb break="no"/>tion. They had very difficult questions <lb/>
to be settled when formed into a province, <lb/>
questions with regard to their lands and <lb/>
many other matters. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man from Banff, the other day, in address<lb break="no"/>ing the House referred to the undignified <lb/>
position the Territories occupied through <lb/>
the annual pilgrimages which had to be <lb/>
made to Ottawa to ask for more money. <lb/>
If such an attitude was an undignified <lb/>
attitude for them in their present unde<lb break="no"/>veloped position, what word should he <lb/>
use to describe a similar proceeding on <lb/>
the part of the representatives of a full <lb/>
blown province, because that was what <lb/>
the hon. gentleman admitted must be <lb/>
done? If they were going to have a pro<lb break="no"/>vince established at once they were not <lb/>
going to get what they thought they <lb/>
ought to get, and they would be obliged <lb/>
to do exactly what Manitoba had been <lb/>
obliged to do, and would be obliged to <lb/>
    do, — to make those annual pilgrimages, <lb/>
only it would be very much more undig<lb break="no"/>nified to go down to Ottawa on behalf of <lb/>
the province and make those annual <lb/>
claims than it was merely for a member <lb/>
of that House, who happened to be a <lb/>
member of the Executive Committee, to <lb/>
go down to Ottawa from year to year, <lb/>
simply to say, "we have no agreement <lb/>
with you, we do not want to ake any <lb/>
agreement with you, but we want to get <lb/>
better terms, and we consider we are en<lb break="no"/>titled to better terms?" So far as the <lb/>
argument of the annual pilgrimages was <lb/>
concerned the hon. gentleman had better <lb/>
not have made reference to it. The Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories had gradually demanded and had <lb/>
gradually taken quietly, it was true, but <lb/>
not the less effectually, larger powers into <lb/>
their own hands. They had developed <lb/>
the Executive Committee, an institution <lb/>
which was their own creation, and had <lb/>
practically put into the hands of men re<lb break="no"/>sponsible to the House almost all the <lb/>
administrative business of the Territories. <lb/>
They had been going on gradually until <lb/>
they had at least arrived to-day very near<lb break="no"/>ly the position of a province so far as <lb/>
administrative business was concerned. <lb/>
The memorial stated very clearly the <lb/>
difference between their present position <lb/>
and that of a province. It went on to say <lb/>
they wanted further powers with the one <lb/>
exception that they did not want to be al <lb/>
lowed to assume a debt which might com<lb break="no"/>plicate the provincial question later on, <lb/>
and they did not want to be admitted into <lb/>
confederation simply becausse they did <lb/>
not feel prepared to discuss the terms of <lb/>
being admitted into confederation. The <lb/>
memorial enabled them to go on gradually <lb/>
developing their institutions, bradually <lb/>
practising self government until they had <lb/>
arrived at the time when they were fully <lb/>
enabled to negotiate with the stronger <lb/>
body at Ottawa in regard to the important <lb/>
questions he had mentioned. He did not <lb/>
think he need wast time in arguing upon <lb/>
the House that they were not ready to go <lb/>
into negotiations. There were questions <lb/>
which demanded a large amount of negoti<lb break="no"/>ation and which unfortunately were set<lb break="no"/>tled not so much on principles of right <lb/>
and justice, but more with respect to the <lb/>
amount of political pressure which could <lb/>
be brought to bear upon the Ottawa <lb/>
authorities. He defied any hon. member <lb/>
to say they were prepared by virtue of <lb/>
their representations at Ottawa, or by <lb/>
virtue of the strength of the Territories in <lb/>
population, or in any other respect, to go <lb/> 
    
    <cb/>

to Ottawa and negotiate with the authori<lb break="no"/>ties there for entrance into confederation. <lb/>
What they wanted was autonomy. Au<lb break="no"/>tonomy meant power to govern them<lb break="no"/>selves. Their jurisdiction was subject to <lb/>
continual incursions of Federal legislation. <lb/>
They made a useful law, and sometimes <lb/>
an Act was passed at Ottawa which rend<lb break="no"/>ered useless their own legislation. They <lb/>
wanted to be put in the position of a pro<lb break="no"/>vince of passing laws coming within their <lb/>
own jurisdictions, but wished to defer the <lb/>
settlement of the very difficult and com<lb break="no"/>plicated question as to the terms upon <lb/>
which they should enter into confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. To go further than that, they <lb/>
were met with this fact staring them in <lb/>
the face, that they were not agreed upon <lb/>
what they wanted to be in the future. <lb/>
Some wanted one province, some wanted <lb/>
two provinces, and possibly before they <lb/>
had gone much further they might find a <lb/>
claim for a province somewhere on the <lb/>
banks of the Saskatchewan. In view of <lb/>
the fact that the most ardent advocate <lb/>
of provincial autonomy was not prepared <lb/>
to show what he really wished to do, why <lb/>
should they complicate the consideration of <lb/>
practical questions which concerned their <lb/>
everyday needs, which come up every <lb/>
day, and concerned them to-day, and would <lb/>
continually, until that province or those <lb/>
    provinces had been established, — why <lb/>
should they complicate their position in <lb/>
the discussion of something upon which <lb/>
there were so many differences of opin<lb break="no"/>ion, and in the discussion of a question <lb/>
which could not be practially settle that <lb/>
night? They might as well drop that <lb/>
subject and get down to business. Their <lb/>
business was, What did they want for <lb/>
the present time, both with regard to <lb/>
their constitution and with regard to <lb/>
their finances, not what they wanted for <lb/>
the future with regard to their constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, and upon which they were not <lb/>
agreed. Let the reference in the memor<lb break="no"/>ial as to what they wanted be as explicit <lb/>
and as implicit as possible, but let them <lb/>
be unanimous as to what they want just <lb/>
now. The hon. gentleman from Leth<lb break="no"/>bridge said in his amendment that they <lb/>
should stand still until the change was <lb/>
made. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>: I beg the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's pardon, I say nothing of the kind. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> (reading the amend<lb break="no"/>ment): Waht I say is, the amendment <lb/>
as it reads is subject to only one construc<lb break="no"/>tion, and that is that it proposes that we <lb/>
should stand still until two or more pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are established. Of course, con<lb break="no"/>tinued Mr. Haultain, if the hon. gentleman <lb/>
did not intend that, he (Mr. Haultain) was <lb/>
very glad, but that was the only meaning <lb/>
he could give the amendment if it meant <lb/>
anything at all. If it meant something <lb/>
    else— <lb/> </p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>: I certainly cannot see <lb/>
it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> proceeded that if the <lb/>
amendment did not mean that, he did <lb/>
not see what it did mean. He thought if <lb/>
they could be unanimous upon what they <lb/>
wanted, and upon what they ahd a right <lb/>
to have, they could agree to disagree with <lb/>
regard to what their future was going to <lb/>
be. Their present position demanded a <lb/>
remedy at once. The memorial set that <lb/>
out much more eloquently than anything <lb/>
he could say. Therefore let them set <lb/>
aside the larger question which was for <lb/>
the future, and turn their attention to <lb/>
the practical needs of the present moment. <lb/>
He thought he need not address an argu<lb break="no"/>ment to the Houe to be unanimous. If <lb/>
they were not unanimous they need not <lb/>
hope for anything from Ottawa. If the <lb/>
hon. member for Banff between now and <lb/>
next session advocated the Alberta auton<lb break="no"/>omy movement he would at least do a <lb/>
great deal of good in calling attention to <lb/>
the system under which the Territories <lb/>
were not working. It might be a very <lb/>
good educative movement, and he (Mr. <lb/>
Haultain) certainly would not object to it, <lb/>
but if dreams were to be dreamed, and if <lb/>
visions were to be seen, they had better <lb/>
be dreamed and better be seen outside of <lb/>
that House, which after all had only to <lb/>
do with practical work. If however they <lb/>
were going to consider the larger subject <lb/>
it should be a little larger that the com<lb break="no"/>paratively small area of Alberta and Sask<lb break="no"/>atchewan for after all those names <lb/>
were only applied for post office purposes. <lb/>
Their consideration of their needs on that <lb/> 
    
    <cb/>

question should be just as broad as the <lb/>
whole of the Territories. And if they <lb/>
were gong to dream a dream, the dream <lb/>
he would like to dream would be the <lb/>
dream of one large province with all its <lb/>
varied resources; a dream of one large <lb/>
province with a united population, and <lb/>
not a divided population; and if that <lb/>
dream could come true he believed it <lb/>
would be a much better dream, and a <lb/>
much more desirable dream than the <lb/>
dream which was dreamed by the hon. <lb/>
member for Banff. A dream of one large <lb/>
province holding its own in confederation, <lb/>
the most powerful province in confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, would be a much more desirable <lb/>
thing to think about, and to speculate <lb/>
about, than a number of small areas con<lb break="no"/>fined in their own powers and in their in<lb break="no"/>fluence. The dream he would like to <lb/>
dream would be the dream of the largest <lb/>
province and the most powerful province <lb/>
in the greatest and most glorious country <lb/>
attached to the mightiest empire the world <lb/>
has ever seen. (Applause.) <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CLIN1">MR. CLINKSKILL</persName></p> 

<p>(Battleford) said the committee in con<lb break="no"/>sidering the report as contained in the <lb/>
memorial, had decided that there were <lb/>
three possible propositions to bring up in <lb/>
the matter. One was the consideration <lb/>
of bringing the whole of the Territories <lb/>
into one province; or two or more <lb/>
provinces, and the third was the consider<lb break="no"/>ation of an enlargement of their powers as <lb/>
they were at present. In regard to the <lb/>
idea of asking for provincial rights the <lb/>
committee were not in a position very <lb/>
well to understand what was meant by <lb/>
the expression "provincial autonomy," <lb/>
as it had been used by some members of <lb/>
the House. The committee endeavored <lb/>
to find out their views, but were unable <lb/>
to find any union amongst them as to what <lb/>
they really wanted. Some did not want <lb/>
a province at all, they had no idea of <lb/>
provincial rights; some would be willing <lb/>
to take a province provided they took in <lb/>
half of Assiniboia and half of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, and made them a province; others <lb/>
would be willing to go int as a province <lb/>
provided Athabasca was taken in. But <lb/>
the committee could not come to any con<lb break="no"/>clusion as to whether those hon. members <lb/>
were able to agree as to what they meant <lb/>
by provincial autonomy. Under the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances the committee agreed that the <lb/>
best thing they could do would be to em<lb break="no"/>body their ideas which would be makeing <lb/>
a step forward in the position in which <lb/>
they now were. Regarding the powers <lb/>
which it would be for their advantage to <lb/>
have. Powers they did not wish to have <lb/>
they had not embodied in the report. <lb/>
He would refer especially to the point of <lb/>
borrowing money and the administration <lb/>
of criminal jurisdiction. As far as the <lb/>
arguments of the hon. member for Banff <lb/>
were concerned he did not think they <lb/>
moved in the right direction to convince <lb/>
that they had necessity to consider the <lb/>
question of asking for full provincial <lb/>
rights yet. That must come some day <lb/>
they were all agreed. The amendment <lb/>
proposed did not find fault with any of <lb/>
the propositions embodied in the memor<lb break="no"/>ial, it was not finding fault with any of <lb/>
the powers asked for, it was simply <lb/>
brought up on a few words contained in <lb/>
one of the clauses, which was brought in <lb/>
in parenthesis, the printing of which <lb/>
would indicate that it was simply a refer<lb break="no"/>ence to a condition which they would <lb/>
be in at some future date, when they <lb/>
would be in a position to ask for provin<lb break="no"/>cial powers for one, two, or more provin<lb break="no"/>ces. The fact of those words being in <lb/>
did not bind that it should be one pro<lb break="no"/>vince, or two, or any number at all. In <lb/>
the N.W.T. they had been for some time <lb/>
gradually moving towards increased pow<lb break="no"/>ers. The powers that had been granted <lb/>
to them had been exercised with judgment <lb/>
and with good results. The argument had <lb/>
been brought forward that they should <lb/>
ask for a great deal more than they ex<lb break="no"/>pected. He took issue with that. If <lb/>
they put forward claims on just principles <lb/>
and gave good sound reasons in support <lb/>
of them, they would be more likely to get <lb/>
what they wanted than if they asked for <lb/>
something which they could not justify. <lb/>
It had been said they had made progress <lb/>
slowly. He admitted they had not got <lb/>
the powers they asked for immediately, <lb/>
but they had had a change of administra<lb break="no"/>tion at Ottawa, whether <lb/>
Conservative or Liberal, there was always <lb/>
a thing hanging over those Governments, <lb/>
and that was shortness of money, and <lb/>
they would doubtless find that it did not <lb/>
matter what administration it was, they <lb/>
would always be inclined to keep as much <lb/>
of the money in their own hands as pos<lb break="no"/>sible. That was to say, they would not <lb/>
be willing to give the Territories any more <lb/>
money than they were entitled to, and it <lb/>
was necessary for them all the more de<lb break="no"/>cidedly to show what they actually requir<lb break="no"/>ed and they were not asking more than <lb/>
they could make use of. As to the devel<lb break="no"/>opment of the coal fields in Alberta, that <lb/>
would be very largely dependent upon the <lb/>
population of the Territories. It was all <lb/>
very well to say they could get a large <lb/>
market in the south, but there was be <lb/>
tween them and the south a wall of <lb/>
tariffs, and there was every prospect that <lb/>
that wall would be built higher every <lb/>
day, so that it would be a handicap upon <lb/>
the Alberta coal fields as regards markets. <lb/>
It would be better for Alberta to aid in <lb/>
getting the population into the Territories <lb/>
which would give a market for the miner<lb break="no"/>als of Alberta and which would result in <lb/>
getting the population into Alberta, and <lb/>
that again result in consuming the pro<lb break="no"/>ductions of the Territories. As regards <lb/>
the borrowing of money on public credit, <lb/>
he might say that in order to do that, they <lb/>
must have good security. He could not <lb/>
    
    <cb/>

see where the money was to come from, if <lb/>
they had a province such as Alberta, ex<lb break="no"/>cept from direct taxation, and direct tax<lb break="no"/>ation was always a cry which tended to <lb/>
keep population from going into the coun<lb break="no"/>try. The freer they could make a coun<lb break="no"/>try as far as direct taxation was concern<lb break="no"/>ed, the more likely they would be to get <lb/>
population. The hon. member for Banff <lb/>
instanced a cry that came from Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan for provincial autonomy. He (Mr. <lb/>
Clinkskill) did not know that the hon. <lb/>
member was referring to anything except <lb/>
that once upon a time a very slight wail <lb/>
was heard to come from that vast terri<lb break="no"/>tory, but it was of such a very weak na<lb break="no"/>ture that it never reached very far, and <lb/>
they had heard nothing of it since that <lb/>
one time it was given expression to. He <lb/>
could not talk for the people of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan in the same way the hon. member <lb/>
talked for the people of Alberta, but he <lb/>
did know that he was in favor of one pro<lb break="no"/>vince and not of two, and he was in favor <lb/>
of a gradual development of the powers <lb/>
they had until the arrival of the time <lb/>
when the step into a province would be a <lb/>
very short step to take. He could not <lb/>
follow the hon. gentleman's figures. He <lb/>
showed that 78 per cent of the revenue <lb/>
was got from Alberta and 30 per cent. was <lb/>
spent on schools. He (Mr. Clinkskill) <lb/>
was very sorry to hear the hon. member <lb/>
from Yorkton accused of levity in speak<lb break="no"/>ing of that matter. The charge of levity <lb/>
should have been raised against the hon. <lb/>
member for Banff for raising the argu<lb break="no"/>ment that the country used so much on <lb/>
the one hand, and on the other hand spent <lb/>
so little in a proper direction. Certainly <lb/>
he (Mr. Clinkskill) did not think that <lb/>
was an argument in favor of a people <lb/>
being allowed full provincial powers. <lb/>
He was sorry the hon. member for Banff <lb/>
had not by this time come to reason, and <lb/>
was not assisting them in that progress <lb/>
which was desirable. At one time the <lb/>
hon. gentleman's career in that House was <lb/>
directly opposed to the progress of the <lb/>
House, and the move he was making now <lb/>
was nothing different from the stand he <lb/>
took at that time. The development that <lb/>
had taken place in their powers in the <lb/>
Territories, they had not to thank they <lb/>
the hon. member for Banff for. In con<lb break="no"/>clusion he (Mr. Clinkskill) said he was in <lb/>
favor of all the claims laid down in the <lb/>
memorial. He would like to have <lb/>
those granted, and he would like <lb/>
to say that if they be not grant<lb break="no"/>ed, or were not granted at an <lb/>
early day, he would be in favor of one pro<lb break="no"/>vince but not of two provinces. (Hear, <lb/>
hear). <lb/></p> 

<p>By permission of the House <lb/></p>
    
    <p rendition="simple:centre">
<persName ref="pers:BRET1">MR. BRETT</persName> <lb/></p>
    
    <p>
was allowed to speak. He said it would <lb/>
occur from the remarks just made <lb/>
by the hon. gentleman from Battleford <lb/>
that it was heresy, or taknig a stand <lb/>
against everything that was good and <lb/>
right in the direction of the progress of <lb/>
this country, to bring up a question that <lb/>
he (Mr. Brett) thought was an important <lb/>
one. However, the point of view raised <lb/>
by the amendment was not one that was <lb/>
not without suggestion. If hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men would read the paragraph in the <lb/>
memorial upon which the amendment was <lb/>
based, they would see there was practical <lb/>
invitation to the House to discuss one or <lb/>
more vital questions. There was an in<lb break="no"/>vitation there to discuss distinctly they <lb/>
principle involved in the amendment. It <lb/>
distinctly stated "one or more." If there <lb/>
happened to be a number of gentlemen in <lb/>
the House who conscientiously believed <lb/>
that when the time does come for the <lb/>
division of the Territories, and that it <lb/>
should not be a question of, one but of <lb/>
two, it was a proper thing and a proper <lb/>
time to discuss that in the frankest and <lb/>
fullest manner. That was the reason the <lb/>
amendment had been presented. So far <lb/>
as being unanimous, he dared say the <lb/>
House could be made perfectly unanimous. <lb/>
He did not think there was a dissenting <lb/>
voice in the House with reference to the <lb/>
memorial generally speaking, but there <lb/>
was a difference of opinion with reference <lb/>
to whether there should be one or two <lb/>
provinces. The hon. member for Macleod <lb/>
Mr. Haultain) wished the House to un<lb break="no"/>derstand that if the amendment was <lb/>
accepted it would practically nullify the <lb/>
whole of the memorial. If the amend<lb break="no"/>ment did that then most undoubtedly the <lb/>
clause as it appeared in the memorial <lb/>
nullified the balance of it. The amend<lb break="no"/>ment anticipated going on for some time <lb/>
at least on the lines indicated by the <lb/>
memorial, only that it asked that amend<lb break="no"/>ments be passed at next session of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment at Ottawa. So that the amendment <lb/>
aimed at really being immediately pro<lb break="no"/>gressive in that direction while the mem<lb break="no"/>orial did not. It had been asked, on what <lb/>
credit would the province of Alberta bor<lb break="no"/>row money? He answered, on precisely <lb/>
the same kind of credit as Manitoba <lb/>
borrowed money. Manitoba had no lands <lb/>
to pledge any more than they had; she <lb/>
pledged the credit of the province in its <lb/>
future on the public buildings already <lb/>
existing and hereafter to be built, and <lb/>
Alberta could take the same basis of <lb/>
credit, only with this difference, that Al<lb break="no"/>berta would have a very much larger <lb/>
country, if the extent of country was to <lb/>
be taken into consideration. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:INSI1">MR. INSINGER</persName>,</p>
    
    <p>
in speaking to the amendment, said he <lb/>
did at one time suggest to the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Banff that the amendment would <lb/>
better have come up as an amendment to <lb/>
the memorial as a whole. If it was not <lb/>
opposed to the memorial, then the hon. <lb/>
member must take the horn of the alter<lb break="no"/>native and profess that it did not mean <lb/>
anything at all. The amendment should <lb/>
have been brought in either as an amend<lb break="no"/>ment to the whole memorial, or as a sep<lb break="no"/>arate resolution. <lb/></p> 

<cb/>

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:SIMP1">MR. SIMPSON</persName></p>
    
    <p>
(Red Deer) said he thought the member <lb/>
of the House had no differences of opin<lb break="no"/>ion as to the memorial, and as to the differ<lb break="no"/>ence between the memorial and the <lb/>
amendment, for his part he would be <lb/>
in favor of the memorial as it stood. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:MCCA6">MR. McCAULAY</persName></p>
    
    <p>
(Edmonton) said he had received a good <lb/>
deal of information from listening to the <lb/>
debate. While he was very sorry to find <lb/>
out that Alberta had been charged with <lb/>
        being so — intemperate, he might say <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
(laughter) he had often heard it said <lb/>
that the people in the N.W.T., and es<lb break="no"/>pecially in Alberta, were cheerful drink<lb break="no"/>ers, yet he did not know they could be <lb/>
charged with so much in that line. But <lb/>
with regard to educational matters he <lb/>
thought they were up with the times, that <lb/>
they kept pace with the other parts of the <lb/>
Territories, and he was sorry to hear the <lb/>
insulting remarks of the hon. member <lb/>
for Yorkton respecting that matter. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:INSI1">Mr. Insinger</persName>: I simply tied to explain <lb/>
away certain things which the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Banff had said; but the charge me <lb/>
with having insulted Alberta because I <lb/>
tried to explain away certain insulting <lb/>
references by the hon. member for Banff <lb/>
is wrong. I accepted the actual state<lb break="no"/>ment of the hon. member for Banff, and <lb/>
any reflections upon that statement should <lb/>
not be made towards me, but to the hon. <lb/>
member who made the statement. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA6">Mr. McCaulay</persName>: I will then charge <lb/>
the hon. member with repeating waht the <lb/>
hon. member for Banff did say. (Roars of <lb/>
laughter.) While I accpet that with a <lb/>
good grace and think any hon. member <lb/>
in this House should accept any statement <lb/>
there is one thing: when it comes down <lb/>
to charging Alberta with committing <lb/>
three-quarters of the crime committed in <lb/>
the Territories, I draw the line there <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) Continuing Mr. McCaulay <lb/>
said that while there was very little differ<lb break="no"/>ence, as far as he could see, in the amend<lb break="no"/>ment and the memorial, he thought that <lb/>
they all agreed that the time had now <lb/>
arrived for provincial autonomy. What <lb/>
    then should they quarrel of differ over <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
section where it said "one, two or more?" <lb/>
When the time came it would be time <lb/>
enough to decide whether it should be "one <lb/>
or two or more." Therefore he could not <lb/>
agree with the amendment. He would <lb/>
rather see one good province than two <lb/>
poor ones. He had made up his mind to <lb/>
support the memorial as it stood (Ap<lb break="no"/>plause.) <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:REID3">MR. REID</persName></p>
    
    <p>
(Prince Albert) said that after the <lb/>
expression made use of by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Macleod that he expected to hear <lb/>
an expression from the borders of Sask<lb break="no"/>atchewan as to provincial rights, he might <lb/>
said that they hards nothing of provincial <lb/>
rights from there. There had been, some <lb/>
time ago, a wail from there, as the hon. <lb/>
member for Battleford had said, but it <lb/>
was buried in the back woods. He <lb/>
thought they were going on satisfactorily <lb/>
in the Territories and that the memorial <lb/>
was in the right direction. It had taken <lb/>
the Territories 20 years to reach the pre<lb break="no"/>sent stage and he thought it would, at <lb/>
the present rate of progress, be 20 years <lb/>
more before they were ready for provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MAGR1">Mr. Magrath</persName>: For fear of losing the <lb/>
little support I had in connection with <lb/>
this amendment, I will, with the permis<lb break="no"/>sion of the House, withdraw it. <lb/></p> 

<p>Leave was given, and the amendment <lb/>
was withdrawn. <lb/></p> 

<p>The House then went into committee <lb/>
of the whole at 10:45. Progress was <lb/>
immediately reported. The memorial <lb/>
    passed a second and third time, was [<unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
curred in, and a resolution adopted to the <lb/>
effect that His Honor the Lieut. Gover<lb break="no"/>nor be asked to forward the memorial to <lb/>
the Governor-General-in-Council. <lb/></p> 

<p>Adjournment of the House took place <lb/>
at 10:50. <lb/></p>
