<p>[...]of the delay. He came now to a very <lb/>
important question. Reference had <lb/>
been made in regard to <lb/></p>
 <p rendition="simple:centre">
THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.</p> 

<p>A resolution had been passed by the <lb/>
House last session unanimously and he <lb/>
thought the Government ought to have <lb/>
taken some steps in regard to that <lb/>
resolution. From the correspondence <lb/>
laid on the table it seemed that the <lb/>
Government had delayed the matter <lb/>
so long that the Dominion Government <lb/>
had not been able to deal with the <lb/>
matter while the House of Commons <lb/>
was in session. Had the question been <lb/>
taken up earlier the Assembly might <lb/>
have possibly been in a position to <lb/>
have dealt with it during its present <lb/>
session. <lb/></p>
 <p>
In this connection the commissioner <lb/>
of public works had intimated that we <lb/>
had not sufficient money to meet <lb/>
various expenditures. These state<lb break="no"/>ments had been made for the last four <lb/>
sessions, and yet the Government had <lb/>
nothing to offer them. The commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of public works said it was not <lb/>
within the powers of the Assembly to <lb/>
announce a policy, its only duty was <lb/>
to protect the interests of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies as far as it could. This, however, <lb/>
was hardly in keeping with some <lb/>
statements made by the leader of the <lb/>
Government in former years. The <lb/>
hon. leader had said he would be un<lb break="no"/>willing to agree to the same terms as <lb/>
Manitoba, but in view of the state<lb break="no"/>ments made by the commissioner of <lb/>
public works, he was willing to take <lb/>
even worse than Manitoba took, if it <lb/>
was offered. (Mr. Haultain: No , no.) <lb/>
The late commissioner of public works <lb/>
would not agree to terms unless we <lb/>
received a million a year, but the pre<lb break="no"/>sent one would assent to $400,000. <lb/></p>
 <p>
Premier Haultain said that was not <lb/>
the case. What Mr. Sifton had said <lb/>
was that the worst treatment they <lb/>
could expect on the basis of Manitoba <lb/>
was $400,000. <lb/></p>
 <p>
Mr. D. H. McDonald continuing said <lb/>
another question was the management <lb/>
of the ſands of this country. The <lb/>
commissioner of public works was <lb/>
willing to let the lands go for a consid<lb break="no"/>eration, whereas the leader of the <lb/>
Government had said we had a right <lb/>
to the lands and minerals, and that <lb/>
the claim could be successfully pro<lb break="no"/>secuted. There was evidently a divi<lb break="no"/>sion on the point which ought to be <lb/>
cleared up. <lb/></p>
 
 <p>
The hon. gentleman  on resuming his <lb/>
seat was cheered by his supporters. <lb/></p>

<p>The following is a continuation of <lb/>
the debate on the Budget. It will be <lb/>
remembered that the last issue contain<lb break="no"/>ed Mr. A. L. Sifton's speech in intro<lb break="no"/>ducing the estimates, and the reply of <lb/>
Mr. H. McDonald, leader of the <lb/>
Opposition. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ELLI1">Dr. Elliot</persName> was the next speaker. <lb/>
He said that he had much pleasure in <lb/>
congratulating the Territorial trea<lb break="no"/>surer on the excellent impression his <lb/>
speech had made upon the House and <lb/>
would no doubt make upon the coun<lb break="no"/>try. The whole matter had been mere<lb break="no"/>ly touched with the point of a pin by <lb/>
the leader of the Opposition. The <lb/>
criticisms had been of the two-penny-<lb break="yes"/>half-penny sort that did not commend <lb/>
themselves even to the narrowest-<lb break="yes"/>minded people. If the Opposition <lb/>
wished to gain the confidence and re<lb break="no"/>spect of the people of the Territories <lb/>
they would have to indulge in a differ<lb break="no"/>ent class of criticism. Mr. McDonald <lb/>
advocated decrease of salaries yet <lb/>
he made no attempt to show incom<lb break="no"/>petency on the part of officials, or <lb/>
that others elsewhere were getting less. <lb/>
The Opposition then charged that a <lb/>
great deal of money was wasted on in<lb break="no"/>spection, and then attempted to prove <lb/>

<cb/>

that work was being done without <lb/>
adequate inspection. That was not <lb/>
very consistent. Everything they pro<lb break="no"/>posed relating to public works, educa<lb break="no"/>tion, public health and asylums in <lb/>
Manitoba, was for an increase, at the <lb/>
same time they were crying out for a <lb/>
decrease in expenditure. He congratu<lb break="no"/>lated the Government on their manly <lb/>
stand in giving the people the benefit <lb/>
of public works even beyond the reven<lb break="no"/>ues of the year, and he defended the <lb/>
policy in regard to test wells, in buy<lb break="no"/>ing machinery supposed to be adequate <lb/>
and afterwards obtaining machines <lb/>
which would go to greater distances to <lb/>
complete the work. He argued that <lb/>
the Red Deer bridge and the others <lb/>
had been sufficient to stand under or<lb break="no"/>dinary circumstances, but had been <lb/>
destroyed by unprecedented floods. <lb/>
It was unfortunate that the bridges <lb/>
referred to should have been lost <lb/>
at the time when money was <lb/>
scarce; but of the 1,100 bridges <lb/>
existing it would be strange if some <lb/>
were not destroyed. Of the 300 bridges <lb/>
constructed since the reorganisation of <lb/>
the department only three had been <lb/>
destroyed; could anybody want a <lb/>
more favourable report? The C.P.R. <lb/>

<cb/>

were continually losing bridges. He <lb/>
believed that scarcely a year passed <lb/>
but some were washed away. As to <lb/>
works for which tenders had been ask<lb break="no"/>ed, in almost all cases the tenders had <lb/>
to be refused and in a few cases there <lb/>
were no tenders. Work had been done <lb/>
much better by day labor than by con<lb break="no"/>tract and that was generally the case. <lb/>
The speeches about work done in <lb/>
frozen ground would not make good <lb/>
immigration literature. The complaints <lb/>
had really nothing in them. In some <lb/>
cases the ground was in fine condition <lb/>
when the instructions were sent, <lb/>
but was frozen afterwards. Last <lb/>
night certain education resolutions <lb/>
were proposed and the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions introduced a new system of dis<lb break="no"/>tributing grants, a system of equalising <lb/>
burdens which endeavors to give poor<lb break="no"/>er and weaker districts a little better <lb/>
assistance than the stronger. He <lb/>
supported the system, though it would <lb/>
probably strike his own district as <lb/>
severely as any in the Territories. <lb/>
The leader of the Opposition said <lb/>
that some of the wealthier classes, <lb/>
people who own large herds of cattle, <lb/>
are escaping taxation through the <lb/>
single tax system, but he did not tell <lb/>
the committee that he himself would <lb/>
probably, save $60 a year. The system <lb/>
of direct taxation of lands would not <lb/>
be the best system in every district of <lb/>
the country, but it must be considered, <lb/>
not from an individual point of view, <lb/>
but from that of the interests of the <lb/>
whole country. Though, it might be <lb/>
detrimental to a few districts, in the <lb/>
vast majority it would be of great <lb/>
benefit. The Opposition said there <lb/>
was no occasion to have a commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of agriculture, but he maintain<lb break="no"/>ed that, there was ample work for the <lb/>
commissioner of agriculture and for <lb/>
the other commissioners also. He con<lb break="no"/>gratulated the treasurer on the clear <lb/>
and careful manner in which he had <lb/>
dealt with the subject of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional changes, not making a bombas<lb break="no"/>tic statement but laying down some of <lb/>
the grounds on which our claims should <lb/>
be based. The commissioner had not <lb/>
expressed satisfaction with the terms <lb/>
given to Manitoba, as the leader of the <lb/>
Opposition seemed to think, but had <lb/>
said that even if that were the best <lb/>
bargain we could get it would be a <lb/>
great deal better than what we have <lb/>
to-day. The hon. gentleman had said <lb/>
the Government should have taken the <lb/>
people into their confidence and told <lb/>
them everything they were thinking <lb/>
about the question. If he might judge <lb/>
from the lamentable want of know<lb break="no"/>ledge displayed by the leader of the <lb/>
Opposition it would indeed have been <lb/>
well that the Government should have <lb/>
educated him at least. <lb/></p> 

<p>It being 5:30 o''clock the Speaker left <lb/>
the chair and resuming on Friday <lb/>
morning, <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ELLI1">Dr. Elliott</persName> continued to deal with the <lb/>
question of <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">PROVINCIAL AUTONOMY.</p>

  
  <p>
   He reffered to the railway grants given <lb/>
to specific railways and supported Mr. <lb/>
A. L. Sifton's contention that the <lb/>
Territories should receive compensa<lb break="no"/>tion from such lands, given away large<lb break="no"/>ly, not for the special benefit of, but to <lb/>
the detriment of the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories; and for the benefit of the <lb/>
Dominion at large. Dr. Elliot con<lb break="no"/>cluded by ridiculing the idea that the <lb/>
system of taxation in the two classes <lb/>
of local improvement districts were <lb/>
drastic systems. They were such as <lb/>
commended themselves to the majority <lb/>
of the people. The large and the small <lb/>
local improvement districts were an <lb/>
excellent system. He also defended <lb/>
the management of the official Gazette, <lb/>
and the policy of the department of <lb/>
agriculture in securing the return of <lb/>
90 per cent. of estray animals to their <lb/>
owners, as reflecting credit in the de<lb break="no"/>partment. <lb/>
  <lb/></p>
  <p rendition="simple:centre">
<persName ref="pers:MCKA6">MR. THOMAS M'KAY</persName></p>
  
  <p>
said the speech of the Territorial <lb/>
Treasurer was a business-like state<lb break="no"/>ment and so far he could congratulate <lb/>
him; but after all he was only making <lb/>
the best he could of a very bad cause. <lb/>
Any differences of opinion in that <lb/>
House were as to the way the money <lb/>
was expended. They had not yet any<lb break="no"/>thing to do with the revenue. Very <lb/>
serious mistakes had been made. The <lb/>
Government had no familiarised <lb/>
themselves as they should have done <lb/>
with the wants of the country, particu<lb break="no"/>larly in regard to public works. Al<lb break="no"/>though apparently in a bankrupt state <lb/>
the members of the Government were <lb/>
not prepared to make any sacrifices, <lb/>
but voted themselves $2,000 for "extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary services." The $13,000 increase <lb/>

   <cb/>

for civil service would have given a <lb/>
good many school grants and built a <lb/>
   good many culverts and bridges. He <lb/>
   condemmed the increase in the number <lb/>
   of ministers and complained that re<lb break="turns"/>turns asked for had not been brought <lb/>
   down. He did not approve of the <lb/>
   voting of a bulk sum for the construc<lb break="no"/>tion of roads as a system liable to <lb/>
   abuse. He thought the item should <lb/>
   have been voted in detail. The late <lb/>
   commissioner of public works has dis<lb break="no"/>cussed the question of a province and <lb/>
   had shown the position the House <lb/>
   should take; he said there were still <lb/>
   85,000,000 acres of land of which the <lb/>
   Territories should have 50,000,000 acres. <lb/>
   That speech had the true ring and he <lb/>
   (Mr. McKay) had been very much sur<lb break="no"/>prised a the speech of the commision<lb break="no"/>er yesterday. He believed the system <lb/>
   of land grants to railways had been <lb/>
   carried too far. The lands were not <lb/>
   alienated from the Government, but <lb/>
   only set aside. The policy might be <lb/>
   changed, as also that of free home<lb break="no"/>steading. This country would never <lb/>
   be prosperous untli the Government <lb/>
   owned the lands, and compensation <lb/>
   should not be accepted. He thought <lb/>
   the Government could refuse to <lb/>
   accept the terms, but there was a <lb/>
   disposition to compromise. If the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment should not be satisfied with <lb/>
   the terms offered, what was to prevent <lb/>
   them resigning. (Cheers). But lead<lb break="no"/>ers of both parites said lands of this <lb/>
   country had been bought by the <lb/>
   Dominion; people here were increas<lb break="no"/>ing the value of the lands for the feder<lb break="no"/>al authorities. We could not, he held, <lb/>
   have control of immigration until we <lb/>
   had control of the land. Three hun<lb break="no"/>dred and forty-five thousand dollars <lb/>
   was given to govern this country; <lb/>
   while the Dominion Government was <lb/>
   spending a larger amount, $400,000 for <lb/>
   immigration to bring in people, leaving <lb/>
   us to look after them. The people <lb/>
   should have an oppotunity of pro<lb break="no"/>nouncing on the policy of going into a <lb/>
   full provincial establishment before <lb/>
   anything further was done in the <lb/>
   matter.</p>
  
  <p rendition="simple:centre">MR. G. W. BROWN,</p>

<p>
 in a speech that was frequently em<lb break="no"/>phasised with sings of approval, joined <lb/>
 his congratulations with those of pre<lb break="no"/>ceding speakers, to the new Territorial <lb/>
 treasurer for his able and lucid speech. <lb/>
 He complimented him on the straight<lb break="no"/>forward, manly way and buisnesslike <lb/>
 manner in which he had placed the <lb/>
 financial condition before the House. <lb/>
 The Territories had reason to congra<lb break="no"/>tulate themselves on thier prosperity, <lb/>
 progress and growth of their insti<lb break="no"/>tutions, political and otherwise. It <lb/>
 had been said that the financial state<lb break="no"/>ment made was without precedent in <lb/>
 anticipating revenue; but the very <lb/>
 same thing had been done in 1894-5-6. <lb/>
 There were public improvments <lb/>
 which were demanded, and this House <lb/>
 owed a duty to the people; if they did <lb/>
 anticipate the revenue, and if it was <lb/>
 impossible to recoup yet the people <lb/>
 would at any rate have the improve<lb break="no"/>ments a year sooner. He defended <lb/>
 the course of the Government in sink<lb break="no"/>ing test wells after the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and private enterprise had <lb/>
 failed. He replied to Mr. McDonald's <lb/>
 criticism of the system of taxation,
 especially in reference to school dis<lb break="no"/>tricts, which exempted personal pro<lb break="no"/>perty. He argued that if any men <lb/>
 should go free it was those who were <lb/>
 giving employment to others and <lb/>
 building up the country by making the <lb/>
 land held by others valuable. When <lb/>
 we have the power to tax the lands we <lb/>
 will have a big control, It did not <lb/>
 matter much who owned the lands if <lb/>
 we had the power to tax them. (Hear, <lb/>
 hear.) In regard to a mandate from <lb/>
 the people about provincial autonomy, <lb/>
 the people of the Territories were <lb/>
 already fully alive to the quesiton and <lb/>
 no appeal to them was necessary. Re<lb break="no"/>ferring to the provincial question he <lb/>
 accused Mr. McKay of stealing his <lb/>
 powder from the speeches of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment members in the past. Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain had explained in the House in <lb/>
 times past what arragements ought <lb/>
 to be made with the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment regarding this country. He also <lb/>
 stated that though the Premier had <lb/>
 shown the full and complete constitu<lb break="no"/>tional rights of this Government and <lb/>
 though the late Minister of Public <lb/>
 Works had discussed the quesiotn at <lb/>
 the last session, the Oppositon had sat <lb/>
 dumb as lobsters. He said that the <lb/>
 bargain the Government expected to <lb/>
 make was the one they were entitled <lb/>
 to. One member of the opposition <lb/>
 criticised the government for delaying <lb/>
 the matter until it was too late to act <lb/>
 this year, and another contended that <lb/>
 the people should have an opportunity
 of expressing themselves. Good as the <lb/>
 governments east and west might be <lb/>
 the people were unanimously in favor of <lb/>
 preserving the Territories for the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, and remaining the most cheap<lb break="no"/>ly and best governed part of the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion. Mr. Brown proceeded to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss the increased necessities of the <lb/>
 country and the greater expenditure <lb/>
 required; and claimed that economy <lb/>
 had been shown that could not be <lb/>
 criticized and would bear the light of <lb/>
 day. Speaking of the increase of <lb/>
 salaries of the members of the execu<lb break="no"/>tive, he said no matter how poor the <lb/>
 country is, it does not want any in<lb break="no"/>dividual to work for it for less than he <lb/>
 is worth. Surelt this country is as im<lb break="no"/>portant as any wholesale house, yet <lb/>
 wholesale houses pay larger salaries to <lb/>
 their managers than were paid to the <lb/>
 executive. This House has all the <lb/>
 duties of an ordinary lesislature and <lb/>
 all the work of the municipalites in <lb/>
 other provinces. These combined took <lb/>
 all the time and services of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the executive, and he was quite <lb/>
 sure the work could not be efficiently <lb/>
 performed with less then three mem<lb break="no"/>bers.
</p>
  <p rendition="simple:centre">THE INDEPENDENT MEMBER.</p>
<p>
 <persName ref="pers:ANNA2">Mr. G. M. Annable</persName> said that he was <lb/>
 very much pleased with part of the <lb/>
 speech of the minister of public works. <lb/>
 He did not object to the increase of <lb/>
 salaries of the ministers; but if his <lb/>
 party were strong enough perhaps he <lb/>
 would move for a still further increase. <lb/>
 He hoped the salaries would be so high <lb/>
 that the ministers would be able to <lb/>
 stay at home and attend to buisness, <lb/>
 and not have to take little jobs from <lb/>
 the Dominion Governments to live on. <lb/>
 The majority of the House evidently <lb/>
 thought they were worth the money. <lb/>
 He would not say whether it was <lb/>
 wise or unwise to spend a <lb/>
 couple of hundred thousand <lb/>
 dollars more than the House has <lb/>
 got; but it was characteristic of the <lb/>
 country to be in debt. The Dominion <lb/>
 is dumping thousands of people into <lb/>
 the country and want us to educate <lb/>
 them and send them to lunatic asylums, <lb/>
 for which many of them were fit sub<lb break="no"/>jects before they came here. That was <lb/>
 not fair. In regard to provincial <lb/>
 autonomy he hoped we should get a <lb/>
 better deal than Manitoba got; and <lb/>
 perhaps we should if the Territories <lb/>
 were represented in the Dominion <lb/>
 House by ten or twelve members, He <lb/>

<cb/>

could not agree with the Opposition in <lb/>
everything they had done, nor did he <lb/>
say they were all bad men; neither <lb/>
did he agree in everything with the <lb/>
Government or approve of all their <lb/>
legislation. If we could not get <lb/>
what we wanted when we were <lb/>
making a provincial deal then it would <lb/>
be the duty of the Government to re<lb break="no"/>sign and let the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment run the affairs. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved that the Opposition had a <lb/>
good effect in causing the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to bring down some good legisla<lb break="no"/>tion. However, he thought that some <lb/>
of the legislation was not good. Re<lb break="no"/>garding the public works department <lb/>
he believed that a lot of work was <lb/>
done. Some was done in his district <lb/>
but he noticed in the past that it was <lb/>
done chiefly every four years. Of <lb/>
course he would not say that it was <lb/>
done for elections purposes. Some of it <lb/>
was well done and some of it was not. <lb/>
Regarding his future course he said <lb/>
that the next session might find him on <lb/>
one side of the House or the other and <lb/>
perhaps he might be as he was at that <lb/>
moment—the leader of his own part. <lb/>
(Laughter). <lb/></p>

  <p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:VILL1">MR. F. VILLENEUVE</persName></p>

  <p>joined in the unanimous concourse of <lb/>
congratulations to the hon, treasurer, <lb/>
congratulating him also on his occupy<lb break="no"/>ing his seat as commissioner of public <lb/>
works. He thought it would be a good <lb/>
thing for the west and the north <lb/>
(laughter) for he had great knowledge <lb/>
of those parts of the country and their <lb/>
needs. He disagreed, however, with <lb/>
him as to his manner of making esti<lb break="no"/>mates, voting $180,000 which they had <lb/>
not got and perhaps never would get <lb/>
unless the Government had greater <lb/>
success than in the past. He protested <lb/>
also against the voting of money in <lb/>
bulk for public works. Details ought <lb/>
to have been given. Replying to Mr. <lb/>
Brown, who had said the Opposition <lb/>
were silent as lobsters, he said a char<lb break="no"/>acteristic of the lobster was to go back<lb break="no"/>wards; he asked who had gone back<lb break="no"/>wards except the Government. They <lb/>
were changing their policy all the <lb/>
time. Another kind of lobsters were <lb/>
those who only opened their mouths to <lb/>
cry "Agreed, agreed." The House <lb/>
ought to have an explanation <lb/>
of what was meant by provincial <lb/>
autonomy,— but the Government <lb/>
submitted no policy. He feared <lb/>
that Northern Alberta would not <lb/>
be properly represented by the <lb/>
Government at the conference. (Oh, <lb/>
oh.) That district was against central<lb break="no"/>isation and wanted two provinces, at <lb/>
least. Everything now had to be done <lb/>
by correspondence and on information <lb/>
and advice of men residing sometimes <lb/>
hundreds of miles from the work to <lb/>
be done. He could assure the executive <lb/>
that the Opposition would give all the <lb/>
advice and assisstance they could to <lb/>
have the best bargain possible made. <lb/>
The members of the Government <lb/>
should be accompanied by the members <lb/>
who represent the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories at Ottawa. The Government <lb/>
should appoint to go with them a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Catholic faith, and one <lb/>
whose language is French. The mem<lb break="no"/>bers for Wolseley and North Regina <lb/>
had reason to be satisfied with the <lb/>
Government because their districts <lb/>
were perfect; but Northern Alberta <lb/>
and St. Albert districts were badly in <lb/>
need of roads and other improvements. <lb/></p>

  <p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:SMIT7">MR. A. S. SMITH</persName></p>

<p>in an effective little speech confined his <lb/>
remarkschiefly to provincial autonomy. <lb/>
He was pleased to hear the treasurer's <lb/>
discussion of the subject and his com<lb break="no"/>parisons with Manitoba. It was for <lb/>
the Government not to lead the House <lb/>
to expect too much. The Territories <lb/>
should benefit by the mistakes of Man<lb break="no"/>itoba. Conditions were now altogether <lb/>
different; the land was now more <lb/>
valuable, and the bargain made by <lb/>
Manitoba would not be acceptable to <lb/>
the Territories at present. At the con<lb break="no"/>ference in 1863, it was recognised that <lb/>
these Territories would cut a great <lb/>
figure in the development of Canada. <lb/>
The financial question here was the <lb/>
great one. The C.P.R. was a Dominion <lb/>
undertaking, part of the bargain by <lb/>
which British Columbia was brought <lb/>
into the Dominion. We pay <lb/>
our full share of the interest of <lb/>
the debt of Canada that built <lb/>
the railways. It was to be regretted <lb/>
that this country would not <lb/>
have a greater say than it has when <lb/>
the question of provincial autonomy <lb/>
comes before the Dominion parliament. <lb/>
He was a little disappointed with the <lb/>
position of the Opposition on the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy question. The mem<lb break="no"/>ber for West Calgary had cited Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and some of the States: and he <lb/>
thought this Territory as well able to <lb/>
manage its affairs as any of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. The railway question was not <lb/>
likely to be the chief question, especial<lb break="no"/>ly in the eastern district. He approved <lb/>
of the policy of voting for public works <lb/>
the money which was absolutely neces<lb break="no"/>sary, notwithstanding the money for <lb/>
them was not in sight. In regard to <lb/>
the commissioner of agriculture he <lb/>
thought it would be just as ridiculous <lb/>
to do away with the head of the agri<lb break="no"/>cultural department as it would be to <lb/>
do away with the department. In re<lb break="no"/>gard to the salaries it was a cheap way <lb/>
of getting praise for economy to vote <lb/>
for reduction of salaries. He had no <lb/>
desire to see this country, organized <lb/>
into municipalities, and he believed in <lb/>
centralization because it would prevent <lb/>
this. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. PATRICK</persName></p> 

<p>also congratulated the treasurer on the <lb/>
comprehensive, manner in which he <lb/>
had dealt with public questions, and <lb/>
the manner in which he had handled <lb/>
the legislation. He did this all the <lb/>
more readily because he had not agreed <lb/>
with all the legislation: he attributed <lb/>
the "drastic legislation" to the deputy <lb/>
of the department. He thought if the <lb/>
connmissioner had had a little more <lb/>
time to devote to its consideration, he <lb/>
would not have introduced such dras<lb break="no"/>tic legislation. Speaking of water <lb/>
supply, he suggested that the failures <lb/>
in boring for water be paid for by the <lb/>
Government and the successes by the <lb/>
farmiers, as the uncertainty discouraged <lb/>
private enterprise. Theoretically, he <lb/>
believed the statements that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had nothing to do with the <lb/>
provincial autonomy question was cor<lb break="no"/>rect; but practically it was not. The <lb/>
voice of the people would have to be <lb/>
respected. It was not the duty of <lb/>
Canada to deal with this question <lb/>
without giving consideration to the <lb/>
feelings and wishes of the people. The <lb/>
people who had colonized these dis<lb break="no"/>tricts had done so with the under<lb break="no"/>standing that they should ultimately <lb/>
become provinces, and they had the <lb/>
right to insist upon this. He, however, <lb/>
thought that the three organised dis<lb break="no"/>tricts were not too large for one pro<lb break="no"/>vince. If there was one vote he had <lb/>
given in the House which he regretted <lb/>
it was that in favor of the claims made <lb/>
to exercise local government rights in <lb/></p>

<p>the Yukon. The question of including <lb/>
Athabasca or portions of it might be <lb/>
considered in connection with the for<lb break="no"/>mation of a new province. But rather <lb/>
than have any part added to any exist<lb break="no"/>ing province he would favor two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces with portions of Athabasca <lb/>
added. Geographically the portion of <lb/>
 the Territories north of Manitoba be<lb break="no"/>longs to that province and he would be <lb/>
 willing to see it added, as this would <lb/>
be a means of reopening there the <lb/>
question of better terms. He suggest<lb break="no"/>ed that the Territories should make <lb/>
common cause with Manitoba. In re<lb break="no"/>ference to the conference, he asked <lb/>
what constitutional remedy there <lb/>
would be if a bill should be brought <lb/>
down that was not acceptable. He <lb/>
answered that the House should be <lb/>
called together, and, in order that <lb/>
this might be done the treasury should <lb/>
not be left without a dollar in its cof<lb break="no"/>fers. He appreciated the need of pub<lb break="no"/>lic works, but this would not be suffi<lb break="no"/>cient warrant for leaving an empty <lb/>
treasury at what would be the most <lb/>
critical period in the history of the <lb/>
country. Money enough was wanted <lb/>
to be left to call the House together to <lb/>
protest if necessary, and to appeal to <lb/>
the people at the polls. He wanted to <lb/>
hear from the leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment what means he would adopt in <lb/>
that case, to give expression to the <lb/>
opinions of the people. In days gone <lb/>
by Premier Haultain had ever been the <lb/>
champion if the rights of the people; <lb/>
and it was regrettable to see him this <lb/>
session abandoning that position, as <lb/>
was evident from the legislation intro<lb break="no"/>duced. He (Dr. Patrick) had supported <lb/>
the Premier because he championed <lb/>
those rights, but if the hon. gentleman <lb/>
were not willing to assert that the <lb/>
rights of the people must be respected, <lb/>
he could not continue the condifence <lb/>
which he had in his Government in the <lb/>
past. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">A LONG SPEECH.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. R. B. Bennett</persName> is an address that <lb/>
started shortly after 4 p.m., lasted until <lb/>
5:30; was resumed at 8 p.m. and con<lb break="no"/>tinued to 9:30 p.m., added his congrat<lb break="no"/>ulations to the others at the able <lb/>
speech of the Territorial Treasurer. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman was one who had <lb/>
has greatness thrust upon him. His <lb/>
famous brother, the Minister of the <lb/>
Interior, had been called the young <lb/>
Napoleon of the west. Well it was a <lb/>
case of history repeating itself. The <lb/>
great Napoleon was always kind to his <lb/>
brothers, putting one on one throne <lb/>
and one on another and the young <lb/>
Napoleon of the west had placed his <lb/>
elder brother on the throne of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. (Oh! oh!) Well it was very <lb/>
strange that the same telegram that <lb/>
brought the news from Ottawa that <lb/>
Mr. Ross was going to the Yukon also <lb/>
brought the news that Mr. A. L. Sifton <lb/>
was to be commissioner of the public <lb/>
works. It was from Ottawa the news <lb/>
came, not Regina. It was the accident <lb/>
of birth that had made the member <lb/>
for Banff Territorial Treasurer and <lb/>
minister of public works. Mr. Bennett <lb/>
proceeded to criticise the budget speech, <lb/>
characterising it as a speech of "ifs <lb/>
and buts." "If they only had so-and-<lb break="yes"/>so, they would do this or that, "but" <lb/>
they had not, so could not. The pro<lb break="no"/>position before the House should be <lb/>
considered as a business matter. He <lb/>
asked whether the members would ap<lb break="no"/>ply the same principles in their private <lb/>
business. Every dollar of the $467,000 <lb/>
received last year had been expended; <lb/>
and there were large outstanding liabil<lb break="no"/>ities. One item was $11,000, another <lb/>
$30,000, in cannection with public <lb/>
works. A liability of $47,00 in con<lb break="no"/>nection with school grants, which has <lb/>
not yet been paid, making a total of <lb/>
$88,000 of a deficit when the financial <lb/>
statement for the year was received. <lb/>
Another business question was what <lb/>
revenue was expected to be received. <lb/>
The answer was about $413,000. Deduct <lb/>
the $88,000 and you have $325,000. <lb/>
Now pay the local improvement grants, <lb/>
$11,000, and $180,000 to schools, and <lb/>
allowing for a deficit the same as last <lb/>
year, there would remain $267,000. <lb/>
Then it was proposed to anticipate <lb/>
$180,000, there would be $447,000 to <lb/>
meet an expenditure of $590,000. <lb/>
Where will they be in 1902 unless <lb/>
Providence comes to our aid, or we <lb/>
receive a much larger grant from the <lb/>
Dominion Government? Would a sin<lb break="no"/>gle business man discount the future <lb/>
when he had no borrowing powers? <lb/>
In times of financial stringency it is <lb/>
customary to reduce expense. What <lb/>
do we find here? You are asked to <lb/>
say that last year we spent $73,000 for <lb/>
civil government, legislation and ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of justice, or about 17 per <lb/>
cent.; this year the percentage asked <lb/>
was about 21 per cent., or $86,000, as <lb/>
against $73,000. Would any sharehold<lb break="no"/>ers adopt such a report from their <lb/>
directors? The Opposition existed <lb/>
because of public clamor and a desire <lb/>
that the legislation should be imparti<lb break="no"/>ally and intelligently criticised. <lb/>
He thought there would have been no <lb/>
difficulty if the Government had taken <lb/>
this position towards the Dominion, <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">EITHER GIVE US MONEY,</p> 

<p>or we will not provide roads, bridges <lb/>
or schools for the immigrants you <lb/>
send. If the executive had come to <lb/>
the House and said, "They refuse us <lb/>
our rights, and justice," and had ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to the people they would have <lb/>
been supported by all the members, <lb/>
and by the country. He proceeded to <lb/>
criticise the outcome of the policy of <lb/>
centralisation, denying to some of the <lb/>
people the right of self-government, <lb/>
while others are entrusted with repre<lb break="no"/>sentatitve institutions. The deputy <lb/>
commissioner of public works was an <lb/>
able executive officer, but he should <lb/>
not be entrusted with legislation; the <lb/>
legislation to take away the rights of <lb/>
the people to self-government was his <lb/>
legislation. It had been said that the <lb/>
policy of the administration was found <lb/>
in the ordinances. The publication of <lb/>
these had cost $20,000, but of what use <lb/>
were they to the people or to the <lb/>
magistrates? They were completely <lb/>
changed every session. Again, a system <lb/>
was needed to secure permanent roads <lb/>
and improvement of the main lines <lb/>
of communication and what had been <lb/>
done? The minister had gone back to <lb/>
the old system of district engineers <lb/>
after it had been abandoned for a year. <lb/>
He blamed the Government for inac<lb break="no"/>tion and inability, resulting in 2,000 <lb/>
unsettled cases of right of way claims <lb/>
under the expropriation ordinance. A <lb/>
section had given power to go to <lb/>
the supreme court, but the Government <lb/>
had not availed themselves of it. <lb/>
Referring to what Dr. Elliott had <lb/>
said about the Red Deer bridge he <lb/>
(Mr. Bennett) stated on the authority <lb/>
of men competent to judge that the <lb/>
bridge was improperly built. He pro<lb break="no"/>tested against estimates in bulk, as <lb/>
used as an engine of oppression against <lb/>
the people, and as a dangerous power <lb/>
to give to one man to locate public <lb/>
works, and to say to the electors, "If <lb/>
you want schools, road or bridges, vote <lb/>
for this man." Speaking of salaries, <lb/>
he contended that every man should <lb/>
be paid what he was worth: that it <lb/>
pays to have a good men and pay them <lb/>
good salaries. But was this the time <lb/>
to increase salaries? In times of <lb/>
financial stress it was customary to re<lb break="no"/>duce salaries. The late treasurer <lb/>
served the country well and received <lb/>
$2,500. Was the present treasuerer's <lb/>
services worth more? It ill became <lb/>
him at such a time to make the first <lb/>
break by increasing his salary. The <lb/>

<cb/>

sacrifice should not all be borne by the <lb/>
"moss back," a portion should be <lb/>
borne by these gentlemen who are <lb/>
living in luxury, devoting half their <lb/>
time to the public service and the <lb/>
other half to matters political in sup<lb break="no"/>port of the Dominion Government. <lb/>
The commissioner of public works had <lb/>
left the impression that the lands of the <lb/>
Territories were all alienated; but the <lb/>
fact was that half the lands shown on <lb/>
his colored map were homestead lands, <lb/>
while only a small portion of the <lb/>
others were really alienated. He quoted from <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre">A SPEECH FROM MR. ROSS,</p> 

<p>the late treasurer, last year, that there <lb/>
were 50,000,00 acres still left over and <lb/>
above those taken for railroad pur<lb break="no"/>poses, and 35,000,000 acres allowed for <lb/>
cost of the administration. Turning to the <lb/>
remedy, he said, after reading the <lb/>
memorials that had been sent, he did <lb/>
not wonder that nothing had been ob<lb break="no"/>tained. The government had not met <lb/>
the difficulty as they should have done. <lb/>
The prescription by the Territorial <lb/>
treasurer was provincial autonomy. <lb/>
This was a very large question. He <lb/>
had occupied an independent position <lb/>
in reference to this question, and was <lb/>
prepared to give hearty support to any <lb/>
proposition or any set of men adequate <lb/>
to meet the growing necessities of the <lb/>
question. Should the House know <lb/>
anything about the terms proposed or <lb/>
not? Should they know whether <lb/>
there was to be one province or two <lb/>
provinces? Whether they were to <lb/>
have the lands or compensation, and <lb/>
whether they should have the miner<lb break="no"/>als? Before the terms and conditions <lb/>
were agreed upon this House should <lb/>
have an opportunity of discussing <lb/>
them. Why should the House not <lb/>
have had some of these terms before <lb/>
them this year? Next session the Bill <lb/>
was to be brought down, the time <lb/>
would not be adequate to consider <lb/>
them. He suggested that after the <lb/>
conference at Ottawa, immediately on <lb/>
the proposals being known, let the <lb/>
House be called together to discuss <lb/>
them; and, if necessary, let there be a <lb/>
dissolution, and let the people pro<lb break="no"/>nounce upon them. He held that this <lb/>
country should have, if not all, the <lb/>
major part of the lands, and also its <lb/>
minerals. We demand these, they <lb/>
will bring us revenue. If any servies <lb/>
of his could assist the Attorney-General <lb/>
they would be given. He would <lb/>
never accept any terms as being <lb/>
the same as were given to Manitoba <lb/>
and he was sure of this that the people <lb/>
would keep on demanding until their <lb/>
grievances were removed. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. R. S. LAKE</persName></p> 

<p>replied to Mr. Bennett's remarks on <lb/>
the ministers having taken part in <lb/>
Dominion political matters, and he de<lb break="no"/>fended the local Government against <lb/>
the charge that they had used unfair <lb/>
influences in the election in Eastern <lb/>
Assiniboia. He himself was a candi<lb break="no"/>date and knew nothing of such in<lb break="no"/>fluences. He did not agree with the <lb/>
doctrine that members of the House <lb/>
should not take part in Dominion <lb/>
political matters. He denied that the <lb/>
supporters of the Government had <lb/>
sneered and jeered at Mr. Bennett's <lb/>
first speech; and said that the gentle<lb break="no"/>man's undoubted ability as a speaker <lb/>
made no impression because of his <lb/>
rash statements. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:HAUL2">PREMIER HAULTAIN</persName></p> 

<p>who on rising was received with <lb/>
applause said that he and the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had been accused of telling the <lb/>
old old story. If so one would have <lb/>
thought they would have been met with <lb/>
the old old criticism. That, however, <lb/>
was not so and he had to object to and <lb/>
protest against the style and scope of <lb/>
the criticisms. The Opposition had <lb/>
found that three bridges out of three <lb/>
hundred had been swept away, and <lb/>
two school districts had not been paid. <lb/>
They had discovered things that every<lb break="no"/>body knew last year. The whole criti<lb break="no"/>cism had been founded on misconcep<lb break="no"/>tion of the facts, figures and arguments <lb/>
of the member for Banff. The House <lb/>
had listened to a federal political har<lb break="no"/>angue for the first time. The references <lb/>
to the "Napoleon of the West" and the <lb/>
insinuation as to influences brought to <lb/>
bear on him (Mr. Haultain) with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to a choice of a successor to Mr. <lb/>
Ross were absolutely indecent; and <lb/>
the statements of the hon. gentleman <lb/>
were entirely untrue. He denied that <lb/>
members of the Government or officials <lb/>
had gone about influencing electors; <lb/>
or that any bulk grants had been im<lb break="no"/>properly used. Attacks had been made <lb/>
on the deputy minister of public works <lb/>
and a gentleman who had just joined <lb/>
the service, both of them unwarrranted <lb/>
and foundationless. There were a large <lb/>
number of things in the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's address. The policy of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was referred to as an experi<lb break="no"/>ment and they had been censured for <lb/>
amending so many ordinances. For <lb/>
his part he hoped that for many years <lb/>
the policy, institutions and laws would <lb/>
have to be changed every year. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) It had been suggested that if the <lb/>
Dominion Government refused to treat <lb/>
the Territories liberally the Assembly <lb/>
should resign and leave the Federal <lb/>
Government to carry on the business. <lb/>
This would be to take the attitude of a <lb/>
sulky boy. The first part of the speech <lb/>
of the member for West Calgary had <lb/>
been delivered before; and the second <lb/>
ought to have been made a year ago. <lb/>
He took exception to the statement <lb/>
that the faith of Canada had been com<lb break="no"/>mitted to three provinces. He pointed <lb/>
out that the province of Quebec and <lb/>
that of British Columbia were each <lb/>
larger in area than the three districts. <lb/>
of the Territories. The debate had at <lb/>
any rate brought out the policy of the <lb/>
Opposition. Their policy last year was <lb/>
a reduction of $2,500 in general ex<lb break="no"/>penses, this year they had expanded a <lb/>
little on the magnificent sum. They <lb/>
protested against forced taxation with<lb break="no"/>out representation, yet they said they <lb/>
supported large local improvement dis<lb break="no"/>tricts. He took as official the declaration <lb/>
of the member for St. Albert that he <lb/>
was opposed to centralization. The <lb/>
only alternative to the system was a <lb/>
municipal system. Another portion of <lb/>
their policy was the statement of the <lb/>
member for West Calgary that there <lb/>
was no difference between a corpora<lb break="no"/> 


<cb/>


tion and a Government. There had <lb/>
been corporation leanings on the other <lb/>
side of the House. As explained by the <lb/>
treasurer the increase in Civil Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had been about $6,000 not $13,000. <lb/>
The Government accepted the offer of <lb/>
help from the member of West Calgary <lb/>
but it should have been offered last <lb/>
year. There had been no change of <lb/>
front no change of opnion on the part <lb/>
of the Government. The treasurer had <lb/>
said the change of their political status <lb/>
would have to be justified; unless the <lb/>
House could prove that they would be <lb/>
better off the change would not be <lb/>
justified. It was a simple fact that the <lb/>
power of final settlement was with the <lb/>
Dominion Government. This did <lb/>
not mean that the Government <lb/>
would acquiesce in any impossible <lb/>
terms. He would be absolutely un<lb break="no"/>willing to have a province established <lb/>
on the same terms as those given to <lb/>
Manitoba. He did not admit that any <lb/>
particular nationality or creed had a <lb/>
claim to representation in the con<lb break="no"/>ference to discuss Territorial matters. <lb/>
With regard to the time of negotiations <lb/>
and the manner in which they had <lb/>
been conducted. Immediately after <lb/>
the raising of the Assembly the memo<lb break="no"/>rial had been sent. The federal min<lb break="no"/>isters were then going all over the <lb/>
country looking after the Dominion <lb/>
elections, and a conference was impos<lb break="no"/>sible. The minister of the interior had <lb/>
taken action before the Territorial <lb/>
treasurer had joined the Government. <lb/>
If made a province without proper <lb/>
terms they would go on kicking and <lb/>
continue kicking until they got them. <lb/>
Extra representation at Ottawa based <lb/>
on the census would be urged. He <lb/>
would demand more than this, <lb/>
viz, the representation to be based <lb/>
on more than prospective popu<lb break="no"/>lation. With regard to negotia<lb break="no"/>tions, Mr. Haultain assured the <lb/>
House that the Government would <lb/>
continue to urge the claims which they <lb/>
had advocated. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:HAWK1">MR. J. B. HAWKES</persName></p> 

<p>said that the Opposition were not here to <lb/>
propound a policy, but when they <lb/>
reached the treasury benches they <lb/>
would have a progressive policy. He <lb/>
advocated a Territorial Government <lb/>
and Opposition; coalition governments <lb/>
were dangerous, and he wanted a Grit <lb/>
or Conservative Government on Terri<lb break="no"/>torial lines. He objected to the minister <lb/>
of agriculture receiving a salary from <lb/>
this country and lowering himself to <lb/>
be a scrutineer in an election. He pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded to read several letters to show <lb/>
that the minister of agriculture had <lb/>
used his influence in the last election. <lb/>
He thought the civil servants were <lb/>
poorly paid but there were too many <lb/>
of them. The Government were not <lb/>
doing enough to secure water for the <lb/>
people. It was not true that private <lb/>
enterprise and Dominion Government <lb/>
enterprise had failed in this. He gave <lb/>
instances of public works that had been <lb/>
badly constructed. There must be <lb/>
something radically wrong in the school <lb/>
system where there were children thir<lb break="no"/>teen years of age who had never been <lb/>
at school. The House should endeavor <lb/>
to be unanimous in the matter of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial organization. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:GILL3">Mr. A. B. GILLIS, WHITEWOOD</persName>,</p> 

<p>expressed congratulations that so com<lb break="no"/>petent a man had succeed the late <lb/>
Territorial treasurer, as shown in the <lb/>
budget speech. He was pleased to see <lb/>
an Opposition in the House, and a divi<lb break="no"/>sion on Territorial lines. Speaking of <lb/>
the civil service grant, he was entirely <lb/>
in accord with the increase of the min<lb break="no"/>isters' salaries. The department of <lb/>
agriculture was of such importance <lb/>
that it could not be done without. The <lb/>
question of water supply was one of <lb/>
the most important and difficult; but <lb/>
the efforts put forth were meeting with <lb/>
approval. He was in full accord with <lb/>
the leader of the House in regard to <lb/>
provincial autonomy. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:CONN2">Mr. J. W. CONNELL</persName></p> 

<p>extended his quota of congratulation <lb/>
to the commissioner of public works <lb/>
and to the members of the Opposition. <lb/>
The policy of the Government was <lb/>
national and also rational. The criti<lb break="no"/>cisms offered by some of the members <lb/>
of the Opposition did not appear to him <lb/>
to have much solidity. Ten thousand <lb/>
political souls like those could find <lb/>
ample waltzing room on the point of a <lb/>

<p>replied to the statements of the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for south Regina. He was prepared <lb/>
to show all the corrrespondence in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the letters read, and <lb/>
denied that he had any intention of <lb/>
influencing the young man's vote in <lb/>
the election. He was not aware that <lb/>
there was anything disreputable in <lb/>
acting as scrutineer in an election; if <lb/>
there was then the hon, member who <lb/>
had spoken probably knew more about <lb/>
it, as he had been one himself. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. C. FISHER</persName></p> 

<p>announced himself as a supporter of <lb/>
the Government's policy. He thought <lb/>
the French Catholics would be well re<lb break="no"/>presented in the conference by Sir <lb/>
Wilfrid Laurier. Oppositions to Gov<lb break="no"/>ernments had always cried extrava<lb break="no"/>gance, but the Government had acted <lb/>
as wisely as possible under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances. He expressed unbounded <lb/>
confidence in the Federal Government <lb/>
and in the Territorial Government as <lb/>
representing the Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:MCDI1">MR. E. C. M'DIARMID</persName></p> 

<p>referred to the shortage of $180,000, <lb/>
and in connection with this the increas<lb break="no"/>ed salaries to the ministers. He did <lb/>
not object to this, but was sorry to <lb/>
notice that the deputy ministers had <lb/>
no increase. If the 2,000 cases about <lb/>
the right of the way should be satisfactorily <lb/>
settled he would support the policy. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:SHER1">MR. J. W. SHERA</persName>,</p> 

<p>as an independent, said he had voted <lb/>
with the Government on some matters <lb/>
and against them on others. He <lb/>
thought any one capable of perform<lb break="no"/>ing the duties of members of the <lb/>
Government should receive the <lb/>
increased salary voted. He did not <lb/>
think the commissioner of public <lb/>
works would be influenced by the fact <lb/>
of his being a brother of the minster <lb/></p> 

<cb/>

<p>of the interior. He would not say at <lb/>
present whether he was in favor of one <lb/>
province, or two, or three, but would <lb/>
await the announcement of the pro<lb break="no"/>posals. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:centre"><persName ref="pers:SIFT2">Mr. A. L. SIFTON</persName></p> 

<p>on rising to close the debate was loud<lb break="no"/>ly applauded and delivered a dashing <lb/>
and masterly reply. He said the de<lb break="no"/>bate had assumed a more important <lb/>
form than a mere discussion of the de<lb break="no"/>tails of the estimates. It was with a <lb/>
feeling of satisfaction he had listened <lb/>
to the discussions, and had been pleas<lb break="no"/>ed with the flattering expressions to<lb break="no"/>wards himself that had been uttered. <lb/>
The criticisms of the disposition of the <lb/>
funds had been rather small. The <lb/>
amount available for roads, drainage <lb/>
and bridges was $102,000 for the whole <lb/>
of the Territories. Of this $65,000 had <lb/>
been asked for by the constituencies <lb/>
represented by ten gentlemen, and the <lb/>
remaining $35,000 by 21 gentlemen. <lb/>
He didn't think that the feelings ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by the member for West <lb/>
Prince Albert as to the increase of <lb/>
salaries were shared by the members <lb/>
of the House. In 1892 for sometime <lb/>
the present Premier was the only paid <lb/>
member of the Government. In Sep<lb break="no"/>tember, that year, in the middle of the <lb/>
year, two members were provided for <lb/>
with one-third of the present popula<lb break="no"/>tion and the amount voted for salaries <lb/>
was $4,500. He did not, therefore, <lb/>
think there was much to complain <lb/>
about. In regard to well boring, he ad<lb break="no"/>mitted there were farmers who would <lb/>
like wells on their farms; but the <lb/>
wester portion of the Territories re<lb break="no"/>quired exceptional treatment in the <lb/>
matter of bridges, and the eastern in <lb/>
regard to water supply. The policy of <lb/>
the Government was to put no well <lb/>
on private property. It was unfortun<lb break="no"/>ate that the member for West Calgary <lb/>
should waste his talents in insinuations <lb/>
against the honor of some one in or <lb/>
out of the House. The Government <lb/>
had two engineers in its employ who <lb/>
were equal to any in this country. <lb/>
He had written to an engineer in re<lb break="no"/>ference to the bridge at Red Deer, and <lb/>
received his opinion that it would have <lb/>
stood in an ordinary year. <lb/></p> 

<p>When Mr. Sifton had concluded the <lb/>
motion was put and carried and the <lb/>
House went into committee of supply, <lb/>
Deputy Speaker Gillis in the chair. <lb/>
After a few minutes' consideration of <lb/>
the first resolution in reference to the <lb/>
estimate for civil service (executive <lb/>
council), Mr. Bennett moved an <lb/>
amendment for which only five mem<lb break="no"/>bers voted, to reduce the item by $4,<lb break="no"/>500, including the salary increases. <lb/>
The committee rose and reported pro<lb break="no"/>gress at 1:30 a.m. <lb/></p>

BENNETT'S LONG RESOLUTION. <lb/></p>
  <p>
<persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. R. B. Bennett</persName> moved a very <lb/>
long resolution. It pointed out that <lb/>
the speech from the throne set forth <lb/>
that the Dominion Government had <lb/>
not given any indications of its inten-  <lb/>
tions in regard to the representations <lb/>
made to them on the inadequacy of the <lb/>
revenue of the Territories. The resolu<lb break="no"/>tion went on to state that the liabilities <lb/>
incurred by the Legislature in 1899 and <lb/>
1900 much exceeded the resources in <lb/>
each of those years; and that a similar <lb/>
state of affairs characterised 1901. The <lb/>
resolution concluded with expressing <lb/>
the opinion that the Government <lb/>
ought to have placed before the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Legislature the fullest in; <lb/>
formation of the Territorial financial <lb/>
position before the prorogation of the <lb/>
Dominion Parliauient; and deemed it <lb/>
inexpedient and unjust that the <lb/>
salaries of the executive should have <lb/>
been increased; and other expendi<lb break="no"/>tures incurred in view of impending <lb/>
constitutional changes, which it re<lb/></p>

<p>regarding as a menance to our rights and <lb/>
detrimental to the interests and future <lb/>
of the Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p>He said that his object in proposing <lb/>
the resolution was to place on record the <lb/>
views of the Opposition. The House, <lb/>
he contended, should have been taken <lb/>
into the confidence of the Government, <lb/>
but the estimates had not been brought <lb/>
down until after the Dominion House <lb/>
had prorogued. It was a very serious <lb/>
condition of affairs that, while the <lb/>
revenue amounted to only $413,000, <lb/>
there were obligations of over $647,000. <lb/>
This discounting the future was over<lb break="no"/>stepping their consitutional powers, <lb/>
as they had no power to borrow money <lb/>
on the public credit. He deemed it his <lb/>
bounden duty to place on record his <lb/>
strong protest against the expediency, <lb/>
unfairness and injustice of increasing <lb/>
the cost of executive government. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD6">Mr. D. H. McDonald</persName> seconded the <lb/>
motion. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SIFT2">Mr. A. L. Sifton</persName> replied that the <lb/>
greater part of the resolution was <lb/>
taken from his address in explanation <lb/>
of the public accounts; the only part <lb/>
in addition to this was the clause stat<lb break="no"/>ing that the hon. gentlemen had no <lb/>
confidence in the manner in which the <lb/>
Government had prepared and the <lb/>
House had passed the estimates. He <lb/>
was quite within his privilege to secure <lb/>
a setting forth of his views, though it <lb/>
was questionable whether it would <lb/>
not have been better to do this in <lb/>
another way, pointing out specific <lb/>
items. It was also within the rights <lb/>
of the House to refuse to pass the <lb/>
motion. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> would have supported <lb/>
the resolution but for the assurances <lb/>
which the Government had given that <lb/>
the people, through their representa<lb break="no"/>tives, and perhaps by appeal to them<lb break="no"/>selves, would have opportunity of pro<lb break="no"/>nouncing on the terms offered by the <lb/>
Dominion Government. He had con<lb break="no"/>fidence to believe that if the Dominion <lb/>
Government should be bent upon a <lb/>
course that would interfere with the <lb/>
wishes of the people of Eastern <lb/>
Assiniboia, the government here would <lb/>
call the House together, and there <lb/>
would be a sufficient proportion of the <lb/>
revenue left unexpended to provide for <lb/>
taking an expression of the wishes of <lb/>
the people if necessary. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. R. S. Lake</persName> asked whether the <lb/>
total suppression of public works <lb/>
would be endorsed by the opposition. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BENN5">Mr. R. B. Bennett</persName> replied that it was <lb/>
not the duty of the opposition to point <lb/>
out where particular items of reduc<lb break="no"/>tion should be made, but they con<lb break="no"/>tended that, in view of the statements <lb/>
in the speech from the throne, it was <lb/>
the imperative duty of the government <lb/>
to place before every member of the <lb/>
House the fullest possible information <lb/>
in order that there might be no lack of <lb/>
efficiency in the public service. The <lb/>
member for the Grenfell must be well <lb/>
aware that the opposition did not ask <lb/>
that all public works should be stopped, <lb/>
but they believed the demands for in<lb break="no"/>crease of subsidy were just and would <lb/>
have been received if the House had <lb/>
been taken into consultation before <lb/>
the Dominion parliament was pro<lb break="no"/>rogued: <lb/></p> 

<p>The motion was lost on the following <lb/>
division: <lb/></p> 

<p>For—McDonald, Bennett, Villeneuve, <lb/>
McKay and McLeod.—5. <lb/></p> 

<p>Against—Haultain, Sifton, Bulyea, <lb/>
Brown, Meyers, Elliot, Cross, Greeley, <lb/>
 Rosenroll, Lake, Smith, Patrick, Con<lb break="no"/>nell, McCauley, Simpson, Wallace, <lb/>Gillis, Shera.—18.</p>
  
  <p rendition="simple:centre">PROROGATION</p>
  
  <p>At 4 p.m. His Honor the Lieutenant <lb/>
   Governor entered the House and gave <lb/>
   assent to thirty-four bills, which with <lb/>
   the eight previously assented to makes <lb/>
   forty-two all told. It was a rainy, <lb/>
   dirty, slushy, muddy day, and the func<lb break="no"/>tion was performed without ceremony. <lb/>
   In proroguing the House His Honor <lb/>
   spoke as follows:—

   <p>
    In bringing this session of the legislative as<lb break="no"/>sembly to a close, I have to express mt satifac<lb break="no"/>tion at the industry and zeal which—extended <lb/>

   <p>
    I have to express my regret that the efforts made by my government to induce the federal <lb/>

    that measure of success the importance of the <lb/>
    requirements and neccessities of the Territories <lb/>
