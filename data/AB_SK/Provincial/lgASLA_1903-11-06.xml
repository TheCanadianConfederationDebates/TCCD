<p rendition="simple:centre">(Continued from page 1.)</p> 

<p rendition="simple:right">FRIDAY, Nov. 6th.</p> 

<p>There was a large attendance of <lb/>
Members at the opening of the House <lb/>
today, only three or four seats being <lb/>
vacant. <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> asked the follow<lb break="no"/>ing questions of the Commissioner of <lb/>
Public Works, notice of which he gave <lb/>
on Wednesday last:— <lb/></p> 

<p>(1) Whether, under date of 16th <lb/>
June, 1903, he addressed from the <lb/>
Executive Council, Regina, to the <lb/>
Right Honorable Sir Wilfrid Laurier, <lb/>
G.C.M.G., Premier of Canada, a letter <lb/>
advising him among other things that <lb/>
he (the Honorable the Commissioner of <lb/>
Public Works), had "advised the <lb/>
federal members representing the <lb/>
Territories" that if the "general repre<lb break="no"/>sentations" made by the said federal <lb/>
members to his (Sir Wilfrid Laurier's) <lb/>
Government were adopted it would <lb/>
reasonably satisfy the general public <lb/>
in the Territories and would put his <lb/>
(Sir Wilfrid Laurier's) candidates in <lb/>
the coming election in a position in <lb/>
which they could fight with zeal;" <lb/>
and if so, <lb/></p> 

<p>(2) Whether the "general represen<lb break="no"/>tations" referred to in the said letter <lb/>
as having been made by the federal <lb/>
members representing the Territories <lb/>
were such as may fairly be inferred <lb/>
from the general tenor of the speeches <lb/>
made by such of the said federal repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from the Territories as took <lb/>
part in the debate on the amendment <lb/>
to the motion to go into committee <lb/>
of Supply made in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons on the 13th day of October last <lb/>
past; and <lb/></p> 

<p>(3) If such may not be fairly inferred <lb/>
what were the "general representa<lb break="no"/>tions" referred to, and <lb/></p> 

<p>(4) What was meant by the reference <lb/>
in the said letter to provincial autono<lb break="no"/>my as an alternative? and <lb/></p> 

<p>(5) Whether the said letter was writ<lb break="no"/>ten and forwarded with the knowledge <lb/>
and consent of the honorable Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner's colleagues on the Executive <lb/>
Council? and <lb/></p> 

<p>(6) Whether the general tenor of the <lb/>
said letter was "strongly approved" <lb/>
over the signatures of G. W. Brown, <lb/>
I. Geo. DeVeber, J. W. Woolf, W. T. <lb/>
Finlay, C. W. Fisher, A. D. McIntyre, <lb/>
Charles Fisher, A. S. Smith, P. Talbot, <lb/>
B. Prince, R. W. Wallace, J. A. Simp<lb break="no"/>son, A. S. Rosenroll, Thos. MacNutt <lb/>
and A. C. Rutherford, members of this <lb/>
House? <lb/></p> 

<p>In reply <persName ref="pers:BULY1">Mr. Bulyea</persName> said: As to <lb/>
question (1) Yes. <lb/></p> 

<p>(2 and 3) The "general representa<lb break="no"/>tions" referred to in the letter were <lb/>
the endorsement and backing up by <lb/>
the Territorial Members of Parliament <lb/>
at that late (June) of the financial <lb/>
claims of the Territories then being <lb/>
considered by the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/></p> 

<p>I must decline to assist the hon. <lb/>
gentleman in deciding whether the na<lb break="no"/>ture of the "general representations" <lb/>
made at that time (16th June) with <lb/>
regard to financial questions can be <lb/>
fairly inferred from the general tenor <lb/>
of the speeches made on the 13th Octo<lb break="no"/>ber with regard to the question of Auto<lb break="no"/>nomy. <lb/></p> 

<p>(4) No alternative proposition was <lb/>
made to the Federal Government. <lb/>
Immediate autonomy with its accom<lb break="no"/>panying revenues was demanded. On <lb/>
the date of the letter (16th June) it was <lb/>
inferred that the Federal Government <lb/>
had definitely decided not to deal with <lb/>
the provincial question this year. We <lb/>
were therefore forced to consider the <lb/>
alternative, namely, large increases to <lb/>
our revenues which had been asked for, <lb/>
not as an alternative to provincial <lb/>
revenues, but until provincial revenues <lb/>
were placed at our disposal. <lb/></p> 

<p>(5) The letter being a personal one <lb/>
was not referred to other Members of <lb/>
the Executive Council, who, however, <lb/>
were aware that every available legiti<lb break="no"/>mate pressure was being brought to <lb/>
bear upon the Federal Government to <lb/>
advance the claims of the Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p>(6) As the letter referred to bears the <lb/>
signatures of the gentlemen mentioned <lb/>
in the question, I do not consider that <lb/>
any answer is necessary. (Cheers.) <lb/></p>
    
<p>
    <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> moved that an Order of <lb/>
    the House do issue for a return show<lb break="no"/>ing a copy of a letter written in August, <lb/>
    1903, by J. Obed Smith, Commissioner <lb/>
    of Immigration, to the Commissioner <lb/>
    of Education or any officer of his de<lb break="no"/>partment, asking that some one be <lb/>
    appointed to make enquires into the <lb/>
    affairs of the Devil's Lake school dis<lb break="no"/>trict. <lb/>
</p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> said he could see no ob<lb break="no"/>jection to the motion, but he would like <lb/>
        to say in anticipation of any possible <lb/>
        misapprehension in regard to any letter <lb/>
        written by Mr. J. Obed Smith in <lb/>
        August that it had nothing to do with <lb/>
        the action taken by the Government <lb/>
        with reference to the Devil's Lake <lb/>
        school district. Any action taken by <lb/>
        the Department of Education was <lb/>
        taken before Mr. Smith's letter was <lb/>
        written. He thought it wise to make <lb/>
        this statement. <lb/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:PATR1">Dr. Patrick</persName> said he was very pleased <lb/>
        to know that the action that was taken <lb/>
        was not taken at the request of Mr. <lb/>
        Smith. Mr. Smith had interfered in <lb/>
        the affairs of the school district and <lb/>
        had asked for certain things as a right. <lb/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:RUTH1">Mr. Rutherford</persName> introduced a bill to <lb/>
        enroll John Gaddis Tipton as an advo<lb break="no"/>cate of the North-West Territories. <lb/>
        The bill was read a first time and re<lb break="no"/>ferred to a special committee composed <lb/>
        of the Attorney General. Messers. Ben<lb break="no"/>nett, Lake, Brown and Rutherford.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> introduced a bill to <lb/>
        amend the Ordinance respecting the <lb/>
        Legislative Assembly, which was read <lb/>
        a first time. <lb/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">Mr. Haultain</persName> also moved the second <lb/>
        reading of Bill No. 7 to amend the <lb/>
        Ordinance respecting Limitation of <lb/>
        Actions in certain cases. He explained <lb/>
        that this was largely a technical <lb/>
        matter of law. <lb/>
