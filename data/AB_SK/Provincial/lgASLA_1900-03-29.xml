      The second session of the Fourth <lb/>
      Legislature of the Territories was <lb/>
      opened at Regina on Thursday, 29th <lb/>
      March, 1900, by His Honor Lieut.-Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor Forget. Twenty-six of the thir<lb break="no"/>ty-one Members were in their seats. <lb/>
      The function was attended by the <lb/>
      usual display, and was witnessed by a <lb/>
      large assemblage of spectators. His <lb/>
      Honour was attended from Govern<lb break="no"/>ment House to the Assembly buildings <lb/>
      by a Mounted Police escourt, and arrived <lb/>
      at the Chamber a few minutes after <lb/>
      three o'clock accompanied by Inspec<lb break="no"/>tor Gilpin-Brown, A.D.C.

    <p rendition="simple:centre">THE SPEECH</p>
            <p>The Speech delivered by the <persName ref="pers:GOVE1">Lieut.-<lb break="yes"/>Governor</persName> was the following:—</p>
            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive ssembly:—</hi></p>
    <p>
      I have much pleasure in welcoming <lb/>
      you upon the occasion of the opening <lb/>
      of the Section Session of the Fourth <lb/>
      Legislative ssembly of the Territories, <lb/>
      and in congratulatng you upon the <lb/>
      remarkable growth in population and <lb/>
      material resources which the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories have experienced during the<lb/>
      past year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spontaneous expressions of loyal<lb break="no"/>ty with which all parts of the Empire <lb/>
      have given practical evidence of their <lb/>
      devotion to the Queen and Imperial in<lb break="no"/>terests, will ever mark the past year as <lb/>
      a memorable one in the history of the <lb/>
      nation. Owing to the non-establish<lb break="no"/>ment of the militia system, the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories were deprived of the privilege <lb/>
      of being represented in the first Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Contingent, but it must be a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of pride and gratification to know <lb/>
      that in the Second Contingent, and in <lb/>
      that corps raised and equipped through <lb/>
      the splended generosity and patriotism <lb/>
      of Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal, <lb/>
      the Territories have now the honor of <lb/>
      having given not only a large number <lb/>
      of men in the aggregate but, in propor<lb break="no"/>tion to their population, a larger num<lb break="no"/>ber than any other portion of the <lb/>
      Dominion, to the Canadian contribu<lb break="no"/>tion to the cause of the Empire. In <lb/>
      this connection you will be asked to <lb/>
      concur in a grant made to the North<lb break="no"/>West members of the Second Contin<lb break="no"/>gent, and your assent will be asked to <lb/>
      a measure legalising grants made by <lb/>
      Municipal Corporations to various <lb/>
      patriotic funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The financial position of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories has been the subject of consider<lb break="no"/>able correspondence addressed to the <lb/>
      Federal authorities by my Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. A portion of the correspon<lb break="no"/>dence was laid before you at your last <lb/>
      Session, and I have ordered copies of <lb/>
      subsequent communications to be pre<lb break="no"/>pared for your information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unprecedented rainfall and dis<lb break="no"/>astrous floods of the past year brought <lb/>
      about a state of affairs which the <lb/>
      revenue, already proved to be inade<lb break="no"/>quate under ordinary conditions, was <lb/>
      altogether unable to cope with. This <lb/>
      state of affairs tended not so much to <lb/>
      create as to aggravate and call more <lb/>
      pointed attention to the great dispro<lb break="no"/>portion existing between the means at <lb/>
      command and the ever-growing neces<lb break="no"/>sities of the rapidly increasing popula<lb break="no"/>tion of the Territories. It is gratify<lb break="no"/>ing for me to be able to inform you <lb/>
      that the Federal Government has <lb/>
      proposed to Parliament now in session <lb/>
      a moderate increase to your annual <lb/>
      grant and a large special vote for the <lb/>
      purpose of restoring public works de<lb break="no"/>troyed by the floods. In spite of this <lb/>
      very substantial increase to the <lb/>
      Revenue, my Government can only <lb/>
      look upon it as affording a temporary <lb/>
      and partial amelioration of otherwise <lb/>
      impossible financial conditions, and <lb/>
      will ask you to take action leading to <lb/>
      the earliest practicable solution of Ter<lb break="no"/>itorial financial and administrative <lb/>
      problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the administration of the law some <lb/>
      changes have suggested themselves as <lb/>
      being calculated to bring about greater <lb/>
      economy and effectiveness. Bills to <lb/>
      secure these ends will be duly submitted <lb/>
      to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accoutns of the Income and Ex<lb break="no"/>penditure of the past year will be laid <lb/>
      before you, as will also the Estimates <lb/>
      for the current year, which have been <lb/>
      prepared with due regard to the effi<lb break="no"/>ciency of the several services to be <lb/>
      undertaken and teh rigid limitations <lb/>
      of the revenue.
    </p>
            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">Gentlemen of the Legislative Assembly—</hi>></p>
    <p>
      I now leave you to your delibera<lb break="no"/>tions, in full confidence that the same <lb/>
      devotion will be given to the interests <lb/>
      of the Territories which has heretofore <lb/>
      characterised the labours of teh Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Honor having departed, <persName ref="pers:EAKI1">Mr. <lb/>
      Speaker</persName> (Hon. Wm. Eakin) took the <lb/>
      Chair. Mr. Speaker announced that <lb/>
      during the recess he had received the <lb/>
      certificate of election of Arthur L. Sif<lb break="no"/>ton as member for Banff. Mr. Sifton <lb/>
      was then introduced to Mr. Speker by <lb/>
      Premier Haultain and Mr. Wallace of <lb/>
      High River, and took his seat amid <lb/>
      warm applause. <persName ref="pers:HAUL2">The Premier</persName> moved <lb/>

    <p>Mr. Speaker took the Chair at 2:55<lb/>
    o'clock.</p>
    <p>
      THE ADDRESS IN REPLY.
    </p>
    <p>Mr. G.W. Brown (North Regina)<lb/>
      on rising to move the Address in Reply<lb/>
      to His Honor's speech, was loudly ap<lb break="no"/>plauded. He sid that he would preface<lb/>
      the task with the remark that the un<lb break="no"/>precedented success attending these<lb/>
      Territories, particularly within the<lb/>
      past twelve months, and in great meas<lb break="no"/>ure during the last three or four years,<lb/>
      was certainly a matter of evident satis<lb break="no"/>faction to the House and to the coun<lb/>
      try. The past year had been one of<lb/>
      <cb/>
      magnificent crops, and magnificent<lb/>
      weather for the curing and marketing<lb/>
      of the crops. It seemed as if at last<lb/>
    </p>
    <P>PROVIDENCE WAS SMILING
    </P>
    <p>upon these Territories. Business in all<lb/>
      lines and branches was lucrative and<lb/>
      cheering; our own people were now<lb/>
      possessed of confidence, and the people<lb/>
      in the Eastern Provinces were gaining<lb/>
      confidence in us and in this part of<lb/>
      Canada. The North-West was no<lb/>
      longer looked upon as a barren or<lb/>
      dubious quantity. The people of the<lb/>
      East, it ws no exaggeration to say,<lb/>
      now looked on the Territories as the<lb/>
      hope and the future mainstay of the<lb/>
      industries and manufactures of Canada.<lb/>
      That favorable feeling regarding the<lb/>
      North-West did not always prevail in<lb/>
      the East. There was a time not very<lb/>
      many years ago, when Eastern people<lb/>
      had smal faith,-when the Eastern<lb/>
      Provinces had more than half an idea<lb/>
      that the Territories were proving a big<lb/>
      bill of expense with no very sure pros<lb break="no"/>pect of a return, and tht this country<lb/>
      was simply a burden. All that is<lb/>
      changed now. There is reason for the<lb/>
      changed feeling. The returns compiled<lb/>
      by the Agriculture Department show<lb/>
      that whereas a few years ago our grain<lb/>
      exports were the smallest of any part<lb/>
      of Canada, to-day we are exporting<lb/>
      grain measured by teh millions of<lb/>
      bushels annually. Dairying, which a<lb/>
      few years ago was languishing and<lb/>
      scarcely deserved the name of industry,<lb/>
      so far as the North-West was concern<lb break="no"/>ed, is now in a thriving state of devel<lb break="no"/>opment, yielding handsome profits to<lb/>
      those engaged in it and adding per<lb break="no"/>ceptibly to the bulk of our exports and<lb/>
    to the name and</p>
    <P>FAME OF CANADIAN PRODUCTS.</P>
    <p>
      North-West butter, which a few years<lb/>
      ago merchants hesitated to handle at<lb/>
      all, is now becoming an article of stan<lb break="no"/>dard value not only in the mining<lb/>
      province west of us but as well in the<lb/>
      markets of the British Isles. (Applause.)<lb/>
      Within a few short years the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies have advanced from the position of<lb/>
      the provincial division having the<lb/>
      smallest exports, to the position of the<lb/>
      disvision having the largest per capita<lb/>
      export of cattle. Looked at from all<lb/>
      sides the development of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories could ont but be pronounced<lb/>
      eminently satisfactory to teh people of<lb/>
      the Territories and to the whole of<lb/>
      Canada. (Applause.) Our population<lb/>
      was increasing rapidly. For the past<lb/>
      year or two the increase in population<lb/>
      of Manitoba and the Territories had<lb/>
      gone on at a rate of at least 20 or 25 per<lb/>
      cent., which was a ratio of annual in<lb break="no"/>crease heretofore unparalleled in the<lb/>
      Territories or in any part of Canada.<lb/>
      (Applause.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SHIELD.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while in these respects our suc<lb break="no"/>cesss had been great, our development<lb/>
      most encouraging, while faith in the<lb/>
      country was becomingh well established<lb/>
      and our credit abroad was gaining a<lb/>
      sure footing, there was yet one point<lb/>
      of view from which could be seen<lb/>
      reason for only chastened rejouicing. It<lb/>
      was with sorow they were compelled<lb/>
      to look at the comparative absence of <lb/>
      increase of the revenue for the local<lb/>
      governmentof teh TErritories. The<lb/>
      revenue had not been increasing to any<lb/>
      adequate extent. For the proper gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the country, to ensure the<lb/>
      proper developmentof the country, to<lb/>
      give sustained confidence to the pio<lb break="no"/>neers who are here and who are com<lb break="no"/>ing in to help build up the country, it<lb/>
      could be laid down as an unassailable<lb/>
      proposition that it was absolutely<lb/>
      necessary that<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>LOCAL REVENUE MUST GROW APACE<lb/>
    WITH LOCAL NEEDS.</p>
    <p>
      For several years past the local revenue<lb/>
      has not been keeping pace with the<lb/>
      local needs. What had been done to<lb/>
      meet the case? What was done when<lb/>
      the revenue became in a sense station<lb break="no"/>ary while the needs kept on growing?<lb/>
      This was done : The people consented<lb/>
      to a reduction of the school grants, and<lb/>
      consented to share in the prosecution<lb/>
      and maintenance of public work by<lb/>
      means of a Local Improvement system.<lb/>
      In these ways the demands on the re<lb break="no"/>venue were lessened. He believed the<lb/>
      people had done and were doing all that<lb/>
      it was reasonable to ask them to do,<lb/>
      but again we are face to face with the<lb/>
      problem of insufficient revenue. In<lb/>
      this circumstance the Assembly and<lb/>
      the people had a duty to perform. The<lb/>
      problem must be met and dealt with;<lb/>
      it must be dealt with in a way best for<lb/>
      the interests of the Territories as a<lb/>
      whole. (Applause.) There was possible<lb/>
      the method of
    </p>
    <p>DIRECT TAXATION.</p>
    <p>We have the power and privilege of<lb/>
      assuming the burden of direct taxation,<lb/>
      but in the early stage of the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of the country, with teh people<lb/>
      still in the position, and for some years<lb/>
      to come likely to be in the position of<lb/>
      pioneers struggling and battling with<lb/>
      primitive conditions and striving under<lb/>
      many incident handicaps for the goal<lb/>
      of permanency, he did not believe it<lb/>
      would be adviable or in the best inter<lb break="no"/>est of the country to apply that meth<lb break="no"/>od. What was the alterantive? Could<lb/>
      we look for an adequately increased<lb/>
      subsidy from Ottawa? That was a<lb/>
      very important question. Wht answer<lb/>
      could be given? He was convinced<lb/>
      tht we could not look with any mea<lb break="no"/>sure of hope for remedy from that<lb/>
      source. He did not bleive tht we<lb/>
      need look to Ottawa for any such in<lb break="no"/>crease as the circumstances demand.<lb/>
      The case had been pressed t Otttawa<lb/>
      for years, and while some increases<lb/>
      were obtained, every year shows a big<lb break="no"/>ger disparity between teh amount we<lb/>
      get and the amount we require. Has<lb/>
      our case not been properly presented at<lb/>
      Ottawa? He (Mr. Brown) thoroughly<lb/>
      believed that our case had been pre<lb break="no"/>sented as properly, as well as as force<lb break="no"/>fully as it could be presented. The<lb/>
      leaders of the Assembly, who under<lb break="no"/>stood the case at least as well as any<lb/>
      men or collection of men alive, had<lb/>
      gone year after year to Ottawahad in<lb/>
      hand, as had been sid. He believed<lb/>
      the federal Government understood the<lb/>
      case now as well as it can be hoped that<lb/>
      they ever wil understand it. On this<lb/>
      subject he did not believe that Ottawa's<lb/>
      action depended on whether a Conser<lb break="no"/>vative or a Liberal Government was in<lb/>
      power. Any Governmetn would do<lb/>
      the best it could. Did the matter de<lb break="no"/>pendwholly on the Government, the<lb/>
      cabinet ministers, probably we might<lb/>
      expect adequate remedy from Ottawa,<lb/>
      from either a Liberal or a Conservative<lb/>
      Government. But it did not lie with<lb/>
      them wholliy. There were more than<lb/>
      two hundred members of Parliament<lb/>
      to be consulted, only four of whom<lb/>
      were sent from the Territories. He did<lb/>
      not want to convey the impression that<lb/>
      the Eastern Provinces were hostile to<lb/>
      us, or that Eastern members would not<lb/>
      grant us what they thought was just<lb/>
      and right, because he did not think<lb/>
      that would be a true impression. The<lb/>
    fact was that the Eastern men, not-</p>-->
