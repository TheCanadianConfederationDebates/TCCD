<p><persName ref="pers:DEWD1">Mr. DEWDNEY</persName> moved for leave to introduce <lb/>
Bill (No. 126) to amend the North-West Territories <lb/>
Act. He said: This Act is ver similar to the one <lb/>
introduced last year. It provides for the election <lb/>
of members of the Legislative Assembly for three <lb/>
years, making clear a doubt that existed about the <lb/>
provision of the Bill of last session on this point. <lb/>
It proposes to abolish the advisory council and the <lb/>

legal experts. It gives the Assembly all the powers <lb/>
it had previously by Order in Council, in addition <lb/>
to the disposition of the liquor question. There is <lb/>
a clause providing that a lump sum of money shall <lb/>
be placed at the disposal of the Legislative Assem<lb break="no"/>bly. The Bill also does away with the system of <lb/>
justices of the peace sitting in conjunction with the <lb/>
Supreme Court to hear criminal cases. It provides <lb/>
for the establishment of gaols in the North-West <lb/>
Territories and for applying to these the same regu<lb break="no"/>lations as are applicable to penitentiaries. It makes <lb/>
it illegal for any man to have liquor in his posses<lb break="no"/>sion unless he has a permit in his own name. Sec<lb break="no"/>tion 110, which deals with the dual language, is <lb/>
altered in accordance with the resolution of the <lb/>
House of last session. The Bill also gives power to <lb/>
the Legislative Assembly to repeal all the provi<lb break="no"/>sions oo the Act relating to the liquor traffic—this <lb/>
provision was in the former Bill—and grants to the <lb/>
Legislative Assembly the same powers as the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces possess in regard to licenses, that is, after a <lb/>
general election. <lb/></p>
