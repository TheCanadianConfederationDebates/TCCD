            <cb/>
       
       
     sections of the North-west Territories Act

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Section 49 has reference to times and

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Section 51 empowers the Governor in 
     <lb/>Council to divide the territories into judicial<lb/>districts. The amendment will give power<lb/>to the assembly to make provision for de<lb break="no"/>termining the boundaries of judicial dis<lb break="no"/>tricts.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Section 53 makes a Supreme Court judge  
     <lb/>the instrument of authority in any matter<lb/>which the law specifies shall be dealt with<lb/>by a court or judge, in the absence of other<lb/>specific provision.<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    
   
            <p>
     Section 64 deals with justices of the peace, 
     <lb/>as to appointment, qualifications, &amp;c., and<lb/>with police magistrates.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Section 88 deals with the jurisdiction of<lb/>judges in civil matters, and the class of<lb/>matters in which either party may demand<lb/>a jury trial, together with various other<lb/>provisions relating to civil trials and cases.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Sections 89 and 90 also deal with judg<lb break="no"/>ments and procedure in civil cases.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The sections mentioned in No. 4 are 7, 8,<lb/>9, 11 and 12 of chapter 19 of 1888. All re<lb break="no"/>fer to the constitution of the legislative<lb/>assembly.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Section 7 prescribes the qualifications of<lb/>voters.<lb/>

            <p>Section 8 the qualifications of candidates<lb/>for election.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Section 12 names the occasions when the<lb/>Speaker may vote in the legislative as<lb break="no"/>sembly.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Section 9 of chapter 28, of 1897, which re<lb break="no"/>pealed and was substituted for section 18<lb/>of chapter 17 of 1894, prohibits members<lb/>of the legislative assembly from holding<lb/>positions of emolument, making the excep<lb break="no"/>tion as regards members of the executive<lb/>council who have procured election after<lb/>appointment to such office.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In this latter important particular what<lb/>I am proposing to do by the amendment is to<lb/>give the legislative assembly power to de<lb break="no"/>fine the qualifications or limitations and<lb/>to regulate the conduct of its own members,<lb/>a right and power which is possessed and<lb/>exercised by this parliament and by every<lb/>provincial parliament. I may say that in<lb/>every discussion of the question of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy by Premier Haultain, the<lb/>lack of this power has been a matter of<lb/>serious complaint. The proposal as a whole,<lb/>while perhaps not very urgent or important,<lb/>will have the effect of narrowing down<lb/>still further the difference between the pre<lb break="no"/>sent position of the territories as territories,<lb/>and the position of a province in confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. I may explain that when Premier<lb/>Haultain was on his last visit to Ottawa,<lb/>
      
      
            <pb n="13855" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1903-10-13_Page_13855.jpg"/>

     in February or March, a tacit understanding 
     <lb/>
     was arrived at, not, of course, with his will<lb break="no"/>ing consent, because, as a matter of fact, 
     <lb/>
     Premier Haultain believes that the question 
     <lb/>
     of provincial establishment should not be 
     <lb/>
     delayed at all, that the whole question of au<lb break="no"/>tonomy should not be dealt with and could 
     <lb/>
     not be dealt with at this session of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and as a result of this understandig he 
     <lb/>
     suggested a number of intermediate changes 
     <lb/>
     in the existing powers of the legislative as<lb break="no"/>sembly. He proposed one important change 
     <lb/>
     by which the entire land titles system should 
     <lb/>
     be transferred to the local authority as well 
     <lb/>
     as a number of additional minor changes 
     <lb/>
     of which these I am proposing form a part. 
     <lb/>
     I believe, that, but for the long absence 
     <lb/>
     during this session of the hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior (Hon. Mr. Sifton), all of these 
     <lb/>
     changes which have been asked for by Pre<lb break="no"/>mier Haultain, would have been introduced 
     <lb/>
     and put through at this session, but on ac<lb break="no"/>count of the pressure on his time, and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps partly because of the opinion which 
     <lb/>
     I think the hon. Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     has formed that the question of provincial 
     <lb/>
     establishment cannot wisely be delayed be<lb break="no"/>yond next year, he decided not to take up 
     <lb/>
     any of these points at this session, but to 
     <lb/>
     leave them over until next session, and then 
     <lb/>
     finally dispose of the whole subject by 
     <lb/>
     giving the territories a complete provincial 
     <lb/>
     status. On account of provision being made 
     <lb/>
     at this session for an additional judge of the 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court of the North-west Territories, 
     <lb/>
     and a consequent necessary amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories Act, Premier 
     <lb/>
     Haultain, some time ago, wrote to me sug<lb break="no"/>gesting that even if the change respecting 
     <lb/>
     the transfer of the land titles system could 
     <lb/>
     not be made this year it would be a distinct 
     <lb/>
     advantage to the practical carrying on of the 
     <lb/>
     business of his government if certain of 
     <lb/>
     these minor changes were made. It perhaps 
     <lb/>
     would be only right for me to state further 
     <lb/>
     that Premier Haultain's proposals to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of the Interior included half a 
     <lb/>
     dozen other sections in addition to those that 
     <lb/>
     I have gone over. I have omitted a number 
     <lb/>
     of sections at the suggestion of the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Justice, which holds that these other 
     <lb/>
     sections deal with criminal jurisdiction over 
     <lb/>
     which for the present this parliament's 
     <lb/>
     authority had better be maintained. With 
     <lb/>
     that view of the department, I do not express 
     <lb/>
     agreement or disagreement. At this stage 
     <lb/>
     of the session it is perhaps wise not to 
     <lb/>
     attempt to introduce anything controversial, 
     <lb/>
     and I have therefore left out half a dozen 
     <lb/>
     sections which Premier Haultain desired 
     <lb/>
     to have added to this amendment. These 
     <lb/>
     various sections which I have added to this 
     <lb/>
     proposed amendment are not of very great 
     <lb/>
     moment. I do not imagine that they 
     <lb/>
     can raise any controversy at all. I trust 
     <lb/>
     they will meet with the unanimous ap<lb break="no"/>proval of the House.

            <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. Yes, the 
     <lb/>
     Bill is intended to provide for the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Supreme Court, and also for ap<lb break="no"/>peals to the court. The intention of the 
     <lb/>
     amendment that my hon. friend (Mr. Scott) 
     <lb/>
     proposes is merely to give to the council 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories control over 
     <lb/>
     the court as to the time, place and sittings 
     <lb/>
     of the court, as to the dividing the territories 
     <lb/>
     into judicial districts, as to defining the ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial jurisdiction and other provisions of 
     <lb/>
     that sort. They also asked that they should 
     <lb/>
     have control over the administration of crim<lb break="no"/>inal justice, but I was not prepared to give 
     <lb/>
     It to them, and they did not get it. We are 
     <lb/>
     responsible for the administration of crim<lb break="no"/>inal justice in these territories, and we 
     <lb/>
     want to keep control over its administra<lb break="no"/>tion.

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Before 
     <lb/>
     you leave the Chair, Mr. Speaker, I wish 
     <lb/>
     to bring to the attention of the House a 
     <lb/>
     matter which is of some importance not 
     <lb/>
     only to the people of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories of Canada, but to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     entire Dominion. Early this session I call<lb break="no"/>ed attention to the fact that the speech from 
     <lb/>
     the Throne made no reference to the grant<lb break="no"/>ing of a provincial status to the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories, and I expressed the hope that 
     <lb/>
     before the end of this session—which at that 
     <lb/>
     time we thought would have been ended 
     <lb/>
     before this—the government would introduce 
     <lb/>
     some legislation for that purpose. Ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the census of 1901, there were 
     <lb/>
     158,000 inhabitants in the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>

     tories; according to the report of the depart<lb break="no"/>ment of immigration there came into this 
     <lb/>
     country in the year 1901 49,149 people; in 
     <lb/>
     1902, 67,379 people; and the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     stated only last evening that, according to 
     <lb/>
     the information received from the depart<lb break="no"/>ment of immigration, no less than 110,000 
     <lb/>
     immigrants came to Canada during the pre<lb break="no"/>sent year. That makes a total for these three 
     <lb/>
     years of 227,528, and we may fairly assume 
     <lb/>
     that at least 175,000 of that number have 
     <lb/>
     gone to the North-west Territories. If that 
     <lb/>
     computation is fair, and I believe it is, then 
     <lb/>
     we have in the North-west Territories at 
     <lb/>
     the present time a population of 330,000 
     <lb/>
     people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not contemplated by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, apparently, to take any steps for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of granting, during the present 
     <lb/>
     session, provincial autonomy to the people 
     <lb/>
     of these territories. It seems to me that, 
     <lb/>
     having regard to the very large population, 
     <lb/>
     the great territorial area, the magnificent 
     <lb/>
     country which we have in the west, the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada should immediately give 
     <lb/>
     its attention to the granting of a provincial 
     <lb/>
     status to the people of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. It was asserted in this House by the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister the other day that the people 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories have in effect 
     <lb/>
     at the present time all the powers which the 
     <lb/>
     people of the other provinces possess, with 
     <lb/>
     the possible exception of the power of bor<lb break="no"/>rowing money. The right hon. gentleman

     What are the powers which the territories

     have not to-day, which they would have if they

     were a province ? If I mistake not, speaking

     at first blush, the legislature of the territories 
     <lb/>
     has all the powers enjoyed by a province with

     The right hon. gentleman greatly minimi<lb break="no"/>zed the difference which exists between the 
     <lb/>
     powers possessed by the legislative assembly 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories and the powers 
     <lb/>
     possessed by the respective legislatures of 
     <lb/>
     the different provinces. In the first place, the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories have 
     <lb/>
     not the same full rights of citizenship as 
     <lb/>
     are enjoyed by the inhabitants of the older 
     <lb/>
     provinces, inasmuch as they have not the 
     <lb/>
     control of their public lands, which are con<lb break="no"/>trolled by the government of Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     which are administered, to a very great 
     <lb/>
     extent, from Ottawa. In the second place, 
     <lb/>
     the people of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     have not the control of their minerals, which 
     <lb/>
     in possessed by the people of the older prov<lb break="no"/>inces of Canada. In the third place, they 
     <lb/>
     have not the power to charter railways and 
     <lb/>
     certain other companies. That power is 
     <lb/>
     taken from them by an exception to sub<lb break="no"/>section 7 of section 13 of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories Act, as amended by section 6 of 
     <lb/>
     chapter 22 of the Acts of 1891. That excep<lb break="no"/>tion is as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The legislative assembly shall, subject to the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of this Act, or of any other Act of 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada at any time in force 
     <lb/>
    
    
    
            <cb/>


     in the territories, have power to make or<lb break="no"/>dinances for the government of the territories 
     <lb/>
     in relation to the class of subjects next here<lb break="no"/>inafter mentioned ; that is to say : the incor<lb break="no"/>poration of companies with territorial objects, 
     <lb/>
     with the following exceptions :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Such companies as cannot be incorporated by 
     <lb/>
     provincial legislatures : railway, steamboat, 
     <lb/>
     canal, tranportation, telegraph, and irrigation 
     <lb/>
     companies. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Therefore, in respect to these six classes 
     <lb/>
     of companies, the legislative assembly of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories has at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time no power whatever to enact legis<lb break="no"/>lation. This exception deprives them of the 
     <lb/>
     power to incorporate a railway company and 
     <lb/>
     the power to deal with irrigation; it deprives 
     <lb/>
     them of the power to incorporate transporta<lb break="no"/>tion, telephone or telegraph companies. I am 
     <lb/>
     not aware of any amendment to that sec<lb break="no"/>tion, but if there is any such amendment, 
     <lb/>
     I shall be glad to have my attention called 
     <lb/>
     to it. Then, in the next place, the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories have no power to borrow 
     <lb/>
     money for necessary purposes; they have 
     <lb/>
     not the same powers in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     administration of justice as the older pro<lb break="no"/>vinces have, and they have no power to 
     <lb/>
     amend their own constitution. The Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the North-west Territories, in 
     <lb/>
     a speech which he delivered in 1900, sum<lb break="no"/>marized the differences between the powers 
     <lb/>
     of the legislature of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories and the powers of the legislatures 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces in the following words, 
     <lb/>
     which I will take the liberty of reading to 
     <lb/>
     the House. His words are as follows :

     Where we fall short of provincial powers is

     Now this question has excited a good deal

     of interest in the North-west Territories dur<lb break="no"/>ing the past six or seven years ; and, al<lb break="no"/>though the documents which have been 
     <lb/>
     brought down at the present session of par<lb break="no"/>liament are in a somewhat confused con<lb break="no"/>dition, I shall endeavour as well as I can

     to run very briefly over the correspondence 
     <lb/>
     and the proceedings respecting this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and to point out to the House in what 
     <lb/>
     way the matter has been brought up in the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of the territories, and in what 
     <lb/>
     manner it has been brought to the attention 
     <lb/>
     of this government since the year 1897, 
     <lb/>
     when, so far as I know, the question first

     may say, however, in the beginning, that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from North Norfolk (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Charlton), as far back as the year 1895, 
     <lb/>
     gave a very strong expression of opinion in 
     <lb/>
     this behalf. Referring to the grant of $277,<lb break="no"/>000 then voted to the North-west Territories, 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman said :

     We could save the whole of that expense by

     manage their own concerns. Give them self-

     government, do not lead them around as infants 
     <lb/>

     I do not agree with the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Norfolk that there would be any sav<lb break="no"/>ing at all to the country as a whole by

     granting provincial autonomy ; but in the

     last part of the hon. gentleman's remarks 
     <lb/>
     I thoroughly concur, and I think he has

     there very aptly expressed the idea in a

     few words.

     Now, there was a memorial from the 
     <lb/>
     territorial legislature to this government on 
     <lb/>
     the 9th of December, 1897, which is to be 
     <lb/>
     found in sessional paper 116, at page 32.

     That memorial reads as follows :

     more directly raised, however, in a memorial

     That memorial was forwarded, and sub<lb break="no"/>sequent correspondence took place. The first

     I will not read the whole of this letter, but

     While financial embarrassments rather than

     constitutional aspirations have led the North<lb break="no"/>west government and legislature to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     provincial status, I think that sufficient prac<lb break="no"/>tical reasons can be given for the early estab<lb break="no"/>lishment of provincial institutions in the west.

     We have a rapidly growing population, much

     It is the view of the government that it will 
     <lb/>
     not be wise at the present time to pass legis<lb break="no"/>lation forming the North-west Territories into 
     <lb/>
     a province or provinces. Some of the reasons 
     <lb/>
     leading to this view may be found in the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the population or the territories is yet 
     <lb/>
     sparse ; that the rapid increase in population 
     <lb/>
     now taking place will in a short time alter 
     <lb/>
     the conditions to be dealt with very materially 
     <lb/>
     and that there is a considerable divergence of 
     <lb/>
     opinion respecting the question whether there 
     <lb/>
     should be one province only, or more than one

     I may say, in connection with this matter, 
     <lb/>
     which I think has been alluded to also by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the Prime Minister during 
     <lb/>
     the present session, that the difference of 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to whether there should be one 
     <lb/>
     province or two provinces does not seem a 
     <lb/>
     sufficient reason for withholding provincial 
     <lb/>
     status from the North-west Territories. Are 
     <lb/>
     the people of those territories to be for ever 
     <lb/>
     deprived of the status enjoyed by the people 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces of Canada, menely because 
     <lb/>
     there may not be absolute unanimity as to 
     <lb/>
     whether there shall be one province or two 
     <lb/>
     provinces or three provinces? It is not likely 
     <lb/>

     absolute unanimity in the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories with regard to a matter of that

     Mr. Haultain replied to that letter on the 
     <lb/>
     30th of March, 1901. His reply is to be 
     <lb/>
     found in sessional paper 116a, at page 2. 
     <lb/>
     I shall quote only portions of his reply. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place he quotes from Mr. Sifton's 
     <lb/>
     letter of March 21st, from which I have just 
     <lb/>
     read extracts. Perhaps as some of the 
     <lb/>
     letters from which he quoted have not been 
     <lb/>
     brought to the attention of the House, and 
     <lb/>
     as it would take too much time to read 
     <lb/>
     them all, I had better read his quotations 
     <lb/>
     from the previous correspondence with Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton. Mr. Haultain's words are as follows:

     That language of Mr. Sifton is very signi<lb break="no"/>ficant because, so far back as March, 1901, 
     <lb/>
     he said there Was very much in the sugges<lb break="no"/>tion that it was necessary there should be 
     <lb/>
     a change in the constitutional and financial 
     <lb/>
     conditions of the territories. We have now 
     <lb/>
     reached a period two years and a half later 
     <lb/>
     in the history of the territories than the 
     <lb/>
     day on which this letter was written, but 
     <lb/>
     we seem to be no nearer to any solution or 
     <lb/>
     the question by the present government than 
     <lb/>
     we were at that time. Continuing, Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain quotes from Mr. Sifton's letter as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :

     the influx of a very great number of people,

     Mr. Haultain in this same letter refers to 
     <lb/>
     a further letter from Mr. Sifton of April 5th, 
     <lb/>
     1901, from which he quotes as follows:

     truth and force in that statement of Mr.

     Haultain's. Are we to expect that the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the North-west Territories is to 
     <lb/>
    stand still at any time within the next fif<lb break="no"/>teen or twenty years ? We "have there a 
     <lb/>country which is capable of supporting 
     <lb/>many millions of population; we have 
     <lb/>there the best undeveloped country in the 
     <lb/>world, and I see no reason to anticipate that 
     <lb/>population will flow into the North-west of 
     <lb/>Canada less rapidly during the next fifteen 
     <lb/>or twenty years than it is flowing into that 
     <lb/>country at present. Therefore as Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain forcibly points out in the letter to which 
     <lb/>I have referred, the difficulties in that re<lb break="no"/>gard will not be obviated by mere delay; 
     <lb/>there will always be difficulties of that kind 
     <lb/>and the only way in which we can do jus<lb break="no"/>tice to the people of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories in this matter is by dealing with 
     <lb/>these difficulties at the present time and 
     <lb/>by giving them, after proper consultation,

     As Great Britain has divested herself, for the

     will not be in accord with established public

     policy for the Dominion to divest itself of the 
     <lb/>
     ability, largely advertised abroad, to grant lands

     adopted in 1884 by the government of the day

     one fact that, should the Dominion withhold

     from the province, for the benefit of Canada 
     <lb/>
     at large, the right to administer the public do<lb break="no"/>main. within its boundaries and to enjoy the

     opening up of each new settlement, will impose

     a burden and financial strain upon the revenues

     of the province altogether out of proportion to 
     <lb/>
     any revenue derivable on account of such settler

            <p>
     I sent a note over to the Rideau Club but 
     <lb/>
     found you were gone. The question of your 
     <lb/>
     financial arrangements was up for discussion 
     <lb/>
     to-day, and Mr. Fielding will communicate with 
     <lb/>
     you. The arrangement suggested will, I think, 
     <lb/>
     prove reasonably satisfactory.

            <p>
     You will observe in Mr. Haultain's letter 
     <lb/>
     a demand for an answer as to the import<lb break="no"/>ant question of provincial autonomy which 
     <lb/>
     had been discussed by representatives of his 
     <lb/>
     government with the representatives of this 
     <lb/>
     government. In fact this question had, so 
     <lb/>
     to speak, been made a matter of state by 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of a subcommittee of the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council for the purpose of considering 
     <lb/>
     the status of the North-west Territories; and, 
     <lb/>
     in reply to the demand of Mr. Haultain of the 
     <lb/>
     19th of March for a final answer—and he 
     <lb/>
     puts the question of provincial autonomy first 
     <lb/>
     —he receives a telegram addressed to him at 
     <lb/>
     Regina making some reference to important 
     <lb/>
     financial arrangements, but containing not 
     <lb/>
     a single word of reply to the demand of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories, presented through 
     <lb/>
     their government, that a provincial status 
     <lb/>
     should be accorded to the people of that 
     <lb/>
     great western country. That, to say the 
     <lb/>
     least of it, Mr. Speaker, seems a somewhat 
     <lb/>
     casual and indifferent way of dealing with 
     <lb/>
     a great question of this kind, which, al<lb break="no"/>though, apparently considered a small and 
     <lb/>
     trifling matter by this government, is of 
     <lb/>
     some importance to nearly 350,000 people 
     <lb/>
     who at present inhabit our great west. Now,

            <cb/>
       
       
     the next letter is one from Mr. Haultain to 
     <lb/>
     Sir Wilfrid Laurier, which is not printed at 
     <lb/>
     all in the correspondence brought down, 
     <lb/>
     but a copy of which I have procured from 
     <lb/>
     a document printed by the legislative as<lb break="no"/>sembly of the North-west Territories. I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry that this return brought down to this 
     <lb/>
     House is so very incomplete that hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers who desire to consider this question 
     <lb/>
     must refer to documents brought down to 
     <lb/>
     the legislature of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     in order to find a complete record. Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain, not satisfied with this somewhat casual 
     <lb/>
     and supercilious response from the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior, wrote to Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
     <lb/>
     on the 15th of April, 1903, after his return to 
     <lb/>
     Regina. The letter is too long to quote in 
     <lb/>

   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It is with much satisfaction that I note that the 
     <lb/>
     government has so far appreciated the position 
     <lb/>
     of affairs in the territories as to approve, in the 
     <lb/>
     most practical manner possible, of our methods 
     <lb/>
     of administration by providing for the expendi<lb break="no"/>tures we found it necessary to incur in the pub<lb break="no"/>lic interest during the year 1902. It would ap<lb break="no"/>pear, however, to have escaped your observation 
     <lb/>
     that the placing of the appropriation to cover our 
     <lb/>
     expenditures of last year in the supplementary 
     <lb/>
     estimates for the coming Dominion fiscal year 
     <lb/>
     will have the effect of keeping the money from 
     <lb/>
     the territorial revenue until after the first day of 
     <lb/>
     July next. All the representations we have made 
     <lb/>
     —both written and oral--have been to the effect 
     <lb/>
     that the supplementary appropriation is desired 
     <lb/>
     to the current fiscal year's appropriations, so 
     <lb/>
     that the money may be rendered available at 
     <lb/>
     the earliest possible moment. To do otherwise 
     <lb/>
     can only embarrass us still further, and I would 
     <lb/>
     submit that with a prospective surplus of thir<lb break="no"/>teen million dollars, to a very large extent due 
     <lb/>
     to the present flourishing condition of these ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, the Dominion will not be put to any 
     <lb/>
     very serious inconvenience by granting us the 
     <lb/>
     money it has been agreed to give us during the 
     <lb/>
     month of May instead of July. I trust that upon 
     <lb/>
     further consideration of the subject you will see 
     <lb/>
     your way clear to recommending the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to grant our request that the $250,000 re<lb break="no"/>ferred to in your telegram be provided for 
     <lb/>
     through the supplementary estimates for 1902-3. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Your telegram makes no mention whatever of 
     <lb/>
     any proposal to increase our grant for the com<lb break="no"/>ing fiscal year. I take it that the suggested ad<lb break="no"/>vance on capital account has no connection what<lb break="no"/>ever with that subject. In discussing the various 
     <lb/>
     phases of the question of territorial finances, it 
     <lb/>
     has been found necessary at times to point out 
     <lb/>
     that our limited and inadequate revenues were 
     <lb/>
     more restricted, and rendered only more in<lb break="no"/>adequate, by the necessity for making expendi<lb break="no"/>tures out of current income which in themselves 
     <lb/>
     were more properly chargeable to a capital ac<lb break="no"/>count. That is to say, we have occasionally found 
     <lb/>
     it necessary to incur heavy expenditures for the 
     <lb/>
     construction of bridges the cost of which has 
     <lb/>
     been a heavy drain upon our revenues, and which 
     <lb/>
     should have been spread over a series of years 
     <lb/>
     instead of being provided for out of the revenue 
     <lb/>
     of one year, to the exclusion of other and equally 
     <lb/>
     important works. But we have never asked for 
     <lb/>
     the establishment of a capital account, and we 
     <lb/>
     do not wish for the establishment of such an 
     <lb/>
     account until a more satisfactory subsidy or 
     <lb/>
     annual grant is provided. We would even pre<lb break="no"/>fer, if possible. to postpone all discussion of the 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <cb/>
       
       
     question until the details of the financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the territories under the provincial sta<lb break="no"/>tus are settled. Whilst the Dominion retains to 
     <lb/>
     itself the control and beneficiary interest in our 
     <lb/>
     revenue producing property it seems but fair 
     <lb/>
     to us that the Dominion should provide all 
     <lb/>
     needed funds for the proper carrying on of our 
     <lb/>
     business. Further, we cannot assent to any 
     <lb/>
     proposition that our expenditures shall be sub<lb break="no"/>ject to approval at Ottawa. The legislative as<lb break="no"/>sembly of the territories has for a number of 
     <lb/>
     years been providing for the administration of 
     <lb/>
     public affairs in the territories. What has been 
     <lb/>
     done in that regard has met with the approval 
     <lb/>
     of the people of the territories, and this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment cannot consent, at this date to any such 
     <lb/>
     proposal as that made in your telegram. In one 
     <lb/>
     sense, I quite agree with you that ' it will be 
     <lb/>
     better that all bridges in territories be left to 
     <lb/>
     the territorial government,' but that <choice><sic>proposi<lb break="no"/>ion</sic><corr>proposition</corr></choice> must be coupled with another, namely, that 
     <lb/>
     adequate financial provision therefor be made 
     <lb/>
     by parliament. The Dominion government in the 
     <lb/>
     first place built the two bridges at Macleod and 
     <lb/>
     Lethbridge without reference to the government 
     <lb/>
     of the territories. It was possible that at the 
     <lb/>
     time they were built it was not practicable to 
     <lb/>
     do so, but the fact remains that, in pursuance 
     <lb/>
     of its general public works policy, the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion government built the two bridges in question 
     <lb/>
     and has undertaken to replace them. Under 
     <lb/>
     existing conditions, which the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment does not appear to wish to remedy, we 
     <lb/>
     are content to leave that matter as it stands at 
     <lb/>
     present.

     Mr. Haultain had been pressing for some 
     <lb/>
     definite answer in regard to this matter 
     <lb/>
     from the month of March of that year. Dur<lb break="no"/>ing that period he had written a great many 
     <lb/>
     times to the Minister of the Interior, he 
     <lb/>
     had written to the hon. Minister of Finance, 
     <lb/>
     he had written to the right hon. Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister himself, and the only answer he 
     <lb/>
     ever got from any of these hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     was a reference to some other gentleman, or 
     <lb/>
     a telegram of a somewhat casual character 
     <lb/>
     in which he was told that certain financial 
     <lb/>
     arrangements with the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories would be provided for by a grant 
     <lb/>
     during the present year. It does seem to 
     <lb/>
     me that the Premier of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, a gentleman representing a constitu<lb break="no"/>ency of something over 350,000 people, might 
     <lb/>
     have been answered by any one of these 
     <lb/>
     three gentlemen to whom I have referred in 
     <lb/>
     a somewhat more formal manner than that 
     <lb/>
     which characterized the correspondence 
     <lb/>
     that I have read. On the 8th June Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier wrote to Mr. Haultain. The

     <lb/>
     regret that the returns to which I have 
     <lb/>
     referred have come down in so incomplete 
     <lb/>
     a condition as to impose an enormous amount 
     <lb/>
     of labour on any man who desires to trace 
     <lb/>
     the sequence of this correspondence. I

     With regard to your further request that 
     <lb/>
     legislation be introduced this session con<lb break="no"/>ferring on the territories full provincial or<lb break="no"/>ganization. I have had the honour to discuss 
     <lb/>
     the matter with the members of the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons from the territories. I have asked 
     <lb/>
     them to consider whether it would be advisable 
     <lb/>
     to have such legislation introduced this year. 
     <lb/>
     We are, as you know, introducing a redistribu<lb break="no"/>tion measure at the present session, and we are 
     <lb/>
     giving to the territories a much larger repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in the House of Commons than they 
     <lb/>
     would be entitled to, were they to become a 
     <lb/>
     province. In fact the Bill which we have 
     <lb/>
     introduced allows to the territories a repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in the House of Commons of ten 
     <lb/>
     members. Were they to be admitted at once 
     <lb/>
     as a province they would be entitled to only 
     <lb/>
     six members. It would be a question of ex<lb break="no"/>treme difficulty and complications to give to 
     <lb/>
     the territories at the same time all the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages of full provincial organization with<lb break="no"/>out the corresponding disadvantages.

     Well, my right hon. friend has at last 
     <lb/>
     given a reply to the Prime Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     territories and it does not seem to me to 
     <lb/>
     be a reply which ought to carry very great 
     <lb/>
     weight. He does not take up any of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons for delay which have been urged 
     <lb/>
     during the past two sessions by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister in this letter confines him<lb break="no"/>self almost entirely to the fact that under 
     <lb/>
     the Redistribution Bill which was introdu<lb break="no"/>ced during the present session the territories 
     <lb/>
     are to receive a representation of ten mem<lb break="no"/>bers, whereas, if we went strictly on popu<lb break="no"/>lation, they would be entitled to only six 
     <lb/>
     members. Is that really an answer to the de<lb break="no"/>mand of these people that they should be 
     <lb/>
     accorded a provincial status ? It is not an 
     <lb/>
     answer, certainly, even if the contention 
     <lb/>
     could be supported for a moment. It could 
     <lb/>
     not be supported for a moment, because, 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman only yesterday ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that it would be fair to regard the 
     <lb/>
     territories as having a population of over 
     <lb/>
     300,000 and as the unit of population for Can 
     <lb/>
     ada is something less than 25,000, if the

     territories were created into a province to<lb break="no"/>day they would be entitled to twelve mem<lb break="no"/>bers instead of ten members. Therefore, I 
     <lb/>
     do not think there is very much force in the 
     <lb/>
     suggestion that my right hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     made. I want to point out to my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend and to the House, that, if you create 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories into a province 
     <lb/>
     or provinces, you are not bound by the 
     <lb/>
     census of 1901. The very fact of your giving 
     <lb/>
     them ten members is evidence that you are 
     <lb/>
     not bound by the census of 1901. If you are 
     <lb/>
     bound by the census of 1901 the Territories 
     <lb/>
     would receive only six members, but you 
     <lb/>
    have a perfect right under the legislation 
     <lb/>that exists at the present time to give them 
     <lb/>twelve members. I believe from the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Prime Minister himself that the 
     <lb/>North-west Territories have now a popula<lb break="no"/>tion which entitles them to twelve members 
     <lb/>instead of ten members. Therefore, if you 
     <lb/>organize them into a province they would 
     <lb/>not be under a disadvantage such as my 
     <lb/>right hon. friend has suggested. Ou the con<lb break="no"/>trary, if you do justice to them and 
     <lb/>create them into a province to-morrow, you 
     <lb/>will be obliged from the facts that are 
     <lb/>patent to the government and to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, to give to the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>twelve representatives in parliament instead 
     <lb/>of ten. Premier Haultain replied to that 
     <lb/>letter of the 15th of June, and as I have read 
     <lb/>the whole of the letter to the Prime Minister, 
     <lb/>I had better read the whole of Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain's letter in reply :

     Sir,—I have the honour to acknowledge re<lb break="no"/>ceipt of your letter of the eighth instant, re<lb break="no"/>lating to the question of provincial institutions 
     <lb/>
     in the territories, and to express regret on 
     <lb/>
     the part of the North-west government that 
     <lb/>
     that question has again been put on one side 
     <lb/>
     for a reason which seems quite foreign to the 
     <lb/>
     subject. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With all deference to the opinion expressed 
     <lb/>
     by you, I cannot see that the representation 
     <lb/>
     proposed to be given to the territories under 
     <lb/>
     the Redistribution Bill could be in any way 
     <lb/>
     affected by the passing of concurrent legisla<lb break="no"/>tion granting the provincial status to the terri<lb break="no"/>tories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The provisions of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act relating to representation would not, I 
     <lb/>
     submit, apply to a province which, at the 
     <lb/>
     earliest, could only come into existence at the 
     <lb/>
     same time as the Redistribution Bill became 
     <lb/>
     law. Even if legislation creating a province were 
     <lb/>
     introduced at the present session of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, the actual coming into existence of the 
     <lb/>
     province would necessarily be postponed for 
     <lb/>
     some months to enable territorial affairs to be 
     <lb/>
     wound up, and thus any question with regard 
     <lb/>
     to representation and the effect of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act would be removed. I 
     <lb/>
     might also remind you that upon the admission 
     <lb/>
     of British Columbia into the confederation and 
     <lb/>
     upon the creation of the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     larger representation was given than these two 
     <lb/>
     provinces were respectively entitled to under the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     You say that you have discussed the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of provincial organization with the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the House of Commons from the terri<lb break="no"/>
       
       
            <cb/>
     
     
     tories and asked them to consider whether it 
     <lb/>
     would be advisable to have such legislation in<lb break="no"/>troduced this year. Your letter does not make 
     <lb/>
     it clear what the opinion of these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     is, but I feel justified in asserting that that 
     <lb/>
     opinion was not in accord with the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     the people they represent unless it supported 
     <lb/>
     the claims made by us which are unanimously 
     <lb/>
     endorsed by the North-west Legislature, and 
     <lb/>
     were practically unanimously endorsed by the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories, at the 
     <lb/>
     general elections in May, 1902. The question of 
     <lb/>
     larger representation in the federal parliament 
     <lb/>
     is without doubt an important one, but the in<lb break="no"/>finitely more urgent question of provincial or<lb break="no"/>ganization should not be subordinated to it. 
     <lb/>
     The two questions are quite separate and in<lb break="no"/>dependent, and cannot, I think I have shown, 
     <lb/>
     affect one another. Under any circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     however, the obtaining of provincial powers is 
     <lb/>
     in our opinion of much greater importance to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the territories than additional 
     <lb/>
     representation in a parliament whose failure 
     <lb/>
     to fulfil the duties and obligations it has as<lb break="no"/>sumed with regard to the North-west is one of 
     <lb/>
     our strongest reasons for demanding home rule.

     I forgot to mention in connection with the

     the provincial status should not be given to

     <lb/>
     the fact that the members from territories,

     is to be believed—and he gives reasons why

     <lb/>
     demanding that this question should be 
     <lb/>
     taken up at once, was passed by the terri<lb break="no"/>torial legislature. I have understood—if I 
     <lb/>
     am wrong in this I would like to be cor<lb break="no"/>rected—that Mr. Haultain went to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the North-west Territories in 1902

     <lb/>
     forthwith, that going to the people upon 
     <lb/>
     that platform, he practically swept the con<lb break="no"/>stituencies, and that very few of those who

     were opposed to this government on that ques<lb break="no"/>tion were returned to the assembly. I have

     understood that the legislature of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to-day is practically unani<lb break="no"/>mous upon that point. I have been so in<lb break="no"/>formed by those who profess to know the

     Territories government, to Sir Wilfrid Laur<lb break="no"/>ier, dated the 16th of June, 1903 ; it is found 
     <lb/>
     at page 18, sessional paper 116a, and is as 
     <lb/>
     follows :

     You will please excuse the liberty I take in 
     <lb/>
     addressing you, if it is a liberty to lay before 
     <lb/>
     you facts that I consider will be of material 
     <lb/>

     You are, of course, cognizant of all the re<lb break="no"/>presentations that the territorial government 
     <lb/>
     have made in reference to increase of the 
     <lb/>
     financial assistance that is voted to us from 
     <lb/>
     time to time, and the arguments that have been 
     <lb/>
     advanced why a material increase is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     necessary, if the alternative of provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy were not granted to us. I have had 
     <lb/>
     considerable correspondence with the federal 
     <lb/>
     members representing the territories, who were 
     <lb/>
     kind enough to apprize me of the general re<lb break="no"/>presentations they had made to your govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and I advised them that I consider that 
     <lb/>
     if such were adopted it would reasonably sa<lb break="no"/>tisfy the general public in the territories, and 
     <lb/>
     would put your candidates and your supporters 
     <lb/>
     in the coming election in a position in which 
     <lb/>
     they could fight with zeal and, I am pleased to

     say, with every prospect of success.

     The supplementary grant, and the addition to 
     <lb/>
     the main vote, while not as much as we asked 
     <lb/>
     for, will be of very material assistance to me 
     <lb/>
     in the work of my department as Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     of Public Works. The capital advance tendered 
     <lb/>
     is also needed for the construction of the large 
     <lb/>
     and permanent structures that must be com<lb break="no"/>pleted to meet the requirements of the large 
     <lb/>
     influx of settlers into the country.

     I regret to say, however, that not only as a 
     <lb/>
     member of the territorial government, but as a 
     <lb/>
     citizen of the North-west Territories, I must 
     <lb/>
     dissent most strongly from the proposition to 
     <lb/>
     charge up against this vote the large expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of $84,000 which is purely and simply for 
     <lb/>
     the reconstruction of two federal public works, 
     <lb/>
     viz:—the bridges over the Old Men's and Belly

     rivers, erected by the late Conservative gov<lb break="no"/>ernment.

            <p>
     I have detained the House with the cor<lb break="no"/>respondence at this length principally for 
     <lb/>
     these reasons : In the first place, to show 
     <lb/>
     that this has been a live question in 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories since the year 
     <lb/>
     1900 at least ; in the second place, to 
     <lb/>
     show that it has been the subject of con<lb break="no"/>siderable correspondence between the terri<lb break="no"/>torial government and this government, that 
     <lb/>
     a sub-committee of the Privy Council has 
     <lb/>
     been appointed to deal with it, and that re<lb break="no"/>presentatives of the territorial government 
     <lb/>
     have conferred with that committee; in the 
     <lb/>
     third place, to show the reasons on account 
     <lb/>
     of which this government has declined to 
     <lb/>
     act upon the memorial twice forwarded to 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency by the legislature of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, urging upon this 
     <lb/>
     government that provincial status should be 
     <lb/>
     granted ; and in the fourth place, to prove 
     <lb/>
     by the statement of the Prime Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories and by the reso<lb break="no"/>lution passed by its legislature that the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories are 
     <lb/>
     almost unanimous in their demand that the 
     <lb/>
     provincial status should be granted to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I shall deal very briefly—because I 
     <lb/>
     have taken up the time of the House 
     <lb/>
     longer than I intended—I shall deal very 
     <lb/>
     briefly with some of the objections which 
     <lb/>
     have been raised against granting a 
     <lb/>
     provincial status to the territories. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place, there is the objection 
     <lb/>
     which has been already adverted to in 
     <lb/>
     the letters of Mr. Haultain, that the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the territories is increasing at a 
     <lb/>
     more rapid rate than the population of the 
     <lb/>
     older provinces. I say, as I have several 
     <lb/>
     times before said in this House, and as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain has said in his correspondence, that 
     <lb/>
     if this is to debar the North-west Territo<lb break="no"/>ries from obtaining a provincial status, then 
     <lb/>
     we must deprive them of provincial status 
     <lb/>
     during the next ten or fifteen years. That 
     <lb/>
     reason would deprive them of a provincial 
     <lb/>
     status after they have a population of a 
     <lb/>
     million people—after they have a population 
     <lb/>
     three or four times, possibly five or six 
     <lb/>
     times, that of some of the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Canada which have enjoyed representative 
     <lb/>
     institutions for many years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the next place, the objection was made 
     <lb/>
     —it was made by my hon. friend the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior last year, and I think 
     <lb/>
     also in some of the correspondence—that 
     <lb/>
     with a continually increasing population it 
     <lb/>
     will be difficult to arrange a permanent 
     <lb/>
     financial basis. So far as that is concerned. 
     <lb/>
     it is one of the difficulties which you must 
     <lb/>
     meet in granting a provincial status to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories. It is 
     <lb/>
     impossible to believe that the population of 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
    
    
     those territories will not increase at an 
     <lb/>
     enormously rapid rate during the next ten, 
     <lb/>
     or fifteen, or twenty years ; and if that fact 
     <lb/>
     is to afford an insuperable difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     arranging a permanent financial basis, 
     <lb/>
     then we shall have the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories treated, to a certain ex<lb break="no"/>tent, as wards of this county for a great 
     <lb/>
     many years to come. I do not believe the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty is insuperable. After you have 
     <lb/>
     arrived at a conclusion that the people of 
     <lb/>
     that country are entitled to a provincial 
     <lb/>
     status, why cannot this government, as 
     <lb/>
     demanded by the government of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories, at once appoint a committee for 
     <lb/>
     conference with that government ? And 
     <lb/>
     what reason is there for saying that it is 
     <lb/>
     impossible to find a basis which, on the one 
     <lb/>
     hand, will be just and fair so far as Can<lb break="no"/>ada is concerned, and, on the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     will give the people of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories such an increase in the financial as<lb break="no"/>sistance to be obtained from the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     as the needs of their rapidly increasing 
     <lb/>
     population will from time to time demand 
     <lb/>
     at our hands ? I do not conceal from my<lb break="no"/>self that the question is attended with dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties ; but I suppose that almost every 
     <lb/>
     question of this kind is attended with some 
     <lb/>
     difficulties. The confederation of this Do<lb break="no"/>minion was not unattended with difficulties. 
     <lb/>
     On the contrary, it was accompanied with 
     <lb/>
     difficulties tenfold greater than any of those 
     <lb/>
     which in the present case are considered 
     <lb/>
     so formidable. Those difficulties were 
     <lb/>
     overcome, and we have today a great 
     <lb/>
     Dominion as a result of the courage and 
     <lb/>
     the wisdom of the men who undertook 
     <lb/>
     to grapple with those difficulties ; and 
     <lb/>
     all we require, it seems to me, is a 
     <lb/>
     certain amount of courage and capacity to 
     <lb/>
     be devoted to this question, and some means 
     <lb/>
     can be found by which justice can be done 
     <lb/>
     to the territories in that regard, and at the 
     <lb/>
     same time no injustice will be done to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada as a whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The next point which has been made has 
     <lb/>
     been referred to by my right hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     during the present session. If I may be 
     <lb/>
     permitted to refer to his language, in speak<lb break="no"/>ing a few days ago of the powers which 
     <lb/>
     are possessed by the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, and overlooking for the 
     <lb/>
     moment many of the differences which ex<lb break="no"/>ist between their status and the status of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, he used this language:

     They are as free as any of us, but have not

     as well to keep that power in abeyance in a 
     <lb/>

            <p>

            <p>
     I do not share the apprehensions of my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend and of the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior with regard to these people. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place, although I have not the 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of them which is possessed by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friends from that country who sit 
     <lb/>
     in this House, nevertheless I have some ac<lb break="no"/>quaintance with many of them from 
     <lb/>
     having made a tour through that country 
     <lb/>
     during the past year ; and I am prepared to 
     <lb/>
     say that if there is any body of people in 
     <lb/>
     Canada who would wisely administer a 
     <lb/>
     public domain entrusted to them, it is the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories ; be<lb break="no"/>cause I found in every meeting which I ad<lb break="no"/>dressed in that country that the people were 
     <lb/>
     strongly imbued with the idea that the pub<lb break="no"/>lic domain should be conserved for public 
     <lb/>
     purposes, and not handed over to corpora<lb break="no"/>tions and promoters. I believe that feeling 
     <lb/>
     is very deep and very widespread in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories ; and a feeling of 
     <lb/>
     that kind is absolutely inconsistent with the 
     <lb/>
     possibility that if the public domain were 
     <lb/>
     entrusted to them, and they were granted 
     <lb/>
     the power to incur debt, they would be like<lb break="no"/>ly to use either the one power or the other 
     <lb/>
     in such a way as would not inure to the 
     <lb/>
     public interest of that country or of Canada 
     <lb/>
     as a whole. Who are those people who in<lb break="no"/>habit the North-west ? Why, up to the 
     <lb/>
     present year, they have been largely the 
     <lb/>
     same people who have been sending repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from the older provinces of Can<lb break="no"/>ada—people of exactly the same type, having 
     <lb/>
     the same political training, accustomed to 
     <lb/>
     the same representative institutions ; and 
     <lb/>
     why is it that Mr. John Smith, living in the 
     <lb/>
     eastern provinces of Canada, is to be en<lb break="no"/>trusted with the right to borrow money for 
     <lb/>public purposes, and the same gentleman, 
     <lb/>when he removes to the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, finds himself classed in a different 
     <lb/>category ? I do not understand any such 
     <lb/>argument as that : and I do not believe any 
     <lb/>ordinary citizen of this country, going from 
     <lb/>eastern Canada to the north-west of Canada, 
     <lb/>will be so influenced by the fact that there 
     <lb/>is a great public domain in that country 
     <lb/>that he will be induced either to borrow 
     <lb/>money or to alienate the public domain to 
     <lb/>any unwise extent or for any unwise pur<lb break="no"/>pose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Then, we have now another element com<lb break="no"/>ing into the North-west Territories—an ele<lb break="no"/>ment from the great country to the south 
     <lb/>
     of us. Are we to have any apprehension 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the attitude of these people 
     <lb/>
     on a question of that kind ? They are peo<lb break="no"/>ple who are accustomed to practically the 
     <lb/>same representative institutions as those<lb/>concluding I shall trouble the House With <lb/>enjoyed by the people of Canada, They are <lb/>people who, I believe, for the most part,<lb/>take a deep interest in public affairs ; and<lb/>I believe that any of those people will<lb/>take at once as deep an interest in the pro<lb break="no"/>per administration of the public affairs of<lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
         
         
     this country as any citizen of Canada in 
     <lb/>
     the east or the west. I was particularly 
     <lb/>
     struck with the interest which some of these 
     <lb/>
     people took in the country. I was struck 
     <lb/>
     with the fact that before they emigrated to 
     <lb/>
     this country they took the pains, some of 
     <lb/>
     them at least, to ascertain what were the 
     <lb/>
     laws with regard to the schools. They 
     <lb/>
     wished to know whether their children 
     <lb/>
     would have the advantage of public schools 
     <lb/>
     or not ; and they evinced an interest in 
     <lb/>
     the administration of the public affairs of 
     <lb/>
     the country which, I think, indicates that 
     <lb/>
     we might safely entrust to them, as well as 
     <lb/>
     to our own people from the east, who, with 
     <lb/>
     their descendants, are in that country, the 
     <lb/>
     management of their own local affairs. Un<lb break="no"/>der these circumstances, it does not seem 
     <lb/>
     to me that the reason that has been suggest<lb break="no"/>ed is a good reason. And where are we to 
     <lb/>
     draw the limit ? If 350,000 people in the 
     <lb/>
     North—west Territories cannot be entrusted 
     <lb/>
     to borrow money, are you to entrust that 
     <lb/>
     power to half a million or to a million ? 
     <lb/>
     What number will afford any reasonable 
     <lb/>
     degree of safety ? I see no reason for with<lb break="no"/>holding that power from 350,000 people and 
     <lb/>
     granting it to half a million or a million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is within the bounds of extreme prob<lb break="no"/>ability that the North-west Territories of 
     <lb/>
     Canada will have well nigh one-half a mil<lb break="no"/>lion people before provincial autonomy can 
     <lb/>
     be accomplished if it is undertaken at 
     <lb/>
     once. Therefore there is no good reason 
     <lb/>
     why the government should stay its hand ; 
     <lb/>
     there is no good reason, I believe why 
     <lb/>
     during this present session the govern<lb break="no"/>ment should have stayed its hand. Is there 
     <lb/>
     any objection to granting to the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories the power to 
     <lb/>
     charter railway companies, telegraph com<lb break="no"/>panies, telephone companies and steamship 
     <lb/>
     lines ? That power is possessed by the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Manitoba who dwell alongside of 
     <lb/>
     them ; in what respect are the people of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba better able to say whether or 
     <lb/>
     not a railway company shall be chartered 
     <lb/>
     than are the people of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories who are separated from them only 
     <lb/>
     by an imaginary line ? I see no force in any 
     <lb/>
     suggestion that in respect of powers of that 
     <lb/>
     kind the people of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     should not be placed on exactly the same 
     <lb/>
     plane as the people of eastern Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The people of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     contend, and it seems to me they fairly con<lb break="no"/>tend, that upon the conceding of a provincial 
     <lb/>
     status they should be given control of their 
     <lb/>
     lands and minerals. Objections have been 
     <lb/>
     raised to this ; I shall refer to one of them. 
     <lb/>
     The Premier of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     touched upon this subject in his speech to 
     <lb/>
     which I have already referred and before 
     <lb/>concluding I shall trouble the House with<lb/>
    a quotation from his remarks. I believe 
     <lb/>the argument against granting to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the North-west Territories the right<lb/>to control their own lands is based on the 
     <lb/>theory that Canada as a whole and not the 
     <lb/>people of the North-west Territories are en<lb break="no"/>

         titled to a proprietary interest in those lands, 
     <lb/>
     and that, therefore those lands should 
     <lb/>
     be reserved for the people of Canada, in<lb break="no"/>cluding the eastern provinces, and should 
     <lb/>
     not be committed to the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to be administered by them. 
     <lb/>
     I have already considered the wisdom or 
     <lb/>
     unwisdom of conceding this power to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories so far 
     <lb/>
     as the likelihood of their making an unwise 
     <lb/>
     use of that power is concerned and I shall 
     <lb/>
     not repeat my argument as to that ; but I 
     <lb/>
     say that the arguments used to-day in Can<lb break="no"/>ada with regard to lands in the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories are precisely the arguments used 
     <lb/>
     by English statesmen of forty or fifty 
     <lb/>
     years ago with regard to the public lands 
     <lb/>
     of Canada as a whole, and of the 
     <lb/>
     colonies generally. I had occasion to 
     <lb/>
     look carefully into this question some two 
     <lb/>
    or three years ago and I went into it 
     <lb/>somewhat fully in an address which I de<lb break="no"/>livered in the town of Lindsay in this pro<lb break="no"/>vince. I pointed out on that occasion, what 
     <lb/>I believe to be the fact, that if the policy 
     <lb/>of certain British statesmen had been per<lb break="no"/>severed in, and if the lands of Canada and 
     <lb/>of the other colonies had been administered 
     <lb/>from Downing Street instead of by the colon<lb break="no"/>ies, such friction and dissatisfaction would 
     <lb/>have been created that it is more than prob<lb break="no"/>able that Canada and some of the other col<lb break="no"/>onies would before this have severed their 
     <lb/>connection with the mother country, I see 
     <lb/>no reason why the views which prevailed 
     <lb/>eventually and which reseulted in giving 
     <lb/>to Canada the absolute control of her 
     <lb/>own public lands are not just as forci<lb break="no"/>ble arguments to-day in the mouths of the 
     <lb/>people of the North-west Territories I have 
     <lb/>under my hand in the speech of Mr. Haul- 
     <lb break="yes"/>tain the arguments of British statesmen of 
     <lb/>days gone by. Let me refer to one or two of 
     <lb/>them and you will see that they are exactly 
     <lb/>in line with the views of those who hold 
     <lb/>that the public lands in the North-west 
     <lb/>Territories should be retained by Canada.

     Mr. Haultain, in his speech, referred to the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the mother country in later years 
     <lb/>
     and particularly to what was done when 
     <lb/>
     a constitution was given to the colony of 
     <lb/>
     West Australia in 1890. The policy of the 
     <lb/>
     British government in later years, where 
     <lb/>
     representative institutions have been con<lb break="no"/>ferred on a colony, is to give to the colony 
     <lb/>
     absolute control of its own lands and not to 
     <lb/>
     seek to administer those lands from London. 
     <lb/>
     The same policy was pursued by those who 
     <lb/>
     prepared the Canadian Confederation Act. 
     <lb/>
     The provinces were given the control of their 
     <lb/>
     own public lands in almost every respect. 
     <lb/>
     The province of Nova Scotia has control of 
     <lb/>
     its Crown lands and of its mines and miner<lb break="no"/>als. The same rule prevails in Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island. In the province of Manitoba the 
     <lb/>
     lands are still administered, I believe, by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, but some compensation was 
     <lb/>
     made to that province when it received a 
     <lb/>
     constitution and I believe that since the 
     <lb/>
     erection of the province—although my friend 
     <lb/>
     from Manitoba will know this better than 
     <lb/>
     I do—the swamp lands have been entrusted 
     <lb/>
     to the administration of the province and I 
     <lb/>
     am under the impression, although am not 
     <lb/>
     sure, that any revenue derived from the 
     <lb/>
     administration of these swamp lands belongs 
     <lb/>
     to the province. I am correct in that, am

     <lb/>
     in the maritime provinces on account of the

     <lb/>
     granted to those provinces in this respect ? 
     <lb/>
     The North-west Territories are not the only 
     <lb/>
     part of Canada containing great areas of 
     <lb/>
     surplus lands that may be filled with an 
     <lb/>
     enormous population in the future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am told by a gentleman holding a high 
     <lb/>
     position in the public affairs of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec that in that great province there 
     <lb/>
     are 75,000,000 of acres of the best land in 
     <lb/>
     the world, which will be settled and will 
     <lb/>
     support an enormous population one day. 
     <lb/>
     The province of Quebec administers these 
     <lb/>
     lands. Immigration from foreign countries 
     <lb/>
     promoted by this government may come 
     <lb/>
     to settle on these lands. And yet, while the 
     <lb/>
     lands are controlled absolutely by the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec under their own local pow<lb break="no"/>ers of self-government, the lands of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories are controlled by this 
     <lb/>
     government through the Department of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior. We have heard a great deal lately 
     <lb/>
     of New Ontario, and no one can doubt that 
     <lb/>
     there is a splendid country in Ontario that 
     <lb/>
     will be filled up with a fine population one 
     <lb/>
     of these days, or that immigration will be 
     <lb/>
     brought from foreign countries to new On<lb break="no"/>tario. The lands of that country are ad<lb break="no"/>ministered by the people of Ontario through 
     <lb/>
     their local government, while, in contrast 
     <lb/>
     with that, the people of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories have their lands administered at 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa by this government, through the 
     <lb/>
     Department of the Interior.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. And the same with Manitoba.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). I think I stated 
     <lb/>
     that, except that I pointed out, as Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain has pointed out, that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba received a certain compensation, 
     <lb/>
     I believe for their lands at the time the 
     <lb/>
     province was constituted. Further than 
     <lb/>
     that, a portion of the lands at least have 
     <lb/>
     been handed over to the control of the 
     <lb/>
     province since it was organized. And, so 
     <lb/>
     far as the province of Manitoba is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, I know of no good reason why any 
     <lb/>
     lands that remain to be administered in that 
     <lb/>
     province should not be administered by the 
     <lb/>
     local government instead of by this govern<lb break="no"/>ment. If the principle is good for the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, I admit it is also 
     <lb/>
     good for the province of Manitoba. In mat<lb break="no"/>ters of this kind, I do not think we should 
     <lb/>
     shrink from going the full length. If the 
     <lb/>
     people of Ontario, of Quebec and of the mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces can properly administer their 
     <lb/>
     lands through their own local government, 
     <lb/>
     I say the people of Manitoba and the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories are just as capable of ad<lb break="no"/>
        
        
            <cb/>
          
          
          ministering their lands through their own 
     <lb/>
     local government, and they can better ad<lb break="no"/>minister them than can this central govern<lb break="no"/>ment at Ottawa. Now, Mr. Haultain refers 
     <lb/>
     to some difficulties that might be suggested, 
     <lb/>
     with regard to immigration. I suppose he 
     <lb/>
     refers to homestead entries and matters of 
     <lb/>
     that kind. These questions would have to 
     <lb/>
     be dealt with between this government and 
     <lb/>
     the government of the territories. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that reasonable provisions could be 
     <lb/>
     made with the people of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories which would ensure to the people 
     <lb/>
     of the country as a whole that there would 
     <lb/>
     be no restriction of immigration by reason 
     <lb/>
     of any dealing by the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, with their own lands. The peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the North-west Territories are more 
     <lb/>
     interested than any one else in Canada 
     <lb/>
     in having these lands taken up and oc<lb break="no"/>cupied, in having the country settled, and 
     <lb/>
     in the prosperity that would follow a great 
     <lb/>
     flood of immigration into that country. So 
     <lb/>
     far as that question is concerned, it has been 
     <lb/>
     suggested by Mr. Haultain, I believe, that 
     <lb/>
     it would not be incapable of solution, and 
     <lb/>
     that it could be settled satisfactorily not 
     <lb/>
     only to the people as a whole, but to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think I have dealt, though very briefly, 
     <lb/>
     with the principal objections which have 
     <lb/>
     been pointed out in the correspondence and 
     <lb/>
     in the speeches of the right hon. the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister and the Minister of the Interior in 
     <lb/>
     dealing with this question. I say in conclu<lb break="no"/>sion that, the people of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories are practically unanimous on this 
     <lb/>
     question, that their government is urgent on 
     <lb/>
     this question, and as the matter has had the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of this government for at least 
     <lb/>
     two years and a half, there seems no good 
     <lb/>
     reason why active steps should not be taken 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of giving to these people 
     <lb/>
     the rights of local self-government to which 
     <lb/>
     they are, I believe, justly entitled. I ap<lb break="no"/>prehend no injury, no danger, to the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country from taking that course. 
     <lb/>
     On the other hand, I believe the adoption 
     <lb/>
     of that course will tend to remove and 
     <lb/>
     obviate friction and dissatisfaction among 
     <lb/>
     these people which, however, will prevail 
     <lb/>
     and continue if we longer withhold from 
     <lb/>
     them those complete rights which the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the eastern provinces enjoy, and 
     <lb/>
     which the people of the west, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     could exercise just as prudently and as well 
     <lb/>
     as the people of any province in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, I move : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     settlement of the terms and conditions upon

     which the territories or any part thereof shall

     any such province is established opportunity

     should be given to the people of the territories

     through their accredited representatives of

     I know that there are many matters of 
     <lb/>
     detail which will have to be dealt with when 
     <lb/>
     this question comes to be considered. These 
     <lb/>
     matters of detail will have to be arranged 
     <lb/>
     by conference between representatives of 
     <lb/>
     this government and representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories. For 
     <lb/>
     the present, the proposition which I desire 
     <lb/>
     to place before the House and the country 
     <lb/>
     is this—that the time has arrived when the 
     <lb/>
     same power of local self-government should 
     <lb/>
     be granted to the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories as that enjoyed by the people 
     <lb/>
     of the older provinces of Canada, and that 
     <lb/>
     fills government, in compliance with the 
     <lb/>
     prayer of the legislature of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories twice repeated, should take im<lb break="no"/>mediately, without any further delay what<lb break="no"/>ever, such steps as may be necessary to 
     <lb/>
     accomplish that purpose, which I believe, 
     <lb/>
     to be not only a wise but a just one.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV4">Mr. FRANK OLIVER</persName> (Alberta). The 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories are certainly to be 
     <lb/>
     congratulated on having received so much 
     <lb/>
     recognition from the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     on this occasion, and from his followers. 
     <lb/>
     The people of the west will no doubt with 
     <lb/>
     great satisfaction hear of the interest he has 
     <lb/>
     taken and of the arguments he has made in 
     <lb/>
     their behalf. As one of the representatives 
     <lb/>
           
           
            <cb/>
         
         
     of the territories in parliament, I can assure 
     <lb/>
     the House that it is with great pleasure and 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction I heard him take the stand he 
     <lb/>
     has taken to-night. I hope he is not alone, 
     <lb/>
     and that the gentlemen who sit behind him 
     <lb/>
     take as great a degree of interest as he 
     <lb/>
     has taken on this occasion. It has struck 
     <lb/>
     me however, and I think it will strike the 
     <lb/>
     people of the territories as well, that pos<lb break="no"/>sibly there would have been a more defi<lb break="no"/>nite and satisfactory result from the atti<lb break="no"/>tude of hon. gentlemen opposite had the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition spoken sooner. This 
     <lb/>
     is not a new question ; as he has intimated.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Would my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend permit me to make a statement in 
     <lb/>
     regard to that ? It was not until after we 
     <lb/>
     began the debate on the Transcontinental 
     <lb/>
     Railway Bill that the papers to which I 
     <lb/>
     have been referring to-night were printed, 
     <lb/>
     and since that debate has concluded I have 
     <lb/>
     spent a good deal of time in endeavouring 
     <lb/>
     to get this correspondence brought down, 
     <lb/>
     and now we have it in a very confused 
     <lb/>
     shape. But I can assure my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     that it was only for that reason I had de<lb break="no"/>layed until now in speaking on this matter. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend will do me the justice, I am 
     <lb/>
     sure, to remember that I brought the matter 
     <lb/>
     to the attention of the government in speak<lb break="no"/>ing in the debate on the address at the 
     <lb/>commencement of the session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Certainly I do not wish 
     <lb/>
     to do the leader of the opposition any in<lb break="no"/>justice uuder the circumstances, and I was 
     <lb/>
     not alluding to that particular feature of the 
     <lb/>
     case. I was about to say that the question 
     <lb/>
     is even older than he suggested in his open<lb break="no"/>ing remarks. It is not a question which 
     <lb/>
     arose in 1896, or in 1897, or in 1900. Having 
     <lb/>
     been a member of the North-west Assembly 
     <lb/>
     myself, I am perhaps more familiar with the 
     <lb/>
     matter than he is, and I can assure him that 
     <lb/>
     the question is of much more ancient date ; 
     <lb/>
     that it has been claiming the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the people of the territories for many years, 
     <lb/>
     and that the position has remained substan<lb break="no"/>tially the same all these years. That is to 
     <lb/>
     say, there has been a demand, either for 
     <lb/>
     terms which would go with provincial or<lb break="no"/>ganization, or equally good terms without 
     <lb/>
     provincial organization. For the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories the question has 
     <lb/>
     been one of finance and not of authority ; 
     <lb/>
     it has been a material question and not a 
     <lb/>
     theoretical question. The question in 1896, 
     <lb/>
     in 1897, and in 1900, was with them how to 
     <lb/>
     best govern the territories, how to meet the 
     <lb/>
     financial requirements of that government. 
     <lb/>
     and how best to bring to the notice and 
     <lb/>
     favourable attention of this government the 
     <lb/>
     requirements of that country. The finan<lb break="no"/>cial needs of the territories are the same 
     <lb/>
     to-day as they have always been, except that 
     <lb/>
     they are greater to-day than they have 
     <lb/>
     ever been. Although my hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     said that he did not have in his possession 
     <lb/>
     the particular correspondence that has been 
     <lb/>

     laid upon the Table, and upon which he 
     <lb/>
     made such lengthy remarks this evening, 
     <lb/>
     still, as a member of this House since 1896, 
     <lb/>
     he must have known that there was a con<lb break="no"/>tinual conflict of opinion between the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the territories and the government 
     <lb/>
     here as to the amount of money that should 
     <lb/>
     be placed at the disposal of that govern<lb break="no"/>ment by this government. If he had been 
     <lb/>
     as enthusiastic ever since 1896 as he has 
     <lb/>
     expressed himself to-night, the people of 
     <lb/>
     the territories would have benefited there<lb break="no"/>by in the years which have intervened, and 
     <lb/>
     would have benefited substantially even this 
     <lb/>
     year. It is no secret that the opposition 
     <lb/>
     have a great deal to do with shaping the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the government, and that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, in considering the demands of the 
     <lb/>
     territories from time to time, have had to 
     <lb/>
     consider the possibility of opposition from 
     <lb/>
     the opposition. It has been the somewhat 
     <lb/>
     thankless place of members of this House 
     <lb/>
     from the territories supporting the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, to bring before the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House and of the country, year after year, 
     <lb/>
     the financial requirements of the territories. 
     <lb/>
     I do not recall that up to the present mo<lb break="no"/>ment we have received any assistance from 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition or from his 
     <lb/>
     supporters on the other side of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). I think my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend is mistaken in that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Well, I am willing to be 
     <lb/>
     corrected, but I do not remember anything 
     <lb/>
     of that kind at this moment. I may say 
     <lb/>
     that this is a subject that has taken my 
     <lb/>
     attention very strongly from year to year, 
     <lb/>
     and while I would not wish at all to ques<lb break="no"/>tion the statement, still, as I said, it does 
     <lb/>
     not come to my memory that we ever did 
     <lb/>
     receive any assistance. I would like to say 
     <lb/>
     that had that interest been taken by the 
     <lb/>
     members of the opposition in the early part 
     <lb/>
     of the session that was taken later on and 
     <lb/>
     to-night, the territories would no doubt have 
     <lb/>
     gained a very considerable financial bene<lb break="no"/>fit and would have been still better able to 
     <lb/>
     meet the requirements that they are called 
     <lb/>
     upon to meet. The point I wish to make is 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the territories want money 
     <lb/>
     and not talk. That is the question at issue, 
     <lb/>
     and the closer we keep to it the better will 
     <lb/>
     be the understanding, and the better the re<lb break="no"/>sults that we will have. While I do not wish 
     <lb/>
     to go into anything very controversial at this 
     <lb/>
     particular time, I will take the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of pointing out that a proposition which 
     <lb/>
     involves the placing before the people of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories of the idea that they 
     <lb/>
     have been very badly used both financially 
     <lb/>
     and otherwise, that their premier, in fact, 
     <lb/>
     has been insulted by this government, and yet 
     <lb/>
     that does not offer in any degree or in any 
     <lb/>
     way any substantial suggestion for immedi<lb break="no"/>ate or future relief, is not a proposition that 
     <lb/>
     is likely to meet with very much favour 
     <lb/>
     at their hands. Had it been intended to 
     <lb/>
     actually benefit the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
          
          
            <cb/>
         
         
     and had the address which we have listened 
     <lb/>
     to to-night contained propositions definitely 
     <lb/>
     tending to result in financial benefit to the 
     <lb/>
     territories, we could appreciate the action 
     <lb/>
     taken, but when action has not been taken 
     <lb/>
     until the last days of a session which al<lb break="no"/>ready has lasted over seven months— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBERS</persName>. How do you know 
     <lb/>
     they are the last days of the session ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. We hope they are. When 
     <lb/>
     action has not been taken until the last 
     <lb/>
     days of a session which has already lasted 
     <lb/>
     over seven months, and when brought for<lb break="no"/>ward no practical suggestion for meeting 
     <lb/>
     the present difficulty is contained in it, there 
     <lb/>
     is only one conclusion to be drawn, and 
     <lb/>
     that is that the remarks of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man are chiefly made to be added to the tons 
     <lb/>
     of printed matter already lying franked in 
     <lb/>
     stacks outside and inside of this building 
     <lb/>
     for distribution throughout the territories. 
     <lb/>
     Talk is cheap, but it is money that counts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are more than pleased to hear the 
     <lb/>
     expression of confidence by the hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition in the intelligence and 
     <lb/>
     honesty of the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories. I was not aware that they 
     <lb/>
     needed any particular certificate in that 
     <lb/>
     regard, but at any rate, we are pleased 
     <lb/>
     to have it from such a good authority. We 
     <lb/>
     believe that all his kind words are fully de<lb break="no"/>served, although the modesty of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories and of their 
     <lb/>
     representatives would prevent them claim<lb break="no"/>ing any special advantage in that regard. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman has been very willing 
     <lb/>
     to concede to us the control of the public 
     <lb/>
     lands in the territories, and of the public 
     <lb/>
     resources of the territories, and he has been 
     <lb/>
     willing to concede us the right to incur debt 
     <lb/>
     on our own behalf. As he said, I do not 
     <lb/>
     know why the people of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories are not just as able to control their 
     <lb/>
     own land satisfactorily and just as worthy 
     <lb/>
     of being allowed to contract debt for public 
     <lb/>
     purposes as the people of any other part 
     <lb/>
     of the country. But, that is not the point. 
     <lb/>
     The point is this : What subsidy is to be 
     <lb/>
     given to the people of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories as the basis of their provincial or<lb break="no"/>ganization, so that they will not need to sell 
     <lb/>
     their public lands and so that they will not 
     <lb/>
     need to go in debt ? The hon. gentleman was 
     <lb/>
     very generous with us in permitting us to 
     <lb/>
     do as we like with our own. What we 
     <lb/>
     want to know is what share he is going to 
     <lb/>
     give us in the general financial arrange<lb break="no"/>ments of the Dominion. That is a matter 
     <lb/>
     which he proposed to leave to a commission 
     <lb/>
     or to arbitration. That is not the way in 
     <lb/>
     which the Premier of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories left it. He made certain definite 
     <lb/>
     financial propositions. He said : Give us 
     <lb/>
     these as the essential part of provincial or<lb break="no"/>ganization. But, the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position does not say that he will give them 
     <lb/>
     these. He says : We will leave it to a com<lb break="no"/>mittee or to a commission. As a representa<lb break="no"/>

     tive of the North-west Territories, and be<lb break="no"/>lieving that the proposition made by the Pre<lb break="no"/>mier would be a good proposition for the ter<lb break="no"/>ritories if acceded to, we want to know what 
     <lb/>
     the hon. leader of the opposition and his fol<lb break="no"/>lowers on the floor of parliament are pre<lb break="no"/>pared to give towards meeting the demands 
     <lb/>
     of the Premier of the North-west Territor<lb break="no"/>ies. That is a definite proposition. It is 
     <lb/>
     not something that is in the clouds. It is 
     <lb/>
     not misty. Upon the acceptance of that 
     <lb/>
     proposition depends the whole question. 
     <lb/>
     Provincial autonomy is only a name, but 
     <lb/>
     the amount of subsidy which the proposed 
     <lb/>
     province will receive is an important fact, 
     <lb/>
     and that is the point we want settled or 
     <lb/>
     approximately settled before we go into a 
     <lb/>
     provincial organization.

     offers of help from our hon. friends op<lb break="no"/>posite what those offers of help mean. We 
     <lb/>
     want to know the measure of their sympathy

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I may return the compli<lb break="no"/>ment. It is of no advantage to the people 
     <lb/>
     of the territories that they should be per<lb break="no"/>mitted to sell the lands of the territories. If 
     <lb/>
     they sell the lands, settlement is thereby de<lb break="no"/>terred; if they do not sell them, they derive 
     <lb/>
     no revenue from them. and in so far as that 
     <lb/>
     is concerned, they might as well be adminis<lb break="no"/>tered by the Dominion government as by 
     <lb/>
     themselves. It is, I may say, a rather cool 
     <lb/>
     proposition that political credit should be 
     <lb/>
     claimed for an offer to permit the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories to control their own lands, when 
     <lb/>
     such a large portion of those lands have al<lb break="no"/>ready passed out of the control of either 
     <lb/>
     government, and when the balance of these 
     <lb/>
     lands are not being sold and no revenue is 
     <lb/>
     being derived from them by the government 
     <lb/>
     which has them in hand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The proposition, as it has been laid 
     <lb/>
     down, simply amounts to this: We 
     <lb/>
     will give you provincial autonomy; we 
     <lb/>
    will give you the lands that at present 
     <lb/>are not being sold, and that the general good 
     <lb/>of the country requires shall not be sold ; 
     <lb/>we will allow you to go into debt to any 
     <lb/>extent you like; but we will not say what 
     <lb/>we will give you to run your government 
     <lb/>on; we will keep away from that subject 
     <lb/>altogether. It seems to me most unfair 
     <lb/>that an attempt should be made to create a 
     <lb/>feeling of dissatisfaction in the North-west 
     <lb/>Territories, without any steps whatever 
     <lb/>being taken to allay the dissatisfaction thus 
     <lb/>created, without saying in any shape or 
     <lb/>form, how far the desires of the people of 
     <lb/>the North-west in regard to financial assist<lb break="no"/>ance are to be acceded to. Just what these 
     <lb/>desires are it may be well to inform the 
     <lb/>House, and perhaps some gentleman on the<lb/>
  
  
            <cb/>
        
        
     other side will be able to tell us how far 
     <lb/>
     they will go towards acceding to these de<lb break="no"/>sires. I may point out that in the printed 
     <lb/>
     papers that have been placed before the 
     <lb/>
     House the financial question is the essential 
     <lb/>
     point in every one of the arguments of Pre<lb break="no"/>mier Haultain and of his government. In 
     <lb/>
     his memorial of April 4th, 1903, the com<lb break="no"/>plaint is : 
     <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>

            <p>
     In the memorial which follows the com<lb break="no"/>plaint is that there are not sufficient addi<lb break="no"/>tions to the annual grant. In Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain's letter to the Prime Minister he draws 
     <lb/>
     particular attention—

            <p>
     And all through the correspondence the 
     <lb/>
     great question is the financial question, the 
     <lb/>
     question of the amount of money that is to 
     <lb/>
     be derived by the territories from the na<lb break="no"/>tional treasury as a condition of entering 
     <lb/>
     into the provincial status. It has been 
     <lb/>
     said that the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories are unanimously in fav<lb break="no"/>our of this provincial organization. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve they are unanimously in favour of 
     <lb/>
     it if they can get it on the terms proposed, 
     <lb/>
     but I am just as certain that they are just 
     <lb/>
     as unanimously against it unless they get it 
     <lb/>
     on these terms, or on some similar terms. I 
     <lb/>
     am perfectly satisfied that they are unani<lb break="no"/>mously against it if they are only to get it 
     <lb/>
     on the same terms as it has been granted to 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces of the Dominion, and I 
     <lb/>
     will take the liberty of reading from the 
     <lb/>
     definite proposition made by Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     in support of my statement. He submitted 
     <lb/>
     a draft Bill for the establishment of the 
     <lb/>
     territories as a province, and in that Bill 
     <lb/>
     he suggested the measure of subsidies which 
     <lb/>
     the territories should receive: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     Now, the proposition which the Premier 
     <lb/>
     of the territories asks this parliament to 
     <lb/>
     agree to, and to which inferentially the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition has asked parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to agree—but which he has been very 
     <lb/>
     careful not to definitely ask anybody to 
     <lb/>
     agree to—is that there shall be a continual 
     <lb/>
     readjustment of the per capita grant and 
     <lb/>
     of the debt account on the basis of the con<lb break="no"/>tinually increasing population. I am here 
     <lb/>
     to say that no other arrangement can or 
     <lb/>
     would be satisfactory. No arrangement 
     <lb/>
     would be satisfactory that would not pro<lb break="no"/>vide for an increase in the per capita grant 
     <lb/>
     and in the debt allowance according to in<lb break="no"/>crease of population. It is a play upon 
     <lb/>
     words, or it is a misuse of words to call 
     <lb/>
     an arrangement entered into under those 
     <lb/>
     conditions, acquiring the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces of Canada. It is acquiring 
     <lb/>
     rights which the other provinces do not 
     <lb/>
     possess. I will be very glad if the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces will agree to it, but I, as a re<lb break="no"/>presentative of the North-west Territories, 
     <lb/>
     do not propose to go into a sort of blind pool, 
     <lb/>
     not knowing how we are going to come 
     <lb/>
     out when a conclusion has been reach<lb break="no"/>ed on this very momentous question. As 
     <lb/>
     the members of the House know, in the 
     <lb/>
     case of the other provinces the per capita 
     <lb/>
     grant is paid on the actual or estimated 
     <lb/>
     population at the date of confederation, and 
     <lb/>
     that population is not continually increased. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. The other provinces are go<lb break="no"/>ing to ask for that to be changed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Possibly so, but I am 
     <lb/>
     speaking of the condition as it exists. I am 
     <lb/>
     not finding fault with the proposition of 
     <lb/>
     Premier Haultain, but what I am finding 
     <lb/>
     fault with is that when the words 'provin<lb break="no"/>cial organization' or ' provincial autonomy' 
     <lb/>
     are used, the inference should be given out 
     <lb/>
     that we are asking for the same terms that 
     <lb/>
     the provinces now have. We are not ask<lb break="no"/>ing for these terms ; we would not accept 
     <lb/>
     these terms ; we could not afford to ac<lb break="no"/>cept these terms ; we must get different 
     <lb/>
     terms, and the question is : Will the op<lb break="no"/>position, which is in such generous mood, 
     <lb/>
     accept those terms. The leader of the 
     <lb/>
  
  
            <cb/>
          
          
     opposition had this document before him, 
     <lb/>
     and he was careful not to say that he would 
     <lb/>
     accept these terms. He was careful to con<lb break="no"/>vey the idea that this question was a mere 
     <lb/>
     matter of detail, and that it could be ar<lb break="no"/>ranged by a committee. I want to say that 
     <lb/>
     it is not a matter of detail. I say that it is 
     <lb/>
     an essential question, and that upon this 
     <lb/>
     question hinges the willingness of the people 
     <lb/>
     to enter into the status of a province, or to 
     <lb/>
     remain outside of that status. I was somewhat 
     <lb/>
     astonished to hear the hon. member (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Borden, Halifax) indicate that the question 
     <lb/>
     as to whether there should be one province 
     <lb/>
     or two was a mere question of detail. The 
     <lb/>
     question of the number of provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     the question of the subsidies which these 
     <lb/>
     provinces shall receive are the essential 
     <lb/>
     questions ; other questions are matters of 
     <lb/>
     detail. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question whether the territories, as 
     <lb/>
     they are at present, have all the powers 
     <lb/>
     which a province has, is a question of de<lb break="no"/>tail ; because, if they have not those pow<lb break="no"/>ers, they can be given to them in their 
     <lb/>
     present condition as well as they could if 
     <lb/>
     they were a province. The hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition questioned the previous state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Premier, that the only import<lb break="no"/>ant right belonging to a province which the 
     <lb/>
     territories did not hold was the right to in<lb break="no"/>cur debt. That statement stands, and 
     <lb/>
     stands correct in all essential particulars. 
     <lb/>
     If the territories lack any other power 
     <lb/>
     than that, it can be given to them without  
     <lb/>
     provincial organization ; and provincial or<lb break="no"/>ganization, with the power to incur debt, 
     <lb/>
     rests, not upon a legislative enactment in 
     <lb/>
     itself, but upon a fixed subsidy being grant<lb break="no"/>ed. Until there is a fixed subsidy, the pro<lb break="no"/>vince, if the territories were created or call<lb break="no"/>ed a province to-morrow, could not incur 
     <lb/>
     debt. Though this parliament were to pass 
     <lb/>
     a thousand Acts allowing it to incur debt, 
     <lb/>
     its credit would not be good until it had a 
     <lb/>
     fixed subsidy. Therefore, the question of 
     <lb/>
     incurring debt depends entirely upon the 
     <lb/>
     terms upon which the subsidy for the pro<lb break="no"/>vince to be created is granted. Given a 
     <lb/>
     permanent, fixed subsidy, the province or 
     <lb/>
     the territories, if you like to call them such, 
     <lb/>
     could incur debt, because their credit would 
     <lb/>
     be good. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have said that the difference between 
     <lb/>
     the powers of the territories as they exist 
     <lb/>
     and the powers of a province are not im<lb break="no"/>portant. They are not of chief import<lb break="no"/>ance. The chief purpose of a local govern<lb break="no"/>ment is to attend to local interests, of which 
     <lb/>
     the greater are the needs of education, the 
     <lb/>
     taking care of municipal legislation and the 
     <lb/>
     providing of the smaller public works. If 
     <lb/>
     these needs are attended to, it matters not 
     <lb/>
     whether it is under the name of a province 
     <lb/>
     or a territory. The needs and require<lb break="no"/>ments of the people are met ; and if 
     <lb/>
     they are fully met the people are better 
     <lb/>
     satisfied than they would be with an empty 
     <lb/>
     offer to allow them to sell their public lands 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <pb n="13891" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1903-10-13_Page_13891.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">13892</fw>
        
        
     and to incur debt on their own account, 
     <lb/>
     which, as far as the proposition has been 
     <lb/>
     laid before us, might have to be met by 
     <lb/>
     local taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will just draw attention again to the 
     <lb/>
     difference in the status of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     and the status of the territories in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter of subsidy, which, as I said before, is 
     <lb/>
     the main matter. The total subsidy per 
     <lb/>
     head amounts, in Ontario, to 66 1/3 cents, in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec to 66 cents, in Nova Scotia to 94 1/4 
     <lb/>
     cents, in New Brunswick to $1.40, in Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Columbia to $1.72, in Manitoba to $2.08 1/2, 
     <lb/>
     in Prince Edward Island to $2.05 1/2, and in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, on the grant of this 
     <lb/>
     year, to $4.47 2/5. Now, unless our hon. friends 
     <lb/>
     are prepared to give us some definite assur<lb break="no"/>ance that we are not going to be placed in 
     <lb/>
     an inferior position financially to that which 
     <lb/>
     we occupy at the present time, I certainly 
     <lb/>
     cannot say that we are in favour of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy, especially when it is 
     <lb/>
     held out to us that provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     means giving us provincial organization on 
     <lb/>
     the same footing as the provinces. We do not 
     <lb/>
     want it on those terms ; we cannot afford 
     <lb/>
     to take it on those terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There has been put up the argument that 
     <lb/>
     the territories should have control of their 
     <lb/>
     public lands and of their own resources in 
     <lb/>
     all ways, in order that they might be able 
     <lb/>
     to aid railways. I do not know just where 
     <lb/>
     this idea emanated from at present ; but I 
     <lb/>
     take the liberty of calling the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House to the fact that as a result of the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings of this session, as far as it has 
     <lb/>
     gone, the North-west is not doing badly in 
     <lb/>
     the matter of aid to railways. It stands at 
     <lb/>
     present to benefit by the credit of the coun<lb break="no"/>try at large to the extent of some $9,000,000 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the Canadian Northern Railway 
     <lb/>
     and some $12,000,000 in regard to the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk Pacific. It might be, if the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories had control of their own 
     <lb/>
     lands, they would be required to pledge 
     <lb/>
     those lands to give aid to railways. I am 
     <lb/>
     in a position to say that it was for the de<lb break="no"/>finite purpose of being able to do so in 
     <lb/>
     years gone by that the demand was made 
     <lb/>
     for control of the lands at a time when there 
     <lb/>
     was no railway extension in the territories, 
     <lb/>
     when railway extension was very greatly 
     <lb/>
     needed, and when the lands of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories had been given and were being given 
     <lb/>
     to aid in the construction of railways not 
     <lb/>
     in the territories at all. At that time the 
     <lb/>
     territories did demand and require the con<lb break="no"/>trol of their own lands for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     aiding railways ; but to-day, I submit, the 
     <lb/>
     position is very considerably different. To<lb break="no"/>day there are no lands in the territories 
     <lb/>
     being sold to speculators ; to-day there are 
     <lb/>
     no lands in the territories being granted to 
     <lb/>
     railways, but railways are being provided 
     <lb/>
     in the territories as they never were pro<lb break="no"/>vided before—liberally and under satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory conditions. That reason, then, for the 
     <lb/>
     control of lands certainly does not exist. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In regard to the question whether there 
     <lb/>
   
   
            <cb/>
       
       
     should be one province or two, I may point 
     <lb/>
     out that the Bill which the Premier has 
     <lb/>
     submitted provides for only one province. 
     <lb/>
     For my own part, considering the territories 
     <lb/>
     in their present condition, with their pre<lb break="no"/>sent population, I have no hesitation in de<lb break="no"/>claring myself in favour of only one pro<lb break="no"/>vince. But the comparison which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition has made between 
     <lb/>
     the territories and the other parts of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion does not hold. There is no other 
     <lb/>
     equal area of the Dominion which offers the 
     <lb/>
     same prospect of an early settlement of an 
     <lb/>
     immense population as does the territories ; 
     <lb/>
     and it is fair matter for consideration 
     <lb/>
     whether such a large area, if fully popu<lb break="no"/>lated, might not be better divided into two 
     <lb/>
     or more provinces rather than be held as 
     <lb/>
     only one. I submit that at this mo<lb break="no"/>ment, when there is a prospect of the early 
     <lb/>
     construction of two lines of railway across 
     <lb/>
     the territories, through the most fertile part 
     <lb/>
     and the prospect of an early and very large 
     <lb/>
     increase of population in that particular 
     <lb/>
     part of the country, which has until recent 
     <lb/>
     years been almost uninhabited, it is hardly 
     <lb/>
     opportune to decide on all questions re<lb break="no"/>lating to the manner of a final organization 
     <lb/>
     of the territories. I beg to assure hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen that the territories are not in the 
     <lb/>
     state of excitement in regard to provincial 
     <lb/>
     organization which they seem to imagine. 
     <lb/>
     They will find that with fair treatment in 
     <lb/>
     the matter of subsidy, the people will be 
     <lb/>
     satisfied, whatever the politicians may be, 
     <lb/>
     or whatever may be those who would desire 
     <lb/>
     to exploit the resources of the country if 
     <lb/>
     placed in other than the present hands. 
     <lb/>
     In regard to the treatment accorded the 
     <lb/>
     Premier of the territories by the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this government, I may say that 
     <lb/>
     I have had a long acquaintance with Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain, and I am quite satisfied that he 
     <lb/>
     is able to protect himself ; and from my more 
     <lb/>
     brief acquaintance with the members of the 
     <lb/>
     present government, I believe they are able 
     <lb/>
     to take their own part, and that we can 
     <lb/>
     leave that matter to be settled between 
     <lb/>
     them. In regard to the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, it is a different matter. 
     <lb/>
     The questions at issue are questions con<lb break="no"/>cerning them and interesting to them, and 
     <lb/>
     I am bound to say that the answer to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories has 
     <lb/>
     been fairly satisfactory. It is contained in 
     <lb/>
     the main and supplementary estimates of 
     <lb/>
     the present session, totalling something like 
     <lb/>
     $1,040,000. This is the answer we want<lb break="no"/>ed ; this is the answer for which we 
     <lb/>
     asked ; this is the answer we receiv<lb break="no"/>ed, and I beg to assure the House that, 
     <lb/>
     so far as it goes, it is entirely satisfactory, 
     <lb/>
     very much more so than would be any poss<lb break="no"/>ible interchange of civilities that might have 
     <lb/>
     gone on between the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     two governments. I might say also, in 
     <lb/>
     answer to the question as to the attitude of 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, that we are here to support and to 
     <lb/>

     advance the interests of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories. Speaking for my<lb break="no"/>self—as I am entitled to speak for myself 
     <lb/>
     only—I support the government so long as 
     <lb/>
     I consider it is supporting the interests of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories. In this par<lb break="no"/>ticular instance I am bound to say that I 
     <lb/>
     believe the North-west Territories has this 
     <lb/>
     year received a response to its demand and 
     <lb/>
     to its requirements which comes nearer be<lb break="no"/>ing satisfactory than any which it has here<lb break="no"/>tofore received. So far, then, we are en<lb break="no"/>titled to congratulate ourselves upon the 
     <lb/>
     results achieved, and I believe the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories will give due 
     <lb/>
     credit both to the government and to their 
     <lb/>
     representatives. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. If the people of the west 
     <lb/>
     are satisfied with what has been done this 
     <lb/>
     year, why does Premier Haultain say that 
     <lb/>
     they have never asked for the establishment 
     <lb/>
     of a capital account, and refuse to accept 
     <lb/>
     the money on that basis ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. He called a special meeting 
     <lb/>
     of the assembly to vote $250,000, and they 
     <lb/>
     were in a hurry to vote it ; they did not 
     <lb/>
     let the grass grow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I am very glad my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend interrupted me on this point, because 
     <lb/>
     I had nearly missed it. As I said before, 
     <lb/>
     the power which goes with provincial or<lb break="no"/>ganization is the power of borrowing money. 
     <lb/>
     This is the power which the hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition is most anxious to give to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories. It 
     <lb/>
     and the power to sell the lands are appar<lb break="no"/>ently the only powers he is willing to give 
     <lb/>
     the territories. In the memorandum which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain submitted to the government 
     <lb/>
     it will be found that one of the grounds of 
     <lb/>
     complaint is that we are not permitted to 
     <lb/>
     draw on the future. He points out that ex<lb break="no"/>tensive works are needed, and he com<lb break="no"/>plains that under their present status they 
     <lb/>
     are not permitted to draw on the future— 
     <lb/>
     to borrow money. That is his strong ground 
     <lb/>
     in demanding provincial organization, and 
     <lb/>
     now, when the government offers to advance 
     <lb/>
     and does advance, a matter of $250,000, the 
     <lb/>
     opposition want to know why it is done, and 
     <lb/>
     say that nobody asked for it and that it 
     <lb/>
     will not be spent. Surely, this money is 
     <lb/>
     just as useful to the people of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories when advanced from the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     treasury as it would be if borrowed in the 
     <lb/>
     outside market. Surely, it is as much use to 
     <lb/>
     them and will build as many public works. 
     <lb/>
     Besides that, if they had borrowed it in the 
     <lb/>
     ordinary market, they would have had to 
     <lb/>
     pay interest, but by the present arrange<lb break="no"/>ment they are not required to pay interest, 
     <lb/>
     and indeed it is not at all certain, as the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance pointed out, that they 
     <lb/>
     will ever have to account for the principal; 
     <lb/>
     that is a matter which will be settled when 
     <lb/>
     a final provincial organization is arrived at. 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. HACKETT</persName>. Might I ask the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman if he supported the resolution for 
     <lb/>
     home rule for Ireland ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I did not happen to be here 
     <lb/>
     when that vote was taken ; 1 had not arriv<lb break="no"/>ed in parliament, but if it is of any interest 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. member or to the House, I 
     <lb/>
     would say that if I had been here I would 
     <lb/>
     not have supported it.

            <p>
                   <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. HACKETT</persName>. The majority of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on that side of the House did 
     <lb/>
     support it, and I think it is strange that, 
     <lb/>
     after supporting that resolution for home 
     <lb/>
     rule for Ireland, they should now oppose 
     <lb/>
     home rule for the west. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. It does not concern me 
     <lb/>
     what the other members of the House did 
     <lb/>
     on that occasion or on any other occasion, 
     <lb/>
     as possibly members on both sides very 
     <lb/>
     well know. However, I do not see What that 
     <lb/>
     has to do with the question, and I would 
     <lb/>
     wish to point out to the hon. member, and 
     <lb/>
     to the gentlemen on both sides, that it is 
     <lb/>
     not we who are objecting to provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy ; we are asking provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy, but we want it on certain terms. 
     <lb/>
     It is hon. gentlemen opposite who are talk<lb break="no"/>ing provincial autonomy, but are not wil<lb break="no"/>ling to give it. They will not give the 
     <lb/>
     terms that alone make provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy a practical and reasonable proposi<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Would it not be a pro<lb break="no"/>per thing to settle whether parliament is 
     <lb/>
     prepared to give it or not, and then arrange 
     <lb/>
     the details ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. We understand that exact<lb break="no"/>ly. That is a view hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     take, but that is not the view we take. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. You take the view that 
     <lb/>
     it should not be given on any terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Not at all. I said in this 
     <lb/>
     House last session, and this session, and I 
     <lb/>
     take the liberty of repeating it, that if the 
     <lb/>
     House will give the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     the terms asked for in the draft Bill con<lb break="no"/>tained in these papers, I will certainly sup<lb break="no"/>port it most strongly. We will all support 
     <lb/>
     it. These are the terms we want. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I did not wish to do the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman personally any injustice. In 
     <lb/>
     making the statement I did. I referred to 
     <lb/>
     the government he supports. They are not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to give the autonomy on any terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I am not discussing what 
     <lb/>
     the government have done. The terms of 
     <lb/>
     this draft Bill are what we want. That 
     <lb/>
     is what we want the government to do and 
     <lb/>
     that is what we want the opposition to say 
     <lb/>
     they will do—but they won't ;  they are very 
     <lb/>
     careful not to. The leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion spoke for two hours, but was careful 
     <lb/>
     to go around this point, and that gives us to 
     <lb/>
     understand that he does not mean to con<lb break="no"/>

     cede these terms. We do not expect we can

     get the terms unless we get some support

     from the other side of the House.

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. There were a great many 
     <lb/>
     who were not here. And the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     will remember that it was stated in the de<lb break="no"/>bate last Saturday—if I may have the pri<lb break="no"/>vilege of referring to it—that keeping away 
     <lb/>
     from the polls was an evidence of opinion 
     <lb/>
     as well as going to the polls. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     we are entitled to claim that those of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's following who remained 
     <lb/>
     away—— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LANC1">Mr. LANCASTER</persName>. They were all paired 
     <lb/>
     with gentlemen on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House. Every member of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     either voted or was paired. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I was discussing this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of debt, the condition which has allow<lb break="no"/>ed the territories an advance of $250,000. 1 
     <lb/>
     point out that this is strictly in accordance 
     <lb/>
     with the request which has been made by 
     <lb/>
     the government of the North-west Territor<lb break="no"/>ies from time to time, and which was in<lb break="no"/>troduced in the resolution before the House. 
     <lb/>
     And, in regard to the expenditure of the 
     <lb/>
     money, Mr. Haultain says that an advance 
     <lb/>
     on capital account is nothing more or less 
     <lb/>
     than a loan on which, eventually they would 
     <lb/>
     have to pay 5 per cent per annum. Naturally 
     <lb/>
     he would like to get out of paying five per 
     <lb/>
    cent interest, and I think that having got 
     <lb/>out of it—that is the government having 
     <lb/>given a loan without interest—he naturally 
     <lb/>accepts the money and prepares to spend 
     <lb/>it—and it will do the territories that amount 
     <lb/>of good. I refer to this because of the 
     <lb/>way the matter was alluded to by hon. 
     <lb/>gentlemen opposite in a recent debate. 
     <lb/>They seemed to think there was an 
     <lb/>intention to take advantage of the ter<lb break="no"/>ritories in some way by compelling—or 
     <lb/>impelling—them to take a loan which they 
     <lb/>either did not want or did not require. I 
     <lb/>wish to point out that it was strictly in ac<lb break="no"/>cordance with the wishes expressed by the 
     <lb/>North-west government, that it was placing 
     <lb/>them in the same financial position exactly 
     <lb/>as if they were a provincial government, ex<lb break="no"/>cept that they were able to borrow money 
     <lb/>without paying interest, while if the terri<lb break="no"/>tories had provincial autonomy, they would 
     <lb/>have to pay interest on borrowed money. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     I repeat that what the territories want 
     <lb/>
     at the present time is adequate financial as<lb break="no"/>sistance with which to conduct their schools 
     <lb/>
     construct their public works, and generally 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
       
       
     care for the interests of government which 
     <lb/>
     have been entrusted to their care. We are 
     <lb/>
     glad of any assistance that we receive from 
     <lb/>
     hon. members of the opposition in pressing 
     <lb/>
     these interests upon the government. We 
     <lb/>
     hope that the coolness with which the op<lb break="no"/>position have viewed these matters in the 
     <lb/>
     past has given place now and for the future 
     <lb/>
     to deep interest, and that, therefore, we 
     <lb/>
     shall be able to depend upon the members 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition to aid us in impressing 
     <lb/>
     upon the government the needs of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories in their present or future 
     <lb/>
     condition. But if our hon. friends expect 
     <lb/>
     to make political capital with the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories, or with the peo<lb break="no"/>ple outside of the North-west Territories, by 
     <lb/>
     telling us they are in favour of provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy, but without providing means for 
     <lb/>
     carrying on that organization, I am afraid 
     <lb/>
     they will make a mistake. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. T. O. DAVIS</persName> (Saskatchewan). As 
     <lb/>
     the hour is late, I do not intend to take up 
     <lb/>
     much time in discussing this question. The 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition, in the long speech 
     <lb/>
     he delivered and the resolution be read, 
     <lb/>
     asked this House to vote in favour of grant<lb break="no"/>ing provincial autonomy to the territories. 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me that in doing so he should 
     <lb/>
     have put some facts before us on which we 
     <lb/>
     could vote intelligently. As far as I could 
     <lb/>
     understand his speech, he seemed simply to 
     <lb/>
     be reading statements from the letters Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain had written to the government, 
     <lb/>
     and part of the replies. As representing a 
     <lb/>
     constituency in the North-west Territories I 
     <lb/>
     have always been opposed to the proposition 
     <lb/>
     of Premier Haultain. In this connection, 
     <lb/>
     I may say that Premier Haultain in one of 
     <lb/>
     his letters said that the members here do 
     <lb/>
     not know the public opinion in the territor<lb break="no"/>ies. I say I know as much about public op<lb break="no"/>inion in the territories as Premier Haultain 
     <lb/>
     does, and I say a majority of people are op<lb break="no"/>posed to this scheme, and for good and sub<lb break="no"/>stantial reasons, as I can show. The leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition should have informed himself 
     <lb/>
     as to the revenue the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories at this stage of the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     would be entitled to draw from the federal 
     <lb/>
     treasury, and show why it would be better 
     <lb/>
     for us to have autonomy. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man quoted a great deal from this sessional 
     <lb/>
     paper, No. 116, and in one case, I notice, 
     <lb/>
     he read only half a paragraph, and left the 
     <lb/>
     other half which did not suit his purpose. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain has made certain demands up<lb break="no"/>on this country. My hon. friend from Al<lb break="no"/>berta (Mr. Oliver) has said he laid before 
     <lb/>
     the House a full statement of what he 
     <lb/>
     wants. I have taken the liberty of boiling 
     <lb/>
     down the demands, and I think I can give 
     <lb/>
     in brief just what Mr. Haultain asks this 
     <lb/>
     House to give him, if we are prepared to 
     <lb/>
     give provincial autonomy. He wants first, 
     <lb/>
     all the public lands. The leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition said he was prepared to support 
     <lb/>
     that part of the proposition. I am glad to 
     <lb/>
     see that he has approached the matter in 
     <lb/>
          
          
          
            <pb n="13897" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1903-10-13_Page_13897.jpg"/>

  that spirit. We in the west would like to<lb/>see the lands given to the government of 
     <lb/>the North-west Territories provided that 
     <lb/>government made a proper use of them, and 
     <lb/>did not undertake to shut off settlement. 
     <lb/>He wants to grant payment for all the lands 
     <lb/>that were given as bonuses to railway com<lb break="no"/>panies in years gone by. But hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite, when they were running the 
     <lb/>governmental machine, gave away a great 
     <lb/>many millions of acres of land in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, and I am sorry to say that 
     <lb/>they were not at all times given for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of subsidizing railways in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, but most of them were 
     <lb/>given to subsidize railways in the province 
     <lb/>of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCREARY</persName>. I suppose Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     would also be entitled to the same payment 
     <lb/>
     for all her lands given away ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. I fancy so. Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     asked for the payment of lands given as bo<lb break="no"/>nuses to build railways. Now, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Grey (Mr. Sproule) who is lead<lb break="no"/>ing the opposition, would probably inform us 
     <lb/>
     whether he is prepared to pay us at a reason<lb break="no"/>able rate for the 50,000,000 acres of land 
     <lb/>
     he and his friends gave away in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories to subsidize railways. 
     <lb/>
     At a reasonable price per acre, say $3, it 
     <lb/>
     would amount to something like $150,000,000. 
     <lb/>
     Well, we will accept it, we would like to get 
     <lb/>
     it, because it would put us on a good footing, 
     <lb/>
     a little better footing than the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario. Now, he goes on further, and if the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition had read that portion 
     <lb/>
     at the bottom instead of reading only one 
     <lb/>
     portion of the document, he would have 
     <lb/>
     found that Mr. Haultain wants compensation 
     <lb/>
     for all the lands that are given as homesteads 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories; in other words, 
     <lb/>
     he wants the federal government to spend 
     <lb/>
     a certain amount of money to put the people 
     <lb/>
     into the territories, and then the North-west 
     <lb/>
     government would like to be compensated 
     <lb/>
     for those lands given to those people as 
     <lb/>
     homesteads. Whether that is a reason<lb break="no"/>able demand to make, I will leave to the 
     <lb/>
     judgment of the leader of the opposition who 
     <lb/>
     seems to be quite friendly to Mr. Haultain, 
     <lb/>
     and who wants to have this thing carried 
     <lb/>
     out. Another thing which will interest my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Grey, I know—because he 
     <lb/>
     is one of the old guard and sat in this House 
     <lb/>
     when that monstrous piece of legislation 
     <lb/>
     was put through which foisted a monopoly 
     <lb/>
     on the people of the west in the way of ex<lb break="no"/>emptions from taxation on the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Pacific Railway roadbed, and all its stations 
     <lb/>
     for ever and lands for twenty years—he 
     <lb/>
     will be happy to know that Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     asks that legislation be now passed to have 
     <lb/>
     that removed, so that the people of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, in forming a pro<lb break="no"/>vince, will not labour under the disability 
     <lb/>
     of having this road exempted from taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. I do not know what it will cost the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada. I leave the leader of 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <cb/>
       
       
     the opposition to figure that out. But I 
     <lb/>
     would like to see him get the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Pacific Railway to give up the privilege 
     <lb/>
     which was given them by his friends twenty 
     <lb/>
     years ago, the privilege of exemption from 
     <lb/>
     taxation on lands for twenty years, as 
     <lb/>
     we always supposed, but as it now turns 
     <lb/>
     out to be, for forty years, exempting them 
     <lb/>
     from taxation on their roadbed, rolling 
     <lb/>
     stock and everything else for ever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCREARY</persName>. That will apply to 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba also. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. I suppose so. Now, the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition has figured out that 
     <lb/>
     the population of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     at the present time is something like 375,000. 
     <lb/>
     He goes Mr. Haultain one better. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). I did not say 
     <lb/>
     375,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. I took down his figures. He 
     <lb/>
     said there was 158,000 in round numbers. 
     <lb/>
     according to the census, and that 170 odd 
     <lb/>
     thousand appear to have gone into the terri<lb break="no"/>tories since then. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). That makes 330,<lb break="no"/>000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. Well, he has gone the Prem<lb break="no"/>ier of the North-west Territories one bet<lb break="no"/>ter. I think the hon. gentleman will agree 
     <lb/>
     that the Premier of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories is not unduly modest in his de<lb break="no"/>mands, and if he thought he was en<lb break="no"/>titled to it he would ask for it. He said 
     <lb/>
     that the population was 250,000, and he 
     <lb/>
     wants a grant of eighty cents per head to 
     <lb/>
     start with. He wants to draw eighty cents 
     <lb/>
     per head until the population reaches 1,396,<lb break="no"/>091. Now, with reference to the debt ac<lb break="no"/>count. The present population on which that 
     <lb/>
     debt account is to be based is 250,000. Now, 
     <lb/>
     he is more modest in that respect than the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). What is the 
     <lb/>
     date of that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. You took it out of your own 
     <lb/>
     return you have been reading from.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). What is the date 
     <lb/>
     to which the hon. gentleman refers '? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. I am talking about this re<lb break="no"/>turn brought down here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). I am asking the 
     <lb/>
     date of that document. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. It is in the Bill, it is 1901. 
     <lb/>
     I must say that if the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion were consulting the Premier of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories now he would be pre<lb break="no"/>pared to ask for $600,000, and I would not 
     <lb/>
     blame him at all. I am just taking what is 
     <lb/>
     in that Bill, the draft of the Bill that was 
     <lb/>
     presented to this House, and that is what 
     <lb/>
     he expects if you give him provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy. Now, we will take the figures of 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition, 330,000. He 
     <lb/>
     wants the debt account based on 330,000, 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <pb n="13899" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1903-10-13_Page_13899.jpg"/>

     and a revision every five years—which is a 
     <lb/>
     perfectly legitimate thing, and I think he 
     <lb/>
     is entitled to it. But I want to point out 
     <lb/>
     now to the leader of the opposition—I think 
     <lb/>
     it was three years ago that Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     started this agitation for provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy—I want to point out to the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition at this stage that every man, 
     <lb/>
     woman and child that goes into the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories is worth to us, on capital 
     <lb/>
     account, $33, or close to it. Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     puts it at $32.40. Now, taking the state<lb break="no"/>ment made by the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     that 170,000 people have gone in there since 
     <lb/>
     the census was taken—I think Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     started his agitation before the census was 
     <lb/>
     taken—I think the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     will see that by not having provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy we have added to our capital account 
     <lb/>
     something in the neighbourhood of between 
     <lb/>
     five and six million dollars, taking his own 
     <lb/>
     figures as to the population. Now he wants 
     <lb/>
     the census taken every five years—I do not 
     <lb/>
     know whether the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     and the gentlemen supporting him would 
     <lb/>
     agree to that. I think it would be a good 
     <lb/>
     thing, but I do not know what hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite would say to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the leader of the opposition is more 
     <lb/>
     generous than the Premier of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, who asked for ten mem<lb break="no"/>bers in this House to start with. The leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition, in addressing the House 
     <lb/>
     to-night, said that they were entitled to 
     <lb/>
     twelve. But when there was a proposition 
     <lb/>
     before this House to grant ten members to 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories, I did not see 
     <lb/>
     that the leader of the opposition exercised 
     <lb/>
     any haste in getting  to his feet and advo<lb break="no"/>cating twelve members. He was a member 
     <lb/>
     of the Redistribution Committee, and I never 
     <lb/>
     heard that he asked for twelve members. 
     <lb/>
     But to-night, at the end of the session, when 
     <lb/>
     we are getting ready to return home, and 
     <lb/>
     when the idea is abroad that possibly there 
     <lb/>
     may be an election in the near future, and 
     <lb/>
     possibly with the idea of gaining a little 
     <lb/>
     kudos out in the west on account of this 
     <lb/>
     thing, he tells us that the territories ought 
     <lb/>
     to have twelve members. Well, why did 
     <lb/>
     not the leader of the opposition take that 
     <lb/>
     stand when there was a proposition before 
     <lb/>
     this House to give them ten members ? I 
     <lb/>
     am positive that if the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion had got up and said that we ought to 
     <lb/>
     have twelve members, the government would 
     <lb/>
     have granted us twelve. But after the Bill 
     <lb/>
     has passed, after it has practically become 
     <lb/>
     law, it is rather late for the leader of the 
     <lb/>
    opposition to advocate giving us twelve 
     <lb/>members. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. BROCK</persName>. Are you speaking for the 
     <lb/>government just now ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. I am speaking for myself. 
     <lb/>
     Now, the Prime Minister of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories made the statement that we 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
        
        
     should have only one province and that the 
     <lb/>
     legislative assembly of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     should have the power to locate the capital. 
     <lb/>
     I think perhaps there might be some milk 
     <lb/>
     in that cocoanut, there must be some reason 
     <lb/>
     why the Premier of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories is so anxious to have provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy. I want to say to the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition that if he had gone out into my 
     <lb/>
     part of the country last year—and his own 
     <lb/>
     political friends up there felt sore that he did 
     <lb/>
     not go and see them—he would have found 
     <lb/>
     a fine country up there, a lot of fine people, 
     <lb/>
     and have heard from those people that 
     <lb/>
     they were not very anxious for political 
     <lb/>
     autonomy at the present time. I would 
     <lb/>
     like to call the attention of the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition to what one of the leading 
     <lb/>
     papers in Saskatchewan says about it, to 
     <lb/>
     let him see what the people up there think 
     <lb/>
     about provincial autonomy. This is the 
     <lb/>
     Alberta ' Advocate ' of October 5th—not very 
     <lb/>
     long ago. It is a Liberal paper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It is a God-send for the country in general

     has been withheld.

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That goes to show that the people in that 
     <lb/>
     part of the country are not thirsting very 
     <lb/>
     much for provincial autonomy. I would 
     <lb/>
     be very glad it the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position and the gentlemen supporting him 
     <lb/>
     in this House were prepared to grant all 
     <lb/>
     these terms, to pay for the lands that had 
     <lb/>
     been given away to railways, to pay for the 
     <lb/>
     homestead lands that have been taken and 
     <lb/>
     to give all that Mr. Haultain is asking for. 
     <lb/>
     But I do not think there is any use 
     <lb/>
     of getting up and making the statement 
     <lb/>
     that we should have provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     without going into the question and letting 
     <lb/>
     us know what the hon. gentleman is pre<lb break="no"/>pared to do. He has brought this proposi<lb break="no"/>tion before the House, and if he is in favour 
     <lb/>
     of accepting Mr. Haultain's demand in its 
     <lb/>
     entirety we would be happy to support it. 
     <lb/>
     I am sure that every member of the House 
     <lb/>
     who represents the territories would sup<lb break="no"/>port it.

     <persName ref="pers:CLAN1">Mr. CLANCY</persName>. The hon. gentleman said 
     <lb/>
     a moment ago that it was an excessive de<lb break="no"/>mand.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI10">Mr. DAVIS</persName>. No, I did not say anything of 
     <lb/>
     the kind. The hon. gentleman (Mr. Clancy) 
     <lb/>
     is just getting wakened up. I have taken 
     <lb/>
     the trouble, Mr. Speaker, to make some com<lb break="no"/>parisons and to see what, under the pro<lb break="no"/>position laid down by Mr. Haultain, we 
     <lb/>
    would be fairly entitled to if the North-west 
     <lb/>Territories were to become a province. We 
     <lb/>do not know exactly what we should get. 
     <lb/>I have a statement here, first, of what we 
     <lb/>would get if we were organized into a pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and, second, of what we do get under 
     <lb/>the present arrangement, which is as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :

            <p>
     So that, taking the statement that I have 
     <lb/>
     made, we would be entitled, if we had pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy, to receive from the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government $969,000 a year, while we 
     <lb/>
     are drawing at the present time over a mil<lb break="no"/>lion dollars, showing that we are fairly 
     <lb/>
     well-off at the present time. There was a 
     <lb/>
     time in the history of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, as my hon. friend from Alberta has 
     <lb/>
     pointed out when we were not so well-off, 
     <lb/>
     and when we did not get as much as we 
     <lb/>
     were entitled to for the purpose of building 
     <lb/>
     roads and bridges. Yet the hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition talks about what Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain did a couple of years ago, when serious 
     <lb/>
     storms swept away the bridges. Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain went around to the people and told them 
     <lb/>
     that he had no money, but that if they had 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy they could have the 
     <lb/>
     bridges rebuilt. If the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west are in a position to get $250,000, and 
     <lb/>
     $250,000 more without being called upon to 
     <lb/>
     pay interest on capital account, they are in 
     <lb/>
     a better position than if they had to pay in<lb break="no"/>terest on that money. Another advantage 
     <lb/>
     of the present position of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories is that they have not to main<lb break="no"/>tain the extravagant form of government 
     <lb/>
     which is kept up in all the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I would like to call the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House to some of the services that we would 
     <lb/>
     have to maintain ourselves if the territories 
     <lb/>
     were put upon a provincial basis that are 
     <lb/>
     now performed by the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment. There is, in the first place, the police 
     <lb/>
     force. If the North-west Territories were 
     <lb/>
     formed into a province, I suppose the hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader opposite would admit that the pro<lb break="no"/>vince would have to pay for the mainten<lb break="no"/>ance of the police force. The mounted police 
     <lb/>
     is paid for at the present time out of the 
     <lb/>
     federal treasury and it performs police duty 
     <lb/>
     in the territories. The territories would 
     <lb/>
     have to assume this expense. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     what the force costs, but I am satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     for the territories that Mr. Haultain pro<lb break="no"/>poses to bring in Assiniboia, Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, Alberta and a portion of Athabasca, 
     <lb/>
     it would not cost less than $200,000 a year. 
     <lb/>
     The registry offices are self-supporting, so 
     <lb/>
     that it is not necessary to say anything about 
     <lb/>
     them. But, in addition to the mounted po<lb break="no"/>lice, they would have to pay for the ad<lb break="no"/>
          
          
            <cb/>
       
       ministration of justice, and for the main<lb break="no"/>tenance of asylums. Any money that is 
     <lb/>
     paid out for these institutions now is paid 
     <lb/>
     by the federal government. Then, there are 
     <lb/>
     the public works that are constructed by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government, such as the build<lb break="no"/>ing of court houses, and the only way in 
     <lb/>
     which the money could be obtained for these 
     <lb/>
     works would be by borrowing it, and re<lb break="no"/>ducing our revenue every year by having 
     <lb/>
     to pay interest on that amount of money. 
     <lb/>
     We would have the increased cost of the 
     <lb/>
     provincial system of government, because 
     <lb/>
     we would have a lot of the paraphernalia 
     <lb/>
     that we do not have at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     Then, there would be more officials. If all 
     <lb/>
     these services were paid for out of the re<lb break="no"/>venue of the territories, you would find that 
     <lb/>
     the people there would have a grievance. In 
     <lb/>
     my part of the country I do not see that 
     <lb/>
     many persons are thirsting for this change. 
     <lb/>
     I think the trouble lies more with the 
     <lb/>
     politicians than with the people. If you 
     <lb/>
     give us enough money so that we can build 
     <lb/>
     our bridges and maintain our roads that is 
     <lb/>
     all we want, and we will not trouble you 
     <lb/>
     for the present. I am glad to know that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House are prepared to vote whatever we 
     <lb/>
     want from time to time, but I do not think 
     <lb/>
     the people of the North-west will trouble 
     <lb/>
     them very much about provincial autonomy, 
     <lb/>
    so long as they do that. The hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman also alluded to railway sub<lb break="no"/>sidies. The government is guaranteeing 
     <lb/>bonds to an amount of something like 
     <lb/>$20,000,000 for the construction of railways 
     <lb/>in the North-west Territories, but if Mr. 
     <lb/>Haultain had been allowed to carry out his 
     <lb/>propaganda two or three years ago, we 
     <lb/>would have been obliged to mortgage the 
     <lb/>resources of the territories for this 
     <lb/>work. Gentlemen from the province of 
     <lb/>Manitoba will tell you that they have 
     <lb/>no debt, but if hon. gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site will look at the Year-book, they  
     <lb/>will find that Manitoba has a debt of $16,<lb break="no"/>664,647, charged up against it. The people 
     <lb/>of the North-west Territories have no debt 
     <lb/>at all, because the railways are subsidized 
     <lb/>by the federal government, and if they get 
     <lb/>enough money to carry on the business of 
     <lb/>the country it is not very likely that they 
     <lb/>will be thirsting to change their system of 
     <lb/>government. I have a statement here of the 
     <lb/>subsidy per head of the different provinces 
     <lb/>in the Dominion and also of that of the 
     <lb/>North-west Territories, which is as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :

     well treated. I want to point out one feature 
     <lb/>
     of the case, and it is this : The hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition thinks that provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy is a new proposition in the territories. 
     <lb/>
     There was a meeting held in my own town 13 
     <lb/>
     years ago, and a committee was appointed 
     <lb/>
     and money collected to agitate for provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy, but that agitation soon died out. 
     <lb/>
     It is, therefore, an old scheme. Four or 
     <lb/>
     five years ago, when Mr. Haultain started 
     <lb/>
     his agitation we had a population of 100,<lb break="no"/>000 ; to-day we have a population of 330,<lb break="no"/>000, we are told, and if we are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     have $33 per head placed to our credit on 
     <lb/>
     capital account, we are $7,590,000 better 
     <lb/>
     off to-day than we would have been 
     <lb/>
     if Mr. Haultain had succeeded when he 
     <lb/>
     first commenced. It is all very well to 
     <lb/>
     say that we could get a re-arrangement, but 
     <lb/>
     I notice that the other provinces have not 
     <lb/>
     been successful in their attempt in that re<lb break="no"/>spect. When we do form a province, we 
     <lb/>
     want it formed on such terms and condi<lb break="no"/>tions that we will not have to ask for better 
     <lb/>
     terms from year to year. We see the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba loaded up with a big debt. 
     <lb/>
     We may call it a guarantee of bonds and 
     <lb/>
     say that the people will not have to pay the 
     <lb/>
     interest, but nevertheless it is a liability 
     <lb/>
     against the province which they may be 
     <lb/>
     called upon to pay. The North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories is getting all that work done by 
     <lb/>
     the federal government, and I think they 
     <lb/>
     are better off as they are to-day. The 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition told us that he 
     <lb/>
     considered the question of the number of 
     <lb/>
     provinces into which we are to be divided 
     <lb/>
     as a secondary consideration. If he went 
     <lb/>
     to my district he would find out what a mis<lb break="no"/>take he makes in that. The southern belt 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories has had the 
     <lb/>
     advantages of a transcontinental railway 
     <lb/>
     for 22 years, but the northern belt has been 
     <lb/>
     without railways until the last few years. 
     <lb/>
     There were a couple of railways there, but 
     <lb/>
     they might as well have been built to the 
     <lb/>
     moon, for they were of no use whatever to 
     <lb/>
     colonization. It is only now that the north<lb break="no"/>ern portion of the district is getting immi<lb break="no"/>gration, and as a member of the district I 
     <lb/>
     will say that the people there are not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to go in with the people of the south<lb break="no"/>ern portion to form one province. We 
     <lb/>
     think there should be two provinces, and if 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend (Mr. Borden, Halifax) were 
     <lb/>
     leading the government he would not coerce 
     <lb/>
     us unless he wanted to have another rebel<lb break="no"/>lion on his hands like that which the Con<lb break="no"/>servatives fomented in 1885. All that has 
     <lb/>
     to be taken into consideration. If the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. Borden, Halifax) goes to Cal<lb break="no"/>gary, which is the centre of this agitation, 
     <lb/>
     he will find that the people there want three 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and some of them want four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. If he told the people of Calgary 
     <lb/>
     that he wanted one province, the first ques<lb break="no"/>tion they would put to him was : Would 
     <lb/>
     he have the capital in Calgary, and if he 
     <lb/>
     proposed to leave it to the Legislative assem<lb break="no"/>
        
        
   
   
            <cb/>
      
      
     bly to decide, as Mr. Haultain proposes, 
     <lb/>
     they would tell him that they would prefer 
     <lb/>
     waiting until something else turned up. The 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition has perhaps ap<lb break="no"/>proached this subject in a fair spirit, and I 
     <lb/>
     am glad to know that he is prepared to lend 
     <lb/>
     his assistance at all times, and to sym<lb break="no"/>pathize with us. We would be much better 
     <lb/>
     satisfied if he would tell us that he is pre<lb break="no"/>pared to sympathize with us to the extent 
     <lb/>
     of demands made by Premier Haultain. 
     <lb/>
     They are modest demands in a way, and the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west would be glad to 
     <lb/>
     know that my hon. friend (Mr. Borden) en<lb break="no"/>dorses them. If the hon. gentleman only gets 
     <lb/>
     up and states that it is a good thing to have 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy he might as well say 
     <lb/>
     that it would be a good thing if the sun 
     <lb/>
     would shine to-morrow, or that it would 
     <lb/>
     rain next summer, but the people of the ter<lb break="no"/>ritories want something more definite than 
     <lb/>
     that. They have been educated by—I was 
     <lb/>
     going to say my friend Mr. Haultain—they 
     <lb/>
     have been educated by the friend of the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition up to considering 
     <lb/>
     that they were entitled to the conditions 
     <lb/>
     laid down in his proposition, and the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition will find it hard to satisfy 
     <lb/>
     public opinion without going as far as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain proposes. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Borden) stated that in 1902 Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain swept the country for provincial auto<lb break="no"/>nomy. Everybody knows that Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain adopted the tactics of the wily politi<lb break="no"/>cian, and that he took a snap verdict. I 
     <lb/>
     fancy that if sufficient time were given to 
     <lb/>
     have threshed out the question of political 
     <lb/>
     autonomy and other questions, Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain would not have a majority at all. But, 
     <lb/>
     when the people were putting their crops 
     <lb/>
     in, and could not get to the polls, he brought 
     <lb/>
     on the elections and got a snap verdict, and 
     <lb/>
     he claims it as a verdict in favour of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy. I want to say that the 
     <lb/>
     people took no stock at all in that question. 
     <lb/>
     The leader of the opposition might as well 
     <lb/>
     say that when Mr. Roblin was returned to 
     <lb/>
     power the people of Manitoba pronounced in 
     <lb/>
     favour of a high tariff, because Mr. Roblin 
     <lb/>
     mentioned it on the platform. Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain is in the same position. The people 
     <lb/>
     did not take any stock in the question of 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy, because they knew it 
     <lb/>
     had to come from Ottawa and not from him, 
     <lb/>
     and as a matter of fact Mr. Haultain got 
     <lb/>
     several in my district. I supported him 
     <lb/>
     myself, and I helped him to the best of my 
     <lb/>
     ability to carry some seats, and 1 never con<lb break="no"/>sidered the question of provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     at all. I want to say as one of the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives from that country, that the people 
     <lb/>
     whom I represent are opposed to provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy at present. I think we are well off 
     <lb/>
     as we are. We have been treated very 
     <lb/>
     generously, and with the help of the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition, we will be treated more 
     <lb/>
     generously in the future in getting suffi<lb break="no"/>cient subsidies to run the affairs of the coun<lb break="no"/>try without going into debt, and without

     putting taxation on the people. There is 
     <lb/>
     no part of Canada where a taxation is light<lb break="no"/>er at present than in the territories. I have 
     <lb/>
     had some intimation that Mr. Haultain in<lb break="no"/>tended to introduce the municipal system. 
     <lb/>
     If he does, he will grant the municipalities 
     <lb/>
     power to borrow money, because, although 
     <lb/>
     he cannot borrow money himself he has 
     <lb/>
     power to give the municipalities authority to 
     <lb/>
     borrow. I understand he intends to submit a 
     <lb/>
     Bill of that kind. I do not know how true 
     <lb/>
     it is, or how it will be received by the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, but I believe that taking everything into 
     <lb/>
     consideration, we are doing very well as we 
     <lb/>
     are and we had better adopt the old say<lb break="no"/>ing: Let well enough alone. I believe the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories are of 
     <lb/>
     that opinion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. W. J. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). I have 
     <lb/>
     listened to some curiosities in the way of 
     <lb/>
     speech-making in this House during the past 
     <lb/>
     seven years, but the member for Alberta 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Oliver) has surpassed even himself to<lb break="no"/>night in the matter of exhibiting curiosities 
     <lb/>
     in the speech-making line. I sympathize 
     <lb/>
     with him, because his position must be very 
     <lb/>
     embarrassing in having to make a speech 
     <lb/>
     for autonomy and against autonomy. He is 
     <lb/>
     in favour of the details being settled imme<lb break="no"/>diately and he is against the details being 
     <lb/>
     settled unless they are settled in advance, 
     <lb/>
     not by the leader of the government, but 
     <lb/>
     by the leader of the opposition, forsooth. 
     <lb/>
     He is for an increased subsidy, but he is 
     <lb/>
     against the motion of the leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition, which asks that this question shall 
     <lb/>
     be taken up at once, and the details refer<lb break="no"/>red to the representatives of the people be<lb break="no"/>fore autonomy is granted and before it is 
     <lb/>
     accepted by them. The hon. gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, finds himself in a most embar<lb break="no"/>rassing position, and he feels at heart that 
     <lb/>
     he is speaking against the sentiment of the 
     <lb/>
     people he represents when he, in a faint<lb break="no"/>hearted manner, I admit, opposes autonomy. 
     <lb/>
     He told us that he would be in favour of 
     <lb/>
     autonomy if autonomy were granted on the 
     <lb/>
     terms asked by Premier Haultain in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill as submitted, but that without that, 
     <lb/>
     he would not be in favour of it. Surely 
     <lb/>
     he has read some speeches made by Pre<lb break="no"/>mier Haultain since that Bill was submitted 
     <lb/>
     to parliament by the government, in which 
     <lb/>
     he stated that while he asked only what he 
     <lb/>
     considered was right and what the territo<lb break="no"/>ries were entitled to, still he would not re<lb break="no"/>fuse to discuss the question and to accept 
     <lb/>
     terms less favourable for the sake of getting 
     <lb/>
     territorial autonomy for his people. He 
     <lb/>
     does not state in so many words, hard and 
     <lb/>
     fast, that unless he can get territorial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy on those terms he is not willing 
     <lb/>
     to accept it on any other terms. He says : 
     <lb/>
     This is what we are entitled to, these terms 
     <lb/>
     should be complied with; but, as he has 
     <lb/>
     stated in public speeches delivered since 
     <lb/>
     that time, he is willing to enter into a con<lb break="no"/>ference with this government and make the 
     <lb/>
     best terms possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     The hon. gentleman has directed his re<lb break="no"/>marks largely to the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion. I can understand his position as a 
     <lb/>
     subservient supporter of the present govern<lb break="no"/>ment. He knows that the government are 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the granting of autonomy, and 
     <lb/>
     he did not wish to place them in an em<lb break="no"/>barrassing position. He rather fears that his 
     <lb/>
     own supporters may rally to the support of 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition, because he has 
     <lb/>
     struck a responsive chord in the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories ; and instead of directing his re<lb break="no"/>marks to the government of which he is so 
     <lb/>
     strong a supporter, he has directed them 
     <lb/>
     wholly to the leader of the opposition, as if 
     <lb/>
     it were his part to offer a policy on this 
     <lb/>
     question. He says that this is an old ques<lb break="no"/>tion, that it is not just of this year's growth, 
     <lb/>
     that it was discussed in years gone by when 
     <lb/>
     he occupied a seat in the territorial assembly. 
     <lb/>
     Yes, and he forgot to tell this House that 
     <lb/>
     when he occupied that seat, he himself 
     <lb/>
     favoured local autonomy ; but to-day he op<lb break="no"/>poses it. The hon. gentleman rather blamed 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition because this 
     <lb/>
     question was not brought up earlier. But 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition has brought this 
     <lb/>
     question up, not only this session, in an early 
     <lb/>
     part of the session, but last year, when he 
     <lb/>
     urged immediate action on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     government of the day. So I think the <choice><sic>re<lb break="no"/>refence</sic><corr>reference</corr></choice> of the hon. member for Alberta to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. leader of the opposition was ill- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     timed and not at all deserved. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. gentleman says it is money they 
     <lb/>
     want, and not talk. It is sometimes neces<lb break="no"/>sary to have a good deal of talk to this 
     <lb/>
     government to get a little money for a cer<lb break="no"/>tain portion of the country ; but that is 
     <lb/>
     not the case when they  propose to vote 
     <lb/>
     $125,000,000 for a railway between Winni<lb break="no"/>peg and Moncton, which is of little use for 
     <lb/>
     relieving the congestion of the west ; and, 
     <lb/>
     by the way, our North-west lands are de<lb break="no"/>signed by the Minister of the Interior to 
     <lb/>
     pay for that railway. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. MCCREARY</persName>. No.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). No other im<lb break="no"/>pression was possible from the statement 
     <lb/>
     of the Minister of the Interior in this House, 
     <lb/>
     that he was going to bring in a Bill to get 
     <lb/>
     authority to dispose of 50,000,000 acres of 
     <lb/>
     land which he stated had been liberated to 
     <lb/>
     the Crown, and which by the construction 
     <lb/>
     of this railway would be made very much 
     <lb/>
     more valuable and would realize a better 
     <lb/>
     price. The Toronto 'Globe' took up the 
     <lb/>
     statement and said in so many words that 
     <lb/>
     this was the intention of the government ; 
     <lb/>
     and it was only lately, since public opinion 
     <lb/>
     was aroused, that an inspired article appear<lb break="no"/>ed in the Regina 'Leader,' edited by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Western Assinibioa (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Scott), stating that there had been a mis<lb break="no"/>apprehension on that point, that such was 
     <lb/>
     not the intention of the government, and 
     <lb/>
     that they would not introduce legislation on 
     <lb/>
     this question this session, though he would

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">13908</fw>
       
       
     not vouch for the future. The granting of 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy has been the subject 
     <lb/>
     of debate, not only this session, but last 
     <lb/>
     session. The hon. Minister of Finance, in 
     <lb/>
     some remarks he made, left the impression 
     <lb/>
     on this House that in the very near future, 
     <lb/>
     possibly within the next year, local self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     government will be afforded to the people 
     <lb/>
     of that portion of Canada. Unfortunately, 
     <lb/>
     however, the gentleman who is supposed to 
     <lb/>
     mould the policy of the government, the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, threw cold water on this 
     <lb/>
     assertion, and left the House in no doubt 
     <lb/>
     whatever as to his proposition on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion. He stated distinctly, in almost so 
     <lb/>
     many words, that so long as this govern<lb break="no"/>ment were in power, the people of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories need not expect local autonomy for 
     <lb/>
    many years to come ; and the Minister of 
     <lb/>the Interior took the same ground last year, 
     <lb/>pointing out that it would not be right to 
     <lb/>grant autonomy to the North-west Territor<lb break="no"/>ies until 600,000 or 700,000 people were in 
     <lb/>that country. Therefore I cannot under<lb break="no"/>stand the hon. member for Western Assini<lb break="no"/>boia when he states to-night that the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior has as much as pro<lb break="no"/>mised that within the next year we would 
     <lb/>have autonomy, whereas the Minister of the  
     <lb/>Interior, not only in public documents, but 
     <lb/>in speeches delivered in this House last ses<lb break="no"/>sion, stated the direct opposite.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Let me remind the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman that the Minister of Finance made 
     <lb/>
     a statement practically to that effect in this 
     <lb/>
     House this session.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). And what did 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister say immediately after<lb break="no"/>wards, when I placed his views before the 
     <lb/>
     House ? I stated that I was putting the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister's sentiments correctly before 
     <lb/>
     the House to the effect that for many years 
     <lb/>
     to come the territories need not expect au<lb break="no"/>tonomy at the hands of this government, 
     <lb/>
     and the Prime Minister said 'hear, hear.'

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">The PRIME MINISTER</persName>. If I said ' hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear,' it was not affirmation. On the con<lb break="no"/>trary, it was negation.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). But the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's speech bone out my con<lb break="no"/>tention.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). If I am allow<lb break="no"/>ed to refer to a past debate, I will do it with 
     <lb/>
     pleasure, as I have ' Hansard ' under my 
     <lb/>
     hand. He pointed out that it was not an 
     <lb/>
     unmixed evil to prevent the people of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west having power to mortgage their 
     <lb/>
     patrimony, to borrow money on their pro<lb break="no"/>perty; and his whole argument was direct<lb break="no"/>ed against granting autonomy for many 
     <lb/>
     years to come. I regret that on this most 
     <lb/>
     important question, for the welfare of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the west, there should be a diver<lb break="no"/>sity of opinion amongst the representatives 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
          
     of the west who are supporters of this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I think I am not misrepresenting 
     <lb/>
     these hon. gentlemen when I state that 
     <lb/>
     they are not a unit on this question, unless 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Western Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     has changed his mind remarkably since last

            <p>
     I think the right hon. gentleman will see 
     <lb/>
     that I was perfectly correct in my state<lb break="no"/>ment. The hon. member for Eastern Assini<lb break="no"/>boia (Mr. Douglas), who is not in his place 
     <lb/>
    to-night took the ground that it would be 
     <lb/>wiser to defer the granting of autonomy to 
     <lb/>the territories for many years, as he be<lb break="no"/>lieved that they were much better off in 
     <lb/>their present condition. He stated that in 
     <lb/>his own opinion the majority of the men in 
     <lb/>his riding were opposed to local autonomy, 
     <lb/>whereas his colleague, the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Western Assiniboia, took the contrary view. 
     <lb/>He stated distinctly that even with an in<lb break="no"/>creased subsidy—and I commend that re<lb break="no"/>mark to the hon. member for Alberta—the 
     <lb/> people of the territories would not be satis<lb break="no"/>fied with anything short of local autonomy. 
     <lb/>This was the view of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Western Assiniboia last session, although I 
     <lb/>will admit that he was rather faint-hearted, 
     <lb/>lest he might embarrass the government of 
     <lb/>which he is a supporter. On the other hand, 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Alberta (Mr. Oliver) 
     <lb/>was rather more canny last session than 
     <lb/>this, and did not commit himself so much 
     <lb/>against autonomy ; but still he stated that 
     <lb/>the great majority of the people were op<lb break="no"/>posed to it, and he himself thought it would 
     <lb/>be better not to have it until there was a 
     <lb/>larger population in that country, and they 
     <lb/>would draw a larger per capita allowance ; 
     <lb/>whereas the hon. member for Saskatchewan 
     <lb/>(Mr. Davis) has both in this House and out 
     <lb/>of it taken such strong grounds that he has 
     <lb/>been taken to task not only by the press of 
     <lb/>western Canada, but by the independent 
     <lb/>press of eastern Canada for his opposition 
     <lb/>to provincial autonomy. So here we have 
     <lb/>a House divided against itself on this most 
     <lb/>important question, on which unanimity is 
     <lb/>required, at least on the part of the sup<lb break="no"/>porters of the government. It is not sur<lb break="no"/>prising, that the government should deny 
     <lb/>the people local autonomy when we have 
     <lb/>this diversity of opinion expressed in this 
     <lb/>House by their own supporters. The hon. 
     <lb/>member for Alberta, when speaking on this 
     <lb/>

     question on one occasion before, stated that 
     <lb/>
     the overwhelming sentiment—I believe these 
     <lb/>
     were his words—of the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west was in his opinion opposed to the grant<lb break="no"/>ing of provincial autonomy. Now, I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe he gauged public opinion on that

     question when he made use of that expres<lb break="no"/>sion.

     who would not be. But does the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman mean to say that Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     would not accept provincial autonomy at 
     <lb/>

     Haultain would do ; I simply take his terms 
     <lb/>
     and say that they are acceptable to me. 
     <lb/>
     When discussing this he simply stated that 
     <lb/>
     he would be in favour of provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy only on the basis of more population.

     the impression, in fact he explicitely stated, 
     <lb/>
     that it would be better to wait until there 
     <lb/>
     was a larger population, so that they could

         minent citizens in that part of Canada,

     <lb/>
     newspaper comments independent of politics, 
     <lb/>
     and from the representatives in the territori<lb break="no"/>al assembly, I had formed an opinion quite 
     <lb/>
     contrary to that formed by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Alberta (Mr. Oliver). That there 
     <lb/>
     may not be a perfect unanimity of opinion 
     <lb/>
     I grant you, but as the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott), in his terse 
     <lb/>
     language last session, said, if the govern<lb break="no"/>ment wait for that they will wait for 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom come, and certainly they will do 
     <lb/>
     so upon this or on any other great public 
     <lb/>
     question ; there will always be a certain 
     <lb/>
     divergence of public opinion, but if the 
     <lb/>
     expressions of the territorial representative 
     <lb/>
     are any gauge of public opinion on that 
     <lb/>
     question, it is overwhelmingly in favour of 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy at the earliest possible

     the amendment of the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion you will see upon what terms. That

     is exactly what they are asking a con<lb break="no"/>ference to fix terms and I do not see how

     the hon. gentleman can consistently with

     his duty—although I do not want to lecture

     reasonable and moderate. There may be a

     difference of opinion in regard to the number 
     <lb/>
     of provinces which should be created ; I 
     <lb/>
     admit that, but that is a question that must 
     <lb/>
     be faced sooner or later. It will have to 
     <lb/>
     be faced five or ten years from now just in 
     <lb/>
     the same way as it will to-day, and at the 
     <lb/>
     most it is a question of detail which the 
     <lb/>
     people of the territories themselves, if you 
     <lb/>
     give them an opportunity, will be only too 
     <lb/>
     glad to decide for you. In the speech frdm 
     <lb/>
     the Throne in the local assembly, at the 
     <lb/>
     last session of the territorial assembly, it 
     <lb/>
     was distinctly declared that it was a nation<lb break="no"/>al necessity to have more power, more re<lb break="no"/>venue and provincial institutions, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain, in his opening address on that 
     <lb/>
     speech, stated that the territorial govern<lb break="no"/>ment had resorted to almost everything short 
     <lb/>
     of force to gain their rights from the pre<lb break="no"/>sent government, and had failed. That is 
     <lb/>
     strong language to emanate from the pre<lb break="no"/>mier of the territories, but it only goes to 
     <lb/>
     show the friction and the irritation that is 
     <lb/>
     caused by the treatment accorded these peo<lb break="no"/>ple by the government of the day. Mr.

     Manitoba, which lies alongside the ter<lb break="no"/>ritories on the eastern side, has been

     the great benefit of its inhabitants for 
     <lb/>
     a great many years. This autonomy

     was granted the province of Manitoba at a

     time when the population was about 17,000. 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia also enjoys that advantage

     with a much less population than the ter<lb break="no"/>ritories have at the present day. The ter<lb break="no"/>ritories of the present-day have a con<lb break="no"/>siderably larger population than Prince

     The House is surely aware that this con<lb break="no"/>dition of affairs cannot exist much longer. 
     <lb/>
     It is causing a great deal of trouble and a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of unrest amongst the newcomers 
     <lb/>
     who are entering that country, and sooner 
     <lb/>
     or later he will find that unless this ques<lb break="no"/>tion is dealt with the government will be 
     <lb/>
     piling up for themselves a heap of trouble. 
     <lb/>
     The longer they put off dealing with it the 
     <lb/>
     greater the difficulties will be. People are 
     <lb/>
     flocking into that country year after year, 
     <lb/>
     settlement is becoming more compact, new 
     <lb/>
     school districts must be organized and new 
     <lb/>
     schools provided in order to meet the wants 
     <lb/>
     of the rising generation. All of this will 
     <lb/>
     cause great demands on the territorial ex<lb break="no"/>chequer, and the territorial government has 
     <lb/>
     not means of recouping itself except a small 
     <lb/>
     tax on land ; it has come here to this 
     <lb/>
     parliament, asking for the amount that 
     <lb/>
     may be doled out to it, large or small. It 
     <lb/>
     galls the people there to feel that they are 
     <lb/>
     dependent on this parliament, and makes 
     <lb/>
     them feel that they are being kept in lead<lb break="no"/>ing strings. Two years ago, and I believe, 
     <lb/>
     again a year ago, that country was visited 
     <lb/>
     by very severe floods which swept away, 
     <lb/>
     according to the correspondence laid on the 
     <lb/>
     Table, upwards of 140 bridges : and because 
     <lb/>
     the government of the territories had to an<lb break="no"/>ticipate for a few months the revenues which 
     <lb/>
     they would receive, the hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior, when bringing down a sup<lb break="no"/>
   
   
            <cb/>
        
        
     plementary of $100,000 to meet this con<lb break="no"/>tingency, said in an apologetic manner that 
     <lb/>
     the government of the territories had an<lb break="no"/>ticipated their revenue, and had rushed into 
     <lb/>
     this expenditure six months in advance, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps unwisely, as he put it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What else cowld the territorial govern<lb break="no"/>ment do ? Here were new people coming 
     <lb/>
     into that country, and here were the rivers 
     <lb/>
     from which the bridges had been washed 
     <lb/>
     away. The people must reach their mar<lb break="no"/>kets, they must have the bridges. The gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had not the money to provide the 
     <lb/>
     bridges, and sooner than cause dissatisfac<lb break="no"/>tion, and even distress, among the people, 
     <lb/>
     they anticipated their revenue. And the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior thought fit to refer 
     <lb/>
     to this as 'perhaps being an unwise ex<lb break="no"/>penditure.' In my opinion, the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories are as capable 
     <lb/>
     of managing their own affairs as those of 
     <lb/>
     any other portion of Canada, notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing the distrust that the present govern<lb break="no"/>ment seems to have of them. And why 
     <lb/>
     should they not be as capable as others ? 
     <lb/>
     Whence come these people ? Many of them 
     <lb/>
     come from south of the American boundary 
     <lb/>
     line, as has been pointed out. These are 
     <lb/>
     people accustomed to representative insti<lb break="no"/>tutions, and they look for them in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and will not be satisfied without them. 
     <lb/>
     Many were residents of eastern Canada, 
     <lb/>
     who enjoyed local autonomy in the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces from which they came ; and they 
     <lb/>
     will look for the same autonomy on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the community among whom they 
     <lb/>
     have settled, and will not be satisfied with<lb break="no"/>out it. We all know that the best immi<lb break="no"/>gration agent is the contented settler. And, 
     <lb/>
     unless we make these people feel that they 
     <lb/>
     are not dependent upon others, unless they 
     <lb/>
     are free to elect representatives to manage 
     <lb/>
     their affairs who will be directly responsible 
     <lb/>
     to them, I think you will find considerable 
     <lb/>
     irritation arising in the future. We have 
     <lb/>
     heard in the past eulogies heaped upon the 
     <lb/>
     succession of governments headed by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain. And properly so. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     the management of territorial affairs under 
     <lb/>
     his direction has been wise and judicious; 
     <lb/>
     otherwise he would not have received the 
     <lb/>
     public endorsation on numerous occasions as 
     <lb/>
     he has done. And when he and his associ<lb break="no"/>ates show such capacity, what is there to 
     <lb/>
     lead us to suppose that they would not show 
     <lb/>
     as great capacity if the territories were 
     <lb/>
     granted the powers of autonomy that they 
     <lb/>
     have been claiming ? Why, what was the 
     <lb/>
     course followed .in making up the present 
     <lb/>
     cabinet ? The Prime Minister did not con<lb break="no"/>fine himself in his choice of colleagues to 
     <lb/>
     men who had stood behind him in opposi<lb break="no"/>tion for eighteen years. He went far out<lb break="no"/>side the ranks of members of this House. 
     <lb/>
     He went to the provinces to secure the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial premiers to make up his cabinet. 
     <lb/>
     He took one premier from Nova Scotia, he 
     <lb/>
     took one from New Brunswick, he went to 
     <lb/>
     Ontario for another, and he went to Mani<lb break="no"/>

     toba for their attorney general. Here were 
     <lb/>
     four of these gentlemen taken from pro<lb break="no"/>vincial governments. And what surprises 
     <lb/>
     me is that, now that these provincial cabi<lb break="no"/>net ministers are elevated to positions of 
     <lb/>
     ministers in the Dominion cabinet, in their 
     <lb/>
     egotism they say : We are the heaven-born 
     <lb/>
     legislators, and those who do not happen to 
     <lb/>
     have been taken, but were left outside, are 
     <lb/>
     not to be trusted with the management 
     <lb/>
     even of their own local affairs. It all de<lb break="no"/>pends upon the terms, as the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Alberta (Mr. Oliver) states, whether 
     <lb/>
     local autonomy will be accepted or not. 
     <lb/>
     This parliament can well afford to deal, not 
     <lb/>
     only justly, but liberally with the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west ; and, in doing so, as I say, 
     <lb/>
     they will take the very best step to encour<lb break="no"/>age immigration to go into that country. 
     <lb/>
     We are to-day spending upwards of half a 
     <lb/>
     million dollars a year for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     bringing in immigrants. I think it is the 
     <lb/>
     duty of parliament rather to try to provide 
     <lb/>
     for the protection of the settlers we have 
     <lb/>
     and make them contented with their lot than 
     <lb/>
     to favour an enormous expenditure in order 
     <lb/>
     to import people, some of whom may not be 
     <lb/>
     so desirable as we would wish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the return brought down, we have re<lb break="no"/>solutions from the North-west in favour of 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan (Mr. Davis) read from a cer<lb break="no"/>tain paper, I think from his own town, a 
     <lb/>
     few lines to show that the people were not 
     <lb/>
     in favour of local autonomy. There is no 
     <lb/>
     great expression of opinion there in favour 
     <lb/>
     of autonomy, according to the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man. But, in looking over the return that 
     <lb/>
     has been brought down. I find that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman himself, in a letter dated April 
     <lb/>
     14th, 1903, sent to the Prime Minister a 
     <lb/>
     resolution passed by the board of trade of 
     <lb/>
     his own town. The resolution reads as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :

            <cb/>
        
        
     political parties, I presume, as in other 
     <lb/>
     places ; and they, through their representa<lb break="no"/>tives, send a request for the grant to the 
     <lb/>
     North-west of provincial institutions. And 
     <lb/>
     yet the hon. gentleman (Mr. Davis), on the 
     <lb/>
     strength of a few words that he reads in a 
     <lb/>
     newspaper, and entirely ignoring the board 
     <lb/>
     of trade, says that there is no public opinion 
     <lb/>
     in favour of autonomy. There were other 
     <lb/>
     resolutions presented from other places in 
     <lb/>
     the territories, as, for instance, Calgary, 
     <lb/>
     Lethbridge, Glenfel and others, resolutions, 
     <lb/>
     not only from boards of trade, but from city 
     <lb/>
     councils and town councils. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member (Mr. Davis) states that 
     <lb/>
     this is a political move. He says that the 
     <lb/>
     last election was not won on the question 
     <lb/>
     of provincial autonomy at all. The result, 
     <lb/>
     he says, was a snap verdict. Yet he takes 
     <lb/>
     credit to himself for having helped to ob<lb break="no"/>tain that snap verdict, because he says his 
     <lb/>
     influence was brought into requisition to 
     <lb/>
     carry three or four constituencies for the 
     <lb/>
     territorial government. There is a gentle<lb break="no"/>man in that territorial government, Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Public Works, I believe, Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bulyea, who is a Liberal. That hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man was in the city of Winnipeg last Octo<lb break="no"/>ber, and while there he was interviewed by 
     <lb/>
     a representative of the press. And here are 
     <lb/>
     the opinions that are attributed to him :

     Winnipeg, October 5.—Hon. G. H. V. Bulyea, 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner of Public Works in the territorial 
     <lb/>
     government has been in Winnipeg, and While 
     <lb/>
     here talked with your correspondent on the 
     <lb/>
     question of territorial autonomy. Mr. Bulyea 
     <lb/>
     seemed to think that the matter was a simple 
     <lb/>
     one. The last territorial elections were fought 
     <lb/>
     out on the question of attaining provincial 
     <lb/>
     powers, and for one province in the area covered 
     <lb/>
     by the present territory. The result was un<lb break="no"/>mistakable, thirty out of the thirty-five mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the assembly being returned on the

     territorial autonomy platform.

            <p>
     Here is this member of the territorial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, this Liberal and supporter of the 
     <lb/>
     government at Ottawa, who has, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     urged this government, even on grounds of 
     <lb/>
     political expediency, to grant provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy to the territories. Surely the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Saskatchewan cannot repudiate 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain's Liberal colleague. Without 
     <lb/>
     wearying the House, I simply state my 
     <lb/>
     opinion that it should be the desire, not only 
     <lb/>
     of those from western Canada, but those 
     <lb/>
     from eastern Canada as well, to have this 
     <lb/>
     question disposed of once for all, and in a 
     <lb/>
     manner satisfactory to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west. And that desire can be expressed 
     <lb/>
     by voting for the amendment of the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition, which calls for immediate 
     <lb/>
     action to add to the powers of the terri<lb break="no"/>torial legislature, and to have terms decided 
     <lb/>
     upon which must be referred to the terri<lb break="no"/>tories to see if they are satisfactory before 
     <lb/>
     they are agreed upon.

     <lb/>
     It is to me, as it was to my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Alberta (Mr. Oliver) a matter of regret that 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition did not raise 
     <lb/>
          
          
            <pb n="13915" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1903-10-13_Page_13915.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">13916</fw>
       
       
     this very important question at an earlier 
     <lb/>
     stage in the session. He makes the excuse 
     <lb/>
     that the printed return was not brought 
     <lb/>
     down until the end of July, but if my re<lb break="no"/>collection serves me, he informed the House 
     <lb/>
     that the printed return had been received 
     <lb/>
     by him from the legislative assembly at 
     <lb/>
     Regina at a much earlier date in the session. 
     <lb/>
     It is regrettable that this important discus<lb break="no"/>sion should have been delayed until this 
     <lb/>
     late stage of the session, when, for about 
     <lb/>
     three months, from the beginning of May to 
     <lb/>
     the end of July, this House was simply 
     <lb/>
     marking time. However, I am gratified to 
     <lb/>
     hear the expressions from the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition and from my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Marquette (Mr. Roche) following so closely 
     <lb/>
     the expressions which I gave voice here 
     <lb/>
     two years ago at the first opportunity I had, 
     <lb/>
     and again last year. I think, however, 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories would have more confidence in our 
     <lb/>
     hon. friends opposite if their anxiety and 
     <lb/>
     keenness were not made so open to suspicion. 
     <lb/>
     It is plain that the opposition is best pleased 
     <lb/>
     when the welfare of the North-west appears 
     <lb/>
     to be threatened. Why the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Marquette a few moments ago endeavoured 
     <lb/>
     to throw doubt upon a denial that was made 
     <lb/>
     here less than a month ago by the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance with regard to the policy of 
     <lb/>
     this government, when that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     was represented as holding out a threat that 
     <lb/>
     the North-west lands were to be sold and 
     <lb/>
     that this government was to continue the 
     <lb/>
     insane and iniquitous policy pursued by 
     <lb/>
     previous governments, and that they were 
     <lb/>
     going to continue to dispose of the North<lb break="no"/>west lands for federal purposes. The Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance a couple of weeks ago 
     <lb/>
     stated distinctly that no such policy was 
     <lb/>
     contemplated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CLAN1">Mr. CLANCY</persName>. The hon. gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     quite wrong. The Finance Minister made 
     <lb/>
     no such statement in this House, and I say 
     <lb/>
     that in the presence of the Finance Minister 
     <lb/>
     himself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. The Finance Minister can 
     <lb/>
     speak for himself. I listened to what he 
     <lb/>
     said, and I understood him to say that no 
     <lb/>
     such policy was contemplated and no such 
     <lb/>
     legislation was going to be brought down. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Marquette seems to 
     <lb/>
     be anxious to believe that the opposite is the 
     <lb/>
     case and anxious to believe that autonomy 
     <lb/>
     is to be long withheld, for less than 
     <lb/>
     fifteen minutes ago he quoted an expression 
     <lb/>
     of the Prime Minister made a couple of 
     <lb/>
     weeks ago, and tried to give it a distorted 
     <lb/>
     meaning as if the Prime Minister had said 
     <lb/>
     that provincial autonomy would not be 
     <lb/>
     granted for many years to come. The 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister states to-night that he did 
     <lb/>
     not mean that the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories were to be left for years with<lb break="no"/>out provincial autonomy, but the member 
     <lb/>
     for Marquette is keen to believe the 
     <lb/>
     opposite. So, I think hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
         
         
     opposite are evincing that kind of anxiety 
     <lb/>
     which will lead the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories to doubt whether they are really 
     <lb/>
     interested in their welfare. Further, I have 
     <lb/>
     to say that, in my opinion, it is very re<lb break="no"/>grettable that this question of so much con<lb break="no"/>cern to the territories, this question of our 
     <lb/>
     local government, should be made a party is<lb break="no"/>sue. Until this year it was kept free from 
     <lb/>
     this position. A few months ago in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Terrritories an attempt was 
     <lb/>
    made, to drag this question of provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy down to the plane of 
     <lb/>party politics. I regret that the leader 
     <lb/>of the oppositon, the leader of the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party in this country, has shown 
     <lb/>to-night a willingness to aid in the attempt 
     <lb/>to make this a party question, moving his 
     <lb/>amendment on a motion to go into Supply 
     <lb/>and so making the question one of want of 
     <lb/>confidence in the government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). It is merely a 
     <lb/>
     motion asking the government to comply 
     <lb/>
     with the demand of the legislature of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, and is no more a 
     <lb/>
     motion of want of confidence, unless the 
     <lb/>
     government desire to make it so, than was 
     <lb/>
     the motion of the hon. member for Hants 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Russell) two or three years ago in re<lb break="no"/>gard to preferential trade, and which was 
     <lb/>
     moved in exactly the same way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. If we take the words of the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition and the words of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Marquette and couple 
     <lb/>
     them with other words which have been 
     <lb/>
     used within the last few months, I think 
     <lb/>
     we are bound to believe that an attempt is 
     <lb/>
     being made, with the assistance of the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the Conservative party of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     to make the granting of provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     for the territories a party question. If my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friends are willing to take that re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility, then it becomes the duty of 
     <lb/>
     the citizens of the North-west to view the 
     <lb/>
     question from that standpoint, and 1 pro<lb break="no"/>pose, even though the session is late and 
     <lb/>
     the hour is late, to spend a few minutes in 
     <lb/>
     looking at this question from the point of 
     <lb/>
     view of its treatment by the two great par<lb break="no"/>ties in this country. As my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Alberta truly said, this is chiefly a financial 
     <lb/>
     question. If the North-west Assembly is 
     <lb/>
     put in a position financially to carry out its 
     <lb/>
     duties, then there is no complaint to be made 
     <lb/>
     on behalf of the people of that country, and 
     <lb/>
     very little complaint would be made by the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of that country. Speech after 
     <lb/>
     speech made by Mr. Haultain could be 
     <lb/>
     quoted to that effect. Therefore, if we are 
     <lb/>
     able to show that in this present year the 
     <lb/>
     financial needs of the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories are being met we will go far to show 
     <lb/>
     that the urgency for provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     is removed for the time being. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) raised 
     <lb/>
     a query respecting the attitude of the North<lb break="no"/>west goverument with regard to the capital 
     <lb/>
     advance of $250,000 voted by parliament. It 
     <lb/>
     would be a matter of great surprise to me to 
     <lb/>

     learn that the North-west government had 
     <lb/>
     refused to accept that capital advance, as 
     <lb/>
     I understand they have called a special 
     <lb/>
     session for the purpose of voting this money 
     <lb/>
     which is being put at their disposal.

     <lb/>
     a quotation from the Budget speech of the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of the Territories at the 
     <lb/>
     last session of the legislature. I quote the

     vote. In an earlier message, Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain had advised me—and this no doubt ex<lb break="no"/>plains the point raised by my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sproule) that he was unwilling to con<lb break="no"/>sider the capital advanced until the current 
     <lb/>
     revenue vote was made larger and on 
     <lb/>
     the 18th April he wired me that the 
     <lb/>
     last addition to the current vote that would 
     <lb/>
     be acceptable would be $200,000. The 
     <lb/>
     government of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     gets not $200,000, but $250,000 addi<lb break="no"/>tional and the objectionable conditions at<lb break="no"/>tached to the advance against which Mr. 
     <lb/>Haultain complained are removed. If he 
     <lb/>is still unsatisfied I would be bound to say, 
     <lb/>as one who in a sense acted as Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain's agent in pressing these proposals on 
     <lb/>the hon. Finance Minister, that I misappre<lb break="no"/>hended the instructions given by him. I will 
     <lb/>go a little further and state that the provi<lb break="no"/>sion made this year for the North-west gov<lb break="no"/>ernment is fully and entirely what we North<lb break="no"/>west members asked for from the Finance 
     <lb/>Minister and his colleagues and our proposi<lb break="no"/>tion—I state it upon my responsibility as a

     were under some misapprehension as to the 
     <lb/>
     measure of control that the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were going to exercise over the 
     <lb/>
     capital advance. But, when they read the

     words that the hon. Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     used here the other evening when the ad<lb break="no"/>vance was being voted that practically the 
     <lb/>
     money will be entirely under the control 
     <lb/>
     of the local authorities they will have no

     further objection as indeed they cannot

     have. But, to proceed with what I was 
     <lb/>
     saying here, I go even farther and I will 
     <lb/>
     state that when we submitted our final pro<lb break="no"/>posal to the hon. Minister of Finance, a pro<lb break="no"/>posal which he has met in every particular 
     <lb/>
     this year, I communicated the effect of it to 
     <lb/>
     the members of the North-west government 
     <lb/>
     and I received a reply to the effect that the 
     <lb/>
     proposed provision would be considered rea<lb break="no"/>sonably satisfactory, and would fairly well 
     <lb/>
     meet their needs. I do not wish the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen to misunderstand me to mean 
     <lb/>
     that the North-west government indicated 
     <lb/>
     that they regarded this proposition as giving 
     <lb/>
     them everything that they were entitled to 
     <lb/>
     but they led us to believe that they would 
     <lb/>
     be reasonably able to carry on all the ser<lb break="no"/>vices for which they were responsible if this

     proposition were carried out.

     Let me illustrate by saying that at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time there are on file in the Public Works 
     <lb/>
     Department, Regina, applications for works in 
     <lb/>
     the way of improvements for this year (1902), 
     <lb/>
     resulting from the rapid development which has 
     <lb/>
     taken place in the country, to complete which 
     <lb/>
     would involve an expenditure of $400,000. I 
     <lb/>
     know from my own personal knowledge that a 
     <lb/>
     very large proportion of the work asked for in 
     <lb/>
     certain districts is urgently needed in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the development of such districts,

     and from present indications the answer to all 
     <lb/>
     such applications is gong to be ' No funds, and 
     <lb/>
     impossible to undertake such work,' because 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government have neither in<lb break="no"/>creased the subsidy nor put the territories in 
     <lb/>
     a position to incur debt, so that they can meet

     The fact is that the lack of power to 
     <lb/>
     borrow money, to pledge the public credit, to 
     <lb/>
     undertake permanent works and spread the 
     <lb/>
     payment over a long period of years so as 
     <lb/>
     to permit the inhabitants ten or twenty 
     <lb/>
     years hence to assist in meeting the cost of 
     <lb/>
     works constructed now has been seriously 
     <lb/>
     complained of for years. This lack is one 
     <lb/>
     of the strong features of the gradual growth 
     <lb/>
     of public sentiment in the country in favour 
     <lb/>
     of provincial autonomy. As the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen from Saskatchewan (Mr. Davis) and 
     <lb/>
     from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) have shown, the 
     <lb/>
     grant made to the territorial government this 
     <lb/>
     year is a very much larger grant, taken pro<lb break="no"/>portionately or measured in any other way, 
     <lb/>
     than the grant given in any former year. 
     <lb/>
     Including the advance, it is actually more, 
     <lb/>
     than the North-west government stated in 
     <lb/>
     their estimates this year was necessary for 
     <lb/>
     their various purposes. The hon. the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition will find in Mr. Haultain's 
     <lb/>
     budget speech, that he asked for $1,130,000, 
     <lb/>
     and he has received in all, on current re<lb break="no"/>venue account, $957,979, which is apart al<lb break="no"/>together from the $84,000 grant for bridge 
     <lb/>
     construction, and apart altogether from the 
     <lb/>
     capital advance. The amount granted there<lb break="no"/>fore, is 85 per cent of the estimates Mr.

     Haultain submitted here last winter and I 
     <lb/>
     may say that a grant amounting to 85 per 
     <lb/>
     cent of the North-west government estimate, 
     <lb/>
     is better treatment than the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories ever got in any former year. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend (Mr. Borden', Halifax) read ex<lb break="no"/>tensively from letters, and communications 
     <lb/>
     and documents, and records, of one kind 
     <lb/>
     or another, to prove that the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories was very much 
     <lb/>
     dissatisfied with the treatment meted out 
     <lb/>
     to him by this government. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     whether it would be proper to say that this 
     <lb/>
     state of dissatisfaction is chronic with the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of the territories, but it is 
     <lb/>
     a fact that in former years and under other 
     <lb/>
     federal governments, his dissatisfaction 
     <lb/>
     was no less pronounced. Let me read to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend a letter which Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     read in the assembly last spring, to prove 
     <lb/>
     that he has no more particular complaint to 
     <lb/>
     make against this government, than he had 
     <lb/>
     against former governments. This is a let<lb break="no"/>ter which Mr. Haultain wrote on November 
     <lb/>
     8, 1895, to the government which was then

     In the matter of legislation, too, there seems 
     <lb/>
     to be a similar amount of indifference to our 
     <lb/>
     wants and our requests. We have for four years 
     <lb/>
     asked that the amount transferred to the as<lb break="no"/>sembly should be voted as a straight grant, by 
     <lb/>
     that means obviating the necessity of a double 
     <lb/>
     audit and account, a double system of books, a 
     <lb/>
     largely increased staff in our oflices, and an 
     <lb/>
     amount of extra work altogether out of propor<lb break="no"/>tion to any benefits derivable from the system. 
     <lb/>
     This request was agreed to by the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance and the Minister of the Interior in 
     <lb/>
     1892, and has been approved by the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior every year since then. A simple 
     <lb/>
     clause in the Act would bring about this most 
     <lb/>
     desirable change, but the clause has not yet 
     <lb/>
     been proposed.

     As I have said, up to this present year the

     to keep this question out of party politics, 
     <lb/>
     and I repeat that it is a regrettable fact, that 
     <lb/>
     an effort has been made this year, assisted 
     <lb/>
     by the leader of one of the political parties

     In the year 1899, the North-west govern<lb break="no"/>ment collected $160,000 on account of liquor 
     <lb/>
     licenses in the Yukon, and it was allowed 
     <lb/>
     to retain that money, which I believe it was 
     <lb/>
     entitled to. They spread the amount thus 
     <lb/>
     collected over two years, and the real sums 
     <lb/>
     available by the North-west government in 
     <lb/>
     1898 and 1899 amounted to $725,758, being 
     <lb/>
     74 per cent upon the amount which they 
     <lb/>
     asked in these two years, which was an 
     <lb/>
     aggregate of $973,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have made a comparison also for periods 
     <lb/>
     of five years. We will call the first period 
     <lb/>
     five Conservative years, because the Con<lb break="no"/>servative government was in power during 
     <lb/>
     those years, from 1892 to 1896, inclu<lb break="no"/>sive. The total estimates submitted here 
     <lb/>
     by the North-west government during those 
     <lb/>
     five years aggregated $1,904,526, and they 
     <lb/>
     were granted $1,130,847, being 59 per cent 
     <lb/>
     of their estimates. The Liberal govern<lb break="no"/>ment have been in power for seven years. 
     <lb/>
     In those seven years the estimates of the 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <cb/>
         
         
     North-west government have amounted to 
     <lb/>
     $4.303,000, and they have been granted di<lb break="no"/>rectly in cash $3,097,353, to which must be 
     <lb/>
     added the $160,000 of Yukon liquor licenses, 
     <lb/>
     making a total of $3,257,353, being 75 per 
     <lb/>
     cent, as against 59 per cent during the last 
     <lb/>
     five years the Conservative government were 
     <lb/>
     in power. Take the first five years that 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal government were in power, from 
     <lb/>
     1897 to 1901, inclusive, the total requisitions 
     <lb/>
     amounted to $2,573,000, and the total grants 
     <lb/>
     amounted to $1,841,495, being 71 per cent. 
     <lb/>
     Or, take the last five years of the present 
     <lb/>
     government, from 1899 to 1903, inclusive, 
     <lb/>
     the estimates presented amounted to $3,<lb break="no"/>465,000, and upon these estimates they have 
     <lb/>
     been given $2,691,595, being 77 per cent of 
     <lb/>
     the amounts asked for in those five years, 
     <lb/>
     as against 59 per cent in the last five years 
     <lb/>
     of the previous government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of these figures, I think we are 
     <lb/>
     fairly well justified in stating that on the 
     <lb/>
     whole we have very much less to complain 
     <lb/>
     of this year than there was to he complained 
     <lb/>
     of in any former year. While I say that, 
     <lb/>
     I would not care to take the position that 
     <lb/>
     the grants are being made too large, because 
     <lb/>
     it is my belief that twice the amount of 
     <lb/>
     money that is being voted could be profit<lb break="no"/>ably and advantageously expended in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, and to Canada's 
     <lb/>
     general advantage. I say that there is 
     <lb/>
     no part of any country in the world which 
     <lb/>
     offers to-day such a good field for invest<lb break="no"/>ments, with such an assurance of speedy 
     <lb/>
     and large returns. Still, I am bound to 
     <lb/>
     say that I think the government are this 
     <lb/>
     year fairly well meeting the financial de<lb break="no"/>mand. The comparisons which I have made 
     <lb/>
     with former years can lead to no other con<lb break="no"/>clusion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My own attitude in former years on the 
     <lb/>
     question of provincial autonomy has been 
     <lb/>
     referred to, and I am free to state that if 
     <lb/>
     no new condition had arisen, if the condi<lb break="no"/>tions were exactly the same at the present 
     <lb/>
     time that they have been in former years, 
     <lb/>
     I would be expressing the same view that 
     <lb/>
     I expressed two years ago on the question. 
     <lb/>
     But a new condition has arisen—the condi<lb break="no"/>tion of the Canadian Pacific Railway tax 
     <lb/>
     exemption, to which I intend to refer a little 
     <lb/>
     later—which, in my opinion, furnishes a 
     <lb/>
     very strong reason why it is better to hesi<lb break="no"/>tate, why it is better not to have action 
     <lb/>
     taken at the present time. But, on the 
     <lb/>
     general question, apart from that condition, 
     <lb/>
     which I hope will be removed in a very 
     <lb/>
     short time, I would simply take the occa<lb break="no"/>sion to repeat the opinion which I have ex<lb break="no"/>pressed in other years, that the people in 
     <lb/>
     the territories have the same right to full 
     <lb/>
     powers of local government as the people of 
     <lb/>
     any province.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Besides the question to which I have re<lb break="no"/>ferred, that of the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way land tax, there are one or two other 
     <lb/>
    factors which might suggest the advisability 
     <lb/>of a little delay. One of these is found in 
     <lb/>

     the joint request of the provincial premiers, 
     <lb/>
     made last fall, for a revision of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of annual provincial subsidies. The details of 
     <lb/>
     their request involve questions which must 
     <lb/>
     and do form an important portion of the 
     <lb/>
     autonomy question as relates to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, and I fail to see how the 
     <lb/>
     autonomy question can be satisfactorily 
     <lb/>
     settled without parliament previously or si<lb break="no"/>multaneously deciding as to the merits of 
     <lb/>
     the provincial statement of claim. The 
     <lb/>
     other factor is what, to be perfectly frank, 
     <lb/>
     I must term the lack of fair comprehension 
     <lb/>
     of the autonomy matter by this parliament 
     <lb/>
     and by the people of the provinces whose 
     <lb/>
     representatives form so great a majority in 
     <lb/>
     this parliament. Of the fact of this lack 
     <lb/>
     of comprehension, I need go no further than 
     <lb/>
     quote the statement of the hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition last year, when he said :

     With regard to the details of Mr. Haultain's

     <lb/>
     have not had an opportunity of seeing it, I do not

     think that these details have much to do with

     the matter.

            <p>
     It is fair to say that when the leader of 
     <lb/>
     one of the political parties is not well seized 
     <lb/>
     of a question—a live political question—it 
     <lb/>
     is too much to expect that the ordinary mem<lb break="no"/>ber or ordinary citizen is well informed re<lb break="no"/>garding it. In my opinion, the admission 
     <lb/>
     was a confession of utter lack of comprehen<lb break="no"/>sion of the matter. Mr. Haultain's draft 
     <lb/>
     Bill practically contains the whole question. 
     <lb/>
     The whole question is made up of details. 
     <lb/>
     Although there is a sentimental side to it, 
     <lb/>
     it is essentially a matter of business to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west. When speaking 
     <lb/>
     of a province, we are not dealing with an 
     <lb/>
     empty name. When a province is formed, 
     <lb/>
     the people will assume serious and heavy 
     <lb/>
     responsibilities. Whereas at the present 
     <lb/>
     time this parliament is under the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility of meeting the cost of our local gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, with a provincial establishment 
     <lb/>
     the people of the territories would them<lb break="no"/>selves have to bear that responsibility ; and, 
     <lb/>
     as has been stated by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Alberta, the measure of their duties and 
     <lb/>
     their ability to meet those responsibilities 
     <lb/>
     will depend upon the terms granted by this 
     <lb/>
     parliament when the province or provinces 
     <lb/>
     will be established. If the people have not 
     <lb/>
     adequate sources of revenue, they will be 
     <lb/>
     unable to enjoy the advantages of good gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in its full sense. Now, in stating 
     <lb/>
     that I am really repeating what the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the territories says almost every 
     <lb/>
     time he speaks on the question. In the 
     <lb/>
     speech of 1900, from which the hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition quoted, Mr. Haultain said : 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     I would like it to be understood very dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly that when I have ever expressed an 
     <lb/>
     opinion in favour of the establishment of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial institutions it was always coupled with 
     <lb/>
     a very strong proviso that the proper financial

     terms are attached. I would never consent for

     one moment, if my consent were necessary, to

     the province of Manitoba. When I say that I 
     <lb/>
     believe the time has come for the establishment 
     <lb/>
     of provincial institutions it is always coupled

     Thus as the hon. member for Alberta said, 
     <lb/>
     the details, the terms, are the essence of 
     <lb/>
     the whole question. On the trip which the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition made through 
     <lb/>
     the west last fall, a slight change of mind 
     <lb/>
     was worked on him with regard to the im<lb break="no"/>portance of matters of detail in relation to 
     <lb/>
     this question. On one very important de<lb break="no"/>tail then he expressed himself clearly in 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories, just as he has 
     <lb/>
     done here, and, on behalf of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, I wish to take occa<lb break="no"/>sion to thank the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position for the expression of opinion which 
     <lb/>
     he gave in favour of the view which we 
     <lb/>
     in that country unanimously take, that 
     <lb/>
     when a province is formed it is only fair, 
     <lb/>
     just and proper that the lands, timber and 
     <lb/>
     mineral resources in that province should 
     <lb/>
     be handed over to the people dwelling there 
     <lb/>
     to be managed and owned by them. This 
     <lb/>
     should be done in the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     in the same way as in every other part of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, except in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba which was formed when the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party was in power. But on 
     <lb/>
     several of the other items of detail my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend carefully avoided giving any expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion when he was in the west last 
     <lb/>
     fall, as he has done on this occasion. I was 
     <lb/>
     in hopes when my hon. friend gave notice of 
     <lb/>
     this motion that he had made up his mind 
     <lb/>
     to give a definite opinion upon some of the 
     <lb/>
     details which he had failed to give in the 
     <lb/>
     west. At Qu'Appelle he was asked if he 
     <lb/>
     supported our claim to compensation for the 
     <lb/>
     lands which had been alienated for federal 
     <lb/>
     purposes and I can assure my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     that the people in the audience went away 
     <lb/>
     without really knowing what his answer 
     <lb/>
     meant, whether the reply was that he would 
     <lb/>
     support them in their demands for compen<lb break="no"/>sation or not. These were the words of his 
     <lb/>
     reply :

     <lb/>
     My hon. friend wants to know why these 
     <lb/>
     lands were alienated. Surely it is a little 
     <lb/>
     late for my hon. friend to be asking that 
     <lb/>
     question. Some of the new settlers in the 
     <lb/>
     west might ask this question without creat<lb break="no"/>ing any surprise, but surely it is a late 
     <lb/>
     date for the leader of the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive party, the party which alienated 
     <lb/>
     the lands contrary to the interests and well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     being of the people of the west and of the 
     <lb/>
     whole of Canada, to be asking in this year 
     <lb/>
     of grace why these lands in the west were 
     <lb/>
     alienated and given away to railway com<lb break="no"/>panies. We may differ as to the wisdom and 
     <lb/>
     policy pursued by the Conservative party, 
     <lb/>
     but the thing is done, there is no need to ask 
     <lb/>
     any questions about the lands being alien<lb break="no"/>ated, and is not my hon. friend able to say 
     <lb/>
     now whether he thinks they were alienated 
     <lb/>
     for federal purposes or for some other pur<lb break="no"/>pose ? Surely the building of railways is a 
     <lb/>
     federal undertaking ; these railways were au<lb break="no"/>thorized to be built by parliament and the 
     <lb/>
     aid was voted by parliament, so that 
     <lb/>
     surely they are federal undertakings. The 
     <lb/>
     people in the west had the idea that my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend was simply evading the question by 
     <lb/>
     a quibble. Let me explain to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     how serious this question is and why it is 
     <lb/>
     viewed so seriously by the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west. The total areas of lands which were 
     <lb/>
     voted away by the Conservative party 
     <lb/>
     to railway companies was 56,082,072 
     <lb/>
     acres. Now the roads constructed with 
     <lb/>
     this in the North-west amounted to 1,606 
     <lb/>
     miles and in Manitoba 1,217 miles. North<lb break="no"/>west land was taken to construct roads in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and the mileage in Ontario is 650 
     <lb/>
     miles and in British Columbia it is 253 miles. 
     <lb/>
     By these various items railway companies 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories, Manitoba, On<lb break="no"/>tario and British Columbia have earned 29,<lb break="no"/>986,826 acres of land mostly in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. Part of this area of land 
     <lb/>
     is in Manitoba, but the North-west Territor<lb break="no"/>ies furnish all the lands earned by the roads 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories, British Co<lb break="no"/>lumbia and Ontario and a portion of the 
     <lb/>
     land for the roads constructed in Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     In Manitoba 2,699,230 acres are patented 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps another million of acres will be 
     <lb/>
     selected there, so that the Territories will 
     <lb/>
     have furnished more than 26,000,000 of the 
     <lb/>
     total 30,000,000 acres of land furnished by 
     <lb/>
     the public to these companies. The terri<lb break="no"/>tories therefore furnish about 86 per cent 
     <lb/>
     of the land earned by railway companies, 
     <lb/>
     yet only 43 per cent of the land aided rail<lb break="no"/>ways were built in the territories, 1,606 
     <lb/>
     miles out of a total of 3,741 miles which 
     <lb/>
     were aided by land grants. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Borden) at Regina said:

     Generosity to the railway companies, gene<lb break="no"/>rosity to Ontario, to British Columbia, to

     to build roads in all of these provinces, our 
     <lb/>
     lands were taken to make these railway cor<lb break="no"/>porations rich, but surely it is a little too 
     <lb/>
     much to ask the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories to believe that the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party in this respect has been 
     <lb/>
     one that can be properly classed as a gener<lb break="no"/>ous policy towards the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. If the Conservative party 
     <lb/>
     had remained in power another five years 
     <lb/>
     and had continued that policy of generosity 
     <lb/>
     there would be practically no public lands 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories at the present 
     <lb/>
     time to have any dispute about. Even as it 
     <lb/>
     is of our lands that may be said to be  fairly 
     <lb/>
     fit for settlement, but little remains outside 
     <lb/>
     of the even-numbered sections, as was 
     <lb/>
     proved by the case of the Qu'Appelle, Long 
     <lb/>
     Lake and Saskatchewan Company. The 
     <lb/>
     company were going to enter a suit in the 
     <lb/>
     Exchequer Court against the government to 
     <lb/>
     avoid being compelled to take the only land 
     <lb/>
     that was available for the purposes of their 
     <lb/>
     land grants which they said was not fit for 
     <lb/>
     settlement. Mr. Haultain says, and I say, 
     <lb/>
     and I think every man of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     will say, that these lands voted to railway 
     <lb/>
     companies were lands voted for federal pur<lb break="no"/>poses and that there is no possibility of any 
     <lb/>
     real dispute with regard to the purposes for 
     <lb/>
     which the lands were voted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When a railway is aided with a cash 
     <lb/>
     vote by the federal government, every per<lb break="no"/>son in the Dominion contributes to that vote. 
     <lb/>
     But when the land of the North-west is 
     <lb/>
     taken for this purpose, only the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west contribute to the aid so 
     <lb/>
     given. I repeat, let the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, the leader of the Conservative party 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion, state, so that the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country and especially the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories can understand 
     <lb/>
     what he means, that the 26,000,000 acres of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories land given to 
     <lb/>
     railway companies, alienated for federal pur<lb break="no"/>poses, are to be taken into account and that 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories are to be com<lb break="no"/>pensated for these lands—a statement that 
     <lb/>
     he failed to make when in the west, that he 
     <lb/>
     does not make here and that is not contained 
     <lb/>
     in his amendment to this motion for sup<lb break="no"/>ply. He must recognize that his general 
     <lb/>
     statement in favour of autonomy is not 
     <lb/>
     worth very much to the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories unless he goes further, as 
     <lb/>
     he was pressed to do by my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) and makes it 
     <lb/>
     known to the public just what he means 
     <lb/>
     by autonomy, and what position we shall 
     <lb/>
     occupy with regard to financial ability to 
     <lb/>
     carry on our local government, if we get 
     <lb/>
     the autonomy to which he thinks we are 
     <lb/>
     entitled. The hon. gentleman cannot this 
     <lb/>
     year claim ignorance of details, because he 
     <lb/>
     has Mr. Haultain's draft Bill before him. I 
     <lb/>
     will ask the hon. gentleman as the hon. mem- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     her for Alberta asked him, whether he is will<lb break="no"/>ing to support Mr. Haultain and the member 
     <lb/>

     propositions of this draft Bill, propositions 
     <lb/>
     that, I believe, are supported by all the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west. For I do not 
     <lb/>
     agree with all my colleagues from the North<lb break="no"/>west on this point, but believe that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain's proposals are approved with 
     <lb/>
     practical unanimity by the people of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west. Until the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Borden, Halifax) is willing to say that he 
     <lb/>
     will stand by these propositions, until he 
     <lb/>
     is prepared to say that if we are granted 
     <lb/>
     autonomy it will be by the assistance of his 
     <lb/>
     vote for these terms, he can hardly com<lb break="no"/>mand the support of those of us from the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, and he can hardly 
     <lb/>
     command the support of the voters of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west who approve the details of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain's draft Bill.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I made reference a few minutes 
     <lb/>
     ago to a condition which had arisen and 
     <lb/>
     which made it wise, in my opinion to delay 
     <lb/>
     for this year, granting autonomy to the 
     <lb/>
     North-west. That new condition is the judg<lb break="no"/>ment given by the Supreme Court of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba in March last upon the test case con<lb break="no"/>cerning the Canadian Pacific Railway land 
     <lb/>
     tax exemption. And, in my view this is a 
     <lb/>
     very important consideration. Even in the 
     <lb/>
     view of the Prime Minister of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories at least a very short time 
     <lb/>
     ago this was a very important considera<lb break="no"/>tion. In the explanatory part of his draft 
     <lb/>
     Bill prepared less than two years ago he 
     <lb/>
     says :  
     <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The effect of these exemptions is to prohibit 
     <lb/>
     any province which may be established, or any 
     <lb/>
     municipal corporation therein, from requiring 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to assist 
     <lb/>
     in the ' administration ' of the country or the 
     <lb/>
     maintenance of 'peace, order and good govern<lb break="no"/>ment ' within its bounds with respect to a part 
     <lb/>
     of its property for ever and with respect 
     <lb/>
     to another part for a limited period of time. 
     <lb/>
     This exemption falls hardly upon the people 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories in a number of 
     <lb/>
     ways. The nature of the land grant to the com<lb break="no"/>pany, in that it is spread over the whole coun<lb break="no"/>try in small blocks of one mile square, alternat<lb break="no"/>ing with those open for homesteads, causes every 
     <lb/>
     dollar spent by a settler in the improvement of 
     <lb/>
     his homestead, where it lies within the districts 
     <lb/>
     reserved for the selection of the land granted on 
     <lb/>
     account of the construction of the Canadian Pa<lb break="no"/>cific Railway, to enhance the value of the lands 
     <lb/>
     held for the company in its neighbourhood. All 
     <lb/>
     public expenditures made in such districts for 
     <lb/>
     roads, bridges and other works of a similar des<lb break="no"/>cription improve the value of the lands still held 
     <lb/>
     by the company under its main line grant, the 
     <lb/>
     company contributing nothing on account of 
     <lb/>
     such lands towards the cost of the works by rea<lb break="no"/>son of which they are benefited.

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Further down in the same document he 
     <lb/>
     speaks of these exemptions as making an 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary burden on the people of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories. Until six months 
     <lb/>
     ago, when this judgment of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court was given, nobody had ever 
     <lb/>
     thought to question the right of the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Pacific Railway to exemption from 
     <lb/>
     taxation in the territories, as respects its 
     <lb/>
     right of way and railway property, from 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
        
        
     the time the road was built and for ever, 
     <lb/>
     nor the right of the company to exemption 
     <lb/>
     from taxation as respects its lands for a 
     <lb/>
     period of twenty years. The date of com<lb break="no"/>mencement of the twenty years period was 
     <lb/>
     disputed, but not the right of exemption 
     <lb/>
     for twenty years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The trial of the test case has brought to 
     <lb/>
     light an exceedingly important and entirely 
     <lb/>
     new contention in behalf of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories, namely that so long as that area 
     <lb/>
     remains in its present position the com<lb break="no"/>pany is entitled by law and under its con<lb break="no"/>tract with parliament to no exemption either 
     <lb/>
     as to its roadbed or lands, and that in 
     <lb/>
     reality it has never had a right to exemp<lb break="no"/>tion from taxation in the territories, and 
     <lb/>
     never will until that area is given the status 
     <lb/>
     of a province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And as concerns schools, the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court of Manitoba upheld the contention, 
     <lb/>
     and this year all the land and all other pro<lb break="no"/>perty of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories are held liable 
     <lb/>
     for school taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The court did not express an opinon as to 
     <lb/>
     whether the company is equally liable to 
     <lb/>
     municipal or direct government taxation— 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories case before the 
     <lb/>
     court was the case of a school district only— 
     <lb/>
     but the judgment given on the school case 
     <lb/>
     leaves little room for doubt that the court 
     <lb/>
     would give the same judgment as regards 
     <lb/>
     municipal and government taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, upon a legal question of this kind 
     <lb/>
     I speak with some hesitation, not being a 
     <lb/>
     lawyer, and I have been careful to put on 
     <lb/>
     paper just what I wish to say so that I may 
     <lb/>
     make no error. But, I followed closely the 
     <lb/>
     press reports of the argument at the trial in 
     <lb/>
     Winnipeg. I have also seen the judgment. 
     <lb/>
     And before judgment was given I met Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howell, counsel for the government and for 
     <lb/>
     the North-west people, who kindly took the 
     <lb/>
     trouble to explain to me the contentions he 
     <lb/>
     advanced in behalf of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. I believe I have grasped the main 
     <lb/>
     features, which are as I have described. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He contended that with respect of school 
     <lb/>
     taxation, before the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way contract and Act were passed in 1881, 
     <lb/>
     granting exemption from taxation ' by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion or by any province thereafter to 
     <lb/>
     be established, or by any municipal corpora<lb break="no"/>tion therein,' an Act (North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     Act, 43 Victoria, chapter 25) was in force, and 
     <lb/>
     under section 10 power to assess and collect 
     <lb/>
     school rates was conferred. Therefore, the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government had already delegat<lb break="no"/>ed taxing power to at least this extent, and, 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway contract not 
     <lb/>
     providing for the abrogation of such power 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     the power and right to levy taxes was not 
     <lb/>
     cancelled by the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     Act, which Act therefore must be consider<lb break="no"/>ed, as far as exemption is concerned, as sub<lb break="no"/>ject to the right already conferred upon the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories in this respect. The 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <pb n="13931" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1903-10-13_Page_13931.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">13932</fw>
     
     
     court upheld the contention, and the judg<lb break="no"/>ment means that the company enjoys no ex<lb break="no"/>emption from school taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The feature that concerns this autonomy 
     <lb/>
     question is this—that upon the creation 
     <lb/>
     of a province parliament would become 
     <lb/>
     liable, under the contract, to secure and 
     <lb/>
     safeguard the company in the exemptions 
     <lb/>
     granted in the contract. The language 
     <lb/>
     of the contract means plainly that the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government or parliament will not 
     <lb/>
     tax for twenty years the lands and for ever 
     <lb/>
     will not tax the other property of the com<lb break="no"/>pany, nor permit such taxation to be levied 
     <lb/>
     in any province whenever such is created ; 
     <lb/>
     in other words, parliament contracted with 
     <lb/>
     the company to restrict the taxing powers 
     <lb/>
     of any new province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When new territory was added to Manito<lb break="no"/>ba this provision of the contract was ob<lb break="no"/>served, and the company was safeguarded 
     <lb/>
     against taxation as agreed. The added por<lb break="no"/>tion was brought under provincial status, 
     <lb/>
     and specifically made subject to the exemp<lb break="no"/>tion provision of the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way contract. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is true that the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     urge that when they made a province 
     <lb/>
     it shall not be subject to the Canadian Pa<lb break="no"/>cific Railway exemptions.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This feature of the autonomy problem 
     <lb/>
     tends to prove the wisdom of the words used 
     <lb/>
     by the Minister of the Interior last year 
     <lb/>
     respecting the advisability of taking time 
     <lb/>
     to develop a full, general and popular un<lb break="no"/>derstanding of the question. If the settle<lb break="no"/>ment with the North-west Territories had 
     <lb/>
     been made last year I very much fear, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the lack of full comprehension by 
     <lb/>
     parliament of the details of the whole mat<lb break="no"/>ter, that the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     would have been left in enjoyment of its 
     <lb/>
     contract rights, no matter how unfair as 
     <lb/>
     against the people of the new province, and 
     <lb/>
     that the new province would have been in 
     <lb/>
     the same position as the added portion of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, which, by the Manitoba Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court judgment, ls left under the exemp<lb break="no"/>tion handicap for twenty years as to lands 
     <lb/>
     and for ever as to roadbed. It is for this 
     <lb/>
     reason that I think it is extremely fortunate 
     <lb/>
     that autonomy was not granted us last year. 
     <lb/>
     I have not the slightest hesitation in de<lb break="no"/>claring that it is vastly better for us to 
     <lb/>
     await autonomy two or three years, and 
     <lb/>
     finally obtain it free from these exemptions 
     <lb/>
     than to obtain it immediately with the 
     <lb/>
     heavy handicap of the exemptions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have already occupied so much time, 
     <lb/>
     and the hour is so late, at this late stage of 
     <lb/>
     the session, that I do not feel justified in 
     <lb/>
     going as fully into the question as other<lb break="no"/>wise I would feel it incumbent upon me to 
     <lb/>
     do. Let me say, in conclusion, that in face 
     <lb/>
     of the position of this Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway tax matter, in view of the millions 
     <lb/>
     of acres of land that are involved, of the 
     <lb/>
     millions of value in railway property of the 
     <lb/>
     company that are involved, it appears to me 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the North-west would be 
     <lb/>
 
 
            <cb/>
        
        
     simply crazy at present to accept autonomy 
     <lb/>
     unless driven to it as a last resort—and we 
     <lb/>
     are not driven to the last resort this year 
     <lb/>
     because our immediate financial needs are 
     <lb/>
     fairly well met ; the lack of the borrowing 
     <lb/>
     power remedied by the capital advance 
     <lb/>
     method ; and little room for complaint is 
     <lb/>
     left us as regards railways. Such being the 
     <lb/>
     case, I certainly approve of delay until all 
     <lb/>
     doubts as to the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     tax question is removed. I hope this doubt 
     <lb/>
     will not exist very long, I hope the case will 
     <lb/>
     soon be settled by a judgment of the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council. Possibly it may be too much to 
     <lb/>
     hope that it may be settled before next 
     <lb/>
     year, because the law courts move slowly. 
     <lb/>
     But the position I take is that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment should obtain from the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     a final decision upon this Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway tax exemption, and that as soon as 
     <lb/>
     it is obtained the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
    should be granted provincial autonomy.
