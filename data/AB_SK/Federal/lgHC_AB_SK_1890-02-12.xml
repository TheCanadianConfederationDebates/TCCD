     [...]some remuneration, so I would ask if it receives 
     <lb/>
     any subsidy from this Government?

     <persName ref="pers:CARL1">Mr. CARLING</persName>. That does not come under 
     <lb/>
     this item, but it will come up later on.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WILS5">Mr. WILSON</persName> (Elgin). I must congratulate the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Agriculture, who possibly may feel a 
     <lb/>
     disposition before long to be exalted to a position 
     <lb/>
     more agreeable to his tastes than his present one, 
     <lb/>
     upon the assistance which he has received from 
     <lb/>
     the two aspirants to his present office. I warn him 
     <lb/>
     that they are dangerous characters, as they say 
     <lb/>
     doctors always are, and I would advise him to be 
     <lb/>
     cautious in accepting the advice of these two aspir<lb break="no"/>ants to the position of Minister of Agriculture. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) got 
     <lb/>
     to his feet first, and defended this item, as he 
     <lb/>
     always has done. He conveyed the idea to the 
     <lb/>
     House that I did not fully understand the question, 
     <lb/>
     or I would know that no other Provinces had a 
     <lb/>
     health board except Ontario, and that, therefore 
     <lb/>
     they could not be expected to adopt means by 
     <lb/>
     which the health of the different localities could be 
     <lb/>
     ascertained. He went further and stated that it 
     <lb/>
     was very desirable to know how many people die 
     <lb/>
     in a particular locality in order to judge of the con<lb break="no"/>dition of health in that locality. I certainly did 
     <lb/>
     not know that that was the way in which to ascer<lb break="no"/>tain the state of health in a locality. I thought 
     <lb/>
     there must be something else reported in order to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain that, but my hon. friend, in his zeal to 
     <lb/>
     show his ability to conduct the Department of 
     <lb/>
     Agriculture, did not think it necessary to obtain 
     <lb/>
     any other information. I may inform my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend that there are other Provinces which have 
     <lb/>
     health boards. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The hon. gentleman said he 
     <lb/>
     was not aware whether the other Provinces had 
     <lb/>
     or had not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WILS5">Mr. WILSON</persName> (Elgin). I think I am capable of 
     <lb/>
     using words to convey my ideas, and, therefore, I can 
     <lb/>
     tell my hon. friend that I did know that there were 
     <lb/>
     other Provinces in which boards of health were 
     <lb/>
     constituted very much on the principles of the boards 
     <lb/>
     of health in Ontario. In regard to the suggestion 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. member for West Middlesex (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Roome), that we should have a central board here, 
     <lb/>
     to which all information should be sent, so that the 
     <lb/>
     whole of these health statistics should be arranged 
     <lb/>
     from Ottawa, I do not think that could be effi<lb break="no"/>ciently worked. I think this matter can be very 
     <lb/>
     much better conducted under the supervision of 
     <lb/>
     the Provinces, that they understand how to con<lb break="no"/>trol these matters better than the Dominion could, 
     <lb/>
     and that, if we would attempt to make this service 
     <lb/>
     eflicient, we should adopt the principle suggested by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Prince Edward (Mr. Platt). I 
     <lb/>
     do not think we would derive any benefit from having 
     <lb/>
     all the reports of the different officers throughout the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion sent here and examined in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     health or the longevity in each locality. As a rule, 
     <lb/>
     these officers make no attempt to ascertain the con<lb break="no"/>dition of affairs. There may be a physician in a 
     <lb/>
     town who tries to make a report of that kind, but 
     <lb/>
     from the rural constituencies, we get practically no 
     <lb/>
     information. The statement of the health of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, for example, when it is limited to the 
     <lb/>
     towns and cities, without the rural municipalities 
     <lb/>
     making any returns, is of no value whatever, or 
     <lb/>
     rather it is worse than useless, because it is mis<lb break="no"/>leading. I think it would be better to drop this 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     item altogether, than to leave the reports in the 
     <lb/>
     present condition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     He said: This, Sir, is, after all, a North-West 
     <lb/>
     question, but I need hardly say that I am quite 
     <lb/>
     aware that it is the privilege, and even the duty, 
     <lb/>
     of every member of this House to concern himself 
     <lb/>
     with any public question whatsoever; and I con<lb break="no"/>gratulate the North-West that my hon. and learned 
     <lb/>
     friend (Mr. McCarthy) has taken a tardy interest 
     <lb/>
     in our welfare. I am not aware that he ever took 
     <lb/>
     a very great interest in our welfare until very 
     <lb/>
     lately. He himself tells us that he sat in this 
     <lb/>
     House time and again when this measure was before 
     <lb/>
     it, and that he actually did not know that the 
     <lb/>
     110th clause existed until the spring of last year. 
     <lb/>
     Well, in an ordinary member that would be an 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary thing, but in a distinguished advo<lb break="no"/>cate it is a very marvellous thing indeed. But I 
     <lb/>
     think I understand why it is that he has taken 
     <lb/>
     this interest in us in the North-West. We had 
     <lb/>
     here a question last year which I do not intend to 
     <lb/>
     go into at present, but which has been agitated 
     <lb/>
     throughout the country in a manner that I do not 
     <lb/>
     think was either edifying or statesmanlike; and I 
     <lb/>
     rather think that my hon. and learned friend dis<lb break="no"/>covered that, on that question, he had taken an 
     <lb/>
     illogical stand, that he found, after defending his 
     <lb/>
     position for a considerable time, that the position 
     <lb/>
     was indefensible, and, in order to let himself down 
     <lb/>
     easy, he took up questions that would have been 
     <lb/>
     settled in the Territories without his aid or the aid 
     <lb/>
     of anybody else outside of those Territories. Now,

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I happened to be in Hamilton at 
     <lb/>
     the time, under more auspicious circumstances, but 
     <lb/>
     I have read that speech carefully, and the remark<lb break="no"/>able thing about it is that it is one of a series 
     <lb/>
     illustrating the law of evolution; because they go 
     <lb/>
     on bit by bit; they repeat themselves considerably, 
     <lb/>
     but still, at each step, my hon. and learned friend 
     <lb/>
     shows that the doctrine of Darwin is applic<lb break="no"/>able even to great politicians, and he illustrates 
     <lb/>
     the law of evolution. I said a moment ago that I 
     <lb/>
     had not the honor of hearing that speech, but, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     I had the honor of reading his speech that had 
     <lb/>
     been delivered in Ottawa, a speech going over the 
     <lb/>
     same ground. It was, after all, the same old stuff, 
     <lb/>
     but with a little evolution. So that, although I 
     <lb/>
     did not hear the speech I am tolerably familiar 
     <lb/>
     with my hon. friend's opinions on these 
     <lb/>
     subjects, and I may say that in the course 
     <lb/>
     of a pretty long political life, in the sense that I 
     <lb/>
     have been studying politics all my life, and 
     <lb/>
     have had an opportunity of hearing most politicians 
     <lb/>
     in England and Canada, and prominent politicians 
     <lb/>
     in France, I have never met with speeches so 
     <lb/>
     wanting in logic from so distinguished a man. 
     <lb/>
     Those speeches have two peculiar characteristics. 
     <lb/>
     The one is that my hon. and learned friend has 
     <lb/>
     taken to dilating on questions that, from his busy 
     <lb/>
     life, he was evidently not conversant with, and I 
     <lb/>
     am sorry to say that from a somewhat cold manner 
     <lb/>
     he has lapsed into violent appeals to passions that 
     <lb/>
     can do nothing but harm. Now, Sir, this question 
     <lb/>
     is a local one, and for that reason I consider that 
     <lb/>
     it should be dealt with by the Local Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     Some French gentlemen have gone in there, because 
     <lb/>
     we have had a small French immigration. Some 
     <lb/>
     of our most useful citizens are French gentlemen. 
     <lb/>
     They have come there with much wealth, and 
     <lb/>
     one of them is a coffee grower, M. de Roffignac 
     <lb/>
     Von Brabandt who has started south of Whitewood 
     <lb/>
     the cultivation of chicory. This House will probably 
     <lb/>
     be surprised to hear that Canada has become a 
     <lb/>
     coffee-growing country. We have in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West coffee plantations at the present minute, and 
     <lb/>
     when my hon. and learned friend next goes there 
     <lb/>
     we shall be able to regale him with a cup of coffee, 
     <lb/>
     if with nothing better, before he dilates on his 
     <lb/>
     favorite topics.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. Oh, I forgot, that would not agree 
     <lb/>
     with my hon. friend. Well, Sir, the view that I 
     <lb/>
     take is this, and it is a view that I have taken here 
     <lb/>
     twice in regard to the second homestead. I say 
     <lb/>
     that if that law is on the Statute-book, a French 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who has gone into the North-West 
     <lb/>
     under that 110th clause has a right to complain if 
     <lb/>
     it is repealed without his having something to say. 
     <lb/>
                   We have a certain <hi rendition="simple:italic">quantum</hi> of French population 
     <lb/>
     along the Saskatchewan; we have a small French 
     <lb/>
     speaking population to the south, and although 
     <lb/>
     they are greatly outnumbered, the bare fact of 
     <lb/>
     their being outnumbered is a reason why, without 
     <lb/>
     giving them a hearing, we should not repeal this 
     <lb/>
     clause. Now, as I said, this speech is a part of a 
     <lb/>
     series. I will say that on some subjects in which 
     <lb/>
     I am conversant my hon. and learned friend has 
     <lb/>
     laid down most extraordinary propositions, 
     <lb/>
     and, among others which I will deal with presently, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     that the North-West has been a losing game to

     used the word Keltic, an hon. gentleman, who

     is a Scotchman, and a friend of mine, asked me, 
     <lb/>
     "What on earth were you talking about kilts the 
     <lb/>
     whole time?" So I must not use the word with a 
     <lb/>
     k, but with a soft c, and say Celtic.

            <p>Now, let me make this remark. He says there

            <p>
     Now, I will explain how my hon. friend has fallen 
     <lb/>
     into such a proposition as this. He has read 
     <lb/>
     treatises on language, especially as it affects modern 
     <lb/>
     thought; and it is rather‚ÄîI do not like to say it, 
     <lb/>
     I do not like to say that he did not understand it, 
     <lb/>
     because it would be impolite, and I could not be 
     <lb/>
     impolite‚Äîbut I will say this, that he is so busy a 
     <lb/>
     man that he has not time to inform himself properly, 
     <lb/>
                   and perhaps he is too much of a <hi rendition="simple:italic">nisi prius</hi> advocate 
     <lb/>
     to be accurate, and too much of a mere lawyer to 
     <lb/>
     be a statesman. But remember the two proposi<lb break="no"/>tions that he lays down. The first proposition is, 
     <lb/>
     that language makes the race and the nation; and 
     <lb/>
     as you may have seen in his speech delivered at 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, he lays down the proposition that with 
     <lb/>
     diversity of language to make a nation is impossible. 
     <lb/>
     Now, the important thing about that proposition 
     <lb/>
     is this: It is sent broadcast into ignorant ears, and 
     <lb/>
     if that last proposition is true we may despair 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. That is the important thing about 
     <lb/>
     these hurried deductions from superficial studies. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend, in his Ottawa speech and in the 
     <lb/>
     speech delivered in this House also, talks about 
     <lb/>
     making this a British colony. Sir, is not this a 
     <lb/>
     British colony? Let us be just. Why is it a 
     <lb/>
     British colony? It is so because of that very 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadian French race that seems to act 
     <lb/>
     like a red rag on a bull on the mind of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend; for we know this very well, that there was 
     <lb/>
     a time in the history of Canada when that race 
     <lb/>
     had just passed over to the British flag, when 
     <lb/>
     temptations were held out to them to join the 
     <lb/>
     thirteen colonies, and if they had not been true to 
     <lb/>
     their new-found allegiance, if their loyalty had not 
     <lb/>
     been impregnable against the seductions of Franklin 
     <lb/>
     and others, we should have had no British colony 
     <lb/>
     here to-day. Let us be just, if my hon. friend can<lb break="no"/>not be generous. I will say this, because I want 
     <lb/>
     to help my hon. friend. My hon. friend does not 
     <lb/>
     profess, he says, to be a very devout man, but still he 
     <lb/>
     complains bitterly that the Roman Catholic Church 
     <lb/>
     is tolerated in a manner in this country that our laws 
     <lb/>
     hardly permit. That is his language, addressed to 
     <lb/>
     ignorant and passionate ears. I have the documents 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="535" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-12_Page_00535.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">535</fw>
            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">536</fw>
           
     here if it is dared to be questioned. That, I say, 
     <lb/>
     is the language addressed by the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     to ignorant and passionate ears. It is stated in 
     <lb/>
     these speeches. The history of Canada is reviewed; 
     <lb/>
     it is mourned over that certain things were not done 
     <lb/>
     in the past, and it is mourned that certain things 
     <lb/>
     were not done when the French Canadians num<lb break="no"/>bered only 60,000. But does any man in his 
     <lb/>
     senses suppose that, if they had not been dealt 
     <lb/>
     with with that wisdom, moderation and generosity 
     <lb/>
     that England has practised in regard to all races 
     <lb/>
     with which she has come in contact in building up 
     <lb/>
     her colonial Empire, we should have a British colony 
     <lb/>
     here to-day? I want to help my hon. friend. In the 
     <lb/>
     intervals of a busy life he is undertaking a crusade 
     <lb/>
     against a million and a-half of people; because it 
     <lb/>
     is a crusade, and he is undertaking a crusade 
     <lb/>
     against the Catholic Church. Nobody supposes 
     <lb/>
     that I have any leaning to that church. I am a 
     <lb/>
     Radical on religious subjects‚Äîthat is to say, I am 
     <lb/>
     a very low English Churchman.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. Mr. Speaker, I am addressing a 
     <lb/>
     lawyer mainly, and I am addressing a legislative 
     <lb/>
     assembly, and everybody knows that, according to 
     <lb/>
     the old Roman law, I can become an English 
     <lb/>
     churchman by adoption; so I have become one by 
     <lb/>
     adoption. I want to help my hon. friend, because 
     <lb/>
     I have devoted some time to the study of history. 
     <lb/>
     I tell him that no assault from outside, no matter 
     <lb/>
     how great, no catapults that have been brought 
     <lb/>
     against that church from outside have ever 
     <lb/>
     done it the least harm. The only harm that ever 
     <lb/>
     came to that church has been from volcanic erup<lb break="no"/>tions from within, and then the overflowings have 
     <lb/>
     carried away some of her fairest possessions. So 
     <lb/>
     that I help my hon. friend. I tell him this: the 
     <lb/>
     way to strengthen the Catholic Church is to assail 
     <lb/>
     it, and the way to solidify and make French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians united ‚Äî and I do not think the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian is a very objectionable person, 
     <lb/>
     for some of the most charming men and most 
     <lb/>
     intelligent men I ever met were French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians ‚Äî but still, as my hon. friend, with 
     <lb/>
     his superior culture, does not like them, I may 
     <lb/>
     tell him that if he wants to make the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian permanent and the French language en<lb break="no"/>during, the way to do it is to put the backs of the 
     <lb/>
     people up by such assaults as he is making 
     <lb/>
     throughout the country. To show that I am speak<lb break="no"/>ing by the book, let me read some passages here. 
     <lb/>
     I forgot, when dealing with the race question, to 
     <lb/>
     read a sentence in which my hon. friend says:

     I think myself it is not too much to say that, for a

     <lb/>
     high position in Canada, to have addressed lan<lb break="no"/>guage like that to any audience. How did he tell 
     <lb/>
     them he intended to move this Bill? I confess the 
     <lb/>
     eloquence surprised me; because, although I had 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     often heard my hon. friend in this House and else<lb break="no"/>where, I did not think that lyric rapture was his

     forte. This is the way he described it:

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     To be the mover of a Bill of one clause, when 
     <lb/>
     there was no danger, no guns pointed at my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, and to describe that as the most glorious 
     <lb/>
     task in his life leads me to wonder what was the 
     <lb/>
     character of the other glorious tasks he performed. 
     <lb/>
     The only comparison I can think of is this: I 
     <lb/>
     once called on a college friend of mine who had 
     <lb/>
     married for money a wife who was somewhat old, 
     <lb/>
     and he said to me when I was leaving at night, 
     <lb/>
     "What do you think of her, Davin ?" "Well, 
     <lb/>
     Jack," I said, "I wish I had known your taste, 
     <lb/>
     for I think I could have got you something older 
     <lb/>
     than that." Well, Sir, if I had known the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman's taste was in that direction I think I 
     <lb/>
     could have got him at least as glorious a task. 
     <lb/>
     Why, Sir, when I read that, I remembered a joke 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friend the Premier the other day. 
     <lb/>
     That right hon. gentleman, speaking of the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Victoria (Mr. Earle), said, with his usual 
     <lb/>
     ready wit, that we were better off in this House 
     <lb/>
     than the House of Commons in England, 
     <lb/>
     for we had an "earl" amongst us. When 
     <lb/>
     I read that glorious statement of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), 
     <lb/>
     I thought we were better off still, for we have a 
     <lb/>
     hero in this House‚Äîa hero who chants his own 
     <lb/>
     epic, and there he sits. I say, Sir, that there is 
     <lb/>
     no foundation whatever for these propositions laid 
     <lb/>
     down by my hon. friend (Mr. McCarthy), and I 
     <lb/>
     will prove that these propositions are false and 
     <lb/>
     misleading, and that, therefore, for a statesman as 
     <lb/>
     my friend is, and for a man of great influence and 
     <lb/>
     popular power to disseminate those fallacies 
     <lb/>
     throughout the country, is a very great crime and 
     <lb/>
     a very great misdemeanor at the bar of history. I 
     <lb/>
     would not care in the least what he proposed to do 
     <lb/>
     if he did not fall into such fallacies, misleading as 
     <lb/>
     they are and calculated to beget ideas which may 
     <lb/>
     indeed tend to the disruption of this country. 
     <lb/>
     Now, Sir, I will prove that there is not a tittle of 
     <lb/>
     foundation for his arguments. My hon. friend, when 
     <lb/>
     he was making his speech on this subject in the 
     <lb/>
     House, resorted to authority. It was a very nat<lb break="no"/>ural thing for a lawyer to do, yet I may say this, 
     <lb/>
     that what I should expect from a statesman would 
     <lb/>
     be "reasoning" on this question. I should expect 
     <lb/>
     from him that he would reason this question from 
     <lb/>
     historical facts; and the historical facts bearing on 
     <lb/>
     it are numerous enough. I should expect reasoning 
     <lb/>
     from him from the existing political phenomena in 
     <lb/>
     Europe, and then I should expect that he would 
     <lb/>
     draw deductions. But what does my hon. and 
     <lb/>
     learned friend do? He comes to us with 
     <lb/>
     authorities like a lawyer going before a court of 
     <lb/>
     appeal, and what, let me ask, are his authorities? 
     <lb/>
     Magazine articles, and some of them written by 
     <lb/>
     trumpery writers whose names will not even go 
     <lb/>
     down the gutter of time. Now, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man might have gone to many existing countries 
     <lb/>
     for a parallel. He might have gone especially to 
     <lb/>
     Switzerland. My hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Mills) suggested Switzerland, and then my hon. 
     <lb/>
     and learned friend (Mr. McCarthy) interjected the 
     <lb/>
     remark, "The French language is an exception in 
     <lb/>
     Switzerland." What the meaning of that observa<lb break="no"/>

     tion is I do not know. How is it an exception in 
     <lb/>
     Switzerland? The only meaning of that utter<lb break="no"/>ance of my hon. friend could be that the 
     <lb/>
     language was exceptionally used in the federal 
     <lb/>
     state. Why, Sir, there are only three federal 
     <lb/>
     states that I know of: Canada, the United 
     <lb/>
     States and Switzerland, and in two of these 
     <lb/>
     the French is an official language. Let me say that 
     <lb/>
     Canada need not be ashamed to go to Switzerland 
     <lb/>
     for a comparison. There is scarcely a country which 
     <lb/>
     my reading makes me acquainted with so calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to inspire interest and so full of historical in<lb break="no"/>cidents that are imperishable. The development 
     <lb/>
     of that country has been extraordinary. The differ<lb break="no"/>ences in its formation, its elevations, its soil and its 
     <lb/>
     climate are great and varied; and although Canada 
     <lb/>
     stretches across an entire continent, and Switzerland 
     <lb/>
     is in the heart of Europe, hemmed in by mighty em<lb break="no"/>pires, sometimes in great danger, often menaced, 
     <lb/>
     fought with by more powerful nations, yet like the

     the difference I have spoken of, we know, Sir, that 
     <lb/>
     there is an analogy between Canada and Switzer<lb break="no"/>land in the produce of our dairies, in the produce 
     <lb/>
     of our cornfields, in our mighty forests, and even in

     physical analogy between the countries, and when 
     <lb/>
     you come to compare the systems of government there 
     <lb/>
     is a more remarkable analogy still. The very same 
     <lb/>
     questions that are relegated to the Provinces in

     Canada are relegated to the Cantons in Switzerland; 
     <lb/>
     and the very same questions that are given to the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government in Canada are given to 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Government in Switzerland which 
     <lb/>
     meets at Berne. How many languages have you 
     <lb/>
     in the Parliament at Berne? Why, Sir, five lan<lb break="no"/>guages can be spoken there, and three of these are 
     <lb/>
     official. I am not saying that I approve of this. I am 
     <lb/>
     only stating facts from which deductions can be 
     <lb/>
     drawn. But here is my hon. friend, a statesman that 
     <lb/>
     might be a Gamaliel to me, at whose feet I ought 
     <lb/>
     to sit; here is my hon. and learned friend dilating 
     <lb/>
     on this question and telling us, in the face of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that Switzerland has endured since the 12th 
     <lb/>
     century, that it is the oldest republic that ever 
     <lb/>
     existed, that its people are contented and prosper<lb break="no"/>ous, that with two languages a nation is impossible! 
     <lb/>
     And does not every one of us know what admir<lb break="no"/>able articles they manufacture there? Who does 
     <lb/>
     not know something about the interest that at<lb break="no"/>taches to that country? Yet, in face of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     that prosperous nation has three official languages, 
     <lb/>
     my hon. and learned friend goes abroad and tells 
     <lb/>
     the people that, if there are two official languages 
     <lb/>
     in the country we can never hope to make a 
     <lb/>
     nation‚Äîthat we may throw up the sponge and 
     <lb/>
     write "Ichabod" over our country! A mere state<lb break="no"/>ment of the fact without any argument to support

                   it is a <hi rendition="simple:italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi>. My hon. and learned

     "And now, having ruled that races and nations, though 
     <lb/>
     largely formed by the working of an artificial law, are 
     <lb/>
     still real and living things, groups in which the idea of 
     <lb/>
     kindred is the idea around which everything has grown, 
     <lb/>
     how are we to define our races and our nations? How 
     <lb/>
     are we to mark them off one from the other? Bearing 
     <lb/>
     in mind the cautions and qualifications which have been 
     <lb/>
     already given, bearing in mind large classes of excep<lb break="no"/>tions which will presently be spoken of, I say unhesitat<lb break="no"/>ingly that for practical purposes there is one test, and one 
     <lb/>
     only, and that test is language. We may at least apply 
     <lb/>
     the test negatively. It might be unsafe to rule that all 
     <lb/>
     speakers of the same language have a common nation<lb break="no"/>ality, but we may safely say that, where there is not 
     <lb/>
     community of language, there is no common nationality 
     <lb/>
     in the highest sense. As in the teeth of community of 
     <lb/>
     language there may be what for all political purposes are 
     <lb/>
     separate nations, so without community of language 
     <lb/>
     there may be an artificial nationality, a nationalit 
     <lb/>
     which may be good for all political purposes, and which 
     <lb/>
     may engender a common national feeling; still, this is 
     <lb/>
     not quite the same thing as that fuller national unity 
     <lb/>
     which is felt where there is community of language. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, mankind instinctively takes language as the badge 
     <lb/>
     of nationality. We so far take it as the badge that we 
     <lb/>
     instinctively assume community of language as a nation 
     <lb/>
     as the rule, and we set down anything that. departs from 
     <lb/>
     that rule as an exception. The first idea suggested by 
     <lb/>
     the word Frenchman, or German, or any other national 
     <lb/>
     name, is that he is a man who speaks French or German 
     <lb/>
     as his mother tongue. We take for granted, in the ab<lb break="no"/>sence of anything to make us think otherwise, that a 
     <lb/>
     Frenchman is a speaker of French, and that a speaker of 
     <lb/>
     French is a Frenchman."

     And, of course, what he seeks to make out is 
     <lb/>
     this: that the teaching of that article is the teach<lb break="no"/>ing he had laid down in his proposition, that it 
     <lb/>
     was necessary to have community of language in 
     <lb/>
     order to have a nation. I cannot believe that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend meant to deceive this House, and there<lb break="no"/>fore I am thrown back on the alternative, that he 
     <lb/>
     did not understand Freeman. That article, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     does not deal with the question my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     tried to make the House think it dealt with. 
     <lb/>
     Freeman takes for his text the extraordinary cir<lb break="no"/>cumstance of a lot of Magyars going to Constanti<lb break="no"/>nople to congratulate an Ottoman general on a victory 
     <lb/>
     on the ground of their kinship; because, as you know, 
     <lb/>
     the Magyar is a form of the same Semitic speech, 
     <lb/>
     if it be Semitic, that is spoken by the Turks. He 
     <lb/>
     does the same thing as Max Miiller who deals with 
     <lb/>
     an extraordinary phenomenon in modern life, 
     <lb/>
     brought about by a strong bent to philological 
     <lb/>
     studies; for people are giving in this late day an 
     <lb/>
     importance to language that was not given before; 
     <lb/>
     and when you read the article, you will find that 
     <lb/>
     Freeman uses the word "exceptions" in an extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary way. He actually uses the word for the 
     <lb/>
     majority, and why does he do it? Because he lays 
     <lb/>
     down this proposition: that there are now certain 
     <lb/>
     nations which are formed on this language idea, but ¬† 
     <lb/>
     he says the exceptions all over Europe are very 
     <lb/>
     large. Now, if the House will bear with me I will give 
     <lb/>
     them an idea of this article; but, first, let me ask 
     <lb/>
     why did not my hon. friend read on? You will 
     <lb/>
     see in a minute. If he had gone on, he would have, 
     <lb/>
     read that all the larger countries of Europe

     provide us with exceptions‚ÄîEngland, France, 
     <lb/>
     Germany, Italy, even Austria. Freeman points 
     <lb/>
     out that there are islands which both speech 
     <lb/>
     and geographical position seem to mark out 
     <lb/>
     as French, but which are English‚Äîas truly English, 
     <lb/>
     as truly devoted to England, as truly a part of the 
     <lb/>
     British Empire in feeling as the people of London. 
     <lb/>
     I allude to the people of the Channel Isles, of the 
     <lb/>
     same blood precisely and coming from the same 
     <lb/>
     district of France as the French Canadians. They 
     <lb/>
     are, I will say, as true to England, I believe, as 
     <lb/>
     the French Canadians are to Confederation. Why? 
     <lb/>
     Freeman asks. Because circumstances led them 
     <lb/>
     to cleave to England though their kindred in 
     <lb/>
     Normandy became French; and one again and 
     <lb/>
     again sees in the article‚Äîwhich I hope my hon. 
     <lb/>
     and learned friend did not read‚Äîthat circumstances 
     <lb/>
     control more than language. The insular Norman, 
     <lb/>
     though speaking French, did not become a French<lb break="no"/>man, and he is to-day a loyal part of the British 
     <lb/>
     nation speaking French.

     language is the most obvious sign of common nationality,

     well, from the character of the people, from their

     that political and other reasons forbade the an<lb break="no"/>nexation by Germany of quite a number of

     Can anything be plainer than that Mr. Freeman

     he read it in such a cursory manner that he did not

     grasp the ideas that inspired and infused it. Well, 
     <lb/>
     all I can say is, that if he takes up his knowledge 
     <lb/>
     as certain birds take their food, on the wing, it is 
     <lb/>
     no wonder his conclusions should be so flighty.

     My hon. friend comes from the country whence I 
     <lb/>
     myself come. Ireland can boast of him amongst 
     <lb/>
     her distinguished lawyers. Does identity of 
     <lb/>
     language make community of sentiment, com<lb break="no"/>munity of race, and community of nation there? 
     <lb/>
     Why, do we not know that for hundreds of years 
     <lb/>
     the Saxon has been denounced in the Saxon 
     <lb/>
     tongue? So that there were at my hon. friend's 
     <lb/>
     door facts that might have prevented him, if he 
     <lb/>
     had the time for reflection, from falling into the 
     <lb/>
     errors he has fallen into. Now, I hardly think it 
     <lb/>
     worth while to deal with his allusions to Mr.

     is taking a deep interest in the North-West, and it

     <lb/>
     last seven years, of Montreal; look at the 
     <lb/>
     increased wealth of Toronto; look at the in<lb break="no"/>creased wealth of the manufacturing towns in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario; look at the extension of manufactures in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario; look at the fact that merchants and manu<lb break="no"/>facturers tell me that the North-West is a magni<lb break="no"/>ficent customer to Ontario. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     goes on to say something about the depreciation in 
     <lb/>
     the value of farms. I have looked into the reports 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Blue, and I know he generally takes a gloomy 
     <lb/>
     view of things, but he does not say that the farms 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario have depreciated in value. We know 
     <lb/>
     that, as farms grow old‚Äîand they are not always 
     <lb/>
     cultivated as they should be here‚Äîthey cannot be 
     <lb/>
     expected to be kept up to their original value; but 
     <lb/>
     I do not think the utterances of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man on this subject were the utterances of 
     <lb/>
     a statesman. Look at the fact that the North-<lb break="yes"/>West has been opened up, that we have a vast 
     <lb/>
     railway there; that we have farms there to which 
     <lb/>
     our children can be sent; that we raise wheat 
     <lb/>
     in the North-West, of which I have a specimen 
     <lb/>
     here, the like of which cannot be produced in any 
     <lb/>
     other part of Canada. I have specimens of wheat 
     <lb/>
     which have been grown near Regina, Moose Jaw 
     <lb/>
     and other parts of the district which I have the 
     <lb/>
     honor to represent, and nine-tenths of all that 
     <lb/>
     wheat have been graded No. 1 Hard from year to 
     <lb/>
     year. Is not that an acquisition of wealth to this 
     <lb/>
     country? If the hon. gentleman were right, we 
     <lb/>
     might apply to his statement Horace's illustration 
     <lb/>
     where he speaks of plucking one hair after another 
     <lb/>
     out of a horse's tail. If this North-West country 
     <lb/>
     is of no value, of course the more you diminish the 
     <lb/>
     size of Canada itself, by a parity of reasoning, the 
     <lb/>
     richer it will become. This is one of those 
     <lb/>
     utterances which, I think, are inexcusable

     <lb/>
     I have already shown that my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     has been guilty of the most glaring inaccu<lb break="no"/>racy in other points; but he also told the

     a word about the dual language; that it had been 
     <lb/>
     silent upon that subject while other papers had 
     <lb/>
     spoken about it. I might refer the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man to the issue of that paper of September 10, 
     <lb/>
     1889, and here I find a whole column headed 
     <lb/>

     " It is palpable in a country such as ours, moderation is

     absolutely necessary in order that it shall develop, pro<lb break="no"/>gress and culminate. If in any province or territory two

     languages are unnecessary in official werk, then the proper 
     <lb/>
     thing is to discuss in a calm and collected manner the 
     <lb/>
     question whether their use shall be continued or termina<lb break="no"/>ted. Mr. Dalton McCarthy in one of his speeches said 
     <lb/>
     he did not know that the French language was required 
     <lb/>
     by law in these Territories. Yet he was in Parliament in 
     <lb/>
     1877, when Mr. Mills brought in his Bill to amend this Act 
     <lb/>
     and, not to be more particular, he was in Parliament, in 
     <lb/>
     1886 when the Revised Statutes were passed, yet he did 
     <lb/>
     not know until the early part of last session that such was 
     <lb/>
     the law. This throws a remarkable light on the ignorance

     of eastern politicians regarding the North-West, and 
     <lb/>
     might indeed give rise generally to curious reflections.

     Everybody acquainted with our leading men knew how 
     <lb/>
     the matter stood. Let it be raised, but when raised let

     us discuss it as statesmen should discuss it, without vio<lb break="no"/>lent or offensive language. We need hardly say that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. McCarth having sat Parliament since 1876, having

     voted on the Revised Statutes, is one of_the persons who 
     <lb/>
     passed the law in its present state. He is responsible for 
     <lb/>
     it. Like every political and administrative question its 
     <lb/>
     expediency or the reverse may be properly discussed. If 
     <lb/>
     it should be decided that in any part of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     the dual language is not necessary, let it be abolished

     The Swiss question is then dealt with. But the

     fact that my hon. friend, in a carefully prepared

     speech, could state that that paper had made no 
     <lb/>
     reference Whatever to this question, shows the 
     <lb/>
     glaring inaccuracy that characterised the wild 
     <lb/>
     effort. Now, the federal system to which I

     referred, requires two things. You must first 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     have a body of communities such as we have in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, such as they have in the United States, 
     <lb/>
     such as they have in Switzerland, and these com<lb break="no"/>munities must have a common bond of sentiment. 
     <lb/>
     They must desire union but not unity; they 
     <lb/>
     must have a loyalty to their State or Province, and 
     <lb/>
     at the same time a loyalty to the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. If, of course, they desired union, the 
     <lb/>
     proper thing would be a central government; but 
     <lb/>
     where they desire to come together and get some<lb break="no"/>thing that will give them the impress of a nation 
     <lb/>
     and yet keep autonomous their own State or Prov<lb break="no"/>ince, the proper solution is a Federal Government, 
     <lb/>
     and that Federal Government is called to deal with 
     <lb/>
     different races, with different languages, with men 
     <lb/>
     of different religions, as we see in Switzerland and 
     <lb/>
     as we see in Canada. Sir, I consider that here in 
     <lb/>
     Canada we have all the conditions that are necessary 
     <lb/>
     to produce a strong federal people. In peace, the 
     <lb/>
     loyalty to the State or Province will be high. In war, 
     <lb/>
     the loyalty to the Federal Government will be high. 
     <lb/>
     If Canada were assailed from without to-day you 
     <lb/>
     would find that every feeling that is provincial in 
     <lb/>
     the breasts of Quebeckers, in the breasts of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswickers, in the breasts of Nova Scotians, in 
     <lb/>
     the breasts of the people of the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories and British Columbia, would all disappear 
     <lb/>
     in the grand federal feeling that they should fight 
     <lb/>
     for their common country. Why, Sir, how little 
     <lb/>
     language has to do with preventing people from 
     <lb/>
     becoming citizens of a country. I have travelled 
     <lb/>
     in Alsace-Lorraine where the people speak German. 
     <lb/>
     They are now under the German flag, but gladly 
     <lb/>
     would they go back. They fought gallantly under 
     <lb/>
     the French banner. A more loyal part of France 
     <lb/>
     than Alsace-Lorraine did not exist. Then take 
     <lb/>
     the Bretons. I saw in the summer of 1870, Gen. 
     <lb/>
     Trochu review 300,000 Breton Mobiles in the streets 
     <lb/>
     of Paris, and there was not a man under the 
     <lb/>
     rank of officer who could speak French; yet these 
     <lb/>
     men, when the hour of peril came, went into 
     <lb/>
     battle and fought just as gallantly and just as 
     <lb/>
     eagerly as the men who spoke French. Now, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     harangues like these, whose dangers I have exposed 
     <lb/>
     to-night, I hope will cease. They can reflect no 
     <lb/>
     honor on my hon. and learned friend, and I speak 
     <lb/>
     with truth when I say that I would be jealous for 
     <lb/>
     his honor. There is no position that he could 
     <lb/>
     attain, there is no reputation, however bright, that 
     <lb/>
     he could make, which would not give me great 
     <lb/>
     pleasure. But such harangues as these can reflect 
     <lb/>
     no credit on him as a statesman, and they are cap<lb break="no"/>able of doing incalculable damage to his country. I, 
     <lb/>
     for one, whether we have a dual language or not, 
     <lb/>
     have no fear whatever for Canada. I am perfectly 
     <lb/>
     certain of Canada's future. History teaches me 
     <lb/>
     lessons that history, if he studies it, will teach my 
     <lb/>
     hon. and learned friend. Why, Sir, does he know 
     <lb/>
     anything of the genesis of nations? Does he know 
     <lb/>
     how one country after another has risen, and how 
     <lb/>
     they have spoken different languages, and how they 
     <lb/>
     have come together, and fought under different 
     <lb/>
     banners, and lived under different governments, 
     <lb/>
     and gradually become assimilated until the differ<lb break="no"/>ence of language disappeared, and sometimes a new 
     <lb/>
     language was evolved? History will teach my hon.
     <lb/>

     shall address the House on this occasion, I shall 
     <lb/>
     be conscious that, perhaps, I may have as little 
     <lb/>
     sympathy from the great body of this assembly as I 
     <lb/>
     had upon a certain occasion during last Session; but 
     <lb/>
     if what is said in this debate upon the side which I 
     <lb/>
     propose to advocate, has as much weight in the 
     <lb/>
     country as the agitation which was set on foot last 
     <lb/>
     winter, then I for one will be perfectly content. 
     <lb/>
     Not because it has had, as alleged, the effect of stir<lb break="no"/>ring up strife and setting race against race and creed 
     <lb/>
     against creed, but because it has had the whole<lb break="no"/>some effect of leading the people distinctly to 
     <lb/>
     understand the position in which they are placed, 
     <lb/>
     and to understand the tendency and necessary 
     <lb/>
     consequences of the policy which has been pursued 
     <lb/>
     for so many years past. I say, if we accomplish 
     <lb/>
     that result, we are doing a good thing, even if we 
     <lb/>
     may irritate the feelings of people less sensitive to 
     <lb/>
     the facts of history than to declamation, and such 
     <lb/>
     language as we have heard from the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who has just taken his seat. I neither propose to 
     <lb/>
     emulate his declamation, nor to wander over as 
     <lb/>
     many subjects as he has touched upon, and in the 
     <lb/>
     end to say nothing whatever on the subject at 
     <lb/>
     issue. The hon. gentleman has said a good deal 
     <lb/>
     about his reading and learning. If all the effect 
     <lb/>
     of his reading has been to enable him to speak 
     <lb/>
     for one hour and say nothing, then I for 
     <lb/>
     one do not care to have that sort of learning. 
     <lb/>
     With respect to the remarks made by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman in regard to the hon. gentleman for North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), I can well leave them to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend, in whose hands the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has very foolishly placed himself. I shall endeavor, 
     <lb/>
     after one or two observations on the historical re<lb break="no"/>ferences made by the hon. gentleman, to go to the 
     <lb/>
     question at issue in this matter. He has talked 
     <lb/>
     about Switzerland, and has endeavored to draw 
     <lb/>
     the inference that different languages may be 
     <lb/>
     spoken and officially used in one country, and yet 
     <lb/>
     it be one nation. I meet that statement by the 
     <lb/>
     simple declaration that Switzerland, or Austro-<lb break="yes"/>Hungary which he might have cited, is a federation 
     <lb/>
     of different races and different nations. Now, I say 
     <lb/>
     there is no analogy whatever between that and 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I say we have not, we cannot have, and 
     <lb/>
     never will have in this country two nationalities. 
     <lb/>
     I deny that there are two nationalities in the sense in 
     <lb/>
     which the term is applicable either to Austro- <lb break="yes"/>Hungary or to Switzerland, and, therefore, the 
     <lb/>
     analogy does not hold good. Coming to the 
     <lb/>
     question really before us, there are two methods 
     <lb/>
     by which it is proposed to deal with it. It 
     <lb/>
     is admitted by the hon. gentleman who has 
     <lb/>
     moved the amendment that a change is required. 
     <lb/>
     If achange is not required there is no object in 
     <lb/>
     moving his resolution. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     proposes to deal with it from a local point of view, 
     <lb/>
     the point of view from which the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
    says it should be dealt with. The other method is 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     to deal with it from the point of view which was 
     <lb/>
     put forward by the hon. gentleman who intro<lb break="no"/>duced the Bill, and that is the national point of 
     <lb/>
     view. I will first deal with the local point of 
     <lb/>
     view. We have before us evidence which clearly 
     <lb/>
     shows the opinion of the people in the North-West. 
     <lb/>
     If we take the press of that country we find, from 
     <lb/>
     a little examination of it, that of all the news<lb break="no"/>papers published in the North-West there is not 
     <lb/>
     a single one which advocates, the retention of the 
     <lb/>
     dual language. I may remark that, in speaking 
     <lb/>
     of the newspapers, I do not include the illustrious 
     <lb/>
     journal to which reference was just made, for 
     <lb/>
     either one of two reasons‚Äîand of these two the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman can take his choice-either that journal is 
     <lb/>
     so well represented in this House that it is unneces<lb break="no"/>sary that the editor should read his own articles for 
     <lb/>
     our benefit, or else, if he chooses to take the other 
     <lb/>
     alternative, a newspaper so largely subsidised by 
     <lb/>
                   public money as is the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Regina Leader</hi> is hardly to 
     <lb/>
     be considered as an independent organ of public 
     <lb/>
     opinion. The hon. gentleman did not tell us 
     <lb/>
     what the opinion in the North-West is; he did 
     <lb/>
     not venture to do that, because if so, he would 
     <lb/>
     have been obliged to admit that public opinion 
     <lb/>
     there demands such a Bill as that introduced and 
     <lb/>
     advocated by the hon. member for North Simcoe 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. McCarthy). I will read opinions from those 
     <lb/>
     newspapers, published since my hon. friend gave 
     <lb/>
     notice of his intention to introduce this Bill. The

     <lb/>sent here to advocate. The hon. gentleman says it 
     <lb/>is a North-West measure. I take issue with him 
     <lb/>upon that point, for two or three reasons. In the 
     <lb/>first place, it is a North-West question, but it is 
     <lb/>also a Dominion question. And it is a Dominion 
     <lb/>question, because this Dominion Parliament legis<lb break="no"/>lates for the North-West, and has declared that 
     <lb/>the North-West is not in a condition to have the 
     <lb/>full powers of constitutional government and the 
     <lb/>management of its own affairs, and it is a mere 
     <lb/>piece of opportunism, an attempt to avoid our own 
     <lb/>responsibilities, to throw on the Legislative 
     <lb/>Asssembly of the North-West the power of dealing 
     <lb/>with this question. What is more; they do not 
     <lb/>ask that it should be left to them, nor do any of

     their newspapers do so. They all support the Bill 
     <lb/>
     introduced by my hon. friend and oppose that pro<lb break="no"/>vision in the existing act, which was incorporated in 
     <lb/>
     it without the knowledge of the father of it, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills); and the people of 
     <lb/>
     North-West declare that the dual language should 
     <lb/>
     be struck out as a provision which they do not re<lb break="no"/>quire, which is not in their interest, and which 
     <lb/>
     should not be imposed on them contrary to their 
     <lb/>
     wishes. Another reason is, that this should not be 
     <lb/>
     made a local question. This reason is one which 
     <lb/>
     may not be acceptable to many hon. gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     but it is one which will have great weight in the 
     <lb/>
     country, that it is not desirable to throw into the 
     <lb/>
     Local Legislature of the North-West a bone of con<lb break="no"/>tention which may cause trouble there in two or 
     <lb/>
     three years.

            <p>
                   <persName ref="pers:OBRI1">Mr. O'BRIEN</persName>. I am glad to find the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman express his approval of my sentiments, 
     <lb/>
     because if we do what this resolution proposes we 
     <lb/>
     would enable a minority in the North-West Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to exercise the same power and control over 
     <lb/>
     the destinies of that country that a minority has 
     <lb/>
     exercised over the destinies of this country, an 
     <lb/>
     influence and power which has not been for the 
     <lb/>
     best interests of the Dominion. That is another 
     <lb/>
     reason, because it can be very well understood 
     <lb/>
     that if this power of continuing two languages is 
     <lb/>
     made a subject of local legislation, that minority 
     <lb/>
     may, by taking advantage of party conflicts, do 
     <lb/>
     what in our history has been done frequently, and 
     <lb/>
     what was done in old Canada, exercise a control<lb break="no"/>ling power to which neither their number nor their 
     <lb/>
     influence entitled them. That is a very important 
     <lb/>
     reason why the power should not be placed in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Local Legislature of the North-West. 
     <lb/>
     Those are two very decided reasons why we should 
     <lb/>
     not deal with it as a local question and give away 
     <lb/>
     the power which belongs to us and to no one else. 
     <lb/>
     Another reason why hon. gentlemen should object 
     <lb/>
     to the amendment is, and it is a reason which is 
     <lb/>
     a very important and practical one, that, if the 
     <lb/>
     amendment were carried, it would not be worth 
     <lb/>
     the paper on which it is written. It does nothing 
     <lb/>
     ‚Äîit does not repeal the statute. What assurance 
     <lb/>
     have we that the people of the North-West would 
     <lb/>
     ever get the power to do what the resolution asks? 
     <lb/>
     Does the hon. gentleman mean to say that by a 
     <lb/>
     resolution of this House we can repeal a clause of 
     <lb/>
     an Act of Parliament? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. It could be done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
                   <persName ref="pers:OBRI1">Mr. O'BRIEN</persName>. It will be done when Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment chooses to do it, but we have no asssurance 
     <lb/>
     that the majority of this House will do it. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's amendment, if carried, leaves the 
     <lb/>
     matter exactly as it was before, and it does not 
     <lb/>
     meet the wishes of the people which the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman professes to represent here, nor does it 
     <lb/>
     meet the expressions of public opinion made in the 
     <lb/>
     newspapers published in that country. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     I say that this amendment, if carried, is a perfect 
     <lb/>
     nonentity. It will not produce even that system 
     <lb/>
     of evolution which the hon. gentleman referred 
     <lb/>
     to. I cannot even pay him the left handed com<lb break="no"/>pliment which he aid to my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) that his speech was 
     <lb/>a system of evolution, for evolution means some<lb break="no"/>
    
            <cb/>
           
     thing to be evolved. That cannot be said of the 
     <lb/>
                   speech of my hon. friend for <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex nihilo nihil fit</hi>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
                   <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. You should say <hi rendition="simple:italic">nihil</hi>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
                   <persName ref="pers:OBRI1">Mr. O'BRIEN</persName>. Upon the grounds which I have 
     <lb/>
     stated I say that this House cannot recognise the 
     <lb/>
     deduction which the hon. gentleman endeavored to 
     <lb/>
     draw from his historical reference to the incidents 
     <lb/>
     of other nationalities. Let me disclaim entirely 
     <lb/>
     (although very likely the disclaimer on account of 
     <lb/>
     the very great representations already made may 
     <lb/>
     not amount to much) any intention to demand the 
     <lb/>
     total abolition of the French language, we demand 
     <lb/>
     the abolition of the French language as an official 
     <lb/>
     language in the North-West, where only five-sixths 
     <lb/>
     of the people know the language, and this has been 
     <lb/>
                   treated as an attack on the French language <hi rendition="simple:italic">per se</hi>. 
     <lb/>
     Those who make that statement know that it is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely without foundation. They must know 
     <lb/>
     that nobody desires to interfere with the French 
     <lb/>
     language in any way where it is useful or neces<lb break="no"/>sary. Hereafter I venture to say that there will be 
     <lb/>
     but one language in this Dominion and that will 
     <lb/>
     be the language which should be used in all the 
     <lb/>
     new Provinces of this country; the language which 
     <lb/>
     must be the official language of the Dominion if 
     <lb/>
     this is ever to be a great or prosperous country. 
     <lb/>
     If the member for East Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) had 
     <lb/>
     carried his historical references as far as Austro-<lb break="yes"/>Hungary, to which the analogy would more 
     <lb/>
     closely apply, he would find that the people 
     <lb/>
     of that country, where there are more than five 
     <lb/>
     languages spoken, have to come to precisely the same 
     <lb/>
     conclusion as the hon. member who introduced 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, and he would find that in Hungary, 
     <lb/>
     where there are the Magyar, the Saxon and 
     <lb/>
     Roumanian languages, all used in the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     pursuits of life, the Hungarian language is imposed 
     <lb/>
     as an absolute necessity, because it was discovered 
     <lb/>
     that the use of all these different languages led to 
     <lb/>
     discord and rendered government impossible. On 
     <lb/>
     the other hand, in Austria, where there are several 
     <lb/>
     languages of a similar character, the attempt made 
     <lb/>
     by the recent Government to allow the use of all 
     <lb/>
     these languages in official documents has led to 
     <lb/>
     endless confusion, has fomented discord, and 
     <lb/>
     brought about endless trouble in the community. 
     <lb/>
     Even here, the analogy does not hold good no more 
     <lb/>
     than in the case of Switzerland, because there we 
     <lb/>
     have distinct nationalities federated for special 
     <lb/>
     purposes. And everyone knows that the Emperor 
     <lb/>
     of Austria is also King of Hungary. I do not 
     <lb/>
     intend to occupy the time of this House any 
     <lb/>
     longer, and I will merely recapitulate the grounds 
     <lb/>
     upon which I object to this amendment. It 
     <lb/>
     means nothing, it does nothing, and it produces 
     <lb/>
     no effect. It is no answer to the petitions 
     <lb/>
     which have been sent here asking that a change 
     <lb/>
     should be made in the law. I further say that 
     <lb/>
     this is not a local question, and for the reasons I 
     <lb/>
     have given that it cannot be properly dealt with 
     <lb/>
     as a local question. The duty and responsibility 
     <lb/>
     connected with the matter belongs to this House, 
     <lb/>
     and they should not, and ought not, delegate it to 
     <lb/>
     any one. The question should be dealt with as 
     <lb/>
     the Bill of the hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy) proposes to deal with it. Those who 
     <lb/>
     do not like the Bill can vote against it and say that 
     <lb/>
     the French language shall continue in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. Those who think there ought 
     <lb/>
     to but one language, in accordance with the well-<lb break="yes"/>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WHIT18">Mr. WHITE</persName> (Cardwell). I cannot hope to enter<lb break="no"/>tain the House with the splendid eloquence and 
     <lb/>
     vivacity of my hon. friend from Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Davin), but with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to make a few observations on the Bill 
     <lb/>
     now under discussion. What I have to complain 
     <lb/>
     of in the speech of the hon. member for Simcoe 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. McCarthy), is that from beginning to end it 
     <lb/>
     had a tendency to offend our French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     fellow-citizens and was not at all addressed to the 
     <lb/>
     question which he presented to the House. That 
     <lb/>
     question in itself, it seems to me, is a very 
     <lb/>
     simple one. It is, whether looking to the 
     <lb/>
     character of the population of the North-West, it 
     <lb/>
     is expedient to continue the use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language in official documents. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), instead of confining him<lb break="no"/>self to the question of the expediency of the use of 
     <lb/>
     the French language in the North-West, went back 
     <lb/>
     to the treaty of 1763, and he made it appear by 
     <lb/>
     every word that he uttered that nothing in the 
     <lb/>
     legislation of Canada, nothing in the legis<lb break="no"/>lation of Great Britain affecting Canada was 
     <lb/>
     so distasteful to him as the recognition of French 
     <lb/>
     as an official language with us. I dissent entirely 
     <lb/>
     from the conclusions he has drawn from his prem<lb break="no"/>ises. He said that the treaty of 1763 made no men<lb break="no"/>tion of the use of French as an official language, that 
     <lb/>
     the treaty of 1774 made no mention of the use of 
     <lb/>
     French as an official language, that the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tional Act of 1791 omitted any recognition of it, 
     <lb/>
     and that after Lord Durham had made his report 
     <lb/>
     upon his visit to Canada in 1839 it was declared 
     <lb/>
     that only one language should be officially recog<lb break="no"/>nised. The hon. gentleman stated also that it was 
     <lb/>
     not until 1848 when the British Parliament repeal<lb break="no"/>ed the statute of 1841, that French obtained an 
     <lb/>
     official recognition in Canada. Now, the recital 
     <lb/>
     of the facts is perfectly accurate, but the inference 
     <lb/>
     drawn seems to me to be wholly misleading. Surely 
     <lb/>
     when we know that from 1774 down to 1841 
     <lb/>
     French was actually in use as an official language, 
     <lb/>
     the whole argument of the hon. member for Simcoe 
     <lb/>
     falls to the ground. It was true, as he says, 
     <lb/>
     that there was nothing in the treaties and nothing 
     <lb/>
     in the Acts of Parliament in reference to it, 
     <lb/>
     but, in spite of treaties and in spite of Acts 
     <lb/>
     of Parliament, French was the language principally 
     <lb/>
     used in official documents in the Legislature. I 
     <lb/>
     have here, for instance, the Journals of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Assembly of 1844-45 containing a report made 
     <lb/>
     by a select Committee, of which Hon. Mr. Papi<lb break="no"/>neau was chairman, on the subject of the use of 
     <lb/>
     the French language, and although it is a little 
     <lb/>
     lengthy, I think it is of sufficient importance to 
     <lb/>
     justify my reading it to the House. This is the 
     <lb/>
     address reported by that committee, which was 
     <lb/>
     unanimously adopted by both chambers of the 
     <lb/>
    Legislature:

     provide that in exclusively English or almost 
     <lb/>
     exclusively English communities the use of the 
     <lb/>
     French language may be abandoned altogether. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, the amendment, as I understand it, proposes 
     <lb/>
     that the same principle shall be extended to the 
     <lb/>
     North-West‚Äîthat the people of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     shall have the opportunity of declaring their will 
     <lb/>
     through their representatives as to whether the

     French language shall be continued in use there or 
     <lb/>
     not. Now, the hon. member for Muskoka (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     O'Brien) is a good deal disturbed by the fear that 
     <lb/>
     the amendment, if adopted, will fail of effect; but 
     <lb/>
     he must know that it is a distinct instruction of 
     <lb/>
     the House to the Government, and if the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment fail to act on this instruction they must resign 
     <lb/>
     office. The hon. member tells us also that it is not 
     <lb/>
     desirable to throw a bone of contention among the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-West, but he has no objection 
     <lb/>
     to a bone of contention being thrown among the 
     <lb/>
     people of the whole Dominion. Is it not a very 
     <lb/>
     much greater source of objection and irritation for 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament of Canada to impose a language 
     <lb/>
     upon a people of any Province than it is to 
     <lb/>
     allow that people to say what language or how 
     <lb/>
     many languages shall be used in their legislature? 
     <lb/>
     Those people pay the taxes and they have the 
     <lb/>
     right to say what expenses shall be placed upon 
     <lb/>
     them. Up to this time the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West have not had much to complain of in this 
     <lb/>
     respect. In fact, were it not for the lamentable

            <cb/>
           
     principally, last summer, I doubt whether the 
     <lb/>
     subject now under discussion would ever have been 
     <lb/>
     alluded to at all either in the North-West or else<lb break="no"/>where. Certain it is that from the time the 
     <lb/>
     amendment was made in the Senate to the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territory Act of 1877 down to the summer 
     <lb/>
     of 1889, when these unhappy religious differences 
     <lb/>
     were brought into the political arena in the 
     <lb/>
     Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, not one complaint 
     <lb/>
     was made, so far as I am aware, by any newspaper 
     <lb/>
     or anybody in the North-West Territory that it 
     <lb/>
     was a hardship upon them and inimical to their 
     <lb/>
     well-being as a national community that the French 
     <lb/>
     should be recognised as an official language. It 
     <lb/>
     is only since it occurred to some gentlemen that 
     <lb/>
     political capital might be made out of it that this 
     <lb/>
     question has been agitated at all. The hon.

     with one quotation bearing upon the case, and it is 
     <lb/>
     from the author selected by the hon. member him<lb break="no"/>self. I refer to Professor Freeman. He says in 
     <lb/>
     one of his lectures, speaking of the Swiss Con<lb break="no"/>federacy‚Äîand I may say that Professor Freeman 
     <lb/>
     maintains that in many important particulars the

     and the United States. There is not an hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman in this House who will take exception 
     <lb/>
     to the view that if it were possible to have one 
     <lb/>
     language it would be an advantage, but it is use<lb break="no"/>less to-day to lay down that view as an argument. 
     <lb/>
     If we could all be by a process of reasoning made 
     <lb/>
     English, it might be to the general advantage, but 
     <lb/>
     the day has gone by, when anything can be gained 
     <lb/>
     by insisting on the suppression of a language 
     <lb/>
     spoken by a large minority in this country.¬† We 
     <lb/>
     have to deal with facts as they exist. Without doubt 
     <lb/>
     under our present system the assimilation of the 
     <lb/>
     people is being gradually brought about. From 
     <lb/>
     personal knowledge I may say that in the Province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, throughout the Eastern Townships and 
     <lb/>
     the Montreal districts, there are more French 
     <lb/>
     people speaking English than English people 
     <lb/>
     speaking French. In fact it is worthy of remark 
     <lb/>

     that in that Province ten Frenchmen learn English 
     <lb/>
     to one Englishman who learns French. But as 
     <lb/>
                   <hi rendition="simple:italic">L'Etendard</hi> said the other day, if efforts are made 
     <lb/>
     to antagonise our fellow-citizens, the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, if they are to be deprived of what the 
     <lb/>
     consider their rights, they will become more 
     <lb/>
     exclusive than they have ever been in the past. 
     <lb/>
     What has been the teaching of the past? We 
     <lb/>
     know that down to the rebellion of 1837 the French 
     <lb/>
     held themselves completely aloof from their Eng<lb break="no"/>lish speaking fellow-subjects, whom they regarded 
     <lb/>
     as an alien and hostile race; but after the rebellion 
     <lb/>
     and after the union of the two Canadas in 1841, a 
     <lb/>
     different feeling began to set in, and a different 
     <lb/>
     state of affairs began to prevail. The French 
     <lb/>
     speaking people obtained the measure of self-<lb break="yes"/>government they desired, and according to the 
     <lb/>
     testimony of Earl Grey in one of his letters to Lord 
     <lb/>
     John Russell: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     "The consequence of this was that the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians and the Liberal party in the western division of the 
     <lb/>
     Province, seeing that their leaders and friends were 
     <lb/>
     admitted to their just share of power and influence, that 
     <lb/>
     no distrust of them was evinced by the Government and 
     <lb/>
     that the Government really was to be carried on strictly 
     <lb/>
     in the spirit of the constitution without any preference 
     <lb/>
     being shown to men of any one party or any one religion, 
     <lb/>
     became on their side reconciled to the Imperial authority 
     <lb/>
     which was exercised, and proved themselves worthy of 
     <lb/>
     the confidence which had been placed in them by the 
     <lb/>
     loyalty and attachment they manifested to the Crown. 
     <lb/>
     So soon and so decidedly were the healing effects of this 
     <lb/>
     policy experienced, that when the news of the French 
     <lb/>
     revolution of February, 1848, reached the Province, it 
     <lb/>
     occasioned no disturbance or alarm. In the state of pub<lb break="no"/>lic feeling and opinion which Lord Elgin found prevailing 
     <lb/>
     on his arrival in Canada little more than a car before, 
     <lb/>
     there can be no doubt that the intelligence of this startling 
     <lb/>
     event would have produced most formidable excitement, 
     <lb/>
     if not actual disturbance. Instead of this there was a 
     <lb/>
     most perfect tranquility and security. All efforts to 
     <lb/>
     create opposition to the Government amongst the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians utterly failed; they heartily and steadily sup<lb break="no"/>ported the Government, and took every opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     manifest, by addresses and resolutlons, the strongest spirit 
     <lb/>
     of loyalty to the British Crown."

            <p>
     That was the effect fifty years ago of a policy of 
     <lb/>
     conciliation and fair play, and every chapter in the 
     <lb/>
     history of Canada shows that where efforts have 
     <lb/>
     been made to antagonise the sentiment of French-<lb break="yes"/>Canadians, or to compel them to speak a foreign 
     <lb/>
     tongue, they have become only the more exclusive 
     <lb/>
     and refused the more obstinately to assimilate with 
     <lb/>
     their fellow-citizens of British origin, but that 
     <lb/>
     when, on the contrary, a policy of fair play, con<lb break="no"/>ciliation and justice is pursued, they have mani<lb break="no"/>fested the most unswerving loyalty to the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown and Canada. Sir George Cartier called 
     <lb/>
     himself an Englishman speaking French, and I 
     <lb/>
     believe there are to-day more French Canadians 
     <lb/>
     who are proud to call themselves English-speaking 
     <lb/>
     Frenchmen than ever before, and that the number 
     <lb/>
     will steadily increase if a policy of fair play and 
     <lb/>
     equal justice be continued. The events of the 
     <lb/>
     past year, however, have not tended to encourage 
     <lb/>
     this assimilation, and every fair-minded man must 
     <lb/>
     regret the agitation which has been made in this 
     <lb/>
     House and out of it on this race and language question. 
     <lb/>
     I believe in the policy of provincial rights in a 
     <lb/>
     matter of this kind. The question of a dual 
     <lb/>
     language is to be dealt with by this Parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada so far as federal affairs are concerned, but 
     <lb/>
     I believe that, so far as provincial affairs are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, it should be dealt with by the Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and to the Provinces I am prepared to relegate it. 
     <lb/>
     I trust our French Canadian friends will take the 
     <lb/>
    same view, and that they will not allow the source 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     from which this proposition emanates to warp or 
     <lb/>
     bias their judgment in the matter. Of course they 
     <lb/>
     believe that, but for the agitation which swept over 
     <lb/>
     this country last summer, this proposition would 
     <lb/>
     not have come here, but they must also be aware 
     <lb/>
     that nine-tenths of the people in the Territories 
     <lb/>
     belong to other races than French, and that, judging 
     <lb/>
     from the tendency of colonisation in that territory, 
     <lb/>
     that population is likely to be larger in proportion 
     <lb/>
     in the future. The tendency to colonisation on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the French population is practically con<lb break="no"/>fined to the eastern part of Ontario, and our 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian friends must be aware that their 
     <lb/>
     interests, not only as French Canadians, but in 
     <lb/>
     every sense, are not jeopardised, and cannot be 
     <lb/>
     jeopardised, by the abolition of the use of their 
     <lb/>
     language in the proceedings and the documents of 
     <lb/>
    the North-West Assembly.

     <persName ref="pers:BEAU13">Mr. BEAUSOLEIL</persName>. (Translation.) I cannot, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, allow this debate to be concluded without 
     <lb/>
     expressing the opinions I hold on this matter, as 
     <lb/>
     being a French Canadian. This question is cer<lb break="no"/>tainly one of the most important which can be 
     <lb/>
     brought before this House. It concerns not only 
     <lb/>
     the limited French population in the North-West, 
     <lb/>
     but looking at the terms in which it is couched, it 
     <lb/>
     influences the peace and prosperity of the country, 
     <lb/>
     and, more especially, the entire French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     race. The Bill brought in by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) is, on the face of it, 
     <lb/>
     directed against the use of the French language in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West. But if we read the speech which 
     <lb/>
     accompanied its introduction, and if we read the 
     <lb/>
     preamble of the Bill itself, we shall there find set 
     <lb/>
     out the principle that there should exist through<lb break="no"/>out the whole of the Dominion but one and only one 
     <lb/>
     official language to be employed in the legislatures 
     <lb/>
     and in the Courts, namely, the English language. 
     <lb/>
     This is a principle, Mr. Speaker, which for my part 
     <lb/>
     I can in no way accept. I am of the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     those who assert that this is not a mere local ques<lb break="no"/>tion; but that it is a question of the gravest 
     <lb/>
     moment and which concerns the whole Dominion. I 
     <lb/>
     am also opposed to the amendment made by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), because I 
     <lb/>
     see in it only an attempt to obtain by an oblique 
     <lb/>
     course what they do not dare to ask for directly. 
     <lb/>
     The Bill of the hon. member for North Simcoe is 
     <lb/>
     supposed to be based upon a resolution passed by 
     <lb/>
     the Council of the North-West Territories, asking 
     <lb/>
     that the use of the French language, before that 
     <lb/>
     body and before the courts, be prohibited. If there 
     <lb/>
     is any justification in this House taking up the ques<lb break="no"/>tion it is evidently the fact that the Council of 
     <lb/>
     the North-West should represent the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-West, and that, consequently, 
     <lb/>
     there would be a moral obligation for this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to carry out the wishes so expressed by that 
     <lb/>
     Council. Now, Mr. Speaker, if, relying on this 
     <lb/>
     fact, this House is of the opinion that the French 
     <lb/>
     language ought to be abolished,‚Äîif we decree its 
     <lb/>
     use to be forfeited because we believe these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions to represent the views of the people, it is 
     <lb/>
     evident that by surrendering to this same Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture the right to decree the abolition of the French 
     <lb/>
     language, we act exactly as if we had decreed it 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. If they wish to abolish the French 
     <lb/>
     language, let them say so plainly. If they believe 
     <lb/>
     that it is in the interest of the peace of the coun<lb break="no"/>try that a single language should be spoken in the

            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">556</fw>
           
     Territories, let them have the courage to say so. If, 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, they desire to avoid exciting the 
     <lb/>
     passions of the people, if they wish to avoid rous<lb break="no"/>ing their prejudices, if they wish to avoid cause of 
     <lb/>
     disappointment, if they desire to maintain peace, 
     <lb/>
     tranquility and the excellent harmony which now 
     <lb/>
     exists among the various races, let them declare 
     <lb/>
     that the retention of the French language in the 
     <lb/>
     North-West is a measure in the interest of the 
     <lb/>
     country and let them reject this Bill. At the time 
     <lb/>
     of the organisation of the Territories, it was thought 
     <lb/>
     of importance to the erection and the peopling of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories that the use of the two languages 
     <lb/>
     before the courts and before the Legislature should 
     <lb/>
     be authorised. Nothing has occurred since to 
     <lb/>
     modify this position, The principle which the 
     <lb/>
     amendment lays down is a dangerous principle; if 
     <lb/>
     it is good to leave to a Local Legislature the right 
     <lb/>
     to decide questions of this importance, touching 
     <lb/>
     the privileges granted to a whole race; if it is good 
     <lb/>
     to grant this to the North-West Territories, how 
     <lb/>
     can you refuse it to the Manitoba Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     which desires, in her turn, to enact the abolition 
     <lb/>
     of the French language? If it is pretended that 
     <lb/>
     the wish of the legislatures should be acceded to 
     <lb/>
     at Ottawa; if it is admitted that a legislature can 
     <lb/>
     decree the abolution of a right established and 
     <lb/>
     recognised, how will you be able to refuse the 
     <lb/>
     exercise of this right when the House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     is in question; how shall we be able to go to the 
     <lb/>
     foot of the throne and represent to the Queen and 
     <lb/>
     to Her Government that the use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language was guaranteed us by the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     which was given to us by an Act of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament? They will reply to us: You have 
     <lb/>
     thought it right to leave to the majority in the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Legislatures the right of decreeing the 
     <lb/>
     forfeiture of the French language in one Province; 
     <lb/>
     to-day, the House of Commons by a majority 
     <lb/>
     decrees the cancelling of this right at Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     by virtue of what principle do you oppose this 
     <lb/>
     decision? It is plain, Mr. Speaker, that if we 
     <lb/>
     wish, with success, to defend the rights of our 
     <lb/>
     race and of our language; if we wish to maintain 
     <lb/>
     our institutions, we should not allow him to lay 
     <lb/>
     down this principle, because if we admit the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple, we shall be obliged to submit to the conse<lb break="no"/>quences, Whatever they may be. This is why, for 
     <lb/>
     my own part‚Äîand I trust that I represent the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of no small number‚ÄîI cannot support 
     <lb/>
     more strongly the amendment made by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin)‚Äîalthough he has 
     <lb/>
     backed it in terms of great sympathy with the French 
     <lb/>
     language‚Äîthan I can support the Bill itself. I do 
     <lb/>
     not wish to give to a legislature, which has 
     <lb/>
     declared itself hostile, the right of decreeing, when 
     <lb/>
     it shall see fit, that the French language shall cease 
     <lb/>
     to be spoken officially in the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. I have heard the reasons given in support 
     <lb/>
     of the Bill and of the amendment. One of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons given is that the French population in the 
     <lb/>
     North-West is small in number. The French popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the North-West is about one to six, which 
     <lb/>
     is at least as great as the proportion of the English 
     <lb/>
     population of the Province of Quebec. And yet 
     <lb/>
     with what indignation would that person be re<lb break="no"/>ceived who would say: The population of English 
     <lb/>
     descent is small in numbers in the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec; it costs several thousands of dollars to 
     <lb/>
     translate the public papers into the two languages, 
     <lb/>
     let us abolish the English tongue. Let us suppose, 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
           
     (what is an impossibility) that a majority should 
     <lb/>
     adopt a similar resolution, how could this House 
     <lb/>
     refuse to the French majority of Quebec the right 
     <lb/>
     to abolish the English language, when it is desired 
     <lb/>
     to grant to the English majority in the North-West 
     <lb/>
     the right to abolish the French language. It is also 
     <lb/>
     stated that this population is poor. This is a good 
     <lb/>
     reason why we should come forward in its defence. 
     <lb/>
    If the population is poor; if it is but poorly able 
     <lb/>to defend itself, it remains for us, the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of Provinces richer and more at liberty, it 
     <lb/>is for us the representatives of a people capable of 
     <lb/>taking care of themselves, to assume charge of 
     <lb/>their interests before this House. It is also 
     <lb/>said that it is not represented. Why is it 
     <lb/>not represented? It is because the counties have 
     <lb/>been so divided that they cannot choose their own 
     <lb/>representatives. In order to establish that the 
     <lb/>Government divided up the Territories in such a 
     <lb/>manner that this population cannot secure a repre<lb break="no"/>sentation, I will cite the words of that illustrious 
     <lb/>man who has passed forty years of his life in the 
     <lb/>North-West Territories, Monseigneur Grandin, 
     <lb/>who says that, looking at the division of the coun<lb break="no"/>ties, it is impossible for the French population to 
     <lb/>be represented. It has been stated, and I believe 
     <lb/>the statement to be correct, that each and every 
     <lb/>one of the members from the North-West was en<lb break="no"/>treated to adopt the paternity of the Bill by sec<lb break="no"/>onding the motion of the member for North Simcoe 
     <lb/>(Mr. McCarthy) and that they had one and 
     <lb/>all refused. I trust that they will continue to 
     <lb/>represent with impartiality all the elements 
     <lb/>which form the population of the North-West, 
     <lb/>and that they will prevent by their vote and 
     <lb/>voice the injustice which it is attempted to com<lb break="no"/>mit. Now, Mr. Speaker, complaint is made of the 
     <lb/>evils caused by the existence of two official langu<lb break="no"/>ages in Canada. It is strange that the member for 
     <lb/>North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) should be the first 
     <lb/>one to find out these great inconveniences. All the 
     <lb/>statesmen who have come from England, being 
     <lb/>without prejudices and having official duties to 
     <lb/>perform; those who have been entrusted with the 
     <lb/>charge of representing the Crown of England in 
     <lb/>Canada; all those who have taken the pains to study 
     <lb/>the question, have declared that the French language 
     <lb/>was not an evil but a benefit; that it was one of the most 
     <lb/>effectual guarantees for the loyalty of the French 
     <lb/>population to the Crown of Britain; that as matters 
     <lb/>stood there was a friendly contention between the 
     <lb/>two races to do most for the progress and advance<lb break="no"/>ment of the country. The hon. the Secretary of 
     <lb/>State cited the other day the opinion of Lord Elgin. 
     <lb/>Who does not remember the speech of Lord 
     <lb/>Dufferin, wherein His Excellency affirmed that the 
     <lb/>existence of the English and French races in Canada, 
     <lb/>was one of the greatest means of promoting the 
     <lb/>progress of the country by the emulation which of 
     <lb/>necessity existed between them. If the hon. the 
     <lb/>member for Simcoe had read a little of the history 
     <lb/>of Canada, or at least if he had desired to under<lb break="no"/>stand the lessons derived from it, he would have 
     <lb/>discovered that every time that an attempt had 
     <lb/>been made to deprive one portion of the population 
     <lb/>of its rights and privileges guaranteed by the 
     <lb/>constitution or by treaties, he would have seen I 
     <lb/>say, that such attempts have been followed by 
     <lb/>discontent, disorders and even by revolutions. It 
     <lb/>is only when the country has been governed 
     <lb/>according to its wishes; when all its rights have 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     causes will produce the same effects. They will 
     <lb/>
     produce the same effects not only in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, but throughout the whole of the Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     for the simple and very natural reason that 
     <lb/>
     if no respect is shown for the rights of 
     <lb/>
     our race in the North-West, we have no longer any 
     <lb/>
     guarantee that they will be respected elsewhere; 
     <lb/>
     and the French population will come to find out 
     <lb/>
     that they must place themselves in a position of 
     <lb/>
     defence against the aggression with which they 
     <lb/>
     will be constantly threatened. This is a condition 
     <lb/>
     of affairs which should not be tolerated. It appears 
     <lb/>
     to me that all the statesmen in this House should 
     <lb/>
     hold out the hand to one another, and come to an 
     <lb/>
     understanding to discourage the schemes of fana<lb break="no"/>tics like the member for Simcoe, who labour to 
     <lb/>
     inflame the population, and to stir up the pre<lb break="no"/>judices of race, in order to hoist themselves into 
     <lb/>
     power, even on the ruins of their country. With 
     <lb/>
     these remarks, Mr. Speaker, I have the honor to 
     <lb/>
     move the following amendment to the amendment 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Davin) :‚Äî 
     <lb/>
            </p>
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
       <p>
     That all the words after the word "Resolved" in the

     <lb/>

                   <persName ref="pers:DENI4">Mr. DENISON</persName>. As the seconder of this Bill, 
     <lb/>
     it is only right that I should place on record my 
     <lb/>
     reasons for the course I intend to take. In ap<lb break="no"/>proaching this subject, I wish to say I have no 
     <lb/>
     feeling against my loyal fellow-subjects of French 
     <lb/>
     origin, or against the French language, and I 
     <lb/>
     would be only too glad if I could speak the French 
     <lb/>
     language well; but I think it is not in the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the North-West Territories, or in the interests 
     <lb/>
     of Canada as a whole, that we should adopt the 
     <lb/>
     French language or continue it in the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territories. If it is decided by this House that it is 
     <lb/>
     wise to have two languages in the North-West, 
     <lb/>
     the question which presents itself is, what other 
     <lb/>
     language shall we choose in addition to English? 
     <lb/>
     Shall we choose French, German, Cree, Icelandic, 
     <lb/>
     or Russian, or any other language. If we take the 
     <lb/>
     population numerically, and adopt the language 
     <lb/>
     of the strongest in that sense, we would have to 
     <lb/>
     adopt, as was suggested by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Bothwell (Mr. Mills), the Cree language. In the 
     <lb/>
     early days up there, the English half-breeds spoke 
     <lb/>
     English and Cree, and the French half-breeds 
     <lb/>
     spoke French and Cree, and the Cree language 
     <lb/>
     was the common language between them all. But, 
     <lb/>
     if we rule that language out, shall we adopt 
     <lb/>
     French or German? I understand that now the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     Germans in the North-West equal, if they do not 
     <lb/>
     exceed the French there, and, if that is not the 
     <lb/>
     case now, I fancy it will not be very many years 
     <lb/>
     before the Germans will far exceed the French 
     <lb/>
     in the North-West. I was in the North-West 
     <lb/>
     twenty years ago, in the year 1870. It was then a 
     <lb/>
     Crown colony, or had been shortly before that. It 
     <lb/>
     was a British Crown colony, governed by the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson Bay Company, by means of a Governor and 
     <lb/>
     a Council. The Hudson Bay Company held that 
     <lb/>
     country from the time when they got their charter 
     <lb/>
     in 1670, until it was bought from them by the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion Government. It has been claimed by some 
     <lb/>
     that that is a French land; in fact Bishop Grandin, 
     <lb/>
     in his letter which we have on the Votes and Pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings of the House, has claimed that it is French 
     <lb/>
     land, he speaks of it as "our land." I cannot see 
     <lb/>
     how he can claim anything of the kind because, as 
     <lb/>
     you all know, it has always been held by the Hudson 
     <lb/>
     Bay Company as a Crown colony under the direct 
     <lb/>
     authority of the British Government from the time 
     <lb/>
     of their charter. I would like to read a few lines 
     <lb/>
     from Hargrave's Red River. On page 87 he says:

     <lb/>And to show further, the interest that was taken in

     <lb/>up troops to Red River colony, through a vast 
     <lb/>wilderness, by the Hudson Bay route up the Nel<lb break="no"/>son River, and by a very long, harassing and 
     <lb/>tedious journey. On page 93 the same author says:

     You will see, Mr. Speaker, by that, the interest 
     <lb/>
     that was taken in the North-West country, by the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government. You will see that there was 
     <lb/>
     no pretence then, that it was in any sense a French 
     <lb/>
     colony, or retained at any time by the French. In 
     <lb/>
     1870, the population was very small, some ten or 
     <lb/>
     eleven thousand, mostly half-breeds. As we know 
     <lb/>
     there is not one representative in the present North-<lb break="yes"/>West Council who speaks the French tongue. I went 
     <lb/>
     over the Canadian PacificRailway line this summer, 
     <lb/>
     and from the time that I entered the Territories to 
     <lb/>
     the day I left, it so happened I did not hear one word 
     <lb/>

     of French spoken. I cannot see that there is any 
     <lb/>
     great cry on the part of the French in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West for a dual language. If it is a good thing for 
     <lb/>
     the French race to have the French language used in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West Territories, it must also be a good 
     <lb/>
     thing for the German race that their language be 
     <lb/>
     spoken there also, because they are growing and 
     <lb/>
     increasing very rapidly. On my return I came 
     <lb/>
     back by the Northern Pacific road, and I am glad to 
     <lb/>
     say that our road is in every respect superior to it, 
     <lb/>
     and is indeed a most magnificent road, and it passes 
     <lb/>
     through a far better country in every respect. In 
     <lb/>
     fact the whole of the Northern Pacific country seems 
     <lb/>
     to be altogether barren, except on the Pacific slope, 
     <lb/>
     where there is some good land. I could see that 
     <lb/>
     the land was all occupied; I could see that our 
     <lb/>
     neighbors have settled pretty nearly all that 
     <lb/>
     country except, perhaps, a small portion on the 
     <lb/>
     Pacific slope. They have occupied all the mountain 
     <lb/>
     lands for pasture, they have occupied all the valleys 
     <lb/>
     good for tillage. As you will remember, not very 
     <lb/>
     long ago when the Oklahoma district was opened for 
     <lb/>
     settlement, it was surrounded on all sides by people 
     <lb/>
     who rushed in so as to be able to get land. That is 
     <lb/>
     conclusive proof, to my mind, that our neighbors to 
     <lb/>
     the south have pretty well overrun all the land 
     <lb/>
     they have, and I think that they are not likely to 
     <lb/>
     have any new territory to throw open unless 
     <lb/>
     they seize more Indian reserves and open them for 
     <lb/>
     settlement. That being the case I have every 
     <lb/>
     ground for saying that there will be a very 
     <lb/>
     large immigration into our own North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territoreis within the next few years. We have 
     <lb/>
     there a great lone land, a land, I suppose, as big 
     <lb/>
     as Europe, without any inhabitants to speak of. 
     <lb/>
     There are very few or no inhabitants in a vast 
     <lb/>
     extent of territory which will be opened for future 
     <lb/>
     settlement. When we think of the large immigra<lb break="no"/>tion that is increasing every year, when we know 
     <lb/>
     that immigration has been pouring into the United 
     <lb/>
     States for years, when we know that that country is 
     <lb/>
     already about filled up, we must become convinced 
     <lb/>
     that the tide of population is sure to turn towards 
     <lb/>
     our own Territories. Now, is this House to say 
     <lb/>
     that we are going to allow these foreign settlers 
     <lb/>
     who come in there, to say what language they shall 
     <lb/>
     speak? I hope not. I think that we should let all 
     <lb/>
     these foreigners who reach our shores under<lb break="no"/>stand that when they set their foot in the 
     <lb/>
     North-West Territories they have got to become 
     <lb/>
     Canadians and speak the language of this conti<lb break="no"/>nent. It has been said that Switzerland is a parallel 
     <lb/>
     case to this Canada of ours, Now, mark you, I am 
     <lb/>
     not referring to Quebec, it is out of the question to 
     <lb/>
     speak about Quebec; I have devoted myself entirely 
     <lb/>
     to the North-West Territories and it has been 
     <lb/>
     suggested that Switzerland is a parallel case. 
     <lb/>
     It is not a parallel case for this reason: In Switzer<lb break="no"/>land they had a dual language from the very 
     <lb/>
     beginning, whereas we have a great lone land empty 
     <lb/>
     now and waiting for settlement. As you know, 
     <lb/>
     Switzerland was peopled from the south by 
     <lb/>
     Italians, from the east by French, from the north 
     <lb/>
     by Germans. They were living in secluded valleys 
     <lb/>
     where they were left undisturbed for a long time, 
     <lb/>
     and when they found they were attacked by a 
     <lb/>
     foreign enemy they combined for common defence. 
     <lb/>
     When I read the history of Switzerland for the 
     <lb/>
     first time, I was surprised to learn what great 
     <lb/>
     dissensions they have had in that country during 
     <lb/>
     several generations, and it has only been when 
     <lb/>
     
   <cb/>
           
     attacked by a common enemy that they combined 
     <lb/>
     and made a common defence. I would like, with 
     <lb/>
     your permission, to read something from Bishop 
     <lb/>
     Grandin's letter. He says:

     <lb/>consecrated by the same constitution, and when the same 
     <lb/>interest exists. So, to be clear, my intention was to say 
     <lb/>that if the Catholics or the French of the other Provinces 
     <lb/>are not treated as they ought to be, I do not see why the 
     <lb/>Protestants and English in the Province of Quebec should 
     <lb/>be treated otherwise. I understand perfectly well the 
     <lb/>responsibility that I take, and I do take it with intention. 
     <lb/>It is not a threat, as I said, but a warning, which I hope 
     <lb/>will be sufficient to prevent the majorities of other Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces from being unjust.'"

     Mr. Mercier? I hope not. I, for one, have no idea 
     <lb/>
     of being influenced by the threats of Mr. Mercier 
     <lb/>
     or his friends. I will take any course in this House

     I choose, ignoring Mr. Mercier and anything he

     when he speaks his remarks have no influence or

     <lb/>
     of the land of my birth, and the land that contains

     Mr. TUPPER. $443 was derived in revenue 
     <lb/>
     for the year ending 30th June last. The entire

     Mr. PERRY asked, Whether the wharfinger at

     Mr. FISET asked, Whether the hon. the Post<lb break="no"/>master General has received the petition which I 
     <lb/>
     forwarded him on behalf of the freeholders of the 
     <lb/>
     Parish of Ste. Ang√®le de M√©rici, asking for a daily

            <p>
     Mr. FISET asked, Whether it is the intention of

     the Government, this year, to take into their

            <p>
     serious consideration the petitions which have been 
     <lb/>
     forwarded to them respecting the railway called 
     <lb/>
     the Matane Branch line ? Whether they propose, 
     <lb/>
     this Session, to grant any subsidy whatever to the 
     <lb/>
     company regularly formed, and which has obtained 
     <lb/>
     a charter from the Legislature of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec for the construction of this branch line ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will take this application and these petitions 
     <lb/>
     applying for subsidies, into their serious considera<lb break="no"/>tion during the present Session.

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. LISTER asked, Whether Colonel Walker 
     <lb/>
     Powell, Adjutant General of Militia, has tendered 
     <lb/>
     his resignation to the Minister of Militia or the 
     <lb/>
     Government at any time during the past five 
     <lb/>
     years ? If so, for what cause ; and on what con<lb break="no"/>ditions did he agree to remain in his present 
     <lb/>
     official position ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir ADOLPHE CARON. In answer to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, I beg to say that the Adjutant General 
     <lb/>
     presented me with a letter, which, upon opening, I 
     <lb/>
     found to be a proposal to resign his office. I re<lb break="no"/>turned it to him, not wishing to accept it, and he 
     <lb/>
     withdrew it without any conditions. 
     <lb/>

     IMPORTATION OF MINING MACHINERY. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. LISTER asked, Whether the Government 
     <lb/>
     has allowed any machinery used in the copper or 
     <lb/>
     nickel mines at Sudbury to be imported free of 
     <lb/>
     duty, or to be used in bond ? Has the importation 
     <lb/>
     into Canada of any mining machinery been per<lb break="no"/>mitted without the payment of duty during the 
     <lb/>
     past five years ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BOWELL. Application was made for the 
     <lb/>
     admission, free of duty, of some machinery that 
     <lb/>
     had been used in the mines of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     for use in the copper and nickel mines at Sudbury, 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, which was conceded by Order in Council. 
     <lb/>
     The British Columbia Government appropriated a 
     <lb/>
     sum of money to purchase machinery for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of erecting reducing works in the Cariboo 
     <lb/>
     district, British Columbia, upon which duty was 
     <lb/>
     paid, and application was made to the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     Government for a refund of said duty as such ma<lb break="no"/>chinery was not manufactured in Canada. That 
     <lb/>
     application was granted. N o refund has been 
     <lb/>
     made, for the reason that it has not yet been shown 
     <lb/>
     to the Department what portion of the machinery 
     <lb/>
     imported is not manufactured in Canada. When 
     <lb/>
     that is done, a refund will be made. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     RAILWAY MAIL CLERKS. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BRIEN asked, Whether it is the intention 
     <lb/>
     of the Government to place mail clerks on the De<lb break="no"/>troit, Lake Erie and Essex Railroad ; and also on 
     <lb/>
     the Leamington and St. Croix Railroad, this Ses<lb break="no"/>sion ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. HAGGART. Mails are not yet carried on 
     <lb/>
     the Detroit, Lake Erie and Essex Railway. 
     <lb/>
     Whether they will be carried or not is at present 
     <lb/>
     under consideration. In answer to the second 
     <lb/>
     question, I beg to say that the mails are carried by 
     <lb/>
     the railway company, and there is no necessity 
     <lb/>
     for a railway mail clerk.
