     <lb/>
     the provision is to exempt them from filing 
     <lb/>
     any patent. Hon. members will under<lb break="no"/>stand that by the terms of their Act the

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. Mr. Speaker. I do not 
     <lb/>
     rise to object to anything the Bill contains, 
     <lb/>
     but, for the purpose of asking the House 
     <lb/>
     to add to the measure an amendment which, 
     <lb/>
     I think, on reflection and consideration, the 
     <lb/>
     House will believe to be in the public in 
     <lb/>
     terest. In 1891 we conferred upon the Leg<lb break="no"/>islative Assembly of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories almost complete power, power almost 
     <lb/>
     as full as that which the provincial bodies 
     <lb/>
     enjoy under the scheme of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, by which a certain portion 
     <lb/>
     of legislative authority is vested in the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, while a certain portion of author<lb break="no"/>ity is retained by this Parliament. But we 
     <lb/>
     did not confer on them any additional au<lb break="no"/>thority to that they already enjoyed in the 
     <lb/>
     matter of education, and it is in regard to 
     <lb/>
     that subject I propose to draw the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the House this evening. It cannot too 
     <lb/>
     firmly be kept in mind that, according to 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of the distribution of legislative 
     <lb/>
     authority, the subject of education was de<lb break="no"/>clared to be a matter of local concern, and, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, properly belonging to the pro<lb break="no"/>vince; and my argument will be that, as 
     <lb/>
     we have conferred upon the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Assembly of' the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     nearly all the power and authority which 
     <lb/>
     have been conferred upon the provinces, 
     <lb/>
     this power or right to deal with the matter 
     <lb/>
     of education should not be withheld. Let 
     <lb/>
     me, for a moment. draw the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House to the provisions of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories Act of 1891. By that Act 
     <lb/>
     it was determined that the Legislative As<lb break="no"/>sembly " shall, subject to the provisions of 
     <lb/>
     this Act, and of any other Act of the Par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada at any time in force in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories, have power to make ordi<lb break="no"/>nances for the government of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     in relation to the class of subject next here<lb break="no"/>unto mentioned, that is to say." I want to 
     <lb/>
     compare that Act, section by section with 
     <lb/>

     the authority which the provinces possess 
     <lb/>
     under the British North America. Act. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place, as no. constitution, properly 
     <lb/>
     so-called. was given to the Territories, so, of' 
     <lb/>
     course, there is no power possessed by them 
     <lb/>
     to amend the constitution. The first author<lb break="no"/>ity given to a province is to amend its own 
     <lb/>
     constitution, and in that regard the Leg<lb break="no"/>islature of a province has wider powers 
     <lb/>
     than is possessed by this Parliament, be<lb break="no"/>cause this Parliament has not the power to 
     <lb/>
     amend its own constitution. The next 
     <lb/>
     power which is conferred by the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act is " taxation within the 
     <lb/>
     province in order to raise a revenue for 
     <lb/>
     provincial purposes." Upon the Territories 
     <lb/>
     we conferred power of direct taxation with<lb break="no"/>in the Territories in order to raise a re<lb break="no"/>venue for territorial or municipal or local 
     <lb/>
     purposes. So that the great sovereign 
     <lb/>
     power, the power of taxation, the power 
     <lb/>
     of raising money in that way was con<lb break="no"/>ferred upon the Legislative Assembly of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories. Then "the borrowing of 
     <lb/>
     money on the sole credit of the province " 
     <lb/>
     was withheld, because, as I have already 
     <lb/>
     had occasion to say with respect to amend<lb break="no"/>ing the constitution, there being no pro<lb break="no"/>vince, the power to borrow money was very 
     <lb/>
     reasonably and very properly withheld. 
     <lb/>
     The next is, "the establishment and tenure 
     <lb/>
     of provincial offices and the appointment 
     <lb/>
     and payment of provincial ofllcers." We gave 
     <lb/>
     to the Territories "the establishment and 
     <lb/>
     tenure of territorial oflices, and the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment and payment of territorial oflicers, 
     <lb/>
     out of the territorial revenue." Then, the 
     <lb/>
    management and sale of the public lands 
     <lb/>belonging to the province, and of the timber 
     <lb/>and wood thereupon " are withheld, as in the 
     <lb/>province of Manitoba. We give, however, 
     <lb/>" the establishment, maintenance, and man<lb break="no"/>agement of prisons in and for the province," 
     <lb/>and "municipal institutions in the terri<lb break="no"/>tories," while we withhold the " establish<lb break="no"/>ment, maintenance, and management of 
     <lb/>hospitals." We give the power to raise 
     <lb/>a revenue by " shop, saloon, tavern, auc<lb break="no"/>tioneer, and other licenses." We confer 
     <lb/>power with respect to "local works and un<lb break="no"/>dertakings, other than such as are of the 
     <lb/>following classes,"—these are not quite the 
     <lb/>same as apply to a province, but are very 
     <lb/>nearly so. We confer power with respect 
     <lb/>to " solemnization of marriage in the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces," and also in the Territories. We 
     <lb/>confer power " with respect to property and 
     <lb/>civil rights," and " with respect to the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of justice, including the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, maintenance, and organization of 
     <lb/>provincial courts, both of civil and of crim<lb break="no"/>inal jurisdiction, and including procedure 
     <lb/>in civil matters in these courts ; but not the 
     <lb/>power of appointing any judicial oficers." 
     <lb/>We give authority for enforcing any law 
     <lb/>to punish " by fine, penalty or imprisonment 
     <lb/>for enforcing any law of the province made 
     <lb/>in relation to any matter coming within 
     <lb/>any of the classes of subjects enumerated 
     <lb/>
   
   
            <cb/>
       
       
     in the section " ; also, " generally matters of 
     <lb/>
     a merely local or private nature in the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories." So it will be seen that, with very 
     <lb/>
     few exceptions, and some of those excep<lb break="no"/>tions incident to the fact that autonomy has 
     <lb/>
     not yet been fully conferred on the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, the same power as the Territories 
     <lb/>
     would have if they were a province, has 
     <lb/>
     been substantially conferred upon the legis<lb break="no"/>lative body which has power to make ordi<lb break="no"/>nances in those Territories. With respect 
     <lb/>
     to education, we made no change. We 
     <lb/>
     left the law with respect to that subject as 
     <lb/>
     it has been since 1875, and that law is a 
     <lb/>
     most extraordinary one. unprecedented, so 
     <lb/>
     far as I know, and one which, I think, ought 
     <lb/>
     no longer to remain in force in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. It is compulsory as to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. It enacts that there shall be separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. Substantially, its provision is that 
     <lb/>
     whatever the majority may be in any local<lb break="no"/>ity, it may establish a school known as a 
     <lb/>
     public school, and the minority in that 
     <lb/>
     locality may establish a separate school. 
     <lb/>
     So that there may be in every locality where 
     <lb/>
     there are Protestants and Catholics the two 
     <lb/>
     school systems. The majority have the right 
     <lb/>
     to call theirs a public school, the minority 
     <lb/>
     have the right to establish what is called a 
     <lb/>
     separate school, and it becomes a separate 
     <lb/>
     school in that locality, although it may not 
     <lb/>
     be a separate school in any other locality. 
     <lb/>
     The exact provision of the clause reads: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     But such ordinance shall always provide that the 
     <lb/>
     majority of ratepayers of any district, may estab<lb break="no"/>lish such schools there as they think fit, and make 
     <lb/>
     the necessary assessment and collect-ion of rates 
     <lb/>
     therefor; and also that the minority of the rate<lb break="no"/>payers therein, whether Protestants or Roman

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That is a provision which has been the law 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     ever since 1875. Now, Sir, let me draw 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the House to the present 
     <lb/>
     position of the North-west Territories so far 
     <lb/>
     as population is concerned. The population 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories, according to the last cen<lb break="no"/>sus, is 66,799, of whom 13,008 are Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics, or not 20 per cent.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. LaRIVIERE</persName>. How many Indians are 
     <lb/>
     included in the total population ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. I do not think the 
     <lb/>
     Indians are included in this 66,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. LaRIVIERE</persName>. Well, I do.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. I may be wrong about 
     <lb/>
     that. In British Columbia there are 20,000

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. So that out of the 20.- <lb/>000 Catholics the larger proportion are In<lb break="no"/>dians. according to the information the hon.<lb/>gentleman gives me, and therefore my<lb/>figures will be understood in that sense.<lb/>Then in Manitoba there are 152,000 popula<lb break="no"/>tion. of whom 20,000 are Roman Catholics.<lb/>or 13 per cent. In New Brunswick, out of  <lb/>a population of 321,000, there are 115,000<lb/>Roman Catholics, or 36 per cent. In Nova  <lb/>Scotia there are 122.000 Roman Catholics<lb/>out of a population of 454,000. or 27 per<lb/>cent of Roman Catholics. In Prince Edward <lb/>Island the proportion of Roman Catholics<lb/>seems still larger. there being 47.000 out of<lb/>a population of 109,000. That is the pro- <lb/>portion of Roman Catholics in these various<lb/>provinces. But it must be remembered that in<lb/>the province of British Columbia and Prince<lb/> Edward Island and New Brunswick there is<lb/>no separate school system. The absolute un<lb break="no"/>limited control of education is vested there in<lb/>the Provincial Legislatures. and it is so vest<lb break="no"/>ed because, according to the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation that being a matter of local con<lb break="no"/>cern, was deemed to be one proper to be<lb/>left to the local authorities. We know that  <lb/>In Ontario there was a separate school <lb/>system at the time of Confederation, and<lb/>that it was stipulated on the part of those<lb/>representing the province of Quebec. as I<lb/>understand it. that that system of separate<lb/>schools—which in fact  had  been  imposed <lb/>upon the province of Ontario by a majority<lb/>of the representatives from the sister pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, when they were united as<lb/>Canada—that that system should be per<lb break="no"/>petuated, and as a correlative. it was en- <lb/>acted that the same system existing for the<lb/>benefit of the Roman Catholics in Ontario<lb/>should be established for the benefit of the<lb/>Protestant minority in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec. So far as these two provinces are  <lb/>concerned, a special arrangement was en<lb break="no"/>tered into as a part of the terms upon which<lb/>Confederation was established ; but with<lb/>regard to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia<lb/>they were left free to deal with the matter<lb/>of education as to them seemed fit. When <lb/>Prince Edward Island was afterwards ad<lb break="no"/>mitted to the Union, the authority respect<lb break="no"/>ing education was left to the Local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature in Prince Edward Island. and when<lb/>British Columbia was brought in, the autho<lb break="no"/>rity to deal with education unfettered was<lb/>left to that province, and when we conferred<lb/>a constitution upon Manitoba we conferred<lb/>it in the manner which is perfectly familiar<lb/>now to the House. and which is expounded to<lb/>be practically. that Manitoba was to have<lb/>unlimited control in the matter of schools.<lb/>Now. Sir, why under these circumstances<lb/>should we fail to trust. or be afraid to trust,<lb/>the people of the North-west Territories with<lb/>
      
      <cb/>
               
     full and complete power in matters of edu<lb break="no"/>cation ? In the case of almost every other<lb/>power which it is possible to confer upon<lb/>the Territories, we have though them <lb/>worthy of our confidence. and I want to <lb/>know why it is that we think them un<lb break="no"/>worthy of dealing with this matter of edu<lb break="no"/>cation ? I am not here to argue one way<lb/>or the other with reference to separate <lb/>schools. My own view on the subject is  <lb/>perfectly well known.  I would prefer that  <lb/>there should not be separate schools. I<lb/>would prefer to see all the children of the land<lb/>brought up without being divided into<lb/>hostile camps on the matter of religion ; but<lb/>I am quite free to say that I would not in<lb break="no"/>terfere with any of the provinces, or with<lb/>the laws or regulations of any province.<lb/>that in their wisdom think proper to adopt<lb/>separate schools. It is a matter with  <lb/>which this Parliament ought to have no con<lb break="no"/>cern. The question here is : why should we <lb/>insist, because in 1875,  when there was <lb/>hardly any population in the Territories at<lb/>all. and when we governed them from here<lb/>almost absolutely, why should we now when<lb/>we have though proper to give them power<lb/>and authority in matters of legislation ?<lb/>Why should we in this particular matter of<lb/>schools withhold from them the full and<lb/>complete power which I submit is theirs as<lb/>of right ? I do not propose to occupy the<lb/>time of the House with anything more than<lb/>a brief statement—because the subject is<lb/>pretty well known to us all— a brief state<lb break="no"/>ment of the scope and object of my amend<lb break="no"/>ment. I have tried for many years past : in <lb/>1893. in 1893 and during this session. to<lb/>have this change made. I did not try be<lb break="no"/>fore. because I felt it was a matter so local<lb/>in its nature that until invoked by the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories to move in the matter, I did not take<lb/>upon myself to bring the matter to the notice<lb/>of this House.    But in the year 1890, I  <lb/>think, the Assembly of the Territories by a <lb/>practically unanimous vote, petitioned this<lb/>Parliament to do away with this clause with<lb/>reference to education, and to give them <lb/>unlimited power to deal with it. and since <lb/>that time. from session to session. whenever<lb/>the Bill has been brought up, petition after<lb/>petition has been presented to this House.<lb/>So far as I know. no petition has been pre<lb break="no"/>sented against that power to deal with<lb/>education being conferred. We have there<lb break="no"/>fore the request of those who care locally in<lb break="no"/>terested that they should have this authority.<lb/>and having that request from them. there<lb/>should be some good reason for withholding<lb/>it.  During the two last sessions the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment introduced a Bill dealing with the<lb/>North-west Territories, and in neither of <lb/>thse Bills did the Government propose to<lb/>deal with question of schools. and <lb/>upon my moving in the matter at the<lb/>close of the session. the Government thought<lb/>proper to withdraw the Bill without permit<lb break="no"/>ting a discussion on the subject. This year<lb/>the Government have again introduced their<lb/>measure : and if I had known that they in<lb break="no"/>

     tended to introduce it and pass it through 
     <lb/>
     the House I should not have troubled the 
     <lb/>
     House by the introduction of a Bill on 
     <lb/>
     the subject ; because it seems to me that it 
     <lb/>
     is a matter that the Government ought to 
     <lb/>
     have dealt with, and if the Government did 
     <lb/>
     not think fit to deal with it, the proper time 
     <lb/>
     to move an amendment was the time I am 
     <lb/>
     now taking, when the Government measure 
     <lb/>
     for enlarging to some extent the power and 
     <lb/>
     authority of the Legislative Assembly is 
     <lb/>
     under the consideration of the House. Now, 
     <lb/>
     I want to draw the attention of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friends to a very important. provision. By 
     <lb/>
     this legislation we are really rivetting upon 
     <lb/>
     the people of the North-west the separate 
     <lb/>
     school system for all time. One of the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the constitution with regard to 
     <lb/>
     separate schools—a provision which was ob<lb break="no"/>served with reference to New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     and Nova Scotia, and, if my memory serves 
     <lb/>
     me rightly, also with reference to Prince 
     <lb/>
     Ed ward Island and British Columbia—was 
     <lb/>
     that conferring full power on the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Legislatures with reference to education. 
     <lb/>
     with this proviso : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     If and for each province the Legislature may 
     <lb/>
     exclusively make laws in relation to education 
     <lb/>
     subject and according to the following provisions. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     This is not merely of application to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Ontario and Quebec. but is of uni<lb break="no"/>versal application, so far as it is embodied 
     <lb/>
     and may be embodied, and probably would 
     <lb/>
     be embodied, in any constitution given to 
     <lb/>
     any province. Subsection 1 provides: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect 
     <lb/>
     any right or privilege with respect to denomina<lb break="no"/>tional schools which any class of persons have by

     Now, we insist by the clause of the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875, which has been included in the various 
     <lb/>
     consolidations of the legislative powers of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, which have been 
     <lb/>
     made from time to time, that they shall have 
     <lb/>
     separate schools: and if we continue insist<lb break="no"/>ing that that system shall prevail up to the 
     <lb/>
     time we create provinces in the North-west. 
     <lb/>
     then the application of this clause of the first 
     <lb/>
     subsection of section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, to which I have referred, rivets 
     <lb/>
     for all time upon the new provinces the 
     <lb/>
     system of separate schools. Create a pro<lb break="no"/>vince there now, enact the usual clauses of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act. and the result 
     <lb/>
     will be that in the new province those who 
     <lb/>
     have enjoyed what is spoken of as a right or 
     <lb/>
     privilege with respect to denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools would be able to say: The consti<lb break="no"/>tution given to this province by the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     Parliament does not permit any interference 
     <lb/>
     with any right or privilege which we en<lb break="no"/>joyed prior to the time of the creation of 
     <lb/>
     this province. That, I think. is a. most im<lb break="no"/>portant consideration. It has been urged, 
     <lb/>
     and I have heard it argued : Why not allow 
     <lb/>
     this matter to remain until the new province. 
     <lb/>
     is created ? Why interfere with the matter 
     <lb/>
     so long as there are mere territories ? It 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
        
        
     will be quite time enough, when we are 
     <lb/>
     creating provinces in the North-west, to give 
     <lb/>
     them full power in school matters. Well, 
     <lb/>
     those who argue in that way will, I think. 
     <lb/>
     find it very difficult to contend that the 
     <lb/>
     population of the North-west are not as com<lb break="no"/>petent as any other population throughout 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion to legislate in regard to educa<lb break="no"/>tional matters. But even if they were not, 
     <lb/>
     we ought to leave it to them to select the 
     <lb/>
     system of education which they prefer, so 
     <lb/>
     that they should not be conducted against 
     <lb/>
     their will by the clause of the Act to which 
     <lb/>
     I have referred. Nor is it altogether an 
     <lb/>
     unimportant matter in another sense. In a 
     <lb/>
     sparsely-settled population, such as you have 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west, could there be anything 
     <lb/>
     more suicidal and foolish than the division 
     <lb/>
     of the school population into two separate 
     <lb/>
     bodies ? It is difficult enough, no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     to educate the children in the North-west, 
     <lb/>
     even with one school system. But for the 
     <lb/>
     people to divide their resources and to frit<lb break="no"/>ter away their means in the establishment 
     <lb/>
     and perpetuation of two systems. does ap<lb break="no"/>pear to me to be the greatest possible folly. 
     <lb/>
     and probably more so there than in any 
     <lb/>
     other part of the Dominion. Now, what is 
     <lb/>
     the position of affairs there at the present 
     <lb/>
     time ? And when I say the present time 
     <lb/>
     I refer to 1891, the last year for which I 
     <lb/>
     have been able to get a report on educational 
     <lb/>
     matters in the library—I do not, suppose 
     <lb/>
     there has been any important change since 
     <lb/>
     then as to the number and the division of 
     <lb/>
     the schools. According to this report there 
     <lb/>
     were 210 Protestant public schools and 34 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic public schools: and when I 
     <lb/>
     speak of the public school, it is the school of 
     <lb/>
     the majority. In the North-west, unlike the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario, there is not one. set of 
     <lb/>
     public schools and another set of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools; but there may be a Protestant 
     <lb/>
     public school in one locality, and a Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic public school in the adjoining local<lb break="no"/>ity, and the school of the minority will be 
     <lb/>
     the separate school, whatever it. may be. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I cannot find that there are in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west any separate schools of Protest<lb break="no"/>ants; however. my hon. friends who come 
     <lb/>
     from the Territories will be able to correct 
     <lb/>
     me on that point. The Protestants have not 
     <lb/>
     availed themselves of their privilege of estab<lb break="no"/>lishing separate schools, and the result is 
     <lb/>
     that either their children have to so without 
     <lb/>
     schooling or have to attend the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic schools in places where the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics are in the majority. But there are 
     <lb/>
     eleven Roman Catholic separate schools: 
     <lb/>
     and I think the House will be astounded to 
     <lb/>
     learn the cost at which these schools are 
     <lb/>
     maintained. Now, at Lacomb, which I be<lb break="no"/>lieve is the term used by the separate school 
     <lb/>
     party for Calgary, if I am correctly inform<lb break="no"/>ed, the daily average attendance at the sepa<lb break="no"/>rate school is 94. and the cost per pupil, 
     <lb/>
     $29.53. In the Protestant public school the 
     <lb/>
     average attendance is 159, and the cost per 
     <lb/>
     pupil, $18.65. So that for the separate school 
     <lb/>
     the cost per pupil is $10.88 more than for 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <pb n="6087" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06087.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">6088</fw>
        
        
     the public school. No doubt that is owing to 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the public school is the larger ; 
     <lb/>
     but join these two schools together, and the 
     <lb/>
     cost of both would be materially reduced. 
     <lb/>
     And that is by no means the worst example 
     <lb/>
     of division. In Prince Albert the average 
     <lb/>
     attendance in the Protestant public school 
     <lb/>
     is 78, and the average cost per pupil, $33.55 : 
     <lb/>
     the separate school has an average attend<lb break="no"/>ance of 11, with a cost of $48.58, or $15.03 
     <lb/>
     per pupil more in the separate 
     <lb/>
     school than in the public school. 
     <lb/>
     Well, these are the places that I am able 
     <lb/>
     to trace and compare the public school sys<lb break="no"/>tem with the separate school system. be<lb break="no"/>cause the names are not identical, and I 
     <lb/>
     have not been able to trace the others and 
     <lb/>
     to make any comparison with them. But 
     <lb/>
     let me give the House the statement of 
     <lb/>
     one or two schools here. Catholic separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. At the school called St. Andrew's 
     <lb/>
     —I do not know where it is—the average 
     <lb/>
     attendance is nine and the average cost 
     <lb/>
     $56.25 per pupil. At the school called St. 
     <lb/>
     Peter's the average attendance is seven and 
     <lb/>
     the cost per pupil $58.96.

     to draw the attention of the. House to the

     cost in Ontario of the schools. In Ontario 
     <lb/>
     the cost per pupil is $8.40. I think it is only

     fair to tell the House that I understand 
     <lb/>
     that calculation has been made, not upon 
     <lb/>
     the average attendance, but upon the aver<lb break="no"/>age number; but working it out upon the 
     <lb/>
     average attendance, the cost would not be 
     <lb/>
     more than $14 or $15 per pupil. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. MASSON</persName>. Is that the provincial cost

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Everything—the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative grant, the municipal School grants, and 
     <lb/>
     assessments, the clergy reserve fund, and 
     <lb/>
     everything. The cost is put down for 1892 
     <lb/>
     at $8.40 per pupil, but I understand that is

     hon. friend (Mr. Ferguson) wanted to know 
     <lb/>
     what the cost of the public schools is com<lb break="no"/>pared with the cost of separate schools.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERG4">Mr. FERGUSON</persName>. Pardon me, I want the 
     <lb/>
     cost of the public Catholic schools and the 
     <lb/>
     cost of the public Protestant schools.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. The public schools or 
     <lb/>
     each denomination. At Moose Jaw the cost 
     <lb/>
     is $11 per pupil ; at Qu'Appelle, $16.76.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERG4">Mr. FERGUSON</persName>. Pardon me again. Can 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman give it to us territorially

            <p>

     <lb/>
     treat that as he pleases. I give it to him 
     <lb/>
     just as 1 find it here. It is $11 or perhaps 
     <lb/>
     $14. as the figures are not very clear. I

     find another school at Regina. is $33. then I 
     <lb/>
     find a school at $21, and one at $17, and 
     <lb/>
     running down the column I find one as low 
     <lb/>
     as $6.64. and another as high as $35. where 
     <lb/>
     the attendance is twelve. I think probably 
     <lb/>
     that is the highest in the list.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERG4">Mr. FERGUSON</persName>. Is that a Protestant

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. I am speaking of Pro<lb break="no"/>testant schools now.

     <persName ref="pers:FERG4">Mr. FERGUSON</persName>. They are getting the

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. I was speaking of the 
     <lb/>
     highest among the Protestant schools. My 
     <lb/>
    hon. friend is assuming the part of an ad<lb break="no"/>vocate before he learns the facts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERG4">Mr. FERGUSON</persName>. We will get the facts 
     <lb/>
     before you sum up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. Yes. Take the other 
     <lb/>
     schools—public Catholic schools. The first 
     <lb/>
     one shows a cost of $55.75 per pupil. The 
     <lb/>
     school at Saskatchewan costs $46.76 per 
     <lb/>
     pupil. The school at St. Albert costs $21.21 
     <lb/>
     per pupil. That at St. Leon $56 per pupil, 
     <lb/>
     and that at St. Laurent $64.28. There is no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that the average cost of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic public schools was larger a good 
     <lb/>
     deal than that of the Protestants. No doubt 
     <lb/>
     about that, but I do not think that is a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of comparison so much as the compari<lb break="no"/>son between public schools and separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. Where we find both these in the 
     <lb/>
     one locality, we find the difference in cost, 
     <lb/>
     which I have given the House, and that 
     <lb/>
     difference is enormously in favour of the 
     <lb/>
     public school system, and we can easily con<lb break="no"/>clude that if there were but one school 
     <lb/>
     system instead of two, the cost would be 
     <lb/>
     proportionately less. Now the total amount 
     <lb/>
     spent by this Parliament in school matters 
     <lb/>
     is over $100,000, so that the question appeals 
     <lb/>
     'to us from the economic point of view. 
     <lb/>
     $101,696 is the total amount we have granted 
     <lb/>
     apparently for educational purposes in the 
     <lb/>

     North-west, and the House can judge, from<lb/>the statement I have given, whether the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure is a wise or foolish one. Of that ex<lb break="no"/>penditure, the amount spent on the Protestant 
     <lb/>schools is 73.20 per cent, and on the Catho<lb break="no"/>lic 26.28 per cent, both public and separate. 
     <lb/>Therefore my conclusion is that whatever 
     <lb/>way you look at it, this question—and I de<lb break="no"/>sire not to raise any irritation or excite any 
     <lb/>passions, but simply that the matter should 
     <lb/>be discussed on its merits—whatever way 
     <lb/>we look at it, I am unable to see or ap<lb break="no"/>preciate any argument or reason why we 
     <lb/>should not rid ourselves of this question from 
     <lb/>Dominion politics, and hand the dealing 
     <lb/>with education to where it properly belongs. 
     <lb/>I therefore beg to move an amendment, 
     <lb/>which will carry out that provision. I pro<lb break="no"/>pose to make the amendment fit in with the 
     <lb/>Bill which we are now asked to read a third 
     <lb/>time. The first provision of that Bill is as 
     <lb/>follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
               3. Sub-paragraph (<hi rendition="simple:italic">h</hi>) of paragraph seven of 
     <lb/>
     subsection one of the section substituted by sec<lb break="no"/>tion six of chapter twenty-two of 1891, for section 
     <lb/>
     thirteen of The North-west Territories Act, is here<lb break="no"/>by repealed and the following substituted there<lb break="no"/>for :-—Railway Companies, (not including tram<lb break="no"/>way and street railway companies) and steam<lb break="no"/>boats, canal, transportation,

     irrigation companies.

            </p></quote>
            
            
            <p>That is the additional power conferred upon<lb/>the Territories by this section, one of the<lb/>powers that we withheld from the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories having been the incorporation of rail<lb break="no"/>way, steamboat, canal and transportation<lb/>companies, and the effect of this amend<lb break="no"/>ment will be that the Territories will have<lb/>power to incorporate tramways and street<lb/>railway companies.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. HUGHES</persName>. In rising to offer an am<lb break="no"/>endment, I need not say, Sir, that I do so <lb/>fully recognizing the position of the House as<lb/>to this question. We have had this question<lb/>before us for some years. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who has just taken his seat (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) has on more than one occasion given<lb/>notice of his intention to move amendments<lb/>
          
          
            <cb/>
           
           
     to this North-west Territories Act. But,<lb/>until the present time, the House has never 
     <lb/>
     been favoured with the opportunity of hear<lb break="no"/>ing the hon. gentleman's views or his argu<lb break="no"/>ments in support of them. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has rightly stated that two years ago 
     <lb/>he gave notice of a motion to bring in a 
     <lb/>Bill abolishing the control of this House in 
     <lb/>relation to separate schools in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, to amend the Act in the 
     <lb/>manner he now proposes to do. You may 
     <lb/> remember, however, Mr. Speaker, during the 
     <lb/> whole session, those of us who were anxious 
     <lb/>to take part in the discussion of that ques<lb break="no"/>tion had to sit here awaiting the conveni<lb break="no"/>ence of the hon. gentlemen, until finally 
     <lb/> we were very much surprised one evening 
     <lb/>to have the House called together to deal 
     <lb/>with the subject. the only warning that 
     <lb/>we were to have the question under dis<lb break="no"/>cussion being the simple announcement, <lb/>"call in the members." It had been my 
     <lb/>intention on that occasion, had the opportu<lb break="no"/>nity been afforded, to move an amendment<lb/>in the line I now propose. But, as I said,<lb/>no opportunity was afforded me ; the mem<lb break="no"/>bers were obliged to vote one way or the<lb/>other on the question, and that without<lb/>warning. We also remember, Sir, how last<lb/>session we were called upon day after day<lb/>to be in our places in the House in antici<lb break="no"/>pation and expectation of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man from North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy)<lb/>bringing on his motion. But the matter was<lb/>allowed to drift until the close of the session<lb/>and nothing was done. Then, on that oc<lb break="no"/>casion, as on the present, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man showed but little interest in the affairs<lb/>of the House, his attendance being<lb/>evidently with the desire of getting in<lb/>his motion in the closing hours of the<lb/>session, when it could not be discussed, and<lb/>when, as now, there would be a very small<lb/>House to discuss the question. I need not<lb/>comment further—it is not proper I should— 
     <lb/>than to say that is the seeming object in 
     <lb/>bringing in his motion at the time and in 
     <lb/>the manner he does. Ample opportunity has 
     <lb/>been afforded this session, as in former 
     <lb/>sessions, to have this matter brought up 
     <lb/>and discussed calmly and fully when the 
     <lb/>members would not be hurried, as at the 
     <lb/>present time, when a member occupying 
     <lb/>the time of the House even for a few minutes 
     <lb/>is subject to the odium in the minds of his 
     <lb/>comrades, who wish to bring the session to 
     <lb/>a close, of occupying time unnecessarily. 
     <lb/>But, that aside, the proposition of the hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman is to relegate to the Territories 
     <lb/>control in matters of education. Now, Sir, 
     <lb/>from the view-point on which I stand, that 
     <lb/>seems an objectionable proposal. So far 
     <lb/>as secular education is concerned, I go as 
     <lb/>far as the hon. gentleman does, possibly I 
     <lb/>go further than he does, in relegating that 
     <lb/>to the control of the Territories. But, in 
     <lb/>regard to theological education in the 
     <lb/>public schools, when the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>proposes to hand that over to the Territorial 
     <lb/>Legislature, I certainly differ from him, and 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <pb n="6091" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06091.jpg"/>

  I shall endeavour in as brief a manner as<lb/>possible to give my views on these points.<lb/>I shall outline briefly my reasons for differ<lb break="no"/>ing from the hon. gentleman, reasons jotted<lb/>down, as his arguments were given in the<lb/>course of the address to which we have just<lb/>listened. In the first place, if the hon.<lb/>member's motion is passed, we recognize as<lb/>he does, the right of those Territories to<lb/>establish separate schools. That right I<lb/>deny as being entirely subversive of the<lb/>principles of responsible Government, and<lb/>good Government in any form. He also<lb/>leaves it an open question with the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories and provinces arising therefrom<lb/>to establish these schools. I shall en<lb break="no"/>deavour, as I proceed, to show that this<lb/>idea is fallacious. If the Territories, follow<lb break="no"/>ing out the views of the hon. gentleman,<lb/>were given this control of education, and<lb/>at the time of their establishment as pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, by their own act, only one system of<lb/>public schools was recognized, the obnoxi<lb break="no"/>ous principle of separate schools might still<lb/>find root in the North-west Territories as in<lb/>the province of New Brunswick and in the<lb/>province of Nova Scotia to-day. Both of<lb/>these provinces have asserted the principle<lb/>of public schools, and yet, Sir, you will find<lb/>that virturally they have their separate<lb/>schools, theological institutions, in the city of<lb/>St. John, Moncton and other parts through<lb break="no"/>out the province. We find in the city of St.<lb/>John that the Roman Catholic convents are<lb/>leased to the public school board of that<lb/>place—I know whereof I speak. and this is<lb/>true not only of St. John, but of other places<lb/>in the Maritime Provinces—and the Sisters<lb/>and Brothers are hired, and are regularly on<lb/>the staff of the public schools as teachers.<lb/>Thus, though in name there are no separate<lb/>schools, the principle of separate schools<lb/>is established in the province of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. And there is an agitation springing<lb/>up now causing dissension among the people.<lb/>an agitation which, I fear, will go a long<lb/>way toward creating unrest throughout this<lb/>country. More than that, Sir, the policy of<lb/>the hon. gentleman, if adopted, would allow<lb/>of the taxes collected from the people being<lb/>used for theological purposes, and that, of<lb/>course, I object to. The hon. gentleman re<lb break="no"/>cognizes that theological or sectarian teach<lb break="no"/>ing is part of national education, and that<lb/>is a point in which I would differ from him.<lb/>I hold that our object should be the total<lb/>severance of theological teaching from our<lb/>national system of education. I think no<lb/>one will gainsay this point—that it is the<lb/>duty of the state to recognize how the citizens<lb/>of this country shall be trained. In declar<lb break="no"/>ing for a Dominion franchise—whatever the<lb/>faults may be found in the details—we have<lb/>declared our right to say that the citizen in<lb/>Nova Scotia shall stand before the country<lb/>on the same footing as the citizen in British<lb/>Columbia or any other part of the Dominion.<lb/>We have asserted that we have the right as<lb/>a nation to lay down the rules that guide<lb/>our citizenship. Now, no doubt, in the old<lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
           
           
     days, the church controlled state affairs,<lb/>and it remained part and parcel of the state<lb/>machinery, and the only education one could<lb/>find was the little smattering in the church.<lb/>There were scarcely any schools except for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of training people for the cleri<lb break="no"/>cal profession and a few state functions, 
     <lb/>
     and education was very limited. The church 
     <lb/>
     in those days controlled the whole machin<lb break="no"/>ery of education, and the theological part 
     <lb/>
     of education was considered, as it is even 
     <lb/>
     down to our own day, to be by all odds 
     <lb/>
     the most important. But times are changed, 
     <lb/>
     and we now find that the people of the 
     <lb/>
     nation recognize that the children of the 
     <lb/>
     land should be educated, not only in mat<lb break="no"/>ters of church form, but in various other 
     <lb/>
     interests of life. As time advanced, we 
     <lb/>
     find a little reading, writing and arithmetic 
     <lb/>
     taught in the schools, and there education 
     <lb/>
     ended. Now, however, we find that not 
     <lb/>
     only are children trained intellectually, but 
     <lb/>
     that attention is given to sanitary mat<lb break="no"/>ters, and they are trained in the broad poli<lb break="no"/>tical principles of the nation, and taught 
     <lb/>
     the municipal, provincial and national in<lb break="no"/>stitutions under which we live. We even 
     <lb/>
     go further and admit that it is necessary 
     <lb/>
     to train them morally or ethically, that 
     <lb/>
     they may be able to distinguish between 
     <lb/>
     right and wrong , and that each may know 
     <lb/>
     his duty towards his fellow men. This, in 
     <lb/>
     short, is the difference in the aim of the 
     <lb/>
     education of to-day, and the aim of the 
     <lb/>
     education of a number of years ago. But 
     <lb/>
     that the state should tax the people for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of inculcating any theological 
     <lb/>
     creed or dogma, is something that I am 
     <lb/>
    satisfied is, if not of the past, will be of 
     <lb/>the past in a very few years, in this land. 
     <lb/>Now, in dealing with this matter of separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools in Canada, we find ourselves 
     <lb/>confronted not only with the question of 
     <lb/>religion, but also with the question of race; 
     <lb/>and here I may be permitted to say a word 
     <lb/>on this latter point. Some of our French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Canadian fellow-citizens take it as a per<lb break="no"/>sonal attack upon their rights when any 
     <lb/>opposition is offered to separate schools. 
     <lb/>Now, it is not long since I had the pleasure 
     <lb/>of reading a report. I think it was of the 
     <lb/>Roman Catholic Committee of the Council 
     <lb/>of Public Instruction of the province of 
     <lb/>Quebec, where the very best men in that 
     <lb/>province demanded that the theological con<lb break="no"/>trol of the schools should be abolished, 
     <lb/>and that the teachers should be trained just 
     <lb/>as they are in other provinces of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion ; that the clerical control so long exer<lb break="no"/>cised over the schools there, should be, if 
     <lb/>not entirely abolished, at least largely abol<lb break="no"/>ished. However, I wish to touch briefly on 
     <lb/>this question of French nationality. It is 
     <lb/>a myth. Our French-Canadian fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>citizens are of the same race and lineage 
     <lb/>as are those of British origin. France was 
     <lb/>originally settled by the Celtic race, so were 
     <lb/>the British Islands : in other words, we 
     <lb/>find one the Britannia major and the other 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <pb n="6093" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06093.jpg"/>

     Britannia minor. Then we find France 
     <lb/>
     overrun by the Teutonic races ; the Francs, 
     <lb/>
     the Goths, Burgundians and. other peoples 
     <lb/>
     from the forests and plains of Germany. 
     <lb/>
     The same or kindred peoples we also find 
     <lb/>
     settling in Britain, the Angles, the Saxons 
     <lb/>
     and the Jutes, at exactly the same period, 
     <lb/>
     all kindred races exactly. Later on we 
     <lb/>
     find France settled largely by the Norse<lb break="no"/>men or Normans. as they are called in 
     <lb/>
     history, all along the valley of the Seine, 
     <lb/>
     along the shores of the Bay of Biscay, and 
     <lb/>
     even around the southern part of France. 
     <lb/>
     That large infusion of Scandinavians or 
     <lb/>
     Norsemen flowing into France, has made 
     <lb/>
     her largely what she is to-day. We find 
     <lb/>
     the identical people settling in Britain under 
     <lb/>
     the names of Danes, or Swedes and Scan<lb break="no"/>dinavians. Following on down there is an 
     <lb/>
     infusion of those Norman people into Eng<lb break="no"/>land, and then we find a return movement 
     <lb/>
     in the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and 
     <lb/>
     fourteenth centuries, during which there 
     <lb/>
     were settlements in France from Britain 
     <lb/>
     even up to the days of the Henrys. So that 
     <lb/>
     so far as race and blood are concerned, 
     <lb/>
    the two peoples are identical, and the cry 
     <lb/>of difference of race, when viewed in the 
     <lb/>light of history, must necessarily vanish. 
     <lb/>Now, language is another point on which 
     <lb/>great stress is laid. I stand here prepared 
     <lb/>to indorse any system that will, in any 
     <lb/>legitimate manner, encourage the study of 
     <lb/>the French language. A child who speaks 
     <lb/>and understands one language well, is edu<lb break="no"/>cated, but a child who understands two 
     <lb/>languages well is better educated. It has 
     <lb/>been said that a child who understands 
     <lb/>three or four languages knows  nothing at 
     <lb/>all ; but, at the same time, I am free to 
     <lb/>say that it is an advantage to any one to 
     <lb/>be able to understand and speak two lan<lb break="no"/>guages well. I would be the last man, the 
     <lb/>last member of this House, either by voice 
     <lb/>or vote, to seek to deprive my French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dian fellow-citizens of any right they enjoy 
     <lb/>in the province of Quebec or the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, of educating their children 
     <lb/>in their mother tongue. You can box the 
     <lb/>compass on religion every morning if you 
     <lb/>choose, but language cannot be changed 
     <lb/>short of a lifetime. Therefore, this ques<lb break="no"/>tion is one that we must necessarily leave 
     <lb/>to settle itself ; and in the years to come 
     <lb/>I am satisfied that you will see a language 
     <lb/>neither all English nor all French, but a 
     <lb/>language strengthened by the best elements 
     <lb/>of the two tongues, and the people will 
     <lb/>be the better for it. Now, in discussing 
     <lb/>this question many considerations must 
     <lb/>necessarily be touched upon, and what I 
     <lb/>propose to say I shall say with all due re<lb break="no"/>gard to every man's faith and every man's 
     <lb/>creed. I have no desire to interfere in 
     <lb/>the slightest with any man's creed or the<lb break="no"/>ology ; I would not tolerate any man inter<lb break="no"/>fering with mine ; and, therefore, I would 
     <lb/>not in the slightest interfere with any man's 
     <lb/>theology. If, therefore, in reviewing these 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
    
     matters. I should say anything that might 
     <lb/>
     be considered harsh, or that is not gen<lb break="no"/>erally discussed on the floor of this House., 
     <lb/>
     I trust that those who differ from me will 
     <lb/>
     recognize that I am only dealing with his<lb break="no"/>torical facts, and not with a desire to hurt 
     <lb/>
     any one's feelings. Many of our fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     citizens, the moment you talk of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, raise their hands in holy horror 
     <lb/>
     and proclaim that their religion is attacked, 
     <lb/>
     that an attempt is made to abolish their 
     <lb/>
     church. Well, Sir, I maintain that a church, 
     <lb/>
     be it Protestant or Roman Catholic, or be 
     <lb/>
     it of any other denomination, that cannot 
     <lb/>
     stand without being bolstered up by the 
     <lb/>
     state, should vanish, and the sooner it 
     <lb/>
     vanishes the better for all concerned. Now, 
     <lb/>
     the contention that the French religion is 
     <lb/>
     synonymous with Romanism is also a myth. 
     <lb/>
     Let us review history, and you will find 
     <lb/>
     that up to the sixteenth century the people 
     <lb/>
     of France fought heroically against being 
     <lb/>
     subjected to the tyranny of the Romish 
     <lb/>
     Church. We find that as late as the six<lb break="no"/>teenth century the people of France held 
     <lb/>
     out heroically against being subjected to 
     <lb/>
     the control of the Church of Rome. Away 
     <lb/>
     back, before the end of the first century 
     <lb/>
     there were over a hundred creeds. Early 
     <lb/>
     in the fourth century we find the famous 
     <lb/>
     Council of Nice called, and even then, just 
     <lb/>
     as in the present day, we find theologians 
     <lb/>
     quarrelling ; there has been a standing quar<lb break="no"/>rel from that day to this, and so it will be 
     <lb/>
     until the end of the chapter. I will men<lb break="no"/>tion another very important fact, from 
     <lb/>
     which I date the rise of what you may call 
     <lb/>
     the assumption of temporal power on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the Roman Church. You may re<lb break="no"/>member, Mr. Speaker, that early in the 
     <lb/>
     fourth century the capital of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Empire was changed from the city of Rome. 
     <lb/>
      to Constantinople. We find at about the same 
     <lb/>
     time that Constantine, the Emperor of Rome, 
     <lb/>
     adopted the Christian faith, and that the 
     <lb/>
     hangers-on of the Government and the great 
     <lb/>
     majority of the priests of the old heathen 
     <lb/>
     religion boxed the compass and turned with 
     <lb/>
     him. That has been the rule from the time 
     <lb/>
     of Constantine down to to-day. About that 
     <lb/>
     time we find the whole Roman empire divid<lb break="no"/>ed into metropolitan divisions, and a metro<lb break="no"/>politan placed over each of those divisions. 
     <lb/>
     The capital was removed from Rome to Con<lb break="no"/>stantinople. We find almost the only author<lb break="no"/>ity existing in Rome to be the bishop of the 
     <lb/>
     church ; from that time dated the power of 
     <lb/>
     the church in Rome and its assumption of 
     <lb/>
     power in the Western Empire. During suc<lb break="no"/>ceeding years we find various attempts made 
     <lb/>
     by the priests of the Christian Church to 
     <lb/>
     fasten themselves on western Europe. 
     <lb/>
     Shortly after this time we find the church 
     <lb/>
     ready to support the party prepared to pay 
     <lb/>
     the highest price for its support—just as 
     <lb/>
     we do today. The price to be paid for 
     <lb/>
     the support of the church has not changed 
     <lb/>
     from that day down to the present. In the 
     <lb/>
     eighth century we find the church extend<lb break="no"/>
          
          
            <pb n="6095" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06095.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">6096</fw>
          
          ing its power to France. We find the Pope 
     <lb/>
     of Rome, fearing there would be a unifica<lb break="no"/>tion of Italy under the Lombard princes, 
     <lb/>
     formed an alliance in order to secure his 
     <lb/>
     authority in Europe. In return for assist<lb break="no"/>ance given in favour of the Pope of 
     <lb/>
     Rome against the Lombard princes in 
     <lb/>
     northern Italy, Romagna and Ancona, the 
     <lb/>
     Pope gave two provinces to his ally, and thus 
     <lb/>
     began the temporal power of the Church of 
     <lb/>
     Rome. From that date, step by step, we 
     <lb/>
     find that church gradually becoming strong<lb break="no"/>er—I will not enter into all the historical 
     <lb/>
     facts connected with it—and gradually be<lb break="no"/>coming, age after age, more intolerant, un<lb break="no"/>til, in the eleventh century it absolutely re<lb break="no"/>fused to recognize the control of the Em<lb break="no"/>peror. Up to that time, it is well known 
     <lb/>
     that every priest and bishop and even the 
     <lb/>
     Pope himself was elected by the people or 
     <lb/>
     appointed by the Emperor. They claim no 
     <lb/>
     divine right to rule, as they do at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time. In the middle of the eighth cen<lb break="no"/>tury we find the temporal power of the 
     <lb/>
     church established, and it continued to be 
     <lb/>
     so down to 1870, until the unification of 
     <lb/>
     Italy, when Victor Emmanuel changed his 
     <lb/>
     capital from Florence to Rome, and from 
     <lb/>
     that date to this, the Church of Rome 
     <lb/>
     has gradually ceased to be a temporal 
     <lb/>
     power. Having entered into this his<lb break="no"/>torical review, we need not go further ; I 
     <lb/>
     could go into details and show how, step 
     <lb/>
     by step, this power was assumed, and this 
     <lb/>
     divine right was assumed, but it is not 
     <lb/>
     necessary. We find ourselves in Canada 
     <lb/>
     suffering from the misgovernment and mis<lb break="no"/>management of by-gone ages. I have no 
     <lb/>
     antipathy whatever to any of our Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic citizens or to the citizens of any 
     <lb/>
     church, but when it comes to our having 
     <lb/>
     our schools governed by that church—I will 
     <lb/>
     not go into the details, although I have all 
     <lb/>
     the figures here—and when it is apparent 
     <lb/>
     that extra cost is incurred, that bad man<lb break="no"/>agement prevails and other objections arise, 
     <lb/>
     I object to this state of things, especially 
     <lb/>
     in a sparsely-settled country—but I need not 
     <lb/>
     go into these facts as they have already 
     <lb/>
     been stated by the last speaker, and are 
     <lb/>
     very well known. But there are very many 
     <lb/>
     objections that are very properly urged to 
     <lb/>
     any such system being perpetuated in this 
     <lb/>
     country. We find that separate schools were 
     <lb/>
     established as a compromise measure. In 
     <lb/>
     the provinces of Ontario and Quebec they 
     <lb/>
     are established, and I suppose they will  re<lb break="no"/>main until some time in future years when 
     <lb/>
     they will vanish of their own accord, when 
     <lb/>
     the people will have become so broad and 
     <lb/>
     liberal that a system of theological govern<lb break="no"/>ment will not be tolerated. But in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west, the matter is entirely different ; 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories there is no need of com<lb break="no"/>promise. I can easily see why, in the early 
     <lb/>
     days of the province of Quebec separate 
     <lb/>
     schools were established. We have two 
     <lb/>
      races in that province, English-speaking and 
     <lb/>
     French-speaking people, and I can easily 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <cb/>
         
         
     see how the question might readily arise of 
     <lb/>
     establishing separate schools, based on the 
     <lb/>
     question of language ; but I cannot see any 
     <lb/>
     reason why such schools should be based 
     <lb/>
     on theology, as subsequently was the case. As 
     <lb/>
     regards language, the two races were about 
     <lb/>
     evenly divided—language on the one hand 
     <lb/>
     and theology on the other. The English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking people, mostly Protestants, and the 
     <lb/>
     French-speaking mostly Roman Catholic, and 
     <lb/>
     it is very easy to see how the school question 
     <lb/>
     gradually developed into the form it subse<lb break="no"/>quently assumed, when Roman Catholic and 
     <lb/>
     Protestant separate schools were establish<lb break="no"/>ed. I do not wish to be misunderstood— 
     <lb/>
     do not desire to be understood as being in 
     <lb/>
     favour of Protestant separate schools or 
     <lb/>
     Protestant control of schools ; but my theory 
     <lb/>
     is this, that there should be no theological 
     <lb/>
     control whatever in connection with schools. 
     <lb/>
     I shall endeavour to submit a few points 
     <lb/>
     to support my view. It is our duty to teach the 
     <lb/>
     youth of the land, intellectually. The question 
     <lb/>
     of theology cannot possibly arise in teaching 
     <lb/>
     reading, writing and arithmetic, or, in tact, 
     <lb/>
     teaching any of the subjects that form our 
     <lb/>
     school curriculum. History is the only sub<lb break="no"/>ject on which any difference of opinion can 
     <lb/>
     possibly exist, and even in regard to that 
     <lb/>
     I am satisfied an arrangement could he 
     <lb/>
     arrived at which would be perfectly satis<lb break="no"/>factory to persons of all creeds and forms 
     <lb/>
     of theology. Therefore, no question can be 
     <lb/>
     raised by any theologian on subjects which 
     <lb/>
     we may call intellectual in our public 
     <lb/>
     schools. There can be no possible objection 
     <lb/>
     to teaching sanitary laws or physical laws 
     <lb/>
     relating to disease, and the development 
     <lb/>
     of the human frame in our schools. Those 
     <lb/>
     are recognized to-day by all theologians as 
     <lb/>
     being proper, and certainly theology does 
     <lb/>
     not enter into those subjects; therefore, 
     <lb/>
     Protestants and Roman Catholics can at<lb break="no"/>tend such schools without straining their 
     <lb/>
    consciences. Moreover, it is well recog<lb break="no"/>nized that the principles of government 
     <lb/>should be thoroughly instilled in the minds 
     <lb/>of the youth, and theology cannot possibly 
     <lb/>enter into the principles of government ; 
     <lb/>and i am satisfied that no one should, for 
     <lb/>a moment, object to the teaching of that 
     <lb/>subject. It is said, look at what the free 
     <lb/>school system in the United States has pro<lb break="no"/>duced. I point to the United States as a coun<lb break="no"/>try carrying out the free school system. 
     <lb/>The men who are causing the dissensions 
     <lb/>and troubles in the United States, are not 
     <lb/>men who were educated under the free school 
     <lb/>system of the United States, but they are 
     <lb/>the offscourings of theological institutions in 
     <lb/>the countries of Europe. I speak of every 
     <lb/>theology, not caring what it may be. There 
     <lb/>is an old saying which is this :

     <lb/>
     theologian to the teaching of morality. Right 
     <lb/>
     is right, and wrong is wrong. Long before 
     <lb/>
     we found any of the precepts of theologians 
     <lb/>
     that are blessing or injuring the world, long 
     <lb/>
     before these theologies were introduced on 
     <lb/>
     the face of the earth, we found right, right, 
     <lb/>
     and wrong, wrong. Morality as taught in our 
     <lb/>
     schools cannot be objected to from a theolo<lb break="no"/>gical point of view. For the benefit of some 
     <lb/>
     of our Roman Catholic fellow-citizens who 
     <lb/>
     might object to the absence of the teaching 
     <lb/>
     of morality in the schools, I wish to read 
     <lb/>
     what a very eminent writer says on the 
     <lb/>
     subject of the teaching of morality, and when 
     <lb/>
     his name is mentioned it will prove accept<lb break="no"/>able to the great majority of the members 
     <lb/>
     of that faith. Mr. Lilly, one of the leading 
     <lb/>
     members of the Jesuit branch of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics in England, says:

     The ethics of Christianity are not, as Mr. John 
     <lb/>
     Morley somewhere calls them, " a mere appendage 
     <lb/>
     to a set of theological mysteries." They are inde<lb break="no"/>pendent of those mysteries, and would subsist to 
     <lb/>
     all eternity, though Christianity and all other reli<lb break="no"/>gions were swept into oblivion. The moral law is 
     <lb/>
     ascertained, not from aimonncements of prophets, 
     <lb/>
     apostles, evangelists, but from a natural and per<lb break="no"/>manent revelation of the reason. " Natural rea<lb break="no"/>son," says Suarez, in his great treatise De Legibus, 
     <lb/>
     "indicates what is in itself good or bad for men ;" 
     <lb/>
     or, as elsewhere in the same work, he expresses it : 
     <lb/>
     " Natural reason indicates what is good or bad for 
     <lb/>
     a rational creature." The great fundamental truths 
     <lb/>
     of ethics are necessary, like the great fundamental 
     <lb/>
     truths of mathematics. They do not proceed from 
     <lb/>
     the arbitrary will of God. They are unchangeable, 
     <lb/>
     even by the flat of the Omnipotent. The moral 
     <lb/>
     precepts of Christianity do not derive their validity 
     <lb/>
     from the Christian religion. They are not a corol<lb break="no"/>lary from its theological creed. It is mere matter 
     <lb/>
     of fact, patent to every one who will look into his 
     <lb/>
     Bible, that Jesus Christ and his apostles left no 
     <lb/>
     code of ethics. The Gospels and Epistles do not 
     <lb/>
     yield even the elements of such a code. Certain it 
     <lb/>
     is that when, in the expanding Christian society, 
     <lb/>
     the need arose for an ethical synthesis, resource 
     <lb/>
     was had to the inexhaustible fountains of wisdom 
     <lb/>
     opened by the Hellenic mind.

            <p>
     The clearness, the precision of pyschological

     analysis, which distinguish the ethics of the Catho<lb break="no"/>lic schools, are due more to Aristotle and Plato,

     <lb/>
     very well be spared the trouble. Now, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     it may be asked, why is it that the church 
     <lb/>
     is so anxious to control the teaching of theo<lb break="no"/>logy in our schools ? Of course it is a relic 
     <lb/>
     of the old days and they do not care to give 
     <lb/>
     it up. In fact none of these principles have 
     <lb/>
     been given up without a struggle. During 
     <lb/>
     the last 200 years, since the overthrow of 
     <lb/>
     theological control in relation to education, 
     <lb/>
     the world has made more progress than in 
     <lb/>
     all the previous years of its existence. That 
     <lb/>
     fact alone I would urge in opposition, to any 
     <lb/>
     control on the part of theologians in our 
     <lb/>
     schools ; any control other than as citizens of 
     <lb/>
     this country. We may well ask: have theo<lb break="no"/>logians any confidence in their own prin<lb break="no"/>ciples ? If they have, why do they seek to 
     <lb/>
     take advantage of the public schools of the 
     <lb/>
     country in order to inculcate their principles. 
     <lb/>
     They have their various meetings every day 
     <lb/>
     during the week, and they have the Sunday 
     <lb/>
     schools in which to control the children, and 
     <lb/>
     yet we find they are not satisfied with that, 
     <lb/>
     but that they wish to control the public 
     <lb/>
     schools of the country in relation to the mat<lb break="no"/>ters of their theology. They certainly should 
     <lb/>
     not fear intelligent public criticism, if their 
     <lb/>
     dogmas are right they should not be afraid <lb/> to have them fearlessly criticised. There is 
     <lb/>
     one other reason why we should not have this 
     <lb/>
     system of separate schools, either Protestant 
     <lb/>
     or Roman Catholic, for I do not make any 
     <lb/>
     exception to either one or the other. There 
     <lb/>
     is the question of vested rights. The record 
     <lb/>
     shows that every year these separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west are increasing in numbers, 
     <lb/>
     and by the time we come to establish these 
     <lb/>
     Territories as provinces, we will find that 
     <lb/>
     these schools have taken such firm root that 
     <lb/>
     it will be all but impossible for this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to eradicate them. I could point to the 
     <lb/>
     record of Ontario—but I shall not take up 
     <lb/>
     the time of the House to go into that aspect 
     <lb/>
     of the case—to show that separate schools 
     <lb/>
     instead of unifying and upbuilding the nation, 
     <lb/>
     divide it, and create a citizenship inside of 
     <lb/>
     a citizenship owing allegiance, not neces<lb break="no"/>sarily to the nation, but to a foreign power. 
     <lb/>
     I contend that separate schools are unneces<lb break="no"/>sary, and especially where settlement is very 
     <lb/>
     sparse. Many of these schools in the North 
     <lb/>
     west Territories have not more than seven 
     <lb/>
     or eight children attending them, and yet you 
     <lb/>
     will find that in some localities Protestant 
     <lb/>
     children—because there are no Protestant 
     <lb/>
     separate schools there, and I hope there 
     <lb/>
     never will be—are forced to walk many miles 
     <lb/>
     in order to attend the public schools, because 
     <lb/>
     the schools in their own sections are Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic ones. I am informed by many people 
     <lb/>
     who come from the North-west, and I am in<lb break="no"/>formed by Roman Catholics in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, that neither in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec nor in the North-west do they demand
               
               
            <pb n="6099" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06099.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">6099</fw>
            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">6100</fw>
        
        
     theological schools . The Roman Catholic peo<lb break="no"/>ple themselves do not ask them, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, I do not see why they should be forced 
     <lb/>
     upon them. This is a new country, and in a 
     <lb/>
     new country we should be very careful what 
     <lb/>
     groundwork we lay down, and we should 
     <lb/>
     examine very critically into the question of 
     <lb/>
     allowing these theologians of any denomina<lb break="no"/>tion to control our schools, for the seed 
     <lb/>
     planted in early days is very hand to eradi<lb break="no"/>cate in later years. I maintain that separate 
     <lb/>
     schools are contrary to the principles of re<lb break="no"/>sponsible government. Responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment recognizes the individuality of each 
     <lb/>
     citizen and separate schools train the youth 
     <lb/>
     of the land, not to recognize that individual<lb break="no"/>ity which is necessary for true citizenship. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, I maintain that children trained 
     <lb/>
     in separate schools are not likely to be as 
     <lb/>
     good or as loyal citizens, ready to sacrifice 
     <lb/>
     their whole independence for the country, 
     <lb/>
     as those trained in public schools. Another 
     <lb/>
     point I am pleased to say that not only 
     <lb/>
     do we find several branches of the Christian 
     <lb/>
     church to-day denying the right of the state 
     <lb/>
     directly or indirectly to recognize any church, 
     <lb/>
     but we find many individuals in other religi<lb break="no"/>ous bodies which do not take the same stand. 
     <lb/>
     stepping out and refusing to accept from the 
     <lb/>
     state any recognition of churches. I trust 
     <lb/>
     that it will not be long before all the 
     <lb/>
     churches, both Protestant and Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic, will take the same line and agree to 
     <lb/>
     abolish separate schools, not only in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west, but in these provinces. An<lb break="no"/>other point. In separate schools the control 
     <lb/>
     of the youth is abdicated to the theologians— 
     <lb/>
     there is no getting round that point—and in 
     <lb/>
     that way the children are brought up not 
     <lb/>
     to recognize the parental authority and the 
     <lb/>
     state authority as supreme, but to recognize 
     <lb/>
     the church as overshadowing both the state 
     <lb/>
     and the home and as the great fountain of 
     <lb/>
     authority. The church to-day has a high 
     <lb/>
     recognition, owing to the respect we all 
     <lb/>
     show the clergy, from the position they oc<lb break="no"/>cupy: and if their doctrines are as they 
     <lb/>
     should be, they should not ask for more. 
     <lb/>
     They have a certain amount of superstitious 
     <lb/>
     regard—I do not use the word improperly— 
     <lb/>
     tendered to them by people of all denomina<lb break="no"/>tions, so that the utterances from the clergy 
     <lb/>
     go further, and are received with less criti<lb break="no"/>cism, than the utterances of ordinary citizens. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, I maintain that they should not 
     <lb/>
     ask for any special privilege in relation to 
     <lb/>
     the schools of this country, on account of 
     <lb/>
     the position they already hold in the minds 
     <lb/>
     of the people. Separate schools, Sir, create 
     <lb/>
     a nation inside of a nation. Before separate 
     <lb/>
     schools existed in this country the youth of 
     <lb/>
     all creeds and doctrines were loyal to the 
     <lb/>
     core; but today we find, unfortunately, 
     <lb/>
     springing up in various localities a spirit 
     <lb/>
     which looks to the church before it looks to 
     <lb/>
     the state. In other words, we find the ul<lb break="no"/>tramontane spirit growing up in many parts 
     <lb/>
     of Canada to-day, and recognizing the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada, not as the paramount 
     <lb/>
     authority, but as secondary to other authori<lb break="no"/>
  
  
            <cb/>
        
        
     ties. Another point is this : If one creed has 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, then all must have them. 
     <lb/>
     The schools of the North-west are wrong, 
     <lb/>
     even on the basis of separate schools, for 
     <lb/>
     they are recognized simply as Protestant and 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic schools. But if one creed 
     <lb/>
     is entitled to separate schools, then all are : 
     <lb/>
     the Methodist, the Presbyterian, the Angli<lb break="no"/>can, the Baptist and all other denominations 
     <lb/>
     have an equal right to demand them. There<lb break="no"/>fore, I maintain that the present basis for 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, if separate schools are to 
     <lb/>
     be recognized, is entirely wrong. I advance 
     <lb/>
     these arguments to show the absurdity of the 
     <lb/>
     whole principle of separate schools.   Now. 
     <lb/>
     there is another aspect of this matter. If 
     <lb/>
     the older provinces seek to force the system 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools on the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. I feel satisfied that the day is not 
     <lb/>
     far distant when those territories will be 
     <lb/>
     peopled with a race that will not tolerate 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. It does not require much 
     <lb/>
     of a prophet to foresee that in the near 
     <lb/>
     future the North—west Territories will have. 
     <lb/>
     a much more predominant population than 
     <lb/>
     they have to-day, and it is well for us in the 
     <lb/>
     older provinces to consider, if we seek to 
     <lb/>
     impose separate schools on the people of 
     <lb/>
     those territories at the present time. whether 
     <lb/>
     they will not in the near future come down 
     <lb/>
     here and say : we will abolish your separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. In other words. they may retaliate 
     <lb/>
     in the coming years, as I have no doubt they 
     <lb/>
     will in any event. Another important point 
     <lb/>
     is this : Every session in Canada, so long as 
     <lb/>
     I remember, we have found one province 
     <lb/>
     arrayed against. another and one theology 
     <lb/>
     against another, owing to this creed inter<lb break="no"/>ference in state affairs, and, Sir, look at it 
     <lb/>
     as you will, get round it as you may, com<lb break="no"/>promise as you will, and concede any point 
     <lb/>
     you deem it necessary to concede, the 
     <lb/>
     question of these theological influences is 
     <lb/>
     eternally cropping up in this country. I main<lb break="no"/>tain that the true position is that every man 
     <lb/>
     should, as I trust every man does. worsnip 
     <lb/>
     God according to the dictates of his own 
     <lb/>
     conscience. and that there should be entire 
     <lb/>
     separation of church and state in all matters. 
     <lb/>
     and that can only be brought about by 
     <lb/>
     abolishing all separate schools. Another 
     <lb/>
     objection to separate schools is this: You 
     <lb/>
     may remember that the American revolu<lb break="no"/>tionary war was brought about because the 
     <lb/>
     people were taxed without representation. 
     <lb/>
     They were free men, and they refused to 
     <lb/>
     pay taxes without representation. The con<lb break="no"/>trary principle, I maintain, should hold good, 
     <lb/>
     that no taxation should carry with it no 
     <lb/>
     representation. We find, however, that the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in Ontario and also in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west, are governed by the clergy, and 
     <lb/>
     the clergy in both Ontario and the North<lb break="no"/>west are exempt from taxation. There<lb break="no"/>fore, we find a set of men, we may almost 
     <lb/>
     say a sovereign body, governing without 
     <lb/>
     being taxed. That principle is wrong. We 
     <lb/>
     also find the other principle in this fact : that 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholic people of the country 
     <lb/>
     are taxed. while they have not their share of 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <pb n="6101" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06101.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">6101</fw> <fw type="dateline">[JULY 16, 1894]</fw> <fw type="num">6102</fw>
        
        
     representation in the government of these 
     <lb/>
     schools. Another very important point is 
     <lb/>
     this: We find that these Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     schools are almost entirely under the control 
     <lb/>
     of church orders. That undoubtedly closes 
     <lb/>
     many avenues of life to young men and 
     <lb/>
     young women of the Roman Catholic faith. 
     <lb/>
     These people have not the same privileges 
     <lb/>
     in the way of rising in the world as 
     <lb/>
     their Protestant fellow—citizens. We find our 
     <lb/>
     Protestant young men and women engaging 
     <lb/>
     in the teaching profession and becoming 
     <lb/>
     ornaments of society; while in almost all 
     <lb/>
     these Roman Catholic schools the teaching 
     <lb/>
     is done largely by members of church 
     <lb/>
     orders, and this closes that important avenue 
     <lb/>
     to young men and young women of that 
     <lb/>
     faith. I could go further; but I will not 
     <lb/>take up the time of the House with any<lb/>
    more arguments on this subject. I am well 
     <lb/>aware, Sir, that any man who stands up 
     <lb/>and differs in the slightest degree from those 
     <lb/>who favour separate schools, or attempts to 
     <lb/>put the brake on theological interference 
     <lb/>in the control of the community, will 
     <lb/>be called intolerant, and have the fin<lb break="no"/>ger of scorn pointed at him. How<lb break="no"/>ever, although I do not expect, I may 
     <lb/>inform the House my amendment to carry 
     <lb/>just at present, I am satisfied that the day 
     <lb/>is not far distant when the question of 
     <lb/>the separation of State and Church will be 
     <lb/>one of the live issues of this Dominion. I 
     <lb/>am satisfied that the people will rise above 
     <lb/>all petty matters and advantages that are 
     <lb/>now flung around this, and will recognize 
     <lb/>no man's creed but look on him simply as 
     <lb/>a citizen of Canada. That is the only true 
     <lb/>basis here, I care not what a man's creed 
     <lb/>may be, but only what his politics are. I 
     <lb/>have set an example of this in my political 
     <lb/>career. So long as a man stands forth 
     <lb/>and takes a straight line in relation to pub<lb break="no"/>lic affairs, I shall support him. irrespective 
     <lb/>of what religious creed he may profess in 
     <lb/>his private life. But once I find a com<lb break="no"/>munity governed by theological opinions. 
     <lb/>or questions of state made subservient to 
     <lb/>questions of theological concern. then I must 
     <lb/>respectfully beg to express my opposition to 
     <lb/>that state of affairs. We are all citizens of 
     <lb/>Canada and should stand forth as such, 
     <lb/>and place ourselves on record before the 
     <lb/>country as public men, and not as members 
     <lb/>of any religious organization. I therefore 
     <lb/>beg to move the following amendment :—

            </p>
   
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     That all the words in the amendment be struck

     out and the following inserted instead thereof : 
     <lb/>
     " That the said Bill be not now read the third time,

     but : recognizing, that the fullest powers relating 
     <lb/>
     to education, consistent with the well-being of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada as a whole should be conferred 
     <lb/>
     on the provincial and territorial Legislatures ; and 
     <lb/>
     that those powers should involve the training of

     the youth :—

            </p>

            <p>
     (1.) Intellectually, that each one may know how

     towards his fellow man.

            </p>

            <p>
     And further recognizing that from a national 
     <lb/>
     view-point it is wrong and contrary to the spirit of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government to confer upon a provin<lb break="no"/>cial or territorial Legislature, authority to establish

     or to enact to establish a system of separate or

     Amendment negatived.

            <p>
     And the question being put on the amend<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:AMYO1">Mr. AMYOT</persName>. I shall only detain the House 
     <lb/>
     for a very few moments. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) asks that 
     <lb/>
     full liberty be given to the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories to legislate in the matter of the 
     <lb/>
     schools. I am glad he has put the question 
     <lb/>
     so clearly and distinctly. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man quoted section 93 of the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     Act, and I admit the interpretation he gave 
     <lb/>
     to it. He has admitted that that clause 
     <lb/>
     gives forever to the provinces, which will 
     <lb/>
     enter into the Dominion, the right to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. But he says that since we have 
     <lb/>
     given to the North-west Territories nearly 
     <lb/>
     all the rights which we have given to 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces, we ought also to 
     <lb/>
     give it the control over education. That 
     <lb/>
     is, if I understand it rightly, the stand 
     <lb/>
    the hon. gentleman has taken. The 
     <lb/>reason, Mr. Speaker, is this—and I 
     <lb/>am surprised that it is not more generally 
     <lb/>understood by the adversaries of separate 
     <lb/>schools—that when we established Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion we established the autonomy of the 
     <lb/>provinces, guaranteeing to the provinces ex<lb break="no"/>clusive right and control of all matters as<lb break="no"/>signed to them. But, so far as education 
     <lb/>is concerned, we have extended the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of autonomy further yet, we have ex<lb break="no"/>tended it to the father of the family, and 
     <lb/>have virtually declared that each father 
     <lb/>of a family shall be the supreme master of 
     <lb/>his children, and may send them to the 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <cb/>
         
         
     school that pleases him. To make certain 
     <lb/>
     that the Local Legislatures shall not use 
     <lb/>
     their majorities to infringe upon the pri<lb break="no"/>vilege of the father of the family, we, the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament of Canada, have remained the 
     <lb/>
     trustees and guardians of his rights. We 
     <lb/>
     cannot interfere with the provinces in mat<lb break="no"/>ters assigned to them, but in relation to 
     <lb/>
     education, the principle is extended further 
     <lb/>
     and it is for us to see that the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the father of the family are protected. Does 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) understand me ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:AMYO1">Mr. AMYOT</persName>. In matters of education, for 
     <lb/>
     fear some ill-advised people, bigots or fana<lb break="no"/>tics, moved by whatever motives, should 
     <lb/>
     try to deprive the father of the family of 
     <lb/>
     his sacred right to educate his children as 
     <lb/>
     he pleases, we have constituted the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada the protector of that right. 
     <lb/>
     So that upon us is thrown the moral obli<lb break="no"/>gation and duty of preventing the provinces 
     <lb/>
     from taking the money of the parents to 
     <lb/>
     teach their children in any other language 
     <lb/>
     or religion than that which the parents de<lb break="no"/>sire. I am glad the hon. member has ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that this section applies to the whole 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion not only as it was origin<lb break="no"/>ally constituted but as it was intended to 
     <lb/>
     be constituted later on, and will even apply 
     <lb/>
     to Keewatin district when it is made a pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The preamble of the Act says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     And whereas it is expedient that provision be 
     <lb/>
     made for the eventual admission into the Union 
     <lb/>
     of other parts of British North America. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     And if the hon. gentleman reads section 
     <lb/>
     146 he will see that provision was made 
     <lb/>
     for the admission of Rupert's Land and the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, which included the 
     <lb/>
     present province of Manitoba, and it was 
     <lb/>
     provided that this should be on such terms 
     <lb/>
    and conditions in each case as are in the 
     <lb/>addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks 
     <lb/>fit to approve, subject to the provisions of 
     <lb/>this Act. I will add only one word. The 
     <lb/>hon. member for North Simcoe must re<lb break="no"/>member that by this House and by the Senate 
     <lb/>of Canada it was promised most faithfully 
     <lb/>that the Parliament of Canada would be 
     <lb/>ready to provide that the legal rights of any 
     <lb/>corporation, company or individual within 
     <lb/>the same shall be respected and placed un<lb break="no"/>der the protection of courts of competent 
     <lb/>jurisdiction. One of these rights was the 
     <lb/>right of education and another was the 
     <lb/>right to speak French or English. The hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman knows that all the Acts con<lb break="no"/>cerning Manitoba and the North-west have 
     <lb/>referred to the British North America Act 
     <lb/>and to that address of both Houses. I re<lb break="no"/>member that at that time some doubts were 
     <lb/>expressed as to the meaning of the phrase. 
     <lb/>but does the hon. gentleman not remember 
     <lb/>the interpretation that Lord Granville gives 
     <lb/>it in his letter to Sir John Young? I need 
     <lb/>not take the time of the House to read 
     <lb/>the letter I speak of. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <pb n="6105" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06105.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">6105</fw> <fw type="dateline">[JULY 16, 1894]</fw> <fw type="num">6106</fw>
         
         
     knows that in that letter it was solemnly 
     <lb/>
     affirmed that the language and the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools would be protected. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr. McCarthy) is an honest man I 
     <lb/>
     am assured ; he is a sincere man, and under<lb break="no"/>standing that Confederation took place on 
     <lb/>
     that condition will he say now that it is 
     <lb/>
     fair that the majority, merely because they 
     <lb/>
     are a majority should refuse to be bound 
     <lb/>
     by the condition ? Would we have induced 
     <lb/>
     these provinces to join the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     under false pretext ? Let Canada not 
     <lb/>
     repeat here at Ottawa the miserable 
     <lb/>
     and contemptible tricks by which, in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba they have 
     <lb/>
     succeeded in abolishing for the present 
     <lb/>
     —for the present, but not for long—the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools and the French language. 
     <lb/>
     If Canada wants to be peaceful and pros<lb break="no"/>perous let her give justice and due pro<lb break="no"/>tection to every one. After all, of what 
     <lb/>
     does the hon. gentleman complain ? He says 
     <lb/>
     the separate schools costs $100,000 a year. 
     <lb/>
     How much does it cost him ? It costs us 
     <lb/>
     as much as it costs him. Does he think we 
     <lb/>
     would be glad to send our money there to 
     <lb/>
     educate the children in a manner contrary 
     <lb/>
     to the wishes of the parents ? Are not the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians loyal ? We want the 
     <lb/>
     British Empire to be prosperous, grand, to 
     <lb/>
     dominate the world ; we want Canada to 
     <lb/>
     remain joined with England. We have the 
     <lb/>
     right to say that our forefathers assisted 
     <lb/>
     in keeping this domain for the Queen, and to<lb break="no"/>day we pretend to be the most devoted sub<lb break="no"/>jects of Her Majesty. Sir George Etienne 
     <lb/>
     Cartier declared that the last gun fired in 
     <lb/>
     defence of British supremacy in Canada 
     <lb/>
     would be fired by a French-Canadian. We 
     <lb/>
     are loyal subjects of the Queen, and we 
     <lb/>
     have the right to remain loyal as French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians and as Catholics. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman need not be afraid ; he will not find 
     <lb/>
     any traitors amongst us; he will never 
     <lb/>
     find us working against the Queen, because 
     <lb/>
     the Pope teaches us to respect constituted 
     <lb/>
     authority and to be faithful to the Queen. 
     <lb/>
     But we have these treaties and guarantees 
     <lb/>
     that these institutions shall be preserved ; 
     <lb/>
     we have the honour of the Dominion pledged. 
     <lb/>
     Can we not depend upon that ? The hon. 
     <lb/>
    gentleman says he approaches this question  
     <lb/>in a cool way. I may set fire to my neigh<lb break="no"/>bour's house in a cool way, but that does 
     <lb/>not justify my act. I shall not go into de<lb break="no"/>tails or take the time of the House. but I  
     <lb/>say that in matters of education autonomy 
     <lb/>has been granted to the father of the family, 
     <lb/>that the provinces have no right to in<lb break="no"/>terfere with him, and, if they do, the Par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada is bound under the treaty, 
     <lb/>in honour and, I might say in conscience, 
     <lb/>to interfere and protect him. Then let us 
     <lb/>not for a moment enact a law that will 
     <lb/>deny those vested and sacred rights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. This is a subject which, 
     <lb/>
     as we all know from past experience when<lb break="no"/>ever it has been brought before the House, is 
     <lb/>
     liable to create a great deal of excite<lb break="no"/>
          
          
            <cb/>
         
         ment and even of bitterness. I am sure that 
     <lb/>
     the House must feel happy that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), in intro<lb break="no"/>ducing this subject to our attention today, 
     <lb/>
     has done so in a speech certainly remarkable 
     <lb/>
     for its moderation and its temperate tone. 
     <lb/>
     For my part, while differing in toto from the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman in the conclusions to which 
     <lb/>
     I arrive upon this question, I may say that 
     <lb/>
     I shall try and emulate the moderation with 
     <lb/>
     with which he has approached it. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman, in his opening remarks, said 
     <lb/>
     that the legislation which is now on the 
     <lb/>
     Statute-book concerning the subject of educa<lb break="no"/>tion in the North-west Territories, is extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary and unprecedented, I admit at 
     <lb/>
     once that it is extraordinary, but I do not 
     <lb/>
     at all admit that it is unprecedented. It is 
     <lb/>
     certainly extraordinary, and I agree with 
     <lb/>
     him in his statement that the subject of 
     <lb/>
     education is one which, by its very nature, 
     <lb/>
     should pertain to the Local Legislatures. This 
     <lb/>
     was the case at the time Confederation was 
     <lb/>
     discussed in 1864, and it is equally the case 
     <lb/>
     in 1894 ; and we may ask ourselves why 
     <lb/>
     was this extraordinary legislation adopted 
     <lb/>
     in 1875. We may well ask ourselves, what 
     <lb/>
     is the reason which induced the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, when dealing with the question 
     <lb/>
     in 1875, while granting local powers to the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territory, to deprive the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature which was then created of a power 
     <lb/>
     which must be admitted is essentially 
     <lb/>
     of a local nature ? Here comes the 
     <lb/>
     precedent. The legislation, as my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend knows, was not unprecedented. 
     <lb/>
     The Legislature was deprived of its supre<lb break="no"/>macy in matters of education in order to 
     <lb/>
     make that Legislature conform to the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces in respect to the powers relating 
     <lb/>
     to the subject of education ; it was made 
     <lb/>
     to conform to the two largest provinces of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion in respect to that matter. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend knows as well as I do that 
     <lb/>
     in that respect the Legislature of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories was placed unon absolutely 
     <lb/>
     the same footing as the Legislature of Que<lb break="no"/>bec and the Legislature of Ontario. Again, 
     <lb/>
     we may ask the question why the Legislatures 
     <lb/>
     of Upper and Lower Canada were deprived, 
     <lb/>
     at the time Confederation was discussed. of 
     <lb/>
    their control over the matter of education. 
     <lb/>The reason everybody knows. It is a matter of 
     <lb/>history that when in 1864 the idea of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, which up to that time had been a 
     <lb/>misty and hazy one, at last took something 
     <lb/>like a practical and tangible shape, the old 
     <lb/>provinces of Upper and Lower Canada had 
     <lb/>been convulsed by an agitation over the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of separate schools. True it is, that the 
     <lb/>Protestant minority of Lower Canada had en<lb break="no"/>joyed for more than thirty years the pri<lb break="no"/>vilege of having its own schools without 
     <lb/>any interference from the majority ; and it 
     <lb/>was only in the year before that the long 
     <lb/>agitation had been settled in Upper Canada 
     <lb/>by granting to the minority of that province 
     <lb/>the same privileges which had been granted 
     <lb/>to the minority in Lower Canada more than 
     <lb/>

     twenty years before. It is also a matter 
     <lb/>
     of history that of all the leaders of public 
     <lb/>
     opinion at that time. Mr. George Brown was 
     <lb/>
     among the most uncompromising opponents 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools. It is also a matter of 
     <lb/>
     history that if there was any man who, more 
     <lb/>
     than another, contributed to shape the events 
     <lb/>
     which made Confederation possible, that man 
     <lb/>
     was Mr. Brown ; but it is also a matter of 
     <lb/>
     history that in his anxiety to make Con<lb break="no"/>federation a success, and to anchor the new 
     <lb/>
     scheme in the affections of the people, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Brown did not hesitate at that time to sink 
     <lb/>
    his own opinion on the question of separate 
     <lb/>schools, and consented to deprive the Local 
     <lb/>Legislature of his own province of supre<lb break="no"/>macy over the question of separate schools. 
     <lb/>Let me here quote the language of Mr. 
     <lb/>Brown in regard to that question. The quo<lb break="no"/>tation may be a little lengthy. but I believe 
     <lb/>it is quite apposite to the subject we have 
     <lb/>in hand. After showing the advantages 
     <lb/>which Ontario was to obtain from having 
     <lb/>control over its own local affairs, Mr. Brown,  
     <lb/>in the Confederation Debates, spoke as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :—

     Now, I need hardly remind the House that I 
     <lb/>
     have always opposed and continue to oppose the 
     <lb/>
     system of sectarian education so far as the public 
     <lb/>
     chest is concerned. I have never had any hesita<lb break="no"/>tion on that point. I have never been able to see 
     <lb/>
     why all the people of the province, to whatever 
     <lb/>
     sect they may belong, should not send their chil<lb break="no"/>dren to the same common schools to receive the 
     <lb/>
     ordinary branches of instruction. I regard the 
     <lb/>
     parent and the pastor as the best religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tors-and so long as the religious faith of the chil<lb break="no"/>dren is uninterfered with, and ample opportunity 
     <lb/>
     afforded to the clergy to give religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     to the children of their flocks, I cannot conceive 
     <lb/>
     any sound objection to mixed schools. But while 
     <lb/>
     in the Conference and elsewhere I have always 
     <lb/>
     maintained this view, and always given my vote 
     <lb/>
     against sectarian public schools. I am bound to ad<lb break="no"/>mit, as I have always admitted, that the sectarian 
     <lb/>
     system, carried to the limited extent it has yet 
     <lb/>
     been in Upper Canada, and confined as it chiefly is 
     <lb/>
     to cities and towns, has not been a very great 
     <lb/>
     practical injury. The real cause of alarm was that 
     <lb/>
     the admission of the sectarian principle was there, 
     <lb/>
     and that at any moment it might be extended to 
     <lb/>
     such a degree as to split up our school system alto<lb break="no"/>gether. There are but a. hundred separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada, out of some four thousand, and 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <cb/>
           
           
     all Roman Catholic. But if the Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     are entitled to separate schools and to go on ex<lb break="no"/>tending their operations, so are the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Church of England, the Presbyterians, the Metho<lb break="no"/>dists, and all other sects. No candid Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic will deny this for a moment ; and there 
     <lb/>
     lay the great danger to our educational fabric, that 
     <lb/>
     the separate system might gradually extend itself 
     <lb/>
     until the whole country was studded with nurser<lb break="no"/>ies of sectarianism, most hurtful to the best inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the province and entailing an enormous 
     <lb/>
     expense to sustain the hosts of teachers that so 
     <lb/>
     prodigal a system of public instruction must in<lb break="no"/>evitably entail. Now, it is known to every hon<lb break="no"/>ourable member of this House that an Act was 
     <lb/>
     passed in 1863, as a final settlement of this secta<lb break="no"/>rian controversy, I was not in Quebec at the time, 
     <lb/>
     but if I had been here. I would have voted against 
     <lb/>
     that Bill, because it extended the facilities for 
     <lb/>
     establishing separate schools. It had, however, 
     <lb/>
     this good feature, that it was accepted by the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic authorities, and carried through 
     <lb/>
     Parliament as a final compromise of the question 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada. When, therefore, it was pro<lb break="no"/>posed that a provision should be inserted in the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme to bind that compact of 
     <lb/>
     1863, and declare it a final settlement, so that we 
     <lb/>
     should not be compelled, as we have been since 
     <lb/>
     1849, to stand constantly to our arms, awaiting 
     <lb/>
     fresh attacks upon our common school system, the 
     <lb/>
     proposition seemed to me one that was not rashly 
     <lb/>
     to be rejected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I admit that, from my point of view, this is a 
     <lb/>
     blot on the scheme before the House, it is con<lb break="no"/>fessedly one of the concession from our side that 
     <lb/>
     had been made to secure this great measure of 
     <lb/>
     reform. But assuredly I for one have not the 
     <lb/>
     slightest hesitation in accepting it as a necessary 
     <lb/>
     condition of the scheme of union, and doubly ac<lb break="no"/>ceptable must it be in the eyes of hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite, who were the authors of the Bil1 of 1863. 
     <lb/>
     But it was urged that though this arrangement 
     <lb/>
     might perhaps be fair as regards Upper Canada, it 
     <lb/>
     was not so as regards Lower Canada, for there 
     <lb/>
     were matters of which the British population have 
     <lb/>
     long complained and some amendments to the 
     <lb/>
     existing School Act were required to secure them 
     <lb/>
     equal justice. Well, when this point was raised 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen of all parties in Lower Canada at once 
     <lb/>
     expressed themselves prepared to treat it in a frank 
     <lb/>
     and conciliatory manner, with a view to removing 
     <lb/>
     any injustice that might be shown to exist ; and on 
     <lb/>
     this understanding the educational clause was 
     <lb/>
     adopted by the Conference.

     And here I am pleased to say that so far as 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant minority of Quebec are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, the pledges given at the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference have been amply and fully redeem<lb break="no"/>ed since Confederation has been established. 
     <lb/>
     One of the first acts done by the Local 
     <lb/>
     Legislature in 1861 was to pass a law, which 
     <lb/>
     has proved satisfactory to the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     minority ever since. I call my hon. friend's 
     <lb/>
     attention to this. Mr. Brown was no more 
     <lb/>
     than is my hon. friend an advocate of a 
     <lb/>
     separate school system—Mr. Brown was just 
     <lb/>
     as thoroughly an opponent of that system. 
     <lb/>
     He said, just as does the hon. gentleman, it 
     <lb/>
     is a blot on our system. But for all that, 
     <lb/>
     strong as was the objection of Mr. Brown to 
     <lb/>

     the separate school system, in order to secure 
     <lb/>
     peace and harmony, and in order to carry out 
     <lb/>
     this great scheme of Confederation, he con<lb break="no"/>sented to sink his own personal views on 
     <lb/>
     education, and I ask why not every patriot, 
     <lb/>
     with a view to secure the same result, adopt 
     <lb/>
     the same course as Mr. Brown did then ? 
     <lb/>
     Such was the position in 1875, when the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories were organized.  The question then 
     <lb/>
     sprung up, and I well recollect what took 
     <lb/>
     place at that time. When Mr. Mackenzie 
     <lb/>
     introduced the Bill there were no provisions 
     <lb/>
     in it regarding the question of education. As 
     <lb/>
     soon as the Premier sat down. Mr. Blake. 
     <lb/>
     who was not a member of the Government 
     <lb/>
     at that time, but was a prominent supporter 
     <lb/>
     of the Administration, rose and made some 
     <lb/>
     remarks. Speaking of the general power of 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature, he went on to say : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It give the Council all the powers practically en<lb break="no"/>joyed by this Parliament and the Local Legislatures 
     <lb/>
     together ; and it would be proper to restrict and de<lb break="no"/>fine their powers in all matters connected with muni<lb break="no"/>cipal government, and provision should be made at 
     <lb/>
     the earliest possible moment for municipal institu<lb break="no"/>tions, local taxation, and improvements. He 
     <lb/>
     regarded it as essential under the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     of the country, and in view of the deliberation 
     <lb/>
     during the last few days (referring to the New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick school question) that a general principle 
     <lb/>
     should be laid down in the Bill with respect to 
     <lb/>
     public instruction. He did believe that we ought 
     <lb/>
     not to introduce in that Territory, the heart-burn<lb break="no"/>ings and difficulties with which certain other por<lb break="no"/>tions of this Dominion and other countries had 
     <lb/>
     been afflicted. It seemed to him, having regard 
     <lb/>
     to the fact that, as far as we could expect at pre<lb break="no"/>sent, the general character of that population 
     <lb/>
     would be somewhat analogous to the population of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, that there should be some provision in the 
     <lb/>
     constitution by which they should have conferred 
     <lb/>
     upon them the same rights and privileges in regard 
     <lb/>
     to religious instruction as those possessed by the 
     <lb/>
     people of the province of Ontario. The principle 
     <lb/>
     of local self-govormnent and the settling of the 
     <lb/>
     question of public instruction, it seemed to him, 
     <lb/>
     ought to be the cardinal principles of the measure.

     not in the first place attract his attention, but

     when he came to the subject of local taxation he

     This provision was introduced at that time.

     Not a word of dissent was expressed. It 
     <lb/>
     became the law of the country, and is the

     law of the country to-day, and this is the

     to remove from the Statute-book. I will 
     <lb/>
     not discuss with the hon. gentleman here

     or anywhere else at present, at all events, 
     <lb/>
     the subject of separate schools. There are 
     <lb/>
     different views as to those schools. This 
     <lb/>
     question does not, however, come up for 
     <lb/>
     discussion on the floor of this House to-day. 
     <lb/>
     I have noted all the objections brought for<lb break="no"/>ward to the separate school system in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west. It is alleged that it is very ex<lb break="no"/>pensive, more expensive than the system of 
     <lb/>
     public schools. So be it—I will not discuss 
     <lb/>
     the matter with the hon. gentleman. Let 
     <lb/>
     me, however, observe this, that if the system 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools is more expensive than 
     <lb/>
     the system of public schools, the minority 
     <lb/>
     will suffer, and not the majority, in fact, it 
     <lb/>
     will be so much worse for the minority ; but 
     <lb/>
     if the minority are willing to pay that price 
     <lb/>
     in order to have their own schools and their 
     <lb/>
     own system of education, why should this 
     <lb/>
     be a matter of offence, or a subject even of 
     <lb/>
     objection on the part of the majority ? But 
     <lb/>
     I will not discuss the question with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, and I will not discuss the ob<lb break="no"/>jections he has raised. I ask : is it advis<lb break="no"/>able, let separate schools he objectionable,

     they cannot be more objectionable today 
     <lb/>
     than they were in 1876, or in 1864, when 
     <lb/>
     Confederation took place—they are just the 
     <lb/>
     same now as they were then—is it advisable, 
     <lb/>
     in view of our present condition, in the hope 
     <lb/>
     we entertain of forming a nation on this con<lb break="no"/>tinent, because after all that is the hope we 
     <lb/>
     entertain to-day—is it advisable. entertain<lb break="no"/>ing, as we do that hope, to go back to the old 
     <lb/>
     heart-burnings, which Mr. Brown declared 
     <lb/>
     to exist in 1864, and open up again the 
     <lb/>
     question to agitation which we had hoped 
     <lb/>
     was finally closed at that time ? I know 
     <lb/>
     very well there are men, I will not say in 
     <lb/>
     this House, but in the province of Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps elsewhere, who would be pleas<lb break="no"/>ed to have the door opened to that agitation 
     <lb/>
     and have the whole system of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools discussed again, not as regards the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, but also as regards the provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec and Ontario. Well, there may 
     <lb/>
     be two sides to this question. Looking at 
     <lb/>
     the press of Ontario we find this idea express<lb break="no"/>ed : but the question was discussed before, 
     <lb/>
     and when it came to be discussed practically 
     <lb/>
     by practical men, it was found advisable to 
     <lb/>
     allow matters to remain as they are at the 
     <lb/>
     present time, and allow a minority to have 
     <lb/>
     separate schools where they desire them. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend has surely not forgotten the con<lb break="no"/>vention of the Equal Rights Association, 
     <lb/>
     which sat in Toronto in June, 1889. Among 
     <lb/>
     the other subjects that were discussed there 
     <lb/>
     was this very question of separate schools.

     schools were a menace to the country. The 
     <lb/>
     subject came to be debated, and there was 
     <lb/>
     in that convention a gentleman whose name 
     <lb/>
     is a household word to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, I mean Professor Cavan, a man of 
     <lb/>
     sterling worth, a man of unspotted character 
     <lb/>
     and of great breadth of thought. Principal 
     <lb/>
     Cavan, speaking on the amendment and sub- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     amendment, used the following language :—

     Principal Cavan said that he was entirely in 
     <lb/>
     sympathy with those who opposed separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     The separate schools, most unfortunately, were 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed by the Act of Confederation, when this 
     <lb/>
     question had been thoroughly taken into account. 
     <lb/>
     There was another thing. Their Protestant brethren 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada had also in some sense the 
     <lb/>
     system of separate schools, and they must take 
     <lb/>
     extreme care they did " not take ground that 
     <lb/>
     would be injurious to their brethren in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec. The resolution before the chair was 
     <lb/>
     framed by gentlemen every one of whom was 
     <lb/>
     opposed to separate schools, in Ontario, and he 
     <lb/>
     would never vote for it if it expressed by implica<lb break="no"/>tion acquiescence in the separate schools, but they 
     <lb/>
     could not undertake at one stroke the entire reform 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion. They had concentrated them<lb break="no"/>selves upon one great and flagrant violation of the 
     <lb/>
     law of equality and they had better get that 
     <lb/>
     righted before attacking any bad feature in the

     not believe the separate schools system was a good

     Thereupon the question of separate schools 
     <lb/>
    was dropped by the convention. Now, 
     <lb/>Sir, I have no fear, for my part, that 
     <lb/>there should ever arise an agitation in the 
     <lb/>province of Quebec for the removal of the 
     <lb/>separate schools of the Protestant minority ; 
     <lb/>but, certainly, it is only fair to ask that 
     <lb/>what is granted in Quebec to the minority 
     <lb/>should also be granted to the minority else<lb break="no"/>where. It is not unfair to ask that the one 
     <lb/>measure of justice which prevails in one 
     <lb/>province should also prevail in the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and territories. And so long as we 
     <lb/>agree to have separate schools anywhere, 
     <lb/>I see no reason why we should not agree 
     <lb/>to have them everywhere as they exist at 
     <lb/>the present time. It may be that the system 
     <lb/>of separate schools is not acceptable to the 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman (Mr. McCarthy), but does he, 
     <lb/>or does anyone, expect that it is possible 
     <lb/>to form this nation it each one of us insists

     <lb/>call his attention to the words which were 
     <lb/>pronounced upon the floor of the British

     Now, Sir, these words seem to me to apply 
     <lb/>
     to our country more than ever they applied 
     <lb/>
     to the United Kingdom. We have here a 
     <lb/>
     mixed community. As has been well ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by the member for Bellechasse (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Amyot)—although I do not share his man<lb break="no"/>ner of expressing his views—we want to 
     <lb/>
     form a nation on this continent. I appeal 
     <lb/>
     to my hon. friend from North Simcoe (Mr.

     <lb/>
     he is Protestant and I am Catholic. I call

     upon him and I call upon all Canadians, 
     <lb/>
     French or Catholic, Protestant or English, 
     <lb/>
     to sink a little of their preferences, of their

     <lb/>
     believe it would be injudicious on my part 
     <lb/>
     to protract the discussion, although the sub<lb break="no"/>ject is a tempting one. Again, I repeat : 
     <lb/>
     it is not the question of separate schools that 
     <lb/>
     I am discussing at this moment, it is simply 
     <lb/>
     the question of carrying on our system of

     Confederation upon the basis which was

     adopted in 1864, and maintained in 1875.

     <lb/>
     little history in connection with the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the North-west Territories. Since 
     <lb/>
     these Territories were acquired by Canada, 
     <lb/>
     I find that the first Act for the temporary 
     <lb/>
     government of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     and Rupert's Land, was passed in 1869. In 
     <lb/>
     that Act there is nothing as to schools. It 
     <lb/>
     would appear that a doubt arose after the 
     <lb/>
     passing of that Act as to whether or not 
     <lb/>
     its provisions were in the power of this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, and subsequently in order to 
     <lb/>
     meet the objections which were raised, and 
     <lb/>
     to settle the question whether or not that 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1869 was within the power of this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, legislation was obtained from 
     <lb/>
     the British Parliament, and the Act re<lb break="no"/>specting the establishment of provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion of Canada was assented to 
     <lb/>
     by the Imperial Parliament on the 29th 
     <lb/>
     June, 1871. Section 1 of that Act says :

     Now, Mr. Speaker, you will see from the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of that law, that this Parliament 
     <lb/>
     has been given power by the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act of 1871 to, from time to time, 
     <lb/>
     establish new provinces in the Territories, 
     <lb/>
     and at the establishment of those provinces 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories make provision for the 
     <lb/>
     constitution and administration of such pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Up to the present moment, with the 
     <lb/>
     exception of the province of Manitoba, which 
     <lb/>
     was given its constitution by the Act known as 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba Act of 1871, no provinces have 
     <lb/>
     been carved out of that vast territory. But 
     <lb/>
     no doubt the time will come—it may come 
     <lb/>
     very shortly—when the people of that coun<lb break="no"/>try will come to this Parliament and say 
     <lb/>
     that the time has arrived when one or 
     <lb/>
     more provinces should be carved out of 
     <lb/>
     what is now known as the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. Those Territories are now governed, 
     <lb/>
     as the House knows, under the laws passed 
     <lb/>
     by this Parliament from time to time, by 
     <lb/>
     a Territorial Legislature. Now, the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act of 1871 confirms and 
     <lb/>
     makes valid the Act of 1869, which I have 
     <lb/>
     quoted. The next Act relating to the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the Territories is an Act to 
     <lb/>
     make further provision for the government 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories, chapter 16, 
     <lb/>
     34 Victoria, 1871. There is nothing in that 
     <lb/>
     Act as to schools. Then, we come to chapter 
     <lb/>
     5 of 36 Victoria, 1873, and there is nothing in 
     <lb/>
     that Act as to schools. The next is chapter

     <lb/>hon. leader of the Opposition has quoted. 
     <lb/>Now, I may say for the information of the

            <p>
     The task which the Ministry has set for itself 
     <lb/>
     was the most important it was possible to conceive. 
     <lb/>
     To found primary institutions under which we 
     <lb/>
     hope to see hundreds of thousands, and the more 
     <lb/>
     sanguine among us think millions of men and 
     <lb/>
     families settled and flourishing was one of the 
     <lb/>
     noblest undertakings that could he entered upon 
     <lb/>
     by any legislative body, and that it was no small 
     <lb/>
     indication of the power and true position of this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, that Parliament should be engaged to-day 
     <lb/>
     in that important task. He agreed with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member from Kingston that the task was one that 
     <lb/>
     required time, consideration and deliberation, and 
     <lb/>
     they must take care that no false steps were made 
     <lb/>
     in such a work. He did not agree with that right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman that the Government ought to re<lb break="no"/>peal his errors. The right hon. gentleman had 
     <lb/>
     tried the institutions for the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     which he now asked the House to frame, and for 
     <lb/>
     the same reason as he had given to-day—that it 
     <lb/>
     would be better for the Dominion Government to 
     <lb/>
     keep matters in their own hands and decide what 
     <lb/>
     was best for the future. He (Mr. Blake.) believed 
     <lb/>
     that it was essential to our obtaining a large im<lb break="no"/>migration to the North-west that we should tell 
     <lb/>
     the people beforehand what those rights were to he 
     <lb/>
     in the country in which we invited them to settle. 
     <lb/>
     It was interesting to the people to know that at 
     <lb/>
     the very earliest moment there was a sufficient 
     <lb/>
     aggregate of population within a reasonable dis<lb break="no"/>tance, that aggregation would have a voice in 
     <lb/>
     the self-government of the territories, and he 
     <lb/>
     believed that the Dominion Government was wise, 
     <lb/>
     (although the measure might be brought down 
     <lb/>
     very late this session and it might be found im<lb break="no"/>possible to give it due consideration) in determin<lb break="no"/>ing in advance of settlement what the character 
     <lb/>
     of the institutions of the country should be 
     <lb/>
     in which we invite people to settle. He did not 
     <lb/>
     agree with the policy of asking people to settle in 
     <lb/>
     that western country, and tell them that a pater<lb break="no"/>nal government would look after them, and would 
     <lb/>
     give them such institutions as the Government 
     <lb/>
     thought suitable. We had better let the people 
     <lb/>
     know their fate politically and otherwise before 
     <lb/>
     they settle there. The task to be discharged now, 
     <lb/>
     or at some future time, was one of considerable 
     <lb/>
     importance. And amongst the difficulties was the 
     <lb/>
     determining of what the range of power the coun<lb break="no"/>cil would be in the first place, assuming that its 
     <lb/>
     character would be that of a mixed nominative 
     <lb/>
     and elective council, as he understood it would be, 
     <lb/>
     of the First Minister; the Council at a subsequent 
     <lb/>
     period assuming the position of a Legislative As<lb break="no"/>sembly when the population was sufficient to en<lb break="no"/>
        
        
            <cb/>

     <lb/>
     from the Honourable First Minister any distinct 
     <lb/>
      enunciation of the powers cbmmitted to the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil and afterwards to the Assembly. Looking 
     <lb/>
     over the Bill hastily, it seemed that the powers 
     <lb/>
      were amongst those of the British North America

     ought not to introduce into that territory the 
     <lb/>
     heart-burnings and difficulties with which certain 
     <lb/>
     other portions of this Dominion and other coun<lb break="no"/>tries had been afflicted. It seemed to him, having

     regard to the fact that, as far as we could expect 
     <lb/>
     at present the general character of that population 
     <lb/>
     would be somewhat analogous to the population of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, that there should be some provision in the 
     <lb/>
     constitution by which they should have conferred 
     <lb/>
     upon them the same rights and privileges in 
     <lb/>
     regard to religious instruction as those possessed 
     <lb/>
     by the people of Ontario. The principles of local 
     <lb/>
     self-government and the settling of the question of 
     <lb/>
     public instruction it seemed to him ought to be the 
     <lb/>
     cardinal principles of the measures.

     There was no other important amendment 
     <lb/>
     made, and the House sat in committee till 
     <lb/>
      six o'clock. After recess the discussion con<lb break="no"/>tinued, it appears from the record, upon 
     <lb/>
     other matters. The Bill was reported and 
     <lb/>
     received its third reading on the following 
     <lb/>
     day, namely, the 2nd of April, without dis<lb break="no"/>cussion. Now, Sir, from the reading of the 
     <lb/>
     language used by Mr. Blake on that occa<lb break="no"/>sion and the reply made to him by the then 
     <lb/>
     leader of the Government, Mr. Mackenzie, 
     <lb/>
     and considering that there was no dissenting 
     <lb/>
     voice in the House at the time that this 
     <lb/>
     amendment was proposed by Mr. Blake and 
     <lb/>
     accepted by Mr. Mackenzie, and subsequent<lb break="no"/>ly embodied by him in legislation, it is clear 
     <lb/>
     that it was made deliberately and designedly, 
     <lb/>
     because, as Mr. Blake said in his speech, 
     <lb/>
     "it was essential to our obtaining a large 
     <lb/>
     immigration to the North-west that we should 
     <lb/>
     tell the people beforehand what those rights 
     <lb/>
     were to be in the country in which we in<lb break="no"/>vited them to settle." Now, it might be well 
     <lb/>
     to read what the Hon. Alexander Macken<lb break="no"/>zie's views were on the subject of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. In the debate which took place on 
     <lb/>
     the motion of the hon. member for Victoria 
     <lb/>
     in reference to the New Brunswick School 
     <lb/>

     In this particular instance, I may say, I believe 
     <lb/>
     in the secular system—I believe in free schools, in 
     <lb/>
     the non-denominationa1 system, and if I could per<lb break="no"/>suade my fellow countrymen in Ontario or Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     or any other province to adopt that principle, it is 
     <lb/>
     the one I would give preference to above all others ; 
     <lb/>
     but I cannot shut my eyes to the fact, that in all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces there is a very considerable 
     <lb/>
     number of people—in the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     indeed, a very large majority, who believe 
     <lb/>
     that the dogmas of religion should be taught 
     <lb/>
     in the public schools—that it has an intimate 
     <lb/>
     relationship with the morality of the people— 
     <lb/>
     that it is essential to their welfare as a people, 
     <lb/>
     that the doctrines of their church should be taught, 
     <lb/>
     and religious principles according to their theory 
     <lb/>
     of religious principles be instilled into the minds 
     <lb/>
     of their children at school. For many years after 
     <lb/>
    I held a seat in the Parliament of Canada I waged 
     <lb/>a war against the principle of separate schools. I 
     <lb/>hoped to be able, young and inexperienced in 
     <lb/>politics as I then was, to establish a system to 
     <lb/>which all would ultimately yield their assent. Sir, 
     <lb/> it was impracticable in operation and impossible 
     <lb/>in political contingencies ; and consequently when 
     <lb/>the Confederation Act was passed in 1867, or 
     <lb/>rather when the Quebec resolutions were adopted 
     <lb/>in 1864 and 1865, which embodied the principle 
     <lb/>should be the law of the land, the Confederation 
     <lb/>took place, under the compact then entered upon.

            <cb/>
            <p>
     I heartily assented to that proposition, and sup<lb break="no"/>ported it by speech and vote in the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     debates. And, sir, the same ground which led me 
     <lb/>
     on that occasion to give loyal assistance to the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation project, embracing as it did the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of having separate schools for Catholics in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, and Protestants in Quebec, caused me to 
     <lb/>
     feel bound to extend at all events my sympathy, 
     <lb/>
     if I could not my active assistance, to those in 
     <lb/>
     other provinces who believed they were labouring 
     <lb/>
     under the same disability and suffering from the 
     <lb/>
     same grievance that the Catholics of Ontario com<lb break="no"/>plained of for many years.

     In that extract Mr. Mackenzie lays down 
     <lb/>
     the views that were held, not only by him<lb break="no"/>self, but by Protestants in Ontario then, 
     <lb/>
     and by Protestants, not alone in the Leg<lb break="no"/>islative Assembly, but in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. and which are, I am sure, held to<lb break="no"/>day by people who are Protestants as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie was. Now, the question before 
     <lb/>
     the House is as to whether or not we 
     <lb/>
     should, by legislation at this time, by the 
     <lb/>
     amendment to the Bill now before the 
     <lb/>
     House, take away from the minority, or 
     <lb/>
     from the people of the North-west, who 
     <lb/>
     went in there and settled on the understand<lb break="no"/>ing and with the expectation that they 
     <lb/>
     would enjoy the rights given them by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie in 1875, and I confess my opin<lb break="no"/>ion is that it would not be right or just, 
     <lb/>
     so long as the territorial condition exists 
     <lb/>
     in that territory, so long as this <choice><sic>Par<lb break="no"/>liment</sic><corr>Parliament</corr></choice> governs that country as it does 
     <lb/>to-day, so long should the law remain 
     <lb/>as it is. But when the time comes, as 
     <lb/>it must come shortly—because the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the Act of 1871, gives us the au<lb break="no"/>thority—for this Parliament to give a con<lb break="no"/>stitution to any province, or to any two 
     <lb/>provinces carved out of those Territories, 
     <lb/>then, and not till then, will the time come 
     <lb/>for this House to deal with this question 
     <lb/>of education. Nor would it be right or just 
     <lb/>that we should repeal clause 14 of the Act, 
     <lb/>as it now stands, giving the powers that 
     <lb/>were given by Mr. Mackenzie. The hon. 
     <lb/>member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) 
     <lb/>tried to argue that by the legislation which 
     <lb/>was passed by this House in 1875 and by 
     <lb/>the continuation of that upon the statutes, 
     <lb/>we were riveting upon the people of the 
     <lb/>North-west Territories a separate school 
     <lb/>system for all time ; and by way of strength<lb break="no"/>ening his argument, the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>quoted section 93 of the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act. With deference to the hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman's opinion, I cannot see the appli<lb break="no"/>cation of section 93 in the way the hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman suggests. That section says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect

     Assembly ; and so far as section 3 of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 is concerned, in my opinion, the 
     <lb/>
     same argument would prevail.  What do we 
     <lb/>
     find is the condition of things now? We 
     <lb/>
     find that, under the authority of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories Act, section 14, Ordinances 
     <lb/>
     have been passed by the territorial legislature 
     <lb/>
     in reference to education. and we find that on 
     <lb/>
     the 3lst December, 1892, an Ordinance was 
     <lb/>
     passed by that legislature which made con<lb break="no"/>siderable changes in the matter of educa<lb break="no"/>tion there. Up to that time, under the 
     <lb/>
     Ordinance immediately preceding, namely, 
     <lb/>
     the Ordinance of 1888, education in that 
     <lb/>
     country was governed by a Board of Educa<lb break="no"/>tion, which was composed of men represent<lb break="no"/>ing both the majority and the minority. 
     <lb/>
     Under the Ordinance, the inspection of the 
     <lb/>
     different schools was made by inspectors 
     <lb/>
     appointed by the different sections of the 
     <lb/>
     Board of Education. But in 1892, by the 
     <lb/>
     Ordinance passed then. we find that the 
     <lb/>
     system of inspection now is similar, so far 
     <lb/>
     as all the schools are concerned. The in<lb break="no"/>spectors are appointed by the Council of 
     <lb/>
     Public Instruction, or the Lieutenant-Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor in Council. and they are appointed 
     <lb/>
     irrespective of their religion, to inspect all 
     <lb/>
     schools, whether separate or otherwise. in 
     <lb/>
     any portion of the district for which they 
     <lb/>
     are appointed. Objection was taken here. 
     <lb/>
     in a previous debate, to that Territorial Ord<lb break="no"/>inance on the ground that by it separate 
     <lb/>
     schools were taken away from the minority. 
     <lb/>
     On the contrary, it is stated, and I think on 
     <lb/>
     good foundation. that, so far as separate 
     <lb/>
     schools are concerned, they continue to 
     <lb/>
     exist in that country to-day, to all intents 
     <lb/>
     and purposes, and it is only with regard to 
     <lb/>
    their inspection that any change has been 
     <lb/>made. And I think, in justice to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple who have gone into that country, un<lb break="no"/>der the Ordinance passed by virtue of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 14 of the Territories Act, and who 
     <lb/>established schools under that Ordinance, 
     <lb/>and subjected themselves to taxation for 
     <lb/>that purpose, believing that that law would 
     <lb/>prevail for all time to come, it would not be 
     <lb/>just or right for this Parliament now to 
     <lb/>take away, by one stroke of the pen, the 
     <lb/>rights of these people. But, when the time 
     <lb/>comes. as it may come soon, when the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of that country desire that one or more 
     <lb/>provinces shall be carved out of their terri<lb break="no"/>tory, then it will be necessary for us to 
     <lb/>give a full constitution to such provinces, 
     <lb/>then, and not till then, will we be called on 
     <lb/>to deal with this question of education.

     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). It is not my in<lb break="no"/>tention to detain the House but for a brief 
     <lb/>
     period. I am not called upon, of course, 
     <lb/>
     to address myself to the subamendment of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Victoria (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hughes). because that has already been dis<lb break="no"/>posed of, and I think that the vote of this 
     <lb/>
     House has shown that it is not easy to em<lb break="no"/>brace eighteen hundred years' history of the 
     <lb/>
     world in a motion, and get for that motion 
     <lb/>
    the support of a very large number of repre<lb break="no"/>
     
     
            <cb/>
          
          
     sentative men. Now. I have a few obser<lb break="no"/>vations to make with regard to the speech 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy). I do not agree with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman in the view he has put forward 
     <lb/>
     as to the importance of conferring upon 
     <lb/>
     the people of the North-west Territories all 
     <lb/>
     the powers of self-government that are pos<lb break="no"/>sessed by the people of the provinces. Such 
     <lb/>
     a course would be altogether at variance 
     <lb/>
     with what has transpired under representa<lb break="no"/>tive institutions, wherever the English race 
     <lb/>
     has spread, and wherever English institu<lb break="no"/>tions prevail. We know that new colonies 
     <lb/>
     are being established and governors appoint<lb break="no"/>ed to them, the instructions which are given 
     <lb/>
     these governors embrace a very much more 
     <lb/>
     limited area of legislation than in the case 
     <lb/>
     of colonies where there is a larger popula<lb break="no"/>tion existing,where society has become more 
     <lb/>
     complex and where there is a greater variety 
     <lb/>
     of interests to be dealt with. In fact, Sir. 
     <lb/>
     the growth of society does not differ very 
     <lb/>
     much from the growth of the individual. No 
     <lb/>
     one undertakes to put a minor in the full 
     <lb/>
     possession of his property and allow him to 
     <lb/>
     dispose of it just as he pleases, and, in the 
     <lb/>
     same way, no one undertakes to confer upon 
     <lb/>
     a new society all the powers that belong 
     <lb/>
     to a sovereign body. In these matters 
     <lb/>
     experience shows the wisdom and necessity 
     <lb/>
     of proper regulation. We must remember 
     <lb/>
     that the Territories are being peopled. so 
     <lb/>
     that, in a five-years term those interested in 
     <lb/>
     the government of the Territories are often 
     <lb/>
     very much smaller in number at the begin<lb break="no"/>ning of the term than at the close. And 
     <lb/>
     those who in the future, at no distant day, 
     <lb/>
     will be interested in the Territories, are 
     <lb/>
     under the jurisdiction of this Legislature 
     <lb/>
     and have a voice in moulding the legislation 
     <lb/>
     here. so that the interests and wishes of 
     <lb/>
     those who are to become inhabitants of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories are better represented than they 
     <lb/>
     would be if the matter was put into the 
     <lb/>
     control of those who are the first occupants 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories. It is for that reason 
     <lb/>
     that the House wisely kept control of this 
     <lb/>
     very important question when government 
     <lb/>
     was bestowed upon that country. If you 
     <lb/>
     look at that country to-day you will find 
     <lb/>
     they have not responsible government. In 
     <lb/>
     fact I am told by a number of the members 
     <lb/>
     from the Territories that the majority of 
     <lb/>
     the people would be opposed to responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. They confess their immatur<lb break="no"/>ity ; they confess that their circumstances 
     <lb/>
     are such that it will not always be the case 
     <lb/>
     that, with responsible government, their con<lb break="no"/>trol of larger matters would not be as great 
     <lb/>
     as through this House, in which they 
     <lb/>
     are represented in proportion to their num<lb break="no"/>bers. So. I think, there was no ground 
     <lb/>
     of complaint as  put forward by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe, that this House 
     <lb/>
     had retained for itself control over the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of education, when, in 1875, the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of representation was, to a limited  
     <lb/>
     extent, introduced into that country. Then,

     Sir, the hon. gentleman might look to the 
     <lb/>
     experience of our neighbours. Take the 
     <lb/>
     case of the territories of the United States 
     <lb/>
     that have not sufficient population to entitle 
     <lb/>
     them to become states of the union, you 
     <lb/>
     will find that what they possess is deter<lb break="no"/>mined by Congress and Congress is author<lb break="no"/>ized to make all needful rules for the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the territories. And the as<lb break="no"/>sumption throughout the territories and else<lb break="no"/>where ever since the Union has been that 
     <lb/>
     Congress could be more safely entrusted with 
     <lb/>
     the superintending control of that govern<lb break="no"/>ment than could the first settlers in the 
     <lb/>
     territory. Then, Sir, you have the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the Territories are the common property of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion. They are held in trust, if 
     <lb/>
     I may use the expression, on behalf of 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces ; and, that being so, this 
     <lb/>
     House has undertaken, in so far as it pos<lb break="no"/>sesses control, to use that control with a 
     <lb/>
     view to producing as little friction as pos<lb break="no"/>sible either with the interests or with the 
     <lb/>
     prejudices of the people, no matter what 
     <lb/>
     those interests or prejudices may be. Now, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, when you look at the subject of educa<lb break="no"/>tion prior to the union, you will find not 
     <lb/>
     that any system was expressly imposed upon 
     <lb/>
     the province, not that the principle of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools was virtually established, 
     <lb/>
    but the rule was established that where 
     <lb/>separate schools were established and had 
     <lb/>been established before the Union, they 
     <lb/>should remain, and where they were not 
     <lb/>established, the province should retain con<lb break="no"/>trol over the subject to introduce them or 
     <lb/>prevent their introduction, as seemed pro<lb break="no"/>per to the people. We have a practical 
     <lb/>illustration of this fact in the position of 
     <lb/>things in the Maritime Provinces and the 
     <lb/>provinces of Ontario and Quebec. So  far 
     <lb/>as the Territories were concerned—I do not 
     <lb/>at all admit that the introduction of separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools there stands upon the same foot<lb break="no"/>ing as the introduction of separate schools 
     <lb/>in the province of Ontario, or of dissentient 
     <lb/>schools in the province of Quebec. In these 
     <lb/>provinces they are protected under the con<lb break="no"/>stitution ; they cannot be interfered with 
     <lb/>by the Local Legislature. But in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, as the hon. Minister has 
     <lb/>said, it has been a matter not of right, not 
     <lb/>of guarantee to any particular class of 
     <lb/>the population, but a matter of policy. They 
     <lb/>were introduced with a view of preventing 
     <lb/>conflict in this House upon the subject of 
     <lb/>separate schools and for the reason that 
     <lb/>they were introduced there they should be 
     <lb/>maintained as long as these Territories are 
     <lb/>under the control of this Parliament. When 
     <lb/>this Parliament has discharged its duties 
     <lb/>and when the people of these Territories 
     <lb/>have received the population to entitle them 
     <lb/>to enter the union they must assume the 
     <lb/>responsibility of deciding for themselves 
     <lb/>under the British North America Act how 
     <lb/>far they shall maintain the principle of 
     <lb/>separate schools or maintain  the non-de<lb break="no"/>nominational system. Any attempt on our 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
        
        
     part whatever our inclinations of feelings 
     <lb/>
     may be to anticipate what ought to be done 
     <lb/>
     in that particular, by the province after 
     <lb/>
     its autonomy is established, instead of be<lb break="no"/>ing a source of security to its institutions 
     <lb/>
     would be a source of the greatest danger. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for North Simcoe has re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the fact that these separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in the North-west Territories are ex<lb break="no"/>pensive, that it costs a very considerable 
     <lb/>
     sum to educate children in these schools. 
     <lb/>
     If the hon. member had looked at the re<lb break="no"/>turns of the schools of the whole North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories, he would have found that there 
     <lb/>
     was very little difference in that respect 
     <lb/>
     between one class of schools and the other. 
     <lb/>
     I took the trouble of going into the accounts 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories. I was anx<lb break="no"/>ious to get some information before the 
     <lb/>
     Public Accounts Committee on the subject, 
     <lb/>
     but have been unable to do so. Any one 
     <lb/>
     can see that the expenses have been very 
     <lb/>
     large, and I do not think it is because separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools and public schools exist there, 
     <lb/>
     but it is that the people of that country 
     <lb/>
     had the means of education provided by 
     <lb/>
    grants from Parliament, and, therefore, 
     <lb/>they are not as economical as they 
     <lb/>would be if the money had been 
     <lb/>raised in the ordinary way through tax<lb break="no"/>ation of the people themselves. Now, 
     <lb/>the hon. member has said, and others 
     <lb/>hold that view, that it would be well if 
     <lb/>we could educate all our population in the 
     <lb/>same public schools. I at once accept 
     <lb/>that proposition, I say that, too, and I would 
     <lb/>be rejoiced if all our people could see alike 
     <lb/>and all accept the public schools as the 
     <lb/>only schools for the elementary education 
     <lb/>of our people. But, Sir, that is not the 
     <lb/>view taken by all the population. A very 
     <lb/>considerable number of our people wish to 
     <lb/>accompany secular with religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tion. They believe that it is a matter of 
     <lb/>immense consequence, they hold strongly 
     <lb/>to that view, and they hold to that view so 
     <lb/>strongly that wherever they are able, they 
     <lb/>will establish parish schools instead of 
     <lb/>separate schools, if these are denied them ; 
     <lb/>and they will educate their children in those 
     <lb/>schools and pay for their maintenance, be<lb break="no"/>sides contributing their portion of taxation 
     <lb/>to the maintenance of the public schools. 
     <lb/>Well, Sir, that is an expression of very 
     <lb/>strong feeling. Practical results show how 
     <lb/>strong that feeling is. Inquiry into the 
     <lb/>subject satisfies me, as I think it will 
     <lb/>satisfy any one who makes it, that if you 
     <lb/>take the centres of population in the United 
     <lb/>States, where a system of secular instruc<lb break="no"/>tion prevails, and where there are no pro<lb break="no"/>visions for denominational schools to any 
     <lb/>extent as they exist with us in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario, you will find that the per<lb break="no"/>centage of children attending. the parish 
     <lb/>schools in proportion to the number of that 
     <lb/>faith by whom those schools are supported, 
     <lb/>is greater than the percentage of children 
     <lb/>in the province of Ontario who are attend<lb break="no"/>

          ing the separate schools, showing that you 
     <lb/>
     do not secure the object which you profess 
     <lb/>
     to have in view when you do away with 
     <lb/>
     separate schools and undertake to introduce 
     <lb/>
     the entire population into the public schools 
     <lb/>
     under a secular system. You do not ac<lb break="no"/>complish that object ; you do not accom<lb break="no"/>plish another object. Under our separate 
     <lb/>
     school system in the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     we have the same examination, the same 
     <lb/>
     system of inspection, for the separate as 
     <lb/>
     for the public schools : and in that way 
     <lb/>
     we secure a fair standard for imparting that 
     <lb/>
     education which the community thinks the 
     <lb/>
     interests of the state, under a system of 
     <lb/>
     popular government, demand. Under the 
     <lb/>
     system of parish schools which must pre<lb break="no"/>vail where you have such institutions as 
     <lb/>
     those that are established in the United 
     <lb/>
     States, you have no such inspection, you 
     <lb/>
     have no such examinations. You cannot 
     <lb/>
     have ; you cannot undertake to interfere 
     <lb/>
     with the affairs of the household and to 
     <lb/>
     say how well qualified the private teacher 
     <lb/>
     employed by the voluntary contributions 
     <lb/>
     of the parents, shall be to discharge the 
     <lb/>
     work in which he is engaged. So far as I 
     <lb/>
     have been able to examine those institutions, 
     <lb/>
     the great majority of the parish schools, 
     <lb/>
     say in the state of Michigan, where they 
     <lb/>
     exist, are altogether inferior in point of 
     <lb/>
     efficiency to the separate schools that are 
     <lb/>
     established in Ontario. Now, that being so, 
     <lb/>
     I think we ought, as public men, to look 
     <lb/>
     at practical results rather than at ideal 
     <lb/>
     notions of theoretical perfectibility, which 
     <lb/>
     we are not likely to attain, and which cer<lb break="no"/>tainly has not been attained, but has proved 
     <lb/>
     a very great failure where an opposite 
     <lb/>
     system has been tried. But, however that 
     <lb/>
     may be, I think this is perfectly plain, that 
     <lb/>
     if we are not to make this House and this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament the arena of religious conten<lb break="no"/>tion, if we are not to raise religion against 
     <lb/>
     religion and race against race in the national 
     <lb/>
     assembly of Canada, we must abstain from 
     <lb/>
     undertaking to  make this a battle ground 
     <lb/>
     for a decision of the question as to whether 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories there shall be a system 
     <lb/>
     of wholly secular education or not. We 
     <lb/>
     leave that question, under the restrictions im<lb break="no"/>posed by the Act of 1875, to the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories ; and when they have ob<lb break="no"/>tained the maturity entitling them to re<lb break="no"/>presentation as a province, then the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of that province, subject to the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, subject to the restrictions 
     <lb/>
     which that Act imposes, must decide for 
     <lb/>
     themselves what system of education will 
     <lb/>
     be established there. I believe myself, if 
     <lb/>
     I were a voter, I would vote to establish 
     <lb/>
     the Ontario system in the Territories ; but, 
     <lb/>
     not being a resident of the Territories. not 
     <lb/>
     expecting  to be when they become a pro<lb break="no"/>vince. I must leave that question to them, 
     <lb/>
     because they are the parties who will be 
     <lb/>
     chiefly affected by the decision to which 
     <lb/>
     they come. Now, my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
  
  
            <cb/>
        
        
     Bellechasse (Mr. Amyot) has spoken about 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of section 146 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, arguing, as I under<lb break="no"/>stand him, that the question has already 
     <lb/>
     been decided in that Territory, not by this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, but by the terms of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act itself. I do not see that, 
     <lb/>
     By section 146 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act it was open to us when we acquired 
     <lb/>
     that Territory, and when we acquired the 
     <lb/>
     Territory now constituting the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba along with it—I say it was open 
     <lb/>
     to us to set out in our application for the 
     <lb/>
     acquisition of the territory, the terms and 
     <lb/>
     conditions upon which it was to be gov<lb break="no"/>erned. The Act contemplated our doing so, 
     <lb/>
     the Act contemplated our stating with what 
     <lb/>
     population any portion of that territory 
     <lb/>
     should become a province. We did not do 
     <lb/>
     that, we acquired the territory without set<lb break="no"/>ting out any terms and conditions within 
     <lb/>
     the meaning that it was necessary to put 
     <lb/>
     upon these words in the Act. And while 
     <lb/>
     we may have power to govern it as colonies, 
     <lb/>
     as provinces of the Dominion, we had no 
     <lb/>
     power to constitute a province or to admit 
     <lb/>
     that province to the Union, we had no power 
     <lb/>
     to make a federal union with provinces that 
     <lb/>
     were already united. And so when Mani<lb break="no"/>toba was admitted to the Union, that was 
     <lb/>
     so apparent, so obvious to every person 
     <lb/>
     who had carefully inquired into the mat<lb break="no"/>ter, that Imperial legislation was necessary 
     <lb/>
     to consummate that object; and then amend<lb break="no"/>ments were sought to the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act by the Act of 1871 for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of enabling us to do in the future 
     <lb/>
     what we had not power to do at that time, 
     <lb/>
     what we had power to do if we had exer<lb break="no"/>cised the power when we obtained the ad<lb break="no"/>mission of the territory, but not having done 
     <lb/>
     so, then our opportunity had passed alto<lb break="no"/>gether. Now, how is that territory to be 
     <lb/>
     governed when it is admitted to the Union ? 
     <lb/>
     We cannot make terms and conditions that 
     <lb/>
     will alter the distribution of power, that is 
     <lb/>
     not the meaning of the terms and conditions. 
     <lb/>
     The terms and conditions mean the financial 
     <lb/>
     terms and conditions; but as to the distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of power, that is determined by the 
     <lb/>
     Act, and the very words which provide that 
     <lb/>
     the Queen may by an Order in Council admit 
     <lb/>
     other territories, also provides that they 
     <lb/>
     shall be not inconsistent with the provi<lb break="no"/>sions of the Act. The distribution of power 
     <lb/>
     must be the same, the power to legislate 
     <lb/>
     on the subject of education must be the 
     <lb/>
     same in a province admitted from that ter<lb break="no"/>ritory that it is in a province already with<lb break="no"/>in the Union. If a province already within 
     <lb/>
     the Union had established separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     it has no power to take them away ; 
     <lb/>
     but the Act does not contemplate ap<lb break="no"/>plying that rule to a territory. When 
     <lb/>Ontario decided to adopt the school 
     <lb/>system it was established by her own act. 
     <lb/>The system of separate schools established in 
     <lb/>Quebec was established by her own act ; 
     <lb/>it was done deliberately by the province, 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <pb n="6125" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06125.jpg"/>

     and when a province decided to establish 
     <lb/>
     a system of separate schools that system 
     <lb/>
     could only be got rid of by the act of the 
     <lb/>
     province.

     attach no importance to the promises given

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). I attach no im<lb break="no"/>portance to any one's promises; I attach 
     <lb/>
     importance to the constitution itself. What 
     <lb/>
     the constitution decides is to govern us. We 
     <lb/>
     have decided at diiferent times that this is 
     <lb/>
     the best means of securing the settlement 
     <lb/>
     of the country and its contentment, and of 
     <lb/>
     avoiding the differences and conflicting 
     <lb/>
     opinions on the subject of religion in this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, and I believe we decided right<lb break="no"/>ly. I see no reason why we should change 
     <lb/>
     that policy , I believe it is the proper policy 
     <lb/>
     to pursue; but it is not a compact under 
     <lb/>
     the terms of the British Neith America Act, 
     <lb/>
     as the terms entered into with the provinces  
     <lb/>
     of Ontario and Quebec constitute a com<lb break="no"/>pact. It is a matter of policy, as a matter 
     <lb/>
     of policy we have supported it, and as a 
     <lb/>
     matter of policy it is attacked by the reso<lb break="no"/>lution which the hon. gentleman has pre<lb break="no"/>sented to the House to-day. If it was a 
     <lb/>
     constitutional rule irrepealable by this House 
     <lb/>
     the motion of the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) would amount to 
     <lb/>
     nothing; but everybody knows that if the 
     <lb/>
     motion of the hon. gentleman were adopted 
     <lb/>
     it would alter the policy we have pursued 
     <lb/>
     heretofore, which I believe we adopted in 
     <lb/>
     the public interest. When the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories or any portion of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories are sutficiently numerous to constitute 
     <lb/>
     a province, when in fact, they attain thei1 
     <lb/>
     majority in regard to local matters and 
     <lb/>
     when they propose to set up for themselves, 
     <lb/>
     this Parliament has no right to exercise con<lb break="no"/>trol over them, no right to exercise any 
     <lb/>
     authority; it can give good advice, but it 
     <lb/>
     has no right to give commands. But we are 
     <lb/>
     not dealing with the future. When the 
     <lb/>
     Territories have a sufficient population to 
     <lb/>
     entitle them to become a province, they 
     <lb/>
     must decide for themselves whether they 
     <lb/>
     will have separate schools or not. I have 
     <lb/>
     my view as to what will be the best decision 
     <lb/>
     for them to arrive at, but I must not im<lb break="no"/>pose on them my view as regards the present 
     <lb/>
     time as to how they should be governed 
     <lb/>
     after they have attained their majority. I 
     <lb/>
     think what we have before us is the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875. Shall we amend it in this particular— 
     <lb/>
     shall we go on as we are ? Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     think we have difficulties enough without 
     <lb/>
     undertaking to create more, and I am per<lb break="no"/>fectly sure this will be an additional one if 
     <lb/>
     we adopt the amendment of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). I 
     <lb/>
     am satisfied we would govern this country 
     <lb/>
     with less success. We would have addition<lb break="no"/>al toad's heads in the witch's cauldron. I 
     <lb/>
     do not know what might come of it, but 
     <lb/>
     certainly something more serious than we 
     <lb/>
    have at the present time. I differ widely 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
         
         
         with the Government on questions of public 
     <lb/>policy; I differ with them on questions of 
     <lb/>tariff, on public expenditures, on schemes by 
     <lb/>which large sums of money are expended, on 
     <lb/>which I believe to be profitless enterprises, 
     <lb/>and I would like the people to have an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of pronouncing their opinion upon 
     <lb/>these questions, and of dealing with them 
     <lb/>before we introduce other subjects, for my 
     <lb/>personal view is that an expression of public 
     <lb/>opinion upon them is very important. Tal<lb break="no"/>leyrand has said that this world comes be<lb break="no"/>fore the next, and I agree with that opinion, 
     <lb/>and I prefer to settle those questions which 
     <lb/>affect our material well-being at this moment 
     <lb/>without interfering with other questions 
     <lb/>that might end in a cyclone.

     <persName ref="pers:THOM21">Sir JOHN THOMPSON</persName>. I am sure those 
     <lb/>
     who have followed the debate must realize 
     <lb/>
     that there is very little left to say, and 
     <lb/>
     I shall act taccordingly by curtailing my ob<lb break="no"/>servations. I listened attentively, as no doubt 
     <lb/>
     we all did to the 1e111arks of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe (Mr. McCalthy) because 
     <lb/>
     this is one of the few occasions when we have 
     <lb/>
     had the opporttmity to listen to the line of 
     <lb/>
     argument by which the hon. gentleman will 
     <lb/>
     endeavour to support his measure. I 
     <lb/>
     gathered from the observations of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member that he assumed that the conferring 
     <lb/>
     of powers upon the Legislative Assembly 
     <lb/>
     of the North—west was entirely an arbitrary 
     <lb/>
     act. that we selected one or more powers. 
     <lb/>
     and added occasionally from time to time 
     <lb/>
     other powers, and the hon. gentleman there<lb break="no"/>fore thought he felt justified in calling upon 
     <lb/>
     us to say what reasons should be given as to 
     <lb/>
     why this power. as to education, should not 
     <lb/>
     be added. I think, when we examine a little 
     <lb/>
     and reflect on the observations already made 
     <lb/>
     in the. course of this debate, we shall see. 
     <lb/>
     that it is for the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe (Mr. McCarathy) to establish a reason 
     <lb/>
     why we should make the change. and that he 
     <lb/>
     is not in a position to ask us why this 
     <lb/>
     power ought not to be added. A my one 
     <lb/>
     who reads the powers which have been 
     <lb/>
     given to the provinces by the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act and contrasts them with the 
     <lb/>
     powers which have been given by this Par<lb break="no"/>liament to the Legislature of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories will perceive at a glance the 
     <lb/>
     diiference which exists in the treatment of 
     <lb/>
     the two cases, the different provinces as 
     <lb/>
     compared with the Territories. In the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act the British Par<lb break="no"/>liament was dealing with provinces having 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy before the Act of 
     <lb/>
     Union, and the distribution of powers was 
     <lb/>
     simply to be a redistribution, in view of are 
     <lb/>
     fact that this Parliament was to he created 
     <lb/>
     and the Federal system to be established. 
     <lb/>
     In dealing with the Territories we were 
     <lb/>
     legislating from time to time for a country 
     <lb/>
     which was to remain, until provinces should 
     <lb/>
     be established under the legislative con<lb break="no"/>trol of this Parliament. And what share 
     <lb/>
     did we give to the Territorial Legislature in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the matter of legislation ? We 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <pb n="6127" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06127.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">6128</fw>
       
       
     gave it a number of powers—a large num<lb break="no"/>ber of the powers given by the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act to the Provincial Legislatures. 
     <lb/>
     But mark the broad line of distinction which 
     <lb/>
     was drawn by this Parliament. Matters re<lb break="no"/>ferring to the constitution of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     it was not to be in their power to change, 
     <lb/>
     for the reason that the constitution was to 
     <lb/>
     be in the hands of this Parliament to change 
     <lb/>
     from time to time. A province from the 
     <lb/>
     outset had the right of autonomous govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It had a responsible system of gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The Territories were not to have 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, they were not to 
     <lb/>
     have autonomy in that sense, but were to 
     <lb/>
     remain from day to day to be controlled by 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature here, and by Orders in 
     <lb/>
     Council issued by His Excellency and his 
     <lb/>
     advisers. Again, the provinces were to 
     <lb/>
     have the right to increase their debt from 
     <lb/>
     time to time. But, because of the very 
     <lb/>
     guardianship which we have over those Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, the Legislature there were not allow<lb break="no"/>ed to incur any debt. One other important 
     <lb/>
     characteristic was to be considered in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the Territories while they were to 
     <lb/>
     remain in the Territorial condition, and that 
     <lb/>
     was in view of the peculiar circumstances 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories, the fact that we were in<lb break="no"/>viting there all races, creeds and denomin<lb break="no"/>ations, there was to be the widest toleration 
     <lb/>
     while the Territories existed. That was 
     <lb/>
     the corner-stone of the whole; the corner-stone 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy) proposes to remove, on the ground 
     <lb/>
     that there can be no good reason given for 
     <lb/>
     its existence. As the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition has said to-night: no men knew 
     <lb/>
     better than those who were engaged in 
     <lb/>
     framing the Act of 1875, the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     which, sectarian disputes might create in 
     <lb/>
     that new country. No one realized better 
     <lb/>
     the fact, that in so far as the population was 
     <lb/>
     to be gathered into the Territories from 
     <lb/>
     the older provinces, it was to be gathered 
     <lb/>
     from different races, and from amongst men 
     <lb/>
     who had strong lines of difference as re<lb break="no"/>gards religious belief. While the popu<lb break="no"/>lation should be going in there, and while 
     <lb/>
     the Territories should remain under our con<lb break="no"/>trol, at least, there was to be the broadest 
     <lb/>
     toleration for every belief, and for the 
     <lb/>
     races, as regards worship, and as re<lb break="no"/>gards larguage and as regards instruction 
     <lb/>
     in the schools. Is it anything new for us 
     <lb/>
     to be told to-day that toleration was expen<lb break="no"/>sive, and that therefore we should not de<lb break="no"/>termine as our predecessors in 1875 deter<lb break="no"/>mined, that the settlers should be allowed in 
     <lb/>
     that country to educate their children ac. 
     <lb/>
     cording to their religious convictions ? Edu<lb break="no"/>cation new is not more expensive than it 
     <lb/>
     was then. They understood perfectly that 
     <lb/>
     as regards the welfare of these people, and 
     <lb/>
     the development of these Territories, there 
     <lb/>
     would be nothing so expensive and burden<lb break="no"/>some to Government as the want of ample 
     <lb/>
     toleration everywhere, whether as regards re<lb break="no"/>ligions worship, religious education, or the 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <cb/>
         
         
     language which the people should speak and 
     <lb/>
     in which they should legislate. That was 
     <lb/>
     the whole Territorial scheme. It was not 
     <lb/>
     therefore, an accidental and haphazard man<lb break="no"/>ner in which certain powers were dealt out 
     <lb/>
     indiscriminately from time to time; but 
     <lb/>
     there was a deliberate scheme framed for 
     <lb/>
     legislation with regard to the Territories 
     <lb/>
     which should—while they were in the 'Ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial condition—keep them not only under 
     <lb/>
     the control of this Parliament, but keep them 
     <lb/>
     governed upon principles consistent with the 
     <lb/>
     policy of this Parliament, a policy which this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament conceived to be the best adapted 
     <lb/>
     for the peopling of the Territories. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). 
     <lb/>
     after having challenged us to give the rea<lb break="no"/>sons why these powers shduld not be con<lb break="no"/>ferred, stated some reasons which would 
     <lb/>
     seem in his opinion to have justified a pro<lb break="no"/>posal to break up the system of the past. 
     <lb/>
     The first was: that while the population of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories only consisted of 66,000 per<lb break="no"/>sons, a little more than 13,000 of these pro' 
     <lb/>
     fess the Roman Catholic belief, and his 
     <lb/>
     deduction from that is—if the fact admits 
     <lb/>
     of any deduction at all and if the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member will apply that fact to his pro<lb break="no"/>posal—that because only 13,000 persons have 
     <lb/>
     accepted the pledge and the good faith of 
     <lb/>
     this Parliament as to the maintenance of 
     <lb/>
     certain institutions there, namely, the right 
     <lb/>
     to enducate their children according to their 
     <lb/>
     religious belief, it is a matter of no im<lb break="no"/>portance that we should break faith with 
     <lb/>
     these 13,000 people. It is just as much a 
     <lb/>
     matter of sound policy now as it was in 
     <lb/>
     1875, that teleration should exist there, and 
     <lb/>
     that we should extend the broadest invita<lb break="no"/>tion to the people of different races and re<lb break="no"/>ligions to come and settle there with a per- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     feet sense of toleration ; and it matters not 
     <lb/>
     how many people in the past have availed 
     <lb/>
     themselves of our invitation. The bad faith 
     <lb/>
     this Parliament would show in repealing a 
     <lb/>
     provision of that kind, while the Territorial 
     <lb/>
     system existed at least, would be just as 
     <lb/>
     great as if the population who availed them<lb break="no"/>selves of our pledge and relied on that sys<lb break="no"/>tem today, were only thirteen, instead of 
     <lb/>
     13,000. The hon. gentleman (Mr. McCarthy) 
     <lb/>
     in the next stage of his argument said that 
     <lb/>
     it was an expensive thing to keep up a 
     <lb/>
     system of toleration, that it was an ex<lb break="no"/>pensive thing to maintain separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     I have suggested to the House that the 
     <lb/>
     statesmen who framed the Act of 1875 knew 
     <lb/>
     as much, from their experience of the older 
     <lb/>
     provinces, about the expense of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools as we do now. The hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     argument, if anything, was this: that the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic schools of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories are more expensive than the pub<lb break="no"/>lic and Protestant schools. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman did not complete his argument be<lb break="no"/>cause he did not complete his facts by 
     <lb/>
     showing us what the facts are as regards 
     <lb/>
     the schools taken as a whole. He went on 
     <lb/>
     further to say that in consequence of the 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <pb n="6129" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06129.jpg"/>

     Catholic schools being attended by a smaller 
     <lb/>
     number of pupils, the average cost per head 
     <lb/>
     of the pupils was greater than in the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant schools. Where I thought the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member (Mr. McCarthy) did the greatest 
     <lb/>
     injustice to the question was, that he under<lb break="no"/>took to compare the cost, with the cost of 
     <lb/>
     education per pupil in the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario where conditions are as widely dif— 
     <lb/>
     ferent as they possibly can be. Every one 
     <lb/>
     knows that spareness of the settlement in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories, the high price which teachers 
     <lb/>
     have to be paid there, and other such con<lb break="no"/>ditions are peculiar to every community 
     <lb/>
     of the like kind. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     had taken for example the statistics, not 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Ontario, but of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Brtish Columbia, in parts where 
     <lb/>
     the like conditions exist, he would find 
     <lb/>
     that he had no word of reproach to utter 
     <lb/>
     as regards the cost of the separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories. One of my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friends here has furnished me with the 
     <lb/>
     figures as regards the cost of education per 
     <lb/>
     pupil in the outlying districts of British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia, and just observe these results as 
     <lb/>
     compared with the results which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member (Mr. McCarthy) read :

            <p>
     That is a comparison with a province 
     <lb/>
     where education is economically managed, 
     <lb/>
     and managed regardless of the separate 
     <lb/>
     school lines which are complained of as 
     <lb/>
     having introduced a want of economy 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories. But, 
     <lb/>
     as pointed out by the leader of the Op<lb break="no"/>position, within the lines of our constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, which provides that separate schools 
     <lb/>
     may be established and must be provided 
     <lb/>
     for there, we know that the regulation of 
     <lb/>
     the schools, as regards expenses and as re<lb break="no"/>gards management, is under the control of 
     <lb/>
     the Territorial Legislature, to-day, and if 
     <lb/>
     the schools are expensive under the present 
     <lb/>
     system, they are no more expensive than 
     <lb/>
     the Territorial Legislature has thought fit to 
     <lb/>
     make them. Now, there was one argument 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
     
     
     advanced by the hon. memebr for North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe which has already been answered, 
     <lb/>
     but with respect to which I wish again to 
     <lb/>
     put the view we take ; because it would be 
     <lb/>
     a point of the greatest importance if the 
     <lb/>
     argument of the hon. gentleman were well 
     <lb/>
     founded. The hon. gentleman stated that 
     <lb/>
     one important reason why the system of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in the Territories should 
     <lb/>
     be abolished, and abolished at once, was that 
     <lb/>
     by allowing it to remain we were riveting 
     <lb/>
     the system on the future provinces : and the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman relied on the provision of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act, which says : 
     <lb/>
     that nothing in the Act of any province— 
     <lb/>
     and he was referring to the provinces which 
     <lb/>
     might hereafter be established—should take 
     <lb/>
     away or prejudicially affect any right or 
     <lb/>
     privilege with respect to denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools which any class of persons have, by 
     <lb/>
     law, in the province at the time of the Union. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman's argument, of course, 
     <lb/>
     was that if this system were allowed to 
     <lb/>
     stand until provinces are created, we would, 
     <lb/>
     by force of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     be unable to withdraw that system, and that 
     <lb/>
     it would be riveted on the provinces. As has 
     <lb/>
     been shown by the hon. member for Both<lb break="no"/>well, the provisions of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act relate only to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     which were entering into the Union at that 
     <lb/>
     time, and to the provinces which were named 
     <lb/>
     in the last section of the Act as entitled 
     <lb/>
     to be admitted into the Union, and have no 
     <lb/>
     relation whatever to the provinces which are 
     <lb/>
     to be created out of the Territorial district 
     <lb/>
     of the country. That is clearly seen when 
     <lb/>
     we come to the British statute of 1871, 
     <lb/>
     which, for the first time, conferred the pow<lb break="no"/>er on this Parliament to create provinces out 
     <lb/>
     of our territories, and, as the hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior has said, enables this Par<lb break="no"/>liament to decide what the constitutions of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces shall be. We claim, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that the constitutional system which 
     <lb/>
     was established with regard to schools and 
     <lb/>
     with regard to language in 1875 ought to 
     <lb/>
     be maintained for the same reasons as 
     <lb/>
     those which dictated its creation, and that 
     <lb/>
     this condition of affairs should last, at least. 
     <lb/>
     while the affairs of the Territories are under 
     <lb/>
     the control of this Parliament. What the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the future provinces shall 
     <lb/>
     be, in view of the pledges which have been 
     <lb/>
     referred to, or in view of any other set of 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, will be for Parliament to 
     <lb/>
     decide when it decides to create those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I hope, therefore, that the House 
     <lb/>
     will be careful to-day not to disturb the 
     <lb/>
     arrangement so wisely made in 1875, and 
     <lb/>
     which is as useful to the Territories now 
     <lb/>
     as it was then.

     <persName ref="pers:CRAI1">Mr. CRAIG</persName>. Mr. Speaker, I would ask 
     <lb/>
     the indulgence of the House for a few min<lb break="no"/>utes while I state my views on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. I am the more anxious to do this, as 
     <lb/>
     a few days ago I paired with a member 
     <lb/>
     of the Opposition, and so am not able to 
     <lb/>
     record my vote. I do not intend to try to 
     <lb/>
          
          
            <pb n="6131" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06131.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">6132</fw>
         
         
     answer any of the arguments which have 
     <lb/>
     been offered, or to defend any of the posi<lb break="no"/>tions which have been taken : I merely wish 
     <lb/>
     to state my own position on the question, 
     <lb/>
     and to give my reasons for holding that 
     <lb/>
     position. If I did vote to-night, I would 
     <lb/>
     support the amendment moved by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). 
     <lb/>
     One of my reasons for doing so would be 
     <lb/>
     that the amendment proposes, as we have 
     <lb/>
     heard tonight, to leave this question entirely 
     <lb/>
     to the Legislature of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Now, it has been taken for granted 
     <lb/>
     by a great many speakers that if this were 
     <lb/>
     done, separate schools in the Territories 
     <lb/>
     would be abolished. Of that I know nothing 
     <lb/>
     at all ; but it does seem to me that if the 
     <lb/>
     members of that Legislature are competent 
     <lb/>
     to deal with the subjects which are com<lb break="no"/>mitted to their care, they are equally com<lb break="no"/>petent to deal with the subject of educa<lb break="no"/>tion ; and, for my part, I would vote to 
     <lb/>
     give them that authority. Now, why should 
     <lb/>
     this Parliament interfere in this matter at 
     <lb/>
     all ? I think there is one very good rea<lb break="no"/>son, and that is that Parliament has inter<lb break="no"/>fered already. Parliament has imposed on 
     <lb/>
     those Territories, separate schools, and I 
     <lb/>
     think Parliament is the body to remove 
     <lb/>
     them. But it is said by some, and this is 
     <lb/>
     supposed to be a very strong argument ; 
     <lb/>
     wait until a province is created. It has 
     <lb/>
     been replied to that by those who favour this 
     <lb/>
     amendment that if separate schools are 
     <lb/>
     allowed until that time, they will be for<lb break="no"/>ever fastened on that province by the con<lb break="no"/>stitution. That point I do not pretend to 
     <lb/>
     know anything about ; but it did occur to 
     <lb/>
     me, in thinking on this question, that if 
     <lb/>
     separate schools were allowed by the con<lb break="no"/>stitution to remain in the Territories until 
     <lb/>
     that time, then the question of vested rights 
     <lb/>
     would be set up. I am satisfied of that in 
     <lb/>
     my own mind. Those who favoured separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools, while they might have no legal 
     <lb/>
     right to set up that contention, would, no 
     <lb/>
     doubt, set it up, and I would not blame 
     <lb/>
     them for doing so. If I were in their posi<lb break="no"/>tion, I would do the same thing ; and if 
     <lb/>
     the separate schools were allowed to remain 
     <lb/>
     until that time, their case would be a strong 
     <lb/>
     one. So that, apart from the question of 
     <lb/>
     law or the question of the constitution alto<lb break="no"/>gether, it appears to me that that is one 
     <lb/>
     strong argument why Parliament should 
     <lb/>
     act now. Then, it is said by some that, 
     <lb/>
     after all, everything that is wanted has, in 
     <lb/>
     effect, been accomplished by the Ordinances 
     <lb/>
     passed a year or two ago by the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories. But I would point out 
     <lb/>
     that the right of that Legislation to do even 
     <lb/>
     that was questioned by those who are in 
     <lb/>
     favour of separate schools. A strong posi<lb break="no"/>tion was taken against the power of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Legislature to enact those Ordin<lb break="no"/>ances, and the Government have been appeal<lb break="no"/>ed to to veto them. And right here I want 
     <lb/>
     to say this : I give the Government great 
     <lb/>
     credit for the position they have taken on 
     <lb/>
     that question, and on the question of separ<lb break="no"/>
         
         
            <cb/>
        
        
     ate schools in Manitoba. I believe the 
     <lb/>
     Premier has done what he said he would 
     <lb/>
    do ; he has stood by the constitution, and I 
     <lb/>admire him for doing it. There is no doubt 
     <lb/>that great pressure was brought to bear up<lb break="no"/>on him to veto those Ordinances, and he 
     <lb/>has resisted that pressure, because on look<lb break="no"/>ing into the matter, he decided that the Leg<lb break="no"/>islature, in adopting them, was acting with<lb break="no"/>in its constitutional rights. So I give the 
     <lb/>Government credit for that ; and, for my<lb break="no"/>self, I may say that I have confidence that 
     <lb/>they will act in the same manner in the 
     <lb/>future. One reason why I would like the 
     <lb/>Government to act at present on this mat<lb break="no"/>ter is that the longer they delay the more 
     <lb/>the difficulties increase. It is said by some 
     <lb/>—and I admit that there is a good deal of 
     <lb/>force in the argument—that the rights of 
     <lb/>minorities ought to be protected. But I ask 
     <lb/>myself, what are those rights ? They are 
     <lb/>rights to what ? And in asking that ques<lb break="no"/>tion I have to ask another, what does the 
     <lb/>state owe to the minority ? To my mind, 
     <lb/>the answer is : a good, fair, secular educa<lb break="no"/>tion—that and nothing more. Would the 
     <lb/>minority lose that if this amendment were 
     <lb/>adopted ? I answer no, if the public schools 
     <lb/>supported in part by the state were confined 
     <lb/>to their true object, in my mind, a secular 
     <lb/>education. I hold—I know I differ from some 
     <lb/>in this—that it is not the duty of the state 
     <lb/>to teach religion ; that it is not the duty of 
     <lb/>the state to use the funds of the state to in<lb break="no"/>culcate any particular tenets ; and I apply 
     <lb/>that to all bodies. The duty of teaching re<lb break="no"/>ligion, in my opinion, belongs, not to 
     <lb/>public schools, or to any schools sup<lb break="no"/>ported in part by the state, but be<lb break="no"/>longs to parents and churches. But, in 
     <lb/>any case, we know that the state would not 
     <lb/>prohibit separate schools. I merely men<lb break="no"/>tion this, because it is thought by some that 
     <lb/>in advocating the passage of this amend<lb break="no"/>ment, we say that there should be no 
     <lb/>separate schools. But the fact of the 
     <lb/>case is, not that the state would 
     <lb/>prohibit separate schools, but that 
     <lb/>the state would decline to aid them. 
     <lb/>As I said, I have no intention of taking up 
     <lb/>the time of the House at any length, but 
     <lb/>merely wish briefly to state my views.  I 
     <lb/>want to say in conclusion that, in advocating 
     <lb/>the passage of this amendment, I am not 
     <lb/>prompted by any hostility to the Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic religion or to Roman Catholics. 
     <lb/>All who know me and know my course in 
     <lb/>this House, know that, without my saying 
     <lb/>it ; but as there is a feeling abroad in some 
     <lb/>parts of Ontario tending in that direction, 
     <lb/>I want to say publicly that I have no sym<lb break="no"/>pathy at all with any society which would 
     <lb/>ostracise a man because of his religion. That 
     <lb/>is my position. I am perfectly free from all 
     <lb/>bigotry. I do not ask whether this man or 
     <lb/>that is a Catholic or a Protestant, but whe<lb break="no"/>ther he is a respectable fellow-citizen, and 
     <lb/>I advocate the passage of this amendment, 
     <lb/>not from any hostility to any sect or body 
     <lb/>of men, but because I believe it would he

     for the good of the country. These are my 
     <lb/>
     views. I wish to take this question out of 
     <lb/>
     the domain of Dominion politics. I would 
     <lb/>
     like to see these matters of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     and religious matters banished for ever from 
     <lb/>
     our policy. I do not know that that time 
     <lb/>
     will ever come, but I shall do my part to 
     <lb/>
     bring it about; and I would be glad to see 
     <lb/>
    the time when our schools would be all pub<lb break="no"/>lic schools and our children not separated 
     <lb/>into two different sections, but growing up 
     <lb/>in public schools all over the country. I do 
     <lb/>not know whether it is possible to have that 
     <lb/>time come, but I hope it will, and will do 
     <lb/>what I can to bring it about.

     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. LaRIVIERE</persName>. I will just begin with 
     <lb/>
     the last words from the last speaker. What 
     <lb/>
     rights have minorities ? When this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment gave a constitution to Manitoba, the 
     <lb/>
     minority there, which was Protestant at the 
     <lb/>
     time, was protected in a broad and states<lb break="no"/>manlike manner. At that time, the minority 
     <lb/>
     was comprised of Protestants for the major<lb break="no"/>ity was composed of Catholics. Again, when 
     <lb/>
     in 1875 these school provisions were intro<lb break="no"/>duced into the Canadian North-west Territo<lb break="no"/>ries Act, the same state of things existed, and, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, this Parliament passed those pro<lb break="no"/>visions protecting the Protestant minority. 
     <lb/>
     But things have changed since. In Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     and the North-west Territories the minority 
     <lb/>
     has become the majority; and because this 
     <lb/>
    not any longer, as my hon. friend who has 
     <lb/>just spoken has said, any claims to protec<lb break="no"/>tion. I was exceedingly pleased with the 
     <lb/>moderate speech made this evening by the 
     <lb/>hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>(Carthy). On the first occasion he brought 
     <lb/>this question before the House, we all re<lb break="no"/>member the very obnoxious preamble which 
     <lb/>headed his Bill: and in his speech the hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman then made was very obnoxious to 
     <lb/>those who did not entertain the same views. 
     <lb/>I have since then noticed with pleasure that 
     <lb/>he has moderated his antagonism. and on 
     <lb/>this occasion he has been more moderate 
     <lb/>still, and I join with the leader of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition and the leader of the Government in 
     <lb/>complimenting him on the very moderate 
     <lb/>way in which he introduced his resolution. 
     <lb/>The hon. leader of the Opposition, in the 
     <lb/>course of his remarks, read a copy of a 
     <lb/>resolution of proceedings that took place be<lb break="no"/>fore the Equal Rights Association in Toronto. 
     <lb/>I have before me a few extracts from the 
     <lb/>speech which the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>Simcoe made before the same association in 
     <lb/>the city of Ottawa about the time it was 
     <lb/>started, and with the permission of the 
     <lb/>House I will read a few quotations from 
     <lb/>it. The hon. gentleman then said :

     to deal, not only with the dual language question 
     <lb/>
     and the iniquitous Act which would fasten it upon 
     <lb/>
     them but with the separate schools. Do you tell

     me that the Equal Rights Association had nothing

     to do with that? Of course the feeling was there, 
     <lb/>
     the greivance existed, peoples minds had only to 
     <lb/>
     be directed to it, and the moment attention was 
     <lb/>
     drawn to it, the province of Manitoba rose to a 
     <lb/>
     man and declared : we want no dual language and 
     <lb/>
     away with separate schools. * * * I am glad 
     <lb/>
     to notice the Protestant minority of Quebec had

     pleasure of addressing them in Montreal on that 
     <lb/>
     question. They all had their hands full. In 
     <lb/>
     Ontario they would have to do with the question 
     <lb/>
     of French teaching in the schools: in Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     they had the dual language to deal with ; and in 
     <lb/>
     the North-west they had the same question. As 
     <lb/>
     soon as the work had been accomplished, they 
     <lb/>
     would then be in the same position to master the

     Are they a superior kind of people from the Pro<lb break="no"/>testants that they hold themselves aloof by having

     When such articles are published in the 
     <lb/>
     public press, is it a wonder that a minority 
     <lb/>
     so small as this is represented to be by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) should be alarmed and should look 
     <lb/>
     to this Parliament for protection, protection 
     <lb/>
     which we are in duty bound to give them ? 
     <lb/>
     It has been contended that the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, the constitution under 
     <lb/>
     which we are governed, does not give as 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. It is true the constitution 
     <lb/>
     does not impose the system of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, but it protects that system where<lb break="no"/>ever- it has existed prior to the entry of a 
     <lb/>
     province into Confederation or wherever it 
     <lb/>
     is afterwards created by the province. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, I say that according to the spirit 
     <lb/>
     of the constitution such a system should 
     <lb/>
     exist, because the constitution protects it 
     <lb/>
     and, in fact, maintains it and renders it 
     <lb/>
     unassutilable from the moment it has been 
     <lb/>
     established. It is true that there is a pro<lb break="no"/>.vision in the Constitutional Act whereby the

     <lb/>
     deals with education, because that section is 
     <lb/>
     outside of the series of sections which come 
     <lb/>
     under the title " Constitution of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces." The only amendments that a pro<lb break="no"/>vince can make to its constitution would be

     speaking on this question, and should not 
     <lb/>
     have done so but for some remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     last speaker (Mr. LaRiviere), and I intend 
     <lb/>
     to occupy" but a short time. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman spoke of the Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     being in the majority in Manitoba some 
     <lb/>
     years ago. It so happened that I spent about 
     <lb/>
     a year of my life in Manitoba in 1870, and 
     <lb/>
     my recollection of the matter at that time is 
     <lb/>
     that the two classes, the Protestants and the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics were about equal in num<lb break="no"/>ber. At any rate we must not forget that 
     <lb/>
     up to that time the country had been ruled 
     <lb/>
     by the Hudson Bay Company, that it had 
     <lb/>
     been ruled as a Crown colony and that there 
     <lb/>
     were no rights such as it has been intimated 
     <lb/>
     they possessed by the member who last 
     <lb/>
     spoke. There was no such thing officially as 
     <lb/>
     the French language. Of course many of 
     <lb/>
     the people spoke it among themselves, and 
     <lb/>
     there was no wish to interfere with them in 
     <lb/>
     doing so, but the language was not recog<lb break="no"/>nized officially at least. It is true that in 
     <lb/>
     the case of rules that it might be necessary 
     <lb/>
     the. French should understand, they were 
     <lb/>
     often published in French, but further than 
     <lb/>
     that the Hudson Bay Company paid no 
     <lb/>
     attention whatever to anything of that sort. 
     <lb/>
     The only rights the French people obtained 
     <lb/>
     were obtained subsequent to that, and were 
     <lb/>
     obtained through the Bell rebellion. and 
     <lb/>
     what followed. The hon. the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition. in reading from some of the 
     <lb/>
     remarks of the Hon. George Brown, tried to 
     <lb/>
     make a point of Mr. Brown's abandoning his 
     <lb/>
     contentions with regard to separate schools 
     <lb/>
     because he was in favour of carrying Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. No doubt that was a very good rea<lb break="no"/>son why the Hon. George Brown should 
     <lb/>
     abandon these views, to lose sight of this 
     <lb/>
     question in the greater question of bringing 
     <lb/>
     about the Confederation of this great Domin<lb break="no"/>ion. But this is an entirely different question. 
     <lb/>
     The question is not one of making a great 
     <lb/>
     Dominion ; the question is what shall we do 
     <lb/>
    with these provinces we are about forming 
     <lb/>in the North-west, shall we start them with 
     <lb/>all the paraphernalia we have in Ontario 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
         
         
     and Quebec, or shall we start with a clean 
     <lb/>
     sheet and allow them to do as they please. 
     <lb/>
     As regards the language question, for my 
     <lb/>
     part—though it does not come in properly 
     <lb/>
     here, but what I shall say now may save me 
     <lb/>
     getting on my feet later—I should like to 
     <lb/>
     see the mover go even further than he has 
     <lb/>
     done, and, instead of leaving it to the people, 
     <lb/>
     declare that no other language shall be used 
     <lb/>
     except the English language. The reason is 
     <lb/>
     because we have there vast empty prairies, 
     <lb/>
     the population being sparse. If we allow the 
     <lb/>
     French language to be made an official lan<lb break="no"/>guage on account of 2 per cent of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation there is no earthly reason why we 
     <lb/>
     should not allow the same right to the 
     <lb/>
    German population who represent. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve, more than 2 per cent. Then 
     <lb/>if so, the Scandinavians, who are near<lb break="no"/>ly equal to the French in numbers, might 
     <lb/>fairly come to this House and ask us to give 
     <lb/>them the right to have the Swedish tongue 
     <lb/>spoken up there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. LaRIVIERE</persName>. What would you do 
     <lb/>
     with the English in Quebec ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. DENISON</persName>. I am not referring to Que<lb break="no"/>bec, because the French in Quebec have the 
     <lb/>
     right to speak their language by the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, and no one is talking of interfer<lb break="no"/>ing with that. I am talking now about 
     <lb/>
     empty prairies, equal almost in size to 
     <lb/>
     Europe; and the question is, how are we 
     <lb/>
     going to start them out. Are we going to 
     <lb/>
     start them out as provinces speaking one 
     <lb/>
     language, or as provinces speaking perhaps 
     <lb/>
     half a dozen languages ? I would like to 
     <lb/>
     say that I have received a telegram from 
     <lb/>
     Mr. W. F. Maclean, of East York, in which 
     <lb/>
     he asks me to state: " If present, I would 
     <lb/>
     vote with Mr. McCarthy. I am detained 
     <lb/>
     here." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McNEILL</persName>. I wish to say but very 
     <lb/>
     few words on this subject. I think the fact 
     <lb/>
     to some extent has been overlooked that we 
     <lb/>
     are dealing not only with the amendment 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friend from North Simcoe (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy) but also with the expressed wish 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislative Assembly of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. Those who are opposed to 
     <lb/>
     the amendment, I think, have carefully 
     <lb/>
     avoided any reference to that fact : but it is 
     <lb/>
     an important fact, and I think that those 
     <lb/>
     who are asking tonight that the representa<lb break="no"/>tives elected by the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories should be allowed the privilege 
     <lb/>
     of managing their own affairs in reference 
     <lb/>
     to education, as well as in reference to 
     <lb/>
     other matters, should not at all events be 
     <lb/>
     accused of intolerance. I confess I was a 
     <lb/>
     good deal surprised and a good deal hurt 
     <lb/>
     to hear the right hon. gentleman who leads 
     <lb/>
     the Government, speaking of those who ad<lb break="no"/>vocate. the views that he advocates, as 
     <lb/>
     those who are in favour of tolerance, there<lb break="no"/>by implying that the people of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia, who have not granted separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, "have been intolerant, and that the 
     <lb/>
           
           
            <pb n="6137" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06137.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">6137</fw> <fw type="dateline">[JULY 16, 1894]</fw> <fw type="num">6138</fw>
        
        
     people of the province of Ontario who dis<lb break="no"/>approve of separate schools on principle, 
     <lb/>
     and who are in favour of the resolution of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from North Simcoe, are also 
     <lb/>
     by implication intolerant. Now, I confess 
     <lb/>
     I was surprised and pained to hear the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman speak in that way, I think 
     <lb/>
     that those who conscientiously believe that 
     <lb/>
     separate schools are not for the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     the people of the North—west Territories. 
     <lb/>
     and who think that the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories ought to have the right to 
     <lb/>
     say whether they wish for separate schools 
     <lb/>
     or not, should at all events he considered 
     <lb/>
     as tolerant as those who desire that separate 
     <lb/>
     schools should exist there, and are unwilling 
     <lb/>
     to let the people of the Territories decide 
     <lb/>
     for themselves. For my part I cannot 
     <lb/>
     see that there is any more intolerance 
     <lb/>
     in the former than in the latter view. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. Mills) 
     <lb/>
     has spoken of our desiring to make this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament a battle ground for sectarian 
     <lb/>
     differences, and he spoke of our desiring to 
     <lb/>
     settle the question here whether there were 
     <lb/>
     to be separate schbols in the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories. Now. surely my hon. friend was 
     <lb/>
     unintentionally unfair when he said so, be<lb break="no"/>cause I am sure he did not wilfully mean to 
     <lb/>
     be unfair. There is no proposal that separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools should be forced upon the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the North-west Territories. No one 
     <lb/>
     is saying by this resolution whether there 
     <lb/>
     should be separate schools in the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories or not. The proposal of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from North Simcoe is that the people 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories should have the 
     <lb/>
     right to decide that matter for themselves, 
     <lb/>
     and that the petition of the Legislative As<lb break="no"/>sembly should be granted by this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:AMYO1">Mr. AMYOT</persName>. And deprive the minority 
     <lb/>
     of their privilege ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McNEILL</persName>. The hon. gentleman knows 
     <lb/>
     perfectly well that the right the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories are asking for 
     <lb/>
     has been exercised. as the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Bothwell himself admits, by the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, has been exercised by the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario, by the province of Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     by the province of New Brunswick, and in 
     <lb/>
     point of fact by all the provinces in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, because the province of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     so far, at all events, as the courts have de<lb break="no"/>cided, exercises the same privilege legally. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I think under these circumstances it 
     <lb/>
     is a little hard that we should be described 
     <lb/>
     as an intolerant party, or intolerant indi<lb break="no"/>viduals. Now, one word with regard to my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the leader of the Opposition, and 
     <lb/>
     if he will forgive me for what he may con<lb break="no"/>sider an impertinence, I will say that I ex<lb break="no"/>ceedingly admired the speech that he de<lb break="no"/>livered in the House to-night on this subject. 
     <lb/>
     But I wish to join issue with him on one 
     <lb/>
     point. Be very eloquently told us what in 
     <lb/>
     his view was necessary to the building up 
     <lb/>
     of a nation; he thought that in order to 
     <lb/>
     build up this nation we should have separate 
     <lb/>
    schools in the North-west Territories. His 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
        
        
     argument went so far as to say that there 
     <lb/>
    should always be separate schools there. I 
     <lb/>see my hon. friend is inclined to dissent. If 
     <lb/>I am not correct, I will withdraw the state<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. Go on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McNEILL</persName>. But I understood very 
     <lb/>
     distinctly that his argument was that there 
     <lb/>
     should always be separate schools in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west. Now, I cannot agree with my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend in thinking that that is the way 
     <lb/>
     to build up a nation. In the first place. I 
     <lb/>
     cannot agree with him in thinking that the 
     <lb/>
     best way to build up a nation is to have our 
     <lb/>
     children separated from one another and 
     <lb/>
     divided into classes, one being a Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic and the other a Protestant class. 
     <lb/>
     I am quite satisfied that the friendships of 
     <lb/>
     childhood, the friendships acquired by chil<lb break="no"/>dren working together in the same school and 
     <lb/>
     playing together in the same play-grounds. 
     <lb/>
     would in the course of a very few genera<lb break="no"/>tions do more to cause sectarian feeling in 
     <lb/>
     this country to disappear than any other one 
     <lb/>
     thing that could he mentioned. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that I could point to sections in our own 
     <lb/>
     muntry to-day where the system pursued of 
     <lb/>
     educating these children together has done 
     <lb/>
     a great deal already to do away with these 
     <lb/>
     bitter sectarian feelings which unfortunately 
     <lb/>
     in some parts of the country do exist to<lb break="no"/>day. I would say further to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     that not only do I not believe that the divid<lb break="no"/>ing of children into separate camps in this 
     <lb/>
     way is a good means of building up a na<lb break="no"/>tion. but I can not agree with him that the 
     <lb/>
     policy of depriving the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, or the people of any 
     <lb/>
     province in this country, of the right to 
     <lb/>
     manage their own educational affairs, is 
     <lb/>
     one which, if persevered in, would effectually 
     <lb/>
     build up a nation in Canada. I think it 
     <lb/>
     would be a policy to cause heart-burning, 
     <lb/>
     to cause dissension, and thus to cause very 
     <lb/>
     great evil in this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I shall not at this late hour 
     <lb/>
     discuss at any length a subject which now 
     <lb/>
     has been exhaustively discussed. I wish to 
     <lb/>
     state, however, what I consider to be the 
     <lb/>
     question before the House. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     we have before the House the question of the 
     <lb/>
     relative merits of separate or public schools ; 
     <lb/>
     the question is whether it shall be left to 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Assembly of the North<lb break="no"/>west to deal with the school question, 
     <lb/>
     to deal with what remains of the ques 
     <lb/>
     tion as respects the use of the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage in the North-west Territories, which 
     <lb/>
     I may say here, as I have said once or 
     <lb/>
     twice before, is no question at all in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories to-day. Suppose the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) 
     <lb/>
     succeeds in carrying his amendment, not 
     <lb/>
     one  iota of result will be accomplished as 
     <lb/>
     regards the use or the disuse of the French 
     <lb/>
     language in the North-west Territories; so 
     <lb/>
     we may pass that by as only a bubble ques<lb break="no"/>tion. However, that question has been raised 
     <lb/>

     outside this House, and put before the minds 
     <lb/>
     of the people, exciting with apprehension 
     <lb/>
     the minds of one class of the subjects of the 
     <lb/>
    Queen in one province, and filling the minds  
     <lb/>of another class of the subjects of the Queen  
     <lb/>in another province, with enthusiastic feel<lb break="no"/>ing or enthusiastic passion, more properly<lb/>speaking, and making them think that they<lb/>are engaged in a magnificent crusade, break<lb break="no"/>ing down an awful arrangement that men<lb break="no"/>aces the peace, and prosperity, and the very<lb/>dignity of Canada. Now, the practical ques<lb break="no"/>tion is, whether or not the Legislative <choice><sic>As<lb break="no"/>sembely</sic><corr>Assembly</corr></choice> of the North-west Territories shall<lb/>have power to deal with the schools.<lb/>I entirely repudiate the assumption of the<lb/>hon. member for West Toronto (Mr. Denison), <lb/>and the hon. gentleman who spoke at an 
     <lb/>earlier period, both of whom assumed that 
     <lb/>if the hon. gentleman's amendment were 
     <lb/>carried, the North-west Assembly would at 
     <lb/>once proceed to pass legislation doing away 
     <lb/>with separate schools. I exceedingly doubt 
     <lb/> whether the North-west Assembly would do 
     <lb/>anything of the kind, and, therefore, those 
     <lb/>hon. gentlemen who would vote for the 
     <lb/>motion of my hon. and learned friend 
     <lb/>to go into committee and pass these 
     <lb/>amendments, believing that thus they  
     <lb/>were doing away with separate schools. I 
     <lb/>say to them, and I know something of the 
     <lb/>temper of the North-west, and of the temper<lb/>of the North-west legislators, they may as<lb/>well spare themselves the pains. It will be<lb/>very gratifying to a large number of people 
     <lb/>in the North-west in case this House should 
     <lb/>decide not to accept the motion of the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), to have<lb/>such an authoritative declaration on the part 
     <lb/>of the Prime Minister, on the part of the 
     <lb/>Minister of Justice, a man who can speak 
     <lb/>on legal subjects with authority, to this 
     <lb/>effect that even if five, six or ten years 
     <lb/>hence the Territories should remain in their 
     <lb/>present state, yet when they come here, 
     <lb/>they will have the fullest freedom as to 
     <lb/>whether separate schools shall or shall not 
     <lb/>exist. Not only has the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>made that statement. but the hon. member 
     <lb/>for Bothwell (Mr. Mills), who can also speak 
     <lb/>on a subject like this with authority, has 
     <lb/>also made a similar statement to-night, and 
     <lb/>if on a future occasion this question is 
     <lb/>brought up, if to-morrow, or years hence we 
     <lb/>come to this Parliament assembled for the 
     <lb/>purpose of securing the admission of the 
     <lb/>Territories in the character of a province, 
     <lb/>it will not be possible, but that the dicta 
     <lb/>of those hon. and learned gentlemen shall 
     <lb/>have great weight.

    a point of calling on an eminent ecclesiastic, 
     <lb/> whose recent death I deplore, to talk with 
     <lb/>him on this very subject ; and I stated to 
     <lb/>him then, what I state here, that I believe 
     <lb/>that to give the Legislative Assembly of the<lb/>Territories power to deal with this question<lb/>would be far safer for the existence of 
     <lb/>the separate schools than to deprive it of<lb/>that power. His Grace said to me<lb/>that if, as regards the schools of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, they had thrown themselves on the<lb/>Local Government and the Local Legislature, <lb/>they would have been better off. I<lb/>do not think there exists in the Territories<lb/>any such feeling against separate schools<lb/>as there is against being deprived of the 
     <lb/>power to which they believe they are en<lb break="no"/>titled in accordance with the spirit of the 
     <lb/>British North America Act. It is not merely 
     <lb/>this Parliament depriving them of this power, 
     <lb/>but when they are impressed with the idea 
     <lb/>that they are deprived of that power, not 
     <lb/>because the wisdom of Parliament sug<lb break="no"/>gests it, and that it is well they should be 
     <lb/>deprived of it, but because of an influence 
     <lb/>and force used by other branches of our 
     <lb/>federation, this irritates the Territories, just 
     <lb/>as it would irritate any province if menaced 
     <lb/>with the sentiments of another province. 
     <lb/>With respect to the argument of the hon.<lb/>gentleman for St. Boniface (Mr. LaRivere),<lb/>I may mention that Mr. Mercier used the<lb/>same argument some years ago. He said : 
     <lb/>Beware as to what you do in the North-west, 
     <lb/>because we are deeply interested in that part 
     <lb/>of the Dominion —take care least we do not<lb/>squeeze you Protestants in the province of 
     <lb/>Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. LaRIVIERE</persName>. I did not use that as an 
     <lb/>
     argument at all. I only made that, as a re<lb break="no"/>mark when the hon. gentleman opposite was 
     <lb/>
     speaking when he stated what should be 
     <lb/>
     done in the provinces, I asked what he would 
     <lb/>
     do in Quebec, applying his own argument. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. If the hon. gentleman did 
     <lb/>
     not use the argument, Mr. Mercier used it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:AMYO1">Mr. AMYOT</persName>. No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. If this argument was never 
     <lb/>
     used, what was the meaning of the phrase 
     <lb/>
     "look at the minority in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ?" The position as regards the minor<lb break="no"/>ity in Quebec was brought about in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with legislation in which they them<lb break="no"/>selves were concerned, and by which 
     <lb/>
     they have certain rights and are pro<lb break="no"/>tected. The minority also in Ontario have 
     <lb/>
     certain rights in accordance with legislation 
     <lb/>
     in which they had something to say. But 
     <lb/>
     what has that to do with the question we 
     <lb/>
     have to consider in regard to the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories, namely : the time has now come 
     <lb/>
     to ask whether, looking at the number of 
     <lb/>
     our population and their intelligence, this 
     <lb/>
     provincial right to say what is desirable as 
     <lb/>
     to the character of our school" system, should 
     <lb/>
     not be placed in the hands of the

     Legislature. There have been many 
     <lb/>
    questions raised here to-night which I would 
     <lb/>like to answer. if this were the time and the 
     <lb/>place. questions raised by the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>in moving the amendment to the motion of 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Simme (Mr. McCarthy). 
     <lb/>questions of vital importance. and I am 
     <lb/>bound to say that it would be very inter<lb break="no"/>esting and might be even instructive to 
     <lb/>hon. gentlemen if we were to discuss some 
     <lb/>of those questions. That motion. if I may 
     <lb/>refer to it in passing. proposes to force on the 
     <lb/>Territories a denominational system. although 
     <lb/>the hon. gentleman spoke  against that. 
     <lb/>and deprive them of every right which they 
     <lb/>claim on this question. The Territories do 
     <lb/>not want to be told that they must have a 
     <lb/>certain description of education. one that 
     <lb/>does not teach them anything about God but 
     <lb/>simply questions of duty between man and 
     <lb/>man. If there was time I should like to ask. 
     <lb/>where do you get the idea of duty if you 
     <lb/>banish the idea of religion?  I do not think 
     <lb/>we could get the idea of a morality 
     <lb/>worthy the name unless it is founded 
     <lb/>on religion. But we must not go in 
     <lb/>to these large questions. It would 
     <lb/>be interesting also to go into the whole 
     <lb/>educational question as regards purely secu<lb break="no"/>lar education on which so much store is 
     <lb/>laid, and also with regard to the value of 
     <lb/>the education given in separate schools. 
     <lb/>I do not know what kind of education is 
     <lb/>given in the separate schools of the Catholics. 
     <lb/>or in the separate schools of the Protestants. 
     <lb/>for l have not had an opportunity of in<lb break="no"/>vestigating it. But if a real religious edu<lb break="no"/>cation is given by either of them. side by 
     <lb/>side with a good secular education. I would 
     <lb/>infinitely prefer it for myself. or for any 
     <lb/>relative in whom I was concerned. to a mere 
     <lb/>secular education. I cannot, with any little 
     <lb/>knowledge I have of the curriculum. under<lb break="no"/>stand how any of the great questions that 
     <lb/>a man of any education has to grapple with 
     <lb/>can be met without facing at every 
     <lb/>step the propositions of religion. You cannot 
     <lb/>climb the starry spiral of science without 
     <lb/>on every stair being confronted with the 
     <lb/>great postulates of religion. You cannot 
     <lb/>have a thorough education. in my opinion. 
     <lb/>without its having been also a religious 
     <lb/>education. But it may be said to me : hold<lb break="no"/>ing the opinions that you do as to schools 
     <lb/>where no religion is taught. abhorring. as 
     <lb/>every man listens to me knows I abhor. 
     <lb/>these prejudices of race and religion. which 
     <lb/>so far as I have been able to judge from 
     <lb/>observation. excite people in proportion to 
     <lb/>their want of all depth in religion. and to 
     <lb/>their want of all knowledge of the race that 
     <lb/>they so spontaneously dislike or hate—if 1 
     <lb/>abhor all that. why is it that I am re: dy to 
     <lb/>give over to the Legislative Assembly the 
     <lb/>power of dealing with the educational ques<lb break="no"/>tion?  I will tell you. Sir: We live in an 
     <lb/>age of a wide suffrage: we live in a demo<lb break="no"/>cratic community; we live in a time when 
     <lb/>the people rule; we live in a time when the 
     <lb/>majority is sacred, and when vox populi is 
     <lb/>
          
          
            <cb/>
    
    
      actually vox dei. I do not say I would 
     <lb/>
    have preferred to have lived in another age. 
     <lb/>but finding myself in such a time I must live 
     <lb/>up to it. I live in a country and at a time 
     <lb/>where these things prevail. and I represent 
     <lb/>a constituency to whose opinions I am bound 
     <lb/>to pay some attention. I know nothing 
     <lb/>whatever about the teachings in the separate 
     <lb/>schools. Looking at the men I have seen 
     <lb/>coming from Protestant separate schools, 
     <lb/>and looking at the men I have seen coming 
     <lb/>from Catholic separate schools. I find a com<lb break="no"/>mensurate and correlative prejudice in the 
     <lb/>minds of each. I find, as I have found, a 
     <lb/>Protestant taught to believe. for instance. 
     <lb/>that anybody holding Catholic tenets was 
     <lb/> predestined to eternal ruin. and I have found 
     <lb/>as strong prejudices in the minds of Catho<lb break="no"/>lics. 1 know nothing whatever about the 
     <lb/>schools. but the chief thing is that I stand. 
     <lb/>as Mr. Lowell makes one of his charactets 
     <lb/>say : "I stand upon the constitution."

     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). Suppose both

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. Well. now, my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     must not give me riddles at five minutes 
     <lb/>
     past one in the morning. The question is 
     <lb/>
     simply this: whether or not we should give 
     <lb/>
     the Territories the power of dealing with 
     <lb/>
     this matter of schools. There is no ques<lb break="no"/>tion about language here at all. The added 
     <lb/>
     power would be welcome to the North-west. 
     <lb/>
     I shall, therefore. vote for the motion. but in 
     <lb/>
     voting for it I wish it to he distinctly under<lb break="no"/>stood that I am voting merely to place in 
     <lb/>
     the hands of the Assembly the power to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question. I am not voting for or 
     <lb/>
     against separate schools. and as I explained 
     <lb/>
     to the House. I am not what you would call 
     <lb/>
     very strongly in favour of a public school 
     <lb/>
     education. Let me correct my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) in one 
     <lb/>
     thing. In his speech he talked the whole 
     <lb/>
     time about the Protestant public schools. 
     <lb/>
     Sir. we have no Protestant public schools in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. Allow me to explain 
     <lb/>
     what I meant by that. I find that the Act 
     <lb/>
     says: the majority may establish a school. 
     <lb/>
     and I find that that majority may be either 
     <lb/>
     Protestant or Catholic, and consequently I 
     <lb/>
     used it in this sense: that if the majority 
     <lb/>
     were Protestants. and did establish a public 
     <lb/>
     school. it was a Protestant public school. 
     <lb/>
     just in that sense. as distinguished on the 
     <lb/>
     other hand from the majority who happen<lb break="no"/>ed to be Roman Catholics and who establish 
     <lb/>
     a public school which would be a Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic public school. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. There are two reasons why 
     <lb/>
     it is desirable to correct my hon. and learned 
     <lb/>
     friend. The first reason is that under the 
     <lb/>
     Act of Parliament and under the Ordinance 
     <lb/>
     founded on that Act of Parliament the phrase 
     <lb/>
     is incorrect. and the next reason is that the 
     <lb/>
     phrase is misleading. It gives the idea that 
     <lb/>
     at a public school. Protestant tenets that 
     <lb/>
     weald be objectionable to Catholics were 
     <lb/>
          
          
            <pb n="6143" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06143.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">6143</fw>
            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">6144</fw>
         
         
     taught, and that a Catholic could not attend 
     <lb/>
     the schools without menace to his faith, 
     <lb/>
     whereas in Regina, Moose Jaw, Medicine 
     <lb/>
     Hat and Moosomin, there are no separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. Yet at all these places Catholics 
     <lb/>
     attend the public school, and I have never 
     <lb/>
     heard a Catholic in my constituency or any<lb break="no"/>where else in the North-west Territories ob<lb break="no"/>ject to anything that took place in the public 
     <lb/>
     schools, complain that their faith was in<lb break="no"/>terfered with or that anything objectionable 
     <lb/>
     either in book or otherwise was heard. I 
     <lb/>
     merely rose to state what I consider to be the 
     <lb/>
     question on which we were voting. We 
     <lb/>
     are not voting on this education question at 
     <lb/>
     all; we are voting on the powers of the 
     <lb/>
     Territorial Assembly as to whether we shall 
     <lb/>
     enlarge these: powers or not. That is the 
     <lb/>
     sole question, and voting on that question 
     <lb/>
     I shall vote in favour of enlarging the powers 
     <lb/>
     of the Assembly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McMULLEN</persName>. I do not wish to give 
     <lb/>
     a silent vote upon this question. The Bill 
     <lb/>
     introduced by the hon. member for- North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) in 1890 had two 
     <lb/>
     clauses linked together, one being with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the abolition of the dual language 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories, and the other 
     <lb/>
     with reference to separate schools. On that 
     <lb/>
     occasion I supported the Bill, with the in<lb break="no"/>tention when we got into committee of sup<lb break="no"/>porting the clause with regard to the dual 
     <lb/>
     language simply and solely on the ground 
     <lb/>
     of economy. It was not because I have any 
     <lb/>
     feeling whatever against the French popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the Dominion, or not because I 
     <lb/>
     wish to deprive them of any rights; but 
     <lb/>
     because I was led to understand that the 
     <lb/>
     French population in the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories understood English as well as 
     <lb/>
     French, and that to continue the printing 
     <lb/>
     of the ordinance in French as well as Eng<lb break="no"/>lish was in my opinion imposing an un<lb break="no"/>necessary expense on the country. With 
     <lb/>
     regard to the question of granting to the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories the power of dealing 
     <lb/>
     with education, I am strongly inclined to 
     <lb/>
     respect the stand taken by the Hon. Alex. 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie when the Bill was passed grant<lb break="no"/>ing the privileges the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     minority now enjoy, and I am also in 
     <lb/>
     favour of the views expressed by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Edward Blake on that occasion. For 
     <lb/>
     my part, I am not an advocate of separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools. At the same time. I do not 
     <lb/>
     Wish by force of law to take from any 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority the right to have separate 
     <lb/>
     schools if they desire to exercise that right. 
     <lb/>
     I would like very well that they should 
     <lb/>
     agree with us to have our children all edu<lb break="no"/>cated together in the same school : and for 
     <lb/>
     that purpose I would quite willingly elimin<lb break="no"/>ate anything in the curriculum of our 
     <lb/>
     schools at all offensive to them. I would 
     <lb/>
     not agree to make the schools absolutely 
     <lb/>
     secular schools. I would rather have a 
     <lb/>
     continuation of the separate schools as they 
     <lb/>
     now exist in Ontario than to have an en<lb break="no"/>tirely secular system of education. I be<lb break="no"/>
       
       
            <cb/>
     
     
     lieve that in the present age we are alto<lb break="no"/>gether drifting too much into secularism, 
     <lb/>
     and are not devoting that attention, 
     <lb/>
     even in our common school education, 
     <lb/>
     to the doctrines of Christianity which 
     <lb/>
     we ought to devote. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe says that we have 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories a population 
     <lb/>
     of about 66,000. If that Territory contained 
     <lb/>
     a population sufficient to have full provin<lb break="no"/>cial rights granted to them. I would be 
     <lb/>
     quite willing to grant them power to deal 
     <lb/>
     with education as well as the power to 
     <lb/>
     charter railways, to borrow money, and to 
     <lb/>
     levy taxes. If any hon. member in this 
     <lb/>
     House thinks that with their present limited 
     <lb/>
     population, it would be well to confer that 
     <lb/>
     power upon them, I am willing to debate that 
     <lb/>
     question with him. In my humble opinion it 
     <lb/>
     would be premature. We have been spend<lb break="no"/>ing large sums of money to try to bring 
     <lb/>
     immigrants to that country Would we not 
     <lb/>
     be glad to see the surplus population of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec, French and Catholic as 
     <lb/>
     it is, go to the North-west rather than to 
     <lb/>
     the United States ? We would rather see 
     <lb/>
     the congested population of Ireland, where 
     <lb/>
     there is a very large Catholic population, 
     <lb/>
     come to settle in our country, than go to 
     <lb/>
     the United States. Our object is to fill up 
     <lb/>
     that Territory with population, and as soon 
     <lb/>
     as there is the necessary population to he 
     <lb/>
     formed into a province, I am quite willing 
     <lb/>
     that they should have full power to deal 
     <lb/>
     with education and every other question. 
     <lb/>
     To those who are strongly opposed to separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools and are in favour of granting 
     <lb/>
     the Territory the power of dealing with the 
     <lb/>
     whole question now, I would say, supposing 
     <lb/>
     that the population of the North-west were 
     <lb/>
     different from what it is at present—sup<lb break="no"/>pose there were 45,000 Catholics and only 
     <lb/>
     15,000 Protestants—would they then as en<lb break="no"/>thusiastically and determinedly advocate 
     <lb/>
     granting to the Territory the right to legis<lb break="no"/>late on school questions ? I do not think 
     <lb/>
     they would. I think they would say that it 
     <lb/>
     is better to wait until the country fills up ; 
     <lb/>
     the population may partake of a different 
     <lb/>
     character from what it has at present, and 
     <lb/>
     might reverse thevery Act that they might 
     <lb/>
     now pass. I think that this Parliament. with 
     <lb/>
     the experience it has had since. Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion on these questions, is in as good a con<lb break="no"/>dition, and perhaps better, to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     question than the North-west Assembly. I 
     <lb/>
     think we understand the question perfectly, 
     <lb/>
     we have made the history of this country 
     <lb/>
     on this question, and I think the intelligence 
     <lb/>
     of the whole Dominion assembled in this 
     <lb/>
     House is quite as capable of dealing with 
     <lb/>
     this question in its present position as the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Assembly. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Simcoe advanced another argument 
     <lb/>
     which, if it were based upon an unques<lb break="no"/>tionable fact, would make me feel disposed 
     <lb/>
     to support his resolution; that is, that in 
     <lb/>
     voting to continue the present condition of 
     <lb/>

     irrevocably, either on our part or their part, 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. But in opposition to the 
     <lb/>
     opinion expressed by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Simcoe, we have the opinion of my 
     <lb/>
     respected leader, the opinion of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Bothwell, and the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. leader of the Government, all of 
     <lb/>
     whom challenge and deny the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's contention. They say there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     in the constitution to prevent the Local 
     <lb/>
     Legislatures controlling the whole matter 
     <lb/>
     when the Territories come to be formed into 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Perhaps I hold views on edu<lb break="no"/>cation different from those of a good many. 
     <lb/>
     I am not in favour of such an absolutely 
     <lb/>
     secular system such as that established in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba ; I believe it is wrong to abolish 
     <lb/>
     from our schools every vestige of religious 
     <lb/>
     education. I find from the statement given 
     <lb/>
     to us by the hon. member for North Sim<lb break="no"/>coe that there are in the North-west two 
     <lb/>
     hundred and ten Protestant public schools 
     <lb/>
     and only thirty-four Catholic public schools. 
     <lb/>
     Well, surely the people of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     can tolerate that number of Catholic schools 
     <lb/>
     until they find what the Territory is going 
     <lb/>
     to develop into. The hon. gentleman points 
     <lb/>
     out that some of those schools cost more 
     <lb/>
     per capita than the Protestant schools. That 
     <lb/>
     is not the fault of the law; it is the fault 
     <lb/>
     of the system of administration. If the 
     <lb/>
     Government were to administer the system 
     <lb/>
     so as to grant a per capita allowance, we 
     <lb/>
     would not have that condition of things. 
     <lb/>
     We are contributing large tracts of land 
     <lb/>
     for the construction of railroads for that 
     <lb/>
     country, and are doing everything in our 
     <lb/>
     power to develop it; and it is to be hoped 
     <lb/>
     that the influx of population will be so 
     <lb/>
     rapid that it will before many years be en<lb break="no"/>titled to full provincial powers; and when 
     <lb/>
     that time comes, if I hold a seat in this 
     <lb/>
     House, I will undoubtedly vote to give them 
     <lb/>
     all the powers provided for in section 93 
     <lb/>
     of the constitution. My hon. friend said 
     <lb/>
     something with regard to the request of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Assembly. There is no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that that Assembly have asked 
     <lb/>
     to be allowed to deal with the question 
     <lb/>
     of schools; every Assembly likes power, 
     <lb/>
     and we know there has been considerable 
     <lb/>
     trouble up there in the last year or two on 
     <lb/>
     this question. But what is the system at 
     <lb/>
     present existing in the Northwest ? It is 
     <lb/>
     exactly the system we have in Ontario. 
     <lb/>
     Our Ontario readers are the readers that 
     <lb/>
     have been established there by the North<lb break="no"/>west Council as the books that are to be 
     <lb/>
     used. If a teacher from Ontario goes to 
     <lb/>
     the North-west holding a second or first-class 
     <lb/>
     certificate, that certificate is admitted as a 
     <lb/>
     certificate of qualification to teach, and if he 
     <lb/>
     does not hold such a certificate, he has to 
     <lb/>
     procure one. We have virutally the same 
     <lb/>
     system. We have two inspectors, a Catholic 
     <lb/>
     and a Protestant, The Catholic inspector 
     <lb/>
     does not only inspect Catholic schools, but 
     <lb/>
     all the schools in his district, and the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant does the same. We have not a Cath<lb break="no"/>
   
   
            <cb/>
          
          
     olic inspector paid simply for inspecting 34 
     <lb/>
     Catholic schools, and a Protestant paid for 
     <lb/>
     inspecting 210 Protestant schools. They 
     <lb/>
     divide the work between them, and inspect 
     <lb/>
     them all on one common system. In that 
     <lb/>
     regard, the practice is just about the same 
     <lb/>
     as in the province of Ontario. I contend 
     <lb/>
     that it is the duty of this House to legislate 
     <lb/>
     in the direction of peace and harmony, in 
     <lb/>
     order to develop rapidly this entire Domin<lb break="no"/>ion. That can best be done, peaceably and 
     <lb/>
     quietly, by granting all rights and privileges, 
     <lb/>
     within reasonable bound, to any class that 
     <lb/>
     comes into our country and settles in any 
     <lb/>
     portion of it. If we are going to extremes 
     <lb/>
     in any direction. we are going seriously to 
     <lb/>
     retard the peaceful and successful develop<lb break="no"/>ment of the Dominion. I should rejoice to see 
     <lb/>
     thousands of Catholics from any part of the 
     <lb/>
     British dominions come in and take up loca<lb break="no"/>tions in our 'Territories and develop them, 
     <lb/>
     and should be glad to give them the enjoy<lb break="no"/>ment of the privileges enjoyed by the Catho<lb break="no"/>lic minority in the province of Ontario. You 
     <lb/>
     can never drive people out of a conscientious 
     <lb/>
     right by legislation. You may gain them 
     <lb/>
     over by kindly treatment into a different 
     <lb/>
     groove, but you cannot force them by co<lb break="no"/>ercion. I do not know of any part of the 
     <lb/>
     British dominions in which such a policy 
     <lb/>
     has been successful. They tried to coerce 
     <lb/>
     Ireland by legislation for eighty years, and 
     <lb/>
     the policy has been declared by the best 
     <lb/>
     English statesmen to have resulted in utter 
     <lb/>
     failure. We do not want to coerce people by 
     <lb/>
     legislation. We want to treat them kindly 
     <lb/>
     and generously. We want to respect their 
     <lb/>
     conscientious feelings and religious beliefs 
     <lb/>
     Whatever you may be able to do by kind 
     <lb/>
     and generous treatment, you will never, by 
     <lb/>
     means of coercive legislation succeed in 
     <lb/>
     accomplishing your object.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I wish to say a few 
     <lb/>
     words in explanation of the vote I intend to 
     <lb/>
     give. We have now seven provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the union, five of which have the undis<lb break="no"/>puted right to control their own education 
     <lb/>
     and to every successive province that has 
     <lb/>
     been brought into Confederation since 1867, 
     <lb/>
     we have given that right. It was disputed in 
     <lb/>
     the province of New Brunswick, but the 
     <lb/>
     courts ultimately upheld the right of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince to control its own education. It was 
     <lb/>
     disputed in Manitoba, but the courts also, in 
     <lb/>
     the case of that province. upheld that pro<lb break="no"/>vincial right. In the North-west Territories, 
     <lb/>
     when the Act of 1875 was passed, there was 
     <lb/>
     no Legislative Assembly there having power 
     <lb/>
     to regulate or control education, and there<lb break="no"/>fore it was quite in order for this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to pass legislation governing that ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. But since then we have given the 
     <lb/>
     no Legislative Assembly there having power 
     <lb/>
     Legislature. We have given them certain 
     <lb/>
     powers within their own control, and 
     <lb/>
     amongst those they are dealing with. the 
     <lb/>
     subject of education. Whether they are 
     <lb/>
     so dealing legally or not, that right has 
     <lb/>
     not been refused them, and, in view of the 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <pb n="6147" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06147.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">6148</fw>
        
        
     fact that it Seems to be an undisputed right 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces to deal with the subject of 
     <lb/>
     education. and in view of the fact that there 
     <lb/>
     is now a legislature there. it does not seem 
     <lb/>
     to me out of harmony with provincial rights 
     <lb/>
     to cede to that: Legislature the power of 
     <lb/>
     dealing with this question. It is dealing with 
     <lb/>
     it to-day. and it must be dealing with it 
     <lb/>
     either in accord with its legal rights or the 
     <lb/>
     reverse. If illegally, it ought to be stopped ; 
     <lb/>
     but if under the sanction of the law. we 
     <lb/>
     ought to extend to that Legislature the full 
     <lb/>
     rights we have given the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Some hon. gentlemen speak of this as tak<lb break="no"/>ing away the rights of the minority. I do 
     <lb/>
     not think that assertion is warranted. All 
     <lb/>
     we have a right to assume, if we give the 
     <lb/>
     power into the hands of the Legislature, is 
     <lb/>
     that it will protect the minority in any 
     <lb/>
     rights they possess to-day. We all 
     <lb/>
     know. as far as I can judge. that the regula<lb break="no"/>tions which the Board of Education there 
     <lb/>
     has made for controlling education, are of a 
     <lb/>
     very liberal character. Therefore, we have 
     <lb/>
     the right to assume that there is no dis<lb break="no"/>position on the pa 't of the North-west As<lb break="no"/>sembly to do injustice to the minority. in 
     <lb/>
     voting as I intend to to-night, it is not be<lb break="no"/>cause I apprehend there is any danger of 
     <lb/>
     our refusing provincial rights to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces after they are fully organized. whe<lb break="no"/>ther the present leader of the Government 
     <lb/>
     be in power or the leader of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>
     because I think both recognize what would 
     <lb/>
     be the rights of the province then. But I 
     <lb/>
     must confess that I agree with the 
     <lb/>
     assumption advanced that if we allow us<lb break="no"/>ages to grow up for a length of time, in 
     <lb/>
     proportion to their duration, they will be 
     <lb/>
     difficult to remove. They were given. by the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875 the right to establish separate 
     <lb/>
     schools there. It might happen, afterwards, 
     <lb/>
     when we establish a province there, and 
     <lb/>
     give the Legislature the full autonomy of a 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Legislature. that we could not 
     <lb/>
     do away with the order of things then exist<lb break="no"/>ing. There was one part of the speech of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. .Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) with which I disagree. and I am 
     <lb/>
     glad to say that, on speaking to him private<lb break="no"/>ly. he expressed an opinion that he intend<lb break="no"/>ed to convey a different impression. I un<lb break="no"/>derstood him to say that because by the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1875 we gave the right to the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories to have separate schools, if we 
     <lb/>
     allowed that to go on, when we came to 
     <lb/>
     establish the province, we would find it 
     <lb/>
     riveted upon the Provincial Government, by 
     <lb/>
     usage, so that it would be difficult, in fact, 
     <lb/>
     illegal, to make a change. That: was the im<lb break="no"/>pression his remarks left on my mind. How<lb break="no"/>ever, I am glad to notice that the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man states that was not the impression he 
     <lb/>
     intended to convey. What he meant to state 
     <lb/>
     was not that there would not be a legal 
     <lb/>
     right vested in this Parliament to give the 
     <lb/>
     full power of controlling education to the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Government, when that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was established there. That would go 
     <lb/>
     a long way towards satisfying the minds of 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <cb/>
          
          
     many hon. gentlemen with reference to 
     <lb/>
     allowing the present condition of things to 
     <lb/>
     remain as they are, and, for my part, I 
     <lb/>
     would feel that there was no injustice done 
     <lb/>
     to the Territories or Council, provided 
     <lb/>
     things did remain as they are. But as 
     <lb/>
     the question is forced on us now. and as 
     <lb/>
     the amendment is in harmony with the 
     <lb/>
     principle I have always held of the undis<lb break="no"/>puted rights of the provinces, with the 
     <lb/>
     exceptions of Ontario and Quebec, which 
     <lb/>
     were governed by legislation introduced and 
     <lb/>
     passed before Confederation, and as it is 
     <lb/>
     the undisputed right of every province out<lb break="no"/>side of those two, and of every other pro<lb break="no"/>vince that may come into the confederacy, 
     <lb/>
     to deal with its own education. I believe 
     <lb/>
     they should have that right. Knowing that 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature out there is discharging 
     <lb/>
     many of the functions of a Provincial Leg<lb break="no"/>islature. I think we should give them this 
     <lb/>
     right, and put them on a par with the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces.

     <lb/>
     give an opportunity to an hon. member who 
     <lb/>
     has already Spoken upon this question, but 
     <lb/>
     who desires to answer some of the objections 
     <lb/>
     which were brought against his arguments, 
     <lb/>
     I move the adjournment of the House.

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. Mr. Speaker, at this 
     <lb/>
     late hour I am not going to trespass upon 
     <lb/>
     the indulgence of the House by any length<lb break="no"/>ened argument. But I would like to put 
     <lb/>
     myself right upon a subject that seems to 
     <lb/>
     be misunderstood as to the legal question 
     <lb/>
     involved, and to answer some arguments 
     <lb/>
     put forward upon the general proposition. 
     <lb/>
     Now, my hon. friends around me understood 
     <lb/>
     me to say—and perhaps I used language 
     <lb/>
     that would convey that impression—that, as 
     <lb/>
     a matter of positive law, when we created 
     <lb/>
     provinces in the North-west, we should be 
     <lb/>
     obliged to restrict the power of the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces in respect of education by the 
     <lb/>
     clause to which I referred as limiting the 
     <lb/>
    clause 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>Act. Now, Sir, I did not, and I do not 
     <lb/>desire to convey that impression, and it is 
     <lb/>only right that I should explain, because it. 
     <lb/>may have an effect possibly upon some hon. 
     <lb/>members, and I wish to make myself per<lb break="no"/>fectly plain. What I was thinking of was 
     <lb/>not the dry question of law to which my 
     <lb/>hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. Mills) has 
     <lb/>devoted some attention, and upon which the 
     <lb/>right hon. First Minister has also given his 
     <lb/>views. That is, that according to the sys<lb break="no"/>tem that we find embodied in the British 
     <lb/>North America Act, the provinces, the ad<lb break="no"/>mission for which was provided for in the 
     <lb/>Act were to come in subject to these general 
     <lb/>clauses in the Act, and amongst them was 
     <lb/>this clause No. 1. So when British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia was admitted to the Confederacy and 
     <lb/>when Prince Edward was admitted, the 
     <lb/>terms embodied in the Order in Council— 
     <lb/>which, the Act provides under section 146, 
     <lb/>were to be equivalent to an Act of Parlia<lb break="no"/>

     ment—were that all the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     Act not solely applicable to one province. 
     <lb/>
     in other words, the general provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     Act were to be applicable to the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces brought in. At the moment I had not 
     <lb/>
     in my mind that this provision applied to 
     <lb/>
     provinces created out of the Territories. 
     <lb/>
     may be that the view of the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     from Bothwell is right in that respect, and 
     <lb/>
     that the clause 2 of the Act of 1871 does 
     <lb/>
     not give to this Parliament the power, in 
     <lb/>
     creating provinces, to confer any constitu<lb break="no"/>tional rights. other and different from those 
     <lb/>
     mentioned in the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. That may possibly be the correct view. 
     <lb/>
     I am free to say that I had not that in my 
     <lb/>
     mind when I addressed the House. I did 
     <lb/>
     not consider it, and I am not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     say that it is or is not the proper one. Sec<lb break="no"/>tion 2 says:

     and it seems to me they enable this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to enact in the constitution of any 
     <lb/>
     province such laws as this Parliament may 
     <lb/>
     see fit. I think it is open to that construc<lb break="no"/>tion, but I have not considered it, and I do 
     <lb/>
     not want to express an opinion one way or 
     <lb/>
     the other. My argument was, and is now 
     <lb/>
     —if we hand this matter over to the control 
     <lb/>
     of tne Territories there will be no harm 
     <lb/>
     done. If the people in the North-west adopt 
     <lb/>
     a scheme of separate schools and afterwards 
     <lb/>
     apply for admission into Confederation there 
     <lb/>
     will be no great harm done to say: Very 
     <lb/>
     well; nothing in any law we can give you 
     <lb/>
     shall prejudicially affect any right or privi<lb break="no"/>lege with reference to denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools. But, if we do not give them power 
     <lb/>
     to choose, if we deny them the right to select 
     <lb/>
     for themselves, then, when the day comes. 
     <lb/>
     as it must before long. when some part of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories will ask for admission and 
     <lb/>
     be entitled by their population and position 
     <lb/>
     to have this clause enacted, then, this Par<lb break="no"/>liament would be bound to repeal the law, 
     <lb/>
     otherwise we should be, as I say. riveting 
     <lb/>
     the system of separate schools upon them. 
     <lb/>
     This point I think a most important one.

     The right hon. Prime Minister, when chal<lb break="no"/>lenged by the hon. member from West As<lb break="no"/>siniboia (Mr. Davin, repelled the assump<lb break="no"/>tion that they would not be so bound. He 
     <lb/>
     said of course it would be open to Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, but the First Minister, as I under<lb break="no"/>stood, in his answer to the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for West Assiniboia—perhaps I was wrong, 
     <lb/>
     but I should like to be corrected if I was 
     <lb/>
     wrong—rather insisted upon the view I am 
     <lb/>
     putting, which is that if separate schools 
     <lb/>
     are continued until the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories are given provincial autonomy, they 
     <lb/>
     will have the right of insisting upon that 
     <lb/>
     being continued when provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     is conferred upon them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:THOM21">Sir JOHN THOMPSON</persName>. I did not say 
     <lb/>
     that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Then I fail to under<lb break="no"/>stand the views which the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     holds. He seems to be on both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:THOM21">Sir JOHN THOMPSON</persName>. Not at all. If 
     <lb/>
     I spoke ambiguously before, I was not at all 
     <lb/>
     conscious of it; but I cannot be said to be 
     <lb/>
     ambiguous after the explanation I made to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Assiniboia. I appealed 
     <lb/>
     to the House to continue the present system 
     <lb/>
     while the Territorial system continued, and 
     <lb/>
     I declared that in my opinion the whole 
     <lb/>
     subject would be open and free to Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment as to what constitution we would give 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces when the provinces were 
     <lb/>
     created. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. I am very glad the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman has explained it in 
     <lb/>
     that way, and perhaps I was wrong in my 
     <lb/>
     understanding of his remarks. Of course it 
     <lb/>
     is an important declaration from the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister. Now, the House will have to use 
     <lb/>
     its own judgment on this question. What 
     <lb/>
     I say is this : that if this question of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools is to remain in its present position 
     <lb/>
     until we grant provincial autonomy to any 
     <lb/>
     portion of the North-west, it will be practi<lb break="no"/>cally impossible, unless there is an enormous 
     <lb/>
     change in public opinion, to deny them what 
     <lb/>
     every other province that has joined the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation has been entitled to, what 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba was entitled to, and what I sub<lb break="no"/>mit under the circumstances every province 
     <lb/>
     would be entitled to. Now, let me draw 
     <lb/>
     attention to the constitution conferred upon 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, in that regard. I have not got 
     <lb/>
     it under my hand, but it will be found on 
     <lb/>
     consulting it that when we conferred au<lb break="no"/>tonomy upon the province of Manitoba we 
     <lb/>
     did it by reference to the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. What we declared was, that 
     <lb/>
     where not otherwise provided for in the Act, 
     <lb/>
     all the provisions of the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act should apply to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and I think the very same words 
     <lb/>
     were contained in the resolutions which were 
     <lb/>
     passed at the time British Columbia and the 
     <lb/>
     province of Prince Edward Island came into 
     <lb/>
     the Union. So that we have got that pre<lb break="no"/>cedent before us : that was the promise upon 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <pb n="6151" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1894-07-16_Page_06151.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">6151</fw>
            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">6152</fw>
          
          
     which we admitted Manitoba, and looking 
     <lb/>
     at the character of the legislation, I do not 
     <lb/>
     think there can be any doubt that the same 
     <lb/>
     rule must apply when we come to admit 
     <lb/>
     the provinces to be created out of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. So much for that point. 
     <lb/>
     I might say more, but it would be unreason<lb break="no"/>able at this late hour to occupy the time 
     <lb/>
     of the House by any attempt to criticise this 
     <lb/>
     long and very important debate. I desire 
     <lb/>
     to say this, however, which I think ought to 
     <lb/>
     be said : that I am not the one who is break<lb break="no"/>ing faith in moving the passage of this am<lb break="no"/>endment. Because in 1875, in the condition 
     <lb/>
     things were at that time, this separate school 
     <lb/>
     enactment was passed, on what principle 
     <lb/>
     can it be said that in 1894 the repeal of that 
     <lb/>
     clause will be a breach of faith ? Surely 
     <lb/>
     that is not a fair way to put it. This Par<lb break="no"/>liament has power and authority to revise, 
     <lb/>
     and did year after year alter and change the 
     <lb/>
     powers and the authorities that were granted 
     <lb/>
     to the North-west, and the change in any 
     <lb/>
     one of these enactments cannot by any fair- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     minded man be characterized as a breach 
     <lb/>
     of faith. Can any great harm be done to 
     <lb/>
     any class of people who have gone in there 
     <lb/>
     and who are permitted to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     subject in their own Local Legislature ? 1 
     <lb/>
     am not seeking to deprive any person of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools ; I am not going into that 
     <lb/>
     argument. I have my own views about 
     <lb/>
     them, and though I would agree with the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Wellington (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Mullen) in saying that I would sooner see a 
     <lb/>
     separate school system than a secular 
     <lb/>
     system, I see no necessity at all for a secular 
     <lb/>
     school system displacing a separate school 
     <lb/>
     system. I am free to say that, but it does 
     <lb/>
     appear to me to be an abuse of language to 
     <lb/>
     say that we should not give this power to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the North-west, who have en<lb break="no"/>ormous powers from us already, who are not 
     <lb/>
     abusing those powers, who are quite as in<lb break="no"/>telligent, I think, as the ordinary constitu<lb break="no"/>ents that we represent here, and to give them 
     <lb/>
     power to decide and dispose of this question 
     <lb/>
     amongst themselves, can hardly be treated 
     <lb/>
     as a breach of faith. Why, the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for West Assiniboia, with the knowledge 
     <lb/>
     he has of the people of the North-west, with 
     <lb/>
     the knowledge he has of the autonomy of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, tells us that he doubts 
     <lb/>
     very much whether the separate school 
     <lb/>
     system will be abolished. But is there any 
     <lb/>
     reason why, in a matter of that kind, they 
     <lb/>
     should not have the power ? Are they not 
     <lb/>
     quite as competent to deal with their schools 
     <lb/>
     as British Columbia was at the time of the 
     <lb/>
     Union, as British Columbia is to-day ; as 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island was, as Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island is, and so with the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ? When you talk about heart-burn<lb break="no"/>ings, and when you talk about peace, do not 
     <lb/>
     forget, none of us can forget, or ought to 
     <lb/>
     forget, that we have no trouble in respect of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces which have complete power 
     <lb/>
     over their schools. The trouble that is con<lb break="no"/>stantly occurring does not come from those 
     <lb/>
     four provinces. but it does come from the 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
         
         
     province that we are attempting to control 
     <lb/>
     and coerce by our legislation here. Nor can 
     <lb/>
     we forget that the difficulties that are aris<lb break="no"/>ing in my own province arise because the 
     <lb/>
     people feel there that the separate school 
     <lb/>
     system was imposed upon them against their 
     <lb/>
     will, and there is continual ferment, and 
     <lb/>
     continual agitation, and continual unrest 
     <lb/>
     with regard to that subject cropping up at 
     <lb/>
     almost every election and on every occasion. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, it is because I desire the peace and wel<lb break="no"/>fare of the Dominion, because I believe that 
     <lb/>
     will be best promoted by giving this power 
     <lb/>
     to the proper authorities, by adjourning to

     Sir JOHN THOMPSON. In stating yes<lb break="no"/>terday what measures it was intended not 
     <lb/>
     to proceed with. I forgot to mention our 
     <lb/>
     intention with regard to the Franchise Bill. 
     <lb/>
     It is proposed to drop all parts of that Bill 
     <lb/>
     except those parts which are necessary to 
     <lb/>
     make provision for the revision of the lists 
     <lb/>
     in constituencies as changed by the Re<lb break="no"/>distribution Act. It is intended also, in view 
     <lb/>
     of the delays that have taken place, to make 
     <lb/>
     provision for further delays in the times 
     <lb/>
     for carrying on the revision this year.
