     Mr. HAGGART. The Government have

     received communications from certain re<lb break="no"/>sidents of the township of Bedford in refer- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     euce to the flooding of their lands, alleged 
     <lb/>
     to have been caused by a Government dam 
     <lb/>
     at the foot of West Rideau Lake. The Sup<lb break="no"/>erintending Engineer is under instructions to 
     <lb/>
     personally examine into these claims upon

     COMPENSATION TO THOS. SWEETMAN. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. DAWSON asked. 1. Has the question 
     <lb/>
     of compensation to Mr. Sweetman, of Fer- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     moy, for damages done to lot 26 in the 
     <lb/>
     seventh concesssion of Bedford, been under 
     <lb/>
     the consideration of the Council ? 2. What 
     <lb/>
     action has been taken ? 3. Has he receiv<lb break="no"/>ed compensation yet ? 4. If so, when was 
     <lb/>
     he paid, and how much ? 5. If not yet 
     <lb/>
     paid, why not ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. HAGGART. The question of com<lb break="no"/>pensation to Mr. Thomas Sweetman for 
     <lb/>
     damages to lot 26, in concession No. 27, Bed<lb break="no"/>ford, has been under consideration. It is 
     <lb/>
     proposed to ask Parliament to vote $220 in 
     <lb/>
     the Supplementary Estimates for 1893-94 
     <lb/>
     in discharge of the claim. He has not yet 
     <lb/>
     received any compensation. It was not paid 
     <lb/>
     because he refused to accept the sum of 
     <lb/>
     $220 when offered him, and afterwards 
     <lb/>
     when he intimated his readiness to accept, 
     <lb/>
     there was no appropriation available.

     <lb/>
     number and value of live cattle exported to 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom in the calendar years 
     <lb/>
     1890, 1891, 1892, and 1893 ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. WALLACE. In 1890 there were 
     <lb/>
     104,133 live cattle exported to the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, of the value of $8,114,145 ; in 1891,

     AMERICAN SWINE.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. FEATHERSTON asked, Has the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment issued an order admitting Ameri<lb break="no"/>can swine in bond for slaughter purposes ? 
     <lb/>
     If so, have they to comply with quarantine 
     <lb/>
     regulations as now in force when imported 
     <lb/>
     for breeding purposes ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. FOSTER. Swine may be imported 
     <lb/>
     for slaughter, in bond, under the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of an Order in Council, passed in 1880, and 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     an Order passed in 1883, being chapter 9 
     <lb/>
     of the Consolidated Orders in Council of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Swine imported for slaughter in 
     <lb/>
     bond have not to comply with the quaran<lb break="no"/>tine regulations in force relating to animals 
     <lb/>
     for breeding purposes, but the regulations 
     <lb/>
     are special, having for their object to secure 
     <lb/>
     complete isolation until they enter the 
     <lb/>
     slaughter-houses, from which they are not 
     <lb/>
     allowed to be removed alive. Such slaugh- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ter-houses are required to be distinct from 
     <lb/>
     those in which Canadian swine are slaught<lb break="no"/>ered.
