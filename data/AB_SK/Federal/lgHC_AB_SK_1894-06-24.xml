     the quantity of wood or lumber furnished

     <lb/>
     the amount received by Messrs. Talbot and 
     <lb/>
     Parent, or J. A. Talbot, for completing a 
     <lb/>
     contract for fence building on the Inter-

     colonial Railway, originally awarded to 
     <lb/>
     Odilon Mignault, of Amqui ? 4. How much

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. HAGGART. I am unable to answer 
     <lb/>
     this question to-day, and it will take the 
     <lb/>
     officers of the Intercolonial Railway some 
     <lb/>
     little time to prepare the information so 
     <lb/>
     as to enable me to answer the question 
     <lb/>
     fully. But I find that Messrs. Talbot and 
     <lb/>
     Parent were in partnership in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the delivery of timber to the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway, and they evidently had a 
     <lb/>
     disagreement in the settlement of their 
     <lb/>
     adairs. Mr. Parent has applied to the 
     <lb/>
     general manager of the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way for such a statement as is now asked 
     <lb/>
     for by the hon. gentleman, which has been

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. The Bill I have just introduced 
     <lb/>
     is similar to the other Bill, except that 
     <lb/>
     clause 12 of that Bill is struck out, because 
     <lb/>
     clause 12 of the old Bill conflicts with clause 
     <lb/>
     14, as the hon. gentleman will see upon 
     <lb/>
     perusal. Clause 1 of the new Bill provides 
     <lb/>
     that the Assembly of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories may incorporate tramway and street 
     <lb/>
     railway companies which they have not the 
     <lb/>
     power to do at the present time. Section 
     <lb/>
     15 of the Northwest Territories Act. is re<lb break="no"/>pealed. The Act as it now stands gives 
     <lb/>
     the Lieutenant-Governor in Council power to 
     <lb/>
     take ordinances respecting the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of justice. They have already got that 
     <lb/>
     power and have passed ordinances in respect 
     <lb/>
     to it, so that there is no necessity for its 
     <lb/>
     forming part of this Bill. Section 49 is 
     <lb/>
     amended by striking out the word " any." 
     <lb/>
     The Act as it now stands contains the words 
     <lb/>
     " and any three judges of the court. shall 
     <lb/>
     constitute the court," and it is proposed to 
     <lb/>
     make it read: " and three judges of the 
     <lb/>
     court shall form the court." Section 50 of 
     <lb/>
     the Act is repealed and amended by adding 
     <lb/>
     "provided that the judge by or before whom 
     <lb/>
     the judgment or decision then in question 
     <lb/>
     was rendered or made, shall not sit as one 
     <lb/>
     of the judge composing the court." That 
     <lb/>
     means that the trial judge whose judgment 
     <lb/>
     is appealed against shall not sit en banc. 
     <lb/>
     Section 59 is repealed and a section sub<lb break="no"/>stituted for it: That each sheriff shall be 
     <lb/>
     paid a salary or $500, and the Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor, by and with the advice of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Assembly, may legislate with re<lb break="no"/>spect to remuneration by fees or otherwise 
     <lb/>
     by sheriffs and clerks, including the registry 
     <lb/>
     court. The change is : That the Lieuten<lb break="no"/>ant-Governor now fixes the fees and this 
     <lb/>
     Act will give power to the Assembly to do 
     <lb/>
     that. The clause of the Bill in relation to 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of justices of the peace 
     <lb/>
     and police magistrates as it appears 
     <lb/>
     in the old Bill will be amended by adding 
     <lb/>
     to subsection 4 the following words : " or 
     <lb/>
     unless he is a magistrate of not less than 
     <lb/>
     three years' standing in Canada." This 
     <lb/>

     means that no person shall be appointed a

     solicitor in any one of the provinces of Can<lb break="no"/>ada for a period not less than three years, 
     <lb/>
     or unless he is a magistrate of not less than 
     <lb/>
     three years' standing. Section 9 provides 
     <lb/>
     that any one charged with treason, or an 
     <lb/>
     offence punishable with more than five 
     <lb/>
     years' imprisonment, may challenge per<lb break="no"/>emptorily ; as the Act now stands it is only 
     <lb/>
     in cases of felony and treason that there is 
     <lb/>
     a peremptory challenge.

     <lb/>
     acts punishable by imprisonment for more

     <lb/>
     Bill provides that the Legislative Assembly 
     <lb/>
     shall have power to confer upon territorial 
     <lb/>
     courts jurisdiction as to matters of alimony; 
     <lb/>
     a question having arisen as to their power 
     <lb/>
     to do that. By section 22 the Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor, with the consent of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor in Council, may close up any road 
     <lb/>
     that is transferred to the Territories or vary 
     <lb/>
     its direction. That is the law in a separate 
     <lb/>
     Act, but we are introducing it into the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories Act, and providing 
     <lb/>
     that the Lieutenant-Governor may with the 
     <lb/>
     consent of the Governor in Council, do in 
     <lb/>
     this respect what the Assembly now does. 
     <lb/>
     As the law now stands a great deal of delay 
     <lb/>
     is occasioned by requiring the assent of the 
     <lb/>
     Assembly. These are all the changes.

     <lb/>
     in the statement of rthe Dominion liabilities 
     <lb/>
     in the Public Accounts. On looking over 
     <lb/>
     the schedules we have been unable to dis<lb break="no"/>cover where this liability is embraced, or 
     <lb/>
     whether, indeed, it is put in as a liability of

     the Government at all. I would like to ask 
     <lb/>
     the hon. First Minister if it is embraced in

     the force on active service in the North 
     <lb/>
     west, was read the second time, and House 
     <lb/>
     resolved itself into committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     (In the Committee.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. There are a few military 
     <lb/>
     bounty warrants out now, which people seek 
     <lb/>
     to apply to unsurveyed land, and until the 
     <lb/>
     land is surveyed they will not be able to 
     <lb/>
     make entry for it. We have been extend<lb break="no"/>ing the time, and this Bill is to extend it 
     <lb/>
     further to 1896, which will be a finality. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MARTIN. I am agreeable to the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     but it might be an advantage to some of 
     <lb/>
     these parties if a clause were added giving 
     <lb/>
     them the right to transfer this privilege. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. We could not agree to that. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. MARTIN. Any reasons ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. There are reasons. It is to 
     <lb/>
     stop speculation. If we .were to agree to 
     <lb/>
     transfer, there would be no end to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MARTIN. In this case the right is 
     <lb/>
     already earned. The right to a homestead 
     <lb/>
     may not be of any particular value to many 
     <lb/>
     of them, and why should they not have a 
     <lb/>
     right to sell ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. The hon. gentleman will un<lb break="no"/>derstand that these military bounty warrants 
     <lb/>
     are applied on homesteads, and the holders 
     <lb/>
     have to perform the. necessary conditions. 
     <lb/>
     We do object, to giving power of transfer 
     <lb/>
     when they apply for it. You can transfer a 
     <lb/>
     military bounty warrant. It can be sold by 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
