     NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES REPRE<lb break="no"/>SENTATION ACT.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName> moved for leave to introduce 
     <lb/>
     Bill (No. 94) to amend the Acts respecting 
     <lb/>
     the Representation of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories in the Parliament of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. Explain, please. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. As hon. gentlemen are aware, 
     <lb/>
     at present the Territories are represented in 
     <lb/>
     this House by four members, from Saskatch<lb break="no"/>ewan, East Assriniboia, Western Assiniboia 
     <lb/>and Alberta. We propose under this Bill, to 
     <lb/>divide Alberta into two constituencies giving 
     <lb/>an additional representative to Alberta, and 
     <lb/>in consequence an addtional representative to 
     <lb/>the North-west Territories. Clause 44 of the 
     <lb/>original Act was struck out some two years 
     <lb/>ago, and I have received a petition from 
     <lb/>the Assembly of the Territories asking that 
     <lb/>the clause should be restored. I am restor<lb break="no"/>ing clause 44 by this Bill, but providing that 
     <lb/>the oath is not to be taken by the elector pre<lb break="no"/>senting himself at the poll in the manner set 
     <lb/>forth in the original Act. He must sub<lb break="no"/>scribe to and take the oath in the form pre<lb break="no"/>scribed in the schedule. I am informed that 
     <lb/>clause 44 was struck out of the original Bill 
     <lb/>in the Senate, because a great deal of perjury 
     <lb/>had taken place in Eastern Assiniboia, and I 
     <lb/>have endeavoured under this Bill to prevent 
     <lb/>anything of that kind, by providing that those 
     <lb/>who apply to the deputy returning officer to 
     <lb/>have their names put on the list, shall sub<lb break="no"/>scribe to the oath and swear to it before the 
     <lb/>deputy returning officer. It is believed that 
     <lb/>there will be less danger of perjury if the 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
        
        
     person has to sign the affidavit. I have 
     <lb/>
     changed the oath of the enumerator, making 
     <lb/>
     it similar to the oath of the revising officer 
     <lb/>
     under the Franchise Act. The oath provided 
     <lb/>
     for in the Bill is as follows :â€” 
     <lb/>

     I, enumerator for the polling 
     <lb/>
     district No. (or as the case may be), of

     the Electoral District of swear 
     <lb/>
     (or solemnly affirm) that I will well and faithfully 
     <lb/>
     discharge the duties assigned to me, without 
     <lb/>
     favour or partiality ; that I will place no name 
     <lb/>
     on the list of voters for the said polling district 
     <lb/>
     and will strike no name off the said list, unless 
     <lb/>
     I shall be satisfied that the said name should 
     <lb/>
     by law be placed on or struck off the said list ; 
     <lb/>
     and that I will in all respects conform to the 
     <lb/>
     law to the best of my judgment and ability.

     These are the only provisions of the Bill.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. This Bill, as I understand, 
     <lb/>
     meets the point that was intended to be met 
     <lb/>
     in the Bill which I placed upon the paper, 
     <lb/>
     and I think also the Bill that my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Martin) placed there. There is in ad<lb break="no"/>dition to that, an additional member provid<lb break="no"/>ed for in the North-west Territories. The 
     <lb/>
     chief thing which the peeple up there are in<lb break="no"/>terested in is met by the first part of the Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MART1">Mr. MARTIN</persName>. Do I understand the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior to say that Alberta is 
     <lb/>
     simply divided into two, and that he does 
     <lb/>
     not alter Eastern or Western Assiniboia ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. It is simply a division of Al<lb break="no"/>berta by the line which is the southern 
     <lb/>
     boundary of Saskatchewan being extended 
     <lb/>
     2westerly to the western boundary of Alberta. 
     <lb/>
     This line runs south of Innisfail. It is nearly 
     <lb/>
     as equal a division of the population of Al<lb break="no"/>berta as it is possible to make. The boun<lb break="no"/>daries of Eastern and Western Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     remain as before.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). Is there any pro<lb break="no"/>vision for another Senator ?

            </p>
   
    

            <p>
   <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. That is provided for in a Bill

     that is being introduced in the Senate by the

     Premier.

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. Provision ought to be

     made for the deputy returning officer having

            </p>
   
            <p>
