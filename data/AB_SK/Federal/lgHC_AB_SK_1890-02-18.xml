<head rendition="simple:centre">ALLEGED CAPTURE OF A WHITE GIRL BY <lb/>
INDIANS.</head>

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I wish to ask the Minister <lb/>
of the Interior whether his Department has any <lb/>
information as to the white girl held captive by <lb/>
the Blackfeet Indians? An hon. member laughs. <lb/>
This is a matter which may be of small importance <lb/>
to him, but there are people who will consider it a <lb/>
matter of very great importance. I call the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Minister to an article in the MacLeod <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Gazette</hi>, which reads as follows:‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
    <p>"Last week the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Gazette</hi> referred to the fact that a white <lb/>
girl was a captive among the Blackfeet Indians. We <lb/>
mentioned the age of the girl as being about five or six <lb/>
years. We have since learned that she is quite nine years <lb/>
old. Some doubt has been expressed in several quarters <lb/>
        as to the truth of the story told in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Gazette</hi> last week. <lb/>
There is not the slightest doubt that it is true in every <lb/>
particular. Winnipeg Jack, whose captive the girl is, is <lb/>
an Indian. He can speak English, an since Lord Stan<lb break="no"/>lely's visit to the reserve he has been made an interpreter. <lb/>
The story, as told by the Indians, is that the child was <lb/>
captured in a raid made by the Indians on the other side <lb/>
of the line, in which her father, an American officer was <lb/>
killed. Now that the Government are aware of the facts <lb/>
for if they are not they should be, it will be their sacre <lb/>
duty to take immediate and prompt action to rescue this <lb/>
girl even if it brings every Indian in the North-West <lb/>
Territories about their ears. There is no time to be lost. <lb/>
The girl is said to be nine years old, and if she is to be <lb/>
save from the horrible fate that is surely in store for <lb/>
her, should she remain where she is, there must he no <lb/>
delay, but prompt action. There should be no parleying." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>I think this may be information which is not in the <lb/>
possession of the Government, and now that it is <lb/>
made public, prompt action should be taken by the <lb/>
head of the Department in regard to this matter. <lb/>
I feel it to be my duty to ask the hon. gentleman <lb/>
whether his Department has any information in <lb/>
regard to it, and, if it has not, I desire to bring it <lb/>
to his attention? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DEWD1">Mr. DEWDNEY</persName>. If the hon. gentleman had <lb/>
given me notice that he proposed to make this <lb/>
enquiry to-day, I would have brought the papers <lb/>
in connection with the subject. It was during last <lb/>
summer that the matter was first brought to the <lb/>
attention of the Government. An enquiry was <lb/>
made, and we hold the correspondence in the <lb/>
Department, which correspondence I shall be happy <lb/>
to grin down, or show to the hon. gentleman if he <lb/>
should inclined to see it. Upon enquiry made, <lb/>
and from information obtained from the Indians on <lb/>
the reserve where the white child is supposed to <lb/>
be, it appears that the child is the daughter of the <lb/>
woman with Whom she is now living. When the <lb/>
matter was brought to my attention, I remembered <lb/>
that I had seen the child myself, and while she <lb/>
appears to have white blood in her veins, it never <lb/>
struck me that she was a white child. The woman <lb/>
has another child, about three years of age, who is <lb/>
as light in color as the girl who is supposed to be <lb/>
the den hter of the American officer. I do not <lb/>
believe she is a white child, but we are making full <lb/>
enquiries, and we propose to follow them up in <lb/>
order to ascertain whether the assertion I have <lb/>
heard made is correct or not. I think it is not. <lb/></p>

<head rendition="simple:centre">THE FRENCH LANGUAGE IN THE NORTH-<lb break="yes"/>WEST.</head>
        

<p>House resumed adjourned debate on the pro<lb break="no"/>posed motion of Mr. McCarthy for second reading <lb/>
of Bill (No. 10) to further amend the Revise <lb/>
Statutes of Canada, chapter 50, respecting the <lb/>
North-West Territories; the motion of Mr. Davin <lb/>
in amendment thereto, and the motion of Mr. <lb/>
Beausoleil in amendment to the amendment. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. Mr. Speaker, I am sure the <lb/>
sentiment will be re-echoed by many of us, when I <lb/>
say that it was not without a deep feeling of <lb/>
anxiety that I heard the beginning of this debate. <lb/>
I am still surer to respond to the feelings of all in <lb/>
expressing the sincere hope that, after all, it will <lb/>
be for the better that the debate had taken place, <lb/>
as it will dispel every suspicion and prevent any <lb/>
misunderstanding; and in that respect I cannot re<lb break="no"/>frain from thanking the hon. gentlemen opposite, <lb/>
for their moderation, their sincerity and their <lb/>
patriotic stand, in discussing this delicate, this <lb/>
dangerous question. Let us hope that the debate <lb/>
will continue in the same spirit. The sensation-<lb break="yes"/>mongers who expected to see the parliamentary <lb/>
arena transformed into a regular battlefield will <lb/>
be disappointed, but the good name of the Can<lb break="no"/>adian representatives, the good credit of the <lb/>
country will gain in value all that our detractors <lb/>
will lose in their expectations. It was thought, <lb/>
nay, it was predicted, that the inflammable <lb/>
materials which enter into the composition of all <lb/>
societies would be set on fire, and that our fine <lb/>
Dominion would soon be all in a blaze; let us hope‚Äî <lb/>
and it looks so, fortunately‚Äîlet us hope that those <lb/>
inflammable elements, suspicion, prejudice and <lb/>
rivalry, will all be consumed and nothing will be <lb/>
left but the fine, solid, sterling gold frame of our <lb/>
young Confederation, more solid and brighter than <lb/>
ever, inviting the admiration of the world as it in<lb break="no"/>vites the covetous eye of our powerful neighbor. <lb/>
Were it not for that hope, were it not for the appy <lb/>
turn that the discussion has taken, I'would say that <lb/>
it is with a sense of deep regret that I have seen <lb/>
the Bill placed before the House by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe. I thought, and I had hoped <lb/>
the day had gone by when we would be called upon <lb/>
to discuss questions conducive to no public good, <lb/>
irritating in their nature and unjust in their object. <lb/>
It was to be expected that in the latter end of the <lb/>
nineteenth century, ideas which savor of what <lb/>
are considered by many as dark ages, would not <lb/>
be advocated in a British Canadian Parliament, <lb/>
advocated by one of the most eminent members of <lb/>
a profession where forbearance, liberality and <lb/>
good fellowship are so universally ractised. The <lb/>
hon. member for Simcoe has argued very strongly <lb/>
against the propriety of enacting the right to <lb/>
dual language in the North-West from the fact <lb/>
that, at the time of the cession of Canada, no such <lb/>
clause was inserted in the Articles of Capitulation, <lb/>
in the Treaty of Paris, in the Quebec Act of 1774, <lb/>
and in the Act of 1791. Discouragingly blind in <lb/>
the perception of historical facts, in the apprecia<lb break="no"/>tion of significant events, the hon. member has not <lb/>
seen that the law of nations secured that right to <lb/>
a people who had against them the fate of war, <lb/>
but who were not conquered, in the strict sense <lb/>
of the word, since the last regular engage<lb break="no"/>ment of that war, the battle at Ste. Foye, <lb/>
was a brilliant victory for the French; <lb/>

<pb n="817" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00817.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">817</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 18, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">818</fw>

and if the hon. member had only taken some <lb/>
of the first official documents under the mili<lb break="no"/>tary regime which followed the Cession, he <lb/>
would have found that the British generals, still <lb/>
smarting under the irritation of a long and obstin<lb break="no"/>ate struggle, were more generous to their foes of <lb/>
yesterday than is my hon. friend for the inoffensive <lb/>
descendants of the discoverers and first settlers of <lb/>
the Hudson's Bay and Rupert's Land. It is a fact <lb/>
worthy of consideration, a fact which should not <lb/>
be overlooked, that, acting according to his instruc<lb break="no"/>tions, or applying simply the general laws which <lb/>
govern the relations between the conquerors and <lb/>
the vanquished, General Murray, the first Governor <lb/>
of Quebec, used the French language in all his <lb/>
dealings with the King's new subjects. I hold in <lb/>
my hand his proclamation, dated 1764, which <lb/>
enacts in what manner his future proclamations <lb/>
shall be published, and it is in French. General <lb/>
Carleton, afterwards Lord Dorchester, issued a pro<lb break="no"/>clamation in 1770, before the "Quebec Act," in <lb/>
which he states that proclamations shall be made <lb/>
in English and in French. All the ordinances of <lb/>
the Quebec Gazette, which is made up chiefly of <lb/>
official documents, are printed in English and in <lb/>
French, from the date of its first issue in 1764. <lb/>
Have I not reason to wonder, Mr. Speaker, that <lb/>
over one century ago we can find such liberal ideas <lb/>
prevailing, in comparison with those of self-styled <lb/>
high-toned and high-minded gentlemen of this <lb/>
enlightened age? Taking at a glance a general <lb/>
view of the policy of the British Government in <lb/>
this country, I am glad to say that I find that it <lb/>
has always been most intelligent, most liberal, <lb/>
except for some period when the home <lb/>
Government was inspired by the misrepresenta<lb break="no"/>tions of some of their friends in Canada. <lb/>
I regret also that the hon. member should have <lb/>
thought fit to bring in this Bill‚Äîwhich, according <lb/>
to the plan of campaign expounded in the press <lb/>
and in the public meetings of the Equal Righters, <lb/>
is the first practical step in the hostile movement <lb/>
directed against, a people whose loyalty to the <lb/>
Crown and British institutions is above suspicion. <lb/>
I say that this is the first step, because we all <lb/>
know that what is asked for in this Bill is only a <lb/>
small portion of what is desired. Judging from <lb/>
the utterances of the hon. member, outside of <lb/>
Parliament, we must expect blows to be directed <lb/>
at the Catholic minority of Ontario, of Manitoba, <lb/>
of the North-West Territories; it is hoped <lb/>
for that the day will soon come when the <lb/>
Catholics and the French, if they wish to have <lb/>
schools of their own, will have to support them <lb/>
and also the public schools of those portions <lb/>
of the country. This Bill, therefore, is the initial <lb/>
step in a direction leading to all sorts of <lb/>
strife, is the first step in the reversal of a generous <lb/>
licy which all classes of the population of Canada <lb/>
have approved of for upwards of fifty years. This <lb/>
enlightened pohcy has given us prosperity, good <lb/>
feeling among the different races, good fellowship <lb/>
among public men. We have been taught to <lb/>
esteem each other, in working to ether for the <lb/>
common good of the country, sinking down all <lb/>
race and creed prejudices, agreeing to disagree on <lb/>
several subjects, but all agreeing to push the <lb/>
country forward in the path of material prosperity. <lb/>
We are asked to-day, to reverse that policy, to go <lb/>
back to the days of strife, of bitter feeing, out <lb/>
of which no good can come. It behooves men <lb/>

<cb/>

that value the peace and prosperity of the country, <lb/>
to stamp out this dangerous agitation, to discour<lb break="no"/>age it at the outset and let well alone. <lb/>
Many right-meaning men do not see the <lb/>
ultimate result of this first move, because <lb/>
if they understood it I am sure it would receive <lb/>
condemnation at their hands. The legislation <lb/>
which we are asked to place in our statutes, not <lb/>
only savors of persecution, but is also retrograde. <lb/>
I take it for granted that the quality of British <lb/>
citizenship is not incompatible with a foreign <lb/>
origin, that a British subject may be of French <lb/>
origin and a Roman Catholic. If you admit of <lb/>
this double proposition, which I claim to be a fair <lb/>
and just one, which I have never heard contested, <lb/>
I do not see how any one can countenance the <lb/>
Bill now before this House. If you admit my <lb/>
proposition, if we of the Province of Quebec are <lb/>
British subjects enjoying all the privileges and <lb/>
rights which this quality confers, I cannot under<lb break="no"/>stand how the member for North Simcoe can ask <lb/>
the House to accept his Bill, in the light of what has <lb/>
been done in the Province of Quebec to satisfy the <lb/>
claims, the just claims of the Protestant minority. <lb/>
This extraordinary war, declared on the minority <lb/>
of the western part of the Country cannot be <lb/>
looked upon otherwise than as cruel and uncalled-<lb break="yes"/>for by every inhabitant of the Province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec. The different sections of the population <lb/>
have managed to work in harmony, presenting the <lb/>
pleasing spectacle of a people divided by nation<lb break="no"/>alities and religion, but united for all other pur<lb break="no"/>poses. Does the promoter of the Bill now before <lb/>
the House know how the minority there have been <lb/>
treated? Does he know that when Confederation <lb/>
took place, it was agreed between the leaders of <lb/>
Quebec that the limits of twelve counties of <lb/>
Quebec Province, in which the English element <lb/>
predominated at that time, would never <lb/>
be changed without the consent of the <lb/>
representatives of those counties? Does the <lb/>
hon. gentleman ignore that the Protestant <lb/>
minority have practically a Council of public in<lb break="no"/>struction of their own, which has complete con<lb break="no"/>trol of educational matters? Does he know that <lb/>
in the smallest municipalities of the Province of <lb/>
Quebec this control exists? Surely he must be <lb/>
aware that every request of the minority in Que<lb break="no"/>bec has always been granted by the majority? A <lb/>
few years ago it was suggested that a separate <lb/>
gaol be set apart for the Protestants, and this sug<lb break="no"/>gestion was acted upon and has now become a fact. <lb/>
Later on it was likewise suggested that a special <lb/>
lunatic asylum should be constructed for Protest<lb break="no"/>ant patients, and the scheme is now bein carried <lb/>
out. The Protestants of Quebec are satisfied; but, <lb/>
strange to say, they are taken to task by men like <lb/>
the promoter of the coercive legislation now pro<lb break="no"/>posed to this House, and are blamed for their being <lb/>
satisfied. People have been speaking of the power <lb/>
of the Catholic Church. Power from whom? My <lb/>
English Protestant friends, I suppose, do not pre<lb break="no"/>tend that the Roman Catholic Church extends its <lb/>
power over them; what, then, their grievances are, <lb/>
I am at a loss to know. But I would read here <lb/>
the opinion of a man who has been living all his <lb/>
lifetime in the Province of Quebec, of a man whose <lb/>
liters merit is onl equalled by the keen percep<lb break="no"/>tion of an unprejudiced and thoroughly informed <lb/>
observer as set forth in an article published in one <lb/>
at the periodicals of Toronto, which must have <lb/>

attracted considerable public attention. It is an <lb/>
article written by Mr. S. E. Dawson, of Montreal, <lb/>
and I will quote a few sentences from it just to <lb/>
show what is the true feeling of the Protestant <lb/>
minority in the Province of Quebec in regard to <lb/>
those pretended grievances: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The English Protestant minority in the Province of <lb/>
Quebec ought to be very unhappy, if for no other reason, <lb/>
because so many estimable people in the sister Provinces <lb/>
and in the United States seem to be distressed on their <lb/>
account. It is not pleasant to be the object of so much <lb/>
solicitude, Besides, it is too late. The doctrine of <lb/>
'States' rights' has been so persistently maintained by <lb/>
the other Provinces, especially by New Brunswick and <lb/>
Ontario, that it is imposslble to deny to the French in <lb/>
Quebec those powers which the English majorities in the <lb/>
other Provinces have successfully asserted. What <lb/>
assistance, then the other Provinces can afford to the <lb/>
minority of Quebec does not clearly appear, even if that <lb/>
minority shared generally in the gloomy apprehensions <lb/>
felt elsewhere on their account. <lb/></p> 

<p>"The English minority ought also to be unhappy be<lb break="no"/>cause of the civil and religious disadvantages which it <lb/>
would appear from outside sources that they are obliged <lb/>
to endure. And, then, if perchance any one of the minor<lb break="no"/>ity faintly suggests that he cannot perceive anything un<lb break="no"/>usually hard in his lot‚Äîanything beyond what falls to <lb/>
minorities elsewhere‚Äîme is chidden by 'superior persons' <lb/>
for not realising his abject condition. So that he becomes <lb/>
discouraged because he is not unhappy enough to please <lb/>
his neighbors. <lb/></p> 

<p>"For, after all, in real deed, the most of us who have <lb/>
long resided in this Province do not find it in the least <lb/>
disagreeable. Unless the Anglo-Saxon mind is at an <lb/>
early age familiarised with other races and religions, it is <lb/>
apt to form fixed ideas. And so it often happens that the <lb/>
rench Roman Catholic, as imagined by our outside <lb/>
friends, is different from the person we come in daily <lb/>
contact with. An Englishman may dwell a life-time in <lb/>
peace in the heart of French Canada. Nobody will leave <lb/>
tracts at his door or give them to his children. He may <lb/>
be on excellent terms, and even exchange hospitalities, <lb/>
with the cur√©; but if that reverend gentleman should feel <lb/>
any doubts about his host's future state, he will never be <lb/>
disagreeable enough to express them." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, this is, unfortunately, the <lb/>
position of affairs in the Province of Quebec since <lb/>
the beginning of this agitation. Nobody knows <lb/>
where the evil is. The evil does not exist; but <lb/>
our Protestant friends in the Province of Quebec, <lb/>
who have not complained, are taken to task and <lb/>
are lectured because they do not understand that <lb/>
they are unhappy, even if they do not see it or <lb/>
feel it. Mr. Speaker, what is the principle, or <lb/>
rather the negation of principle, at the bottom of <lb/>
the Bill presented by my hon. friend from Simcoe? <lb/>
It is coercion in a matter where coercion cannot <lb/>
exist. Coercion has been tried in several coun<lb break="no"/>tries in matters of language and religion, and <lb/>
everywhere it has been tried the result has been <lb/>
contrary not only to expectations, but in a large <lb/>
measure contrary to the wish of those who have <lb/>
employed such means. Now, it is a very sad <lb/>
thing to see how the lessons of history are lost for <lb/>
our Equal Rights people, and how much, by <lb/>
neglecting this part of their education, they are <lb/>
drifting into a channel of narrow ideas. During <lb/>
the early part of the British regime in Canada, <lb/>
compulsion and coercion was trio with a view of <lb/>
welding together the different elements of popula<lb break="no"/>tion, so as to form a homogeneous nation, and it<lb/>
    was always found that this coercion had a result <lb/>
quite contrary to what was expected. The most <lb/>
enlightened of our governors have declared time <lb/>
and again that the only way to strengthen British <lb/>
rule in Canada was to conciliate the King's new <lb/>
subjects. Such was the opinion of General Mur<lb break="no"/>ray, of Lord Derchester, of Sir J. Provost, and of <lb/>
many others, including and foremost amongst them, <lb/>

<cb/>

Lord Elgin. The Equal Righters, who are also, <lb/>
most of them, Imperial Federationists, think differ<lb break="no"/>ently; but I may tell them that if their aim is to <lb/>
perpetuate British institutions in America by sow<lb break="no"/>ing the seed of dissatisfaction, they are wide of the <lb/>
mark. There is one consideration which naturally <lb/>
springs from what I have just said. It is this: <lb/>
That they appear to have lost sight of the <lb/>
broad policy inaugurated by the English Govern<lb break="no"/>ment years ago, but they should not overlook the <lb/>
fact that if they can boast to-day of the title of <lb/>
British citizens, which they profess to value so <lb/>
much, they owe it to the ancestors of the very <lb/>
people they seem to hate and despise. What would <lb/>
have become of the British rule in the wars of <lb/>
Independence and of 1812, if French Canada,‚Äîin<lb break="no"/>stead, I do not say of fighting, but of being loyal, <lb/>
had simply remained neutral. None but stone-<lb break="yes"/>blind men would say that this Canada of ours <lb/>
would still be a British country. It is a matter of <lb/>
history that the Governors of Canada in olden <lb/>
times would arrive here imbued with prejudices <lb/>
against the "Canadians," and that, after studying <lb/>
the country, these prejudices would make way for <lb/>
sounder notions leading to a change of policy. Im<lb break="no"/>mediately after the conquest, General Murray <lb/>
wrote to the Home Government in praise of the <lb/>
King's new subjects. Lieutenant-General Carleton, <lb/>
who, during the war of Independence, was saved <lb/>
from falling into the hands of American soldiers in <lb/>
his fight from Montreal to Quebec by a Canadian <lb/>
Officer‚ÄîGeneral Carleton was a fast friend of the <lb/>
people he was expected by some newly‚Äîlanded <lb/>
emigrant to crush out of existence. I could lengthen <lb/>
this list until your patience would be exhausted; <lb/>
but I must turn to things of the day, and say, <lb/>
that I am amazed to see men, very few I hope, <lb/>
brought up in contact with us, having for years <lb/>
professed the greatest friendship, accepted the <lb/>
hand extended to them, suddenly turn around on <lb/>
the Government to persecute and hound down the <lb/>
men they were so friendly to some months ago. I <lb/>
am amazed to find men of the day, aspiring to be <lb/>
the leaders of the people, reversing the policy in<lb break="no"/>augurated by men whose position placed them above <lb/>
the passions of the moment. When I see that the <lb/>
first Governors under the British rule, before the <lb/>
Quebec Act of 1874, and even during the military <lb/>
rule, condescended to publish the laws and the <lb/>
ordinances in French, I have a right to ex<lb break="no"/>press my surprise that this meagre measure of <lb/>
justice appears in the eyes of certain gentlemen to <lb/>
be too large for the French population of the western <lb/>
Territories. French was used, more than a century <lb/>
ago, to bring the ordinances before the people, <lb/>
and that, after a terrible war, when vanquished <lb/>
and conquerors were face to face; and now, after a <lb/>
union of over one century, this simple act of justice, <lb/>
of international courtesy, which costs the country <lb/>
the enormous sum of five hundred dollars a year, <lb/>
is considered out of place and too generous. If you <lb/>
expect to make a great country with such ideas you <lb/>
are sadly mistaken. Sir Henry Summer Maine and <lb/>
Sir Alfred Lyell have claimed as one of the brightest <lb/>
titles of Great Britain to the admiration of the civ<lb break="no"/>ilised world that, following the example of Rome, <lb/>
which left the conquered people their customs and <lb/>
institutions, England, in its acquisitions of territory, <lb/>
anted to the Crown's new subjects their former <lb/>
we and customs. If we look at the British Em<lb break="no"/>pire we find it carrying into eflect this generous <lb/>

principle of international law. The Equal Righters <lb/>
seem to think that the use of the French language <lb/>
is a monstrous privilege, something unheard of in <lb/>
other countries. They would not have to travel <lb/>
out of the British Empire to find out that we are <lb/>
not a privileged class, and that in many British <lb/>
colonies several other languages are spoken besides <lb/>
the idiom of Shakespeare. In the Windward <lb/>
Islands they will find the French laws and the <lb/>
French language accepted and used. In Mauritius <lb/>
French is spoken in the Legislative Council, and <lb/>
last year a proposition was made to introduce it in <lb/>
the law courts, and no one opposed it. I may here <lb/>
quote a remark which was made in that Assembly, <lb/>
and which will receive its application in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, if the Equal Righters have their own way. <lb/>
One of the speakers in the Mauritius Assembly <lb/>
said that a man coming out of court had re<lb break="no"/>marked: "I have been accused and condemned, <lb/>
and I do not know what for." Coming back <lb/>
to the British colonies I find also that French <lb/>
was introduced in the Seychelles Islands. <lb/>
Let us come nearer England. The Education <lb/>
Commission of 1886-7-8, in their final report, say, in <lb/>
regard to the demands from Wales, that the Welsh <lb/>
language should be used in the schools of Wales: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"It is felt that they should be allowed to take up Welsh <lb/>
as a specific subject recognised in the code; to adopt an <lb/>
optional scheme for English as a class subject suitable to <lb/>
the special needs of Welsh districts, such scheme being <lb/>
founded on the principle of substituting a graduate <lb/>
system of translation from Welsh to English for the <lb/>
resent requirements in English grammar; to teach <lb/>
Welsh along with English as a class subject; and to <lb/>
include Welsh among the languages in whic candidates <lb/>
for Queen's scholarships and or certificates of merit may <lb/>
be examined." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>With reference to Scotland, the same Commission<lb break="no"/>ers say: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"In districts where Gaelic is spoken the intelligence of <lb/>
the children examined under any paragraph of this <lb/>
article may be tested by requiring them to explain in <lb/>
Gaelic the meaning of any passages read or recited." <lb/></p>

<p>In India, according to the Progress Report, India, <lb/>

<p>In Heligoland education is compulsory. The chil<lb break="no"/>dren, mostly of Frisian origin and speaking their <lb/>

official language of courts and documents. In the <lb/>
Cape of Good Hope, in the Session of 1888, it was <lb/>
resolved that the notices of motion and orders of <lb/>
the day and all bills submitted to the Council be <lb/>
printed in the Dutch as well as the English lan<lb break="no"/>guage, and this resolution was carried by twelve to <lb/>
seven, and the Finance Gommittee asked to have a <lb/>
sum of money placed in the Estimates for this <lb/>
Purpose, which was done. And in 1884 an Act <lb/>

<cb/>

was passed under which judges may, and other <lb/>
judicial officers shall, allow the use of either the <lb/>
Dutch or the English language in courts of justice, <lb/>
and divisional councils of a certain number of <lb/>
voters could ask to have summonses and notices <lb/>
issued in Dutch. I shall have occasion to <lb/>
put before the House, in a moment, the opinion <lb/>
of a gentleman who visited Canada not long <lb/>
ago, one of the most prominent men of <lb/>
England, and a well-known writer, who drew <lb/>
a comparison then between the Cape of Good <lb/>
Hope and Canada, which he concluded by saying <lb/>
that the people of these two colonies are the last <lb/>
and best specimens of British conservatism which <lb/>
still exists, and that these colonies were kept true <lb/>
to England by the generous and liberal treat<lb break="no"/>ment which they received at the hands of the <lb/>
Imperial Government. I refer to Sir Charles <lb/>
Dilke. The debate on this subject has considerably <lb/>
widened. My hon. friend who proposed this <lb/>
measure, and those who support it, felt them<lb break="no"/>selves compelled to seek other reasons beyond the <lb/>
practical question to which they would like to re<lb break="no"/>duce it; and in their search for reasons they went <lb/>
to foreign countries. But in their search they <lb/>
were equally unfortunate. For what do we find? <lb/>
Take Austro‚ÄîHungary, we find that Louis Leger, <lb/>
in his history of Austro-Hungary, says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Universities of Vienna. Gratz Innsbruck and Ger<lb break="no"/>novic teach in German. The Chekh Universities teach in <lb/>

<p>"The University of Prague, which was first Latin and <lb/>

<p>Article 19 of the Fundamental Law promulgated in <lb/>

follows:‚Äî <lb/></p>

<p>"All the races of the Empire are on a footing of equal<lb break="no"/>ity and each one of the nations severally has aright <lb/>

the Empire for the purposes of administration or schools, <lb/>

<p>Vambery, in his History of Austria, says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"In 1859 a most important concession was made by the-<lb break="yes"/>Imperial Government to the spirit of nationality. By a <lb/>

<p>These examples show that the countries which <lb/>
have been wisely guided by the necessities of the <lb/>
different nationalities comprising them are those <lb/>
whose vitality is the most pronounced. If, in <lb/>
order to make a nation great, its people should <lb/>
speak but the one language, could it not be argued <lb/>
that there should be in the whole world but one <lb/>
language in order to make it perfect. If there is <lb/>
to assimilation, let there be assimilation all <lb/>
over the world; let there be but one language <lb/>
all over the world. If that is necessary for one <lb/>
nation, it is equally necessary for the whole world. <lb/>
That is the view held by Socialists. They say <lb/>
there should be no differences, no classes, that <lb/>
every citizen in the world should be treated as his <lb/>
neighbor is, and that Christian fraternity should <lb/>
be put in practice, in politics and in the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of the material and moral affairs of the <lb/>

people. They hold that all men should be equal <lb/>
in rank, in privileges, in right, and in every possi<lb break="no"/>ble way. This is communism, radicalism and <lb/>
demagogism. (I must say that in its logical con<lb break="no"/>sequences the Bill we discuss has that tendency.) <lb/>
The hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) <lb/>
has argued against the propriety of allowing the <lb/>
French language to be used in the North-West, <lb/>
on the ground that at the time of the cession <lb/>
of Canada no such law was inserted in the articles <lb/>
of capitulation, that it was not inserted in the <lb/>
Treaty of 1763, and that it was not in the Que<lb break="no"/>bec Act of 1774, or in the Act giving constitutional <lb/>
government to Canada in 1791. I say that is no <lb/>
argument. If it was not then enacted, the reason is <lb/>
this: there was a tacit understanding that the right <lb/>
of the people to their language should be respected. <lb/>
But my hon. friend has gone further, and has said: <lb/>
Oh, in a new country, where people are beginning <lb/>
to colonise and settle, it is wrong in principle and it <lb/>
is a wrong policy to permit differences of language. <lb/>
But there is no difference between the two cases. <lb/>
In the one case, you find the people in a conquered <lb/>
country attached to their own language, and you all <lb/>
allow them to speak it; in the other case, you are <lb/>
asking people to come from all parts of the world <lb/>
to settle in your country; is it not a wise policy <lb/>
to assure them that when they arrive here, they <lb/>
will find the laws of the country promulgated <lb/>
at least in a language they can understand. <lb/>
This has been the wise policy followed in England. <lb/>
It is true, however, the Equal Righters in this <lb/>
country have had ancestors in England. The <lb/>
Solicitor General in England, in the debate on the <lb/>
Act of 1774, speaks of a Canadian Grand Jury <lb/>
who some years before had returned an indictment <lb/>
against all the Roman Catholics of the country. But <lb/>
Sir, I repeat, it here: the British statesmen have <lb/>
framed a generous and liberal policy for the early <lb/>
government of this country, a policy which has <lb/>
saved this colony for England instead of sending <lb/>
it over to the "Stars and Stripes," or of creating a <lb/>
sort of Ireland here in America. In presence of <lb/>
the noble conduct of these statesmen I say that <lb/>
the policy to foster religious strife or race animo<lb break="no"/>sities, whether coming from a Quebec "Nation<lb break="no"/>alist" or a Toronto "Equal Righter" is the <lb/>
greatest enemy of British rule in Canada. More <lb/>
than one hundred years ago, when the English <lb/>
Parliament was meting out its first measure of <lb/>
justice to the French Canadians, in 1774, an <lb/>
English statesman, defending the Quebec Act, <lb/>
said that no address or eloquence: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Will succeed in inducing a polished assembly of men <lb/>
to adopt the barbarous principle that the moment a con<lb break="no"/>quest is obtained, it consists with humanity, it consists <lb/>
with wisdom, it consists with common honesty to take <lb/>
away all the laws of the conquered country, and more <lb/>
especially that portion of the laws which regulated the <lb/>
proceedings of the inhabitants in civil matters. Speaking <lb/>

<p>These are the moderated ideas of conquest. Such <lb/>
has been the practice of nations tween one <lb/>

hundred years, that celebrated debate can be quoted <lb/>
in a Canadian Assembly in a most appropriate man<lb break="no"/>ner. Prejudices from past ages still linger <lb/>

free land of America, but I hope that the vast <lb/>
majority of the citizens of Canada will stamp them <lb/>
out, will prefer peace and prosperity to religious <lb/>
and race strife, will leave to time the settlement <lb/>
of passing difficulties. I confess that the fate of <lb/>
the French language is in your hands; you can <lb/>

the people of Canada rise, through their representa<lb break="no"/>tives, in their power and strength, it will be to <lb/>
assert, after the British Parliament, that right <lb/>
stands in their estimation far above might. How <lb/>
differently inspired was Lord Dufferin when he had <lb/>
occasion to mention the French Canadian race and <lb/>
its language. Speaking, at the time of his admin<lb break="no"/>istration in Canada, at the Canadian Club in <lb/>
London, in 1875, that distinguished Governor <lb/>
General said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I may be permitted to remark on the extraordinary <lb/>
ability and intelligence with which the French portion <lb/>
of Her Majesty's subjects in Canada join with their <lb/>
British fellow-countrymen in working and developing <lb/>
the constitutional privileges with which (thanks to the <lb/>
initiative they were the first to take) their country has <lb/>
been endowed. Our French fellow-countrymen are, in <lb/>
fact, more parliamentary than the English themselves, <lb/>
and in the various fortunes of the colony, there have <lb/>
never been wanting French statesmen of eminence to <lb/>
claim an equal share with their British colleagues <lb/>
in shaping the history of the Dominion. What<lb break="no"/>ever may be the case elsewhere, in Canada, at all <lb/>
events, the French race has learned the golden rule and <lb/>
the necessity of arriving at practical results by the occa<lb break="no"/>sional sacrifice of logical symmetry and to the settlement <lb/>
of disputes, in the spirit of a genemus compromise. The <lb/>
spectacle of two peoples, formed from nationalities so <lb/>
diverse, putting forth all their strength, in generous <lb/>
rivalry of each other, to prove their loyalty to their <lb/>
Queen and to the Government, and laboring with con<lb break="no"/>certed action and in perfect harmony for the weal of their <lb/>
common country, wil1 remain one of the most remarkable <lb/>
and pleasing facts in the history of the world, while also <lb/>
it will testify to the political wisdom and the magnani<lb break="no"/>mous sentiments which pervade all the members of the <lb/>
great Canadian family." <lb/></p>

        <p>
And in Montreal in 1872, at the inauguration of <lb/>
the Queen's statue, on Victoria Square, Lord Duf<lb break="no"/>ferin, speaking of the minority in this Dominion, <lb/>
said: <lb/></p>

I could continue these quotations, but I will not <lb/>

erasing from the pages of the Statute three inof<lb break="no"/>fensive lines which, when erased, will not add an <lb/>
iota to the power, the success, the supremacy of <lb/>
his race in the North-West, whilst, as he well <lb/>

insult, as an attempt at oppression by those against <lb/>
whom his action is directed. No, Sir, the great <lb/>
legislators of the world‚Äîand my hon. and <lb/>
learned friend is well gifted enough to justify his <lb/>
ambition to be one of them‚Äîthe great legislators <lb/>
of the world have not gained their fame by such <lb/>
narrow legislation. They have added to the code <lb/>

</quote>
<p>The indisputable evidence of past history has <lb/>
long demonstrated the truth of those old but wise <lb/>
aphorisms. An hon. member‚ÄîI think the hon. <lb/>
member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charltony‚Äîhas <lb/>
quoted the example of Rome, but, if we go back <lb/>
to ancient history, what do we see? We see two <lb/>
great powers‚Äîaccording to the books of the col<lb break="no"/>leges, which I suppose every one of you has read <lb/>
and translated‚Äîtwo great nations warfaring one <lb/>
against the other for the supremacy of the world‚Äî <lb/>
Carthage and Rome. If we look at the policy <lb/>
of those two great cities which founded <lb/>
two great nations, we find that the ruin <lb/>
of Carthage was brought about in great <lb/>
measure by the hostility which it developed <lb/>
to the nations it had subdued by its armies. <lb/>
In Sicily, where important Greek settlements had <lb/>
fallen into its power, a regular persecution was <lb/>
organised against the language, the customs, <lb/>
the opinions of the conquered. It succeeded <lb/>
in making of them irreconcilable enemies <lb/>
who rose against it at the hour of danger. Rome, <lb/>
on the contrary, courted the sympathies of the <lb/>
Greeks whom she had conquered. She encouraged <lb/>
the study of their language; she preserved their <lb/>
laws, respected their customs, their religion, their <lb/>
schools. The result of the two policies is written <lb/>
in history. Carthage was destroyed, when every<lb break="no"/>thing seemed to promise her success and domina<lb break="no"/>tion. Rome gave to her citizens the freedom of <lb/>
the world and to her name an everlasting glory. <lb/>
What Carthage did, the Normans attempted in <lb/>
England after the conquest. There again the per<lb break="no"/>secution saw the victims victorious in the long <lb/>
struggle, and England was founded, to continue the <lb/>
traditions, the success and the glory of the Roman <lb/>
Empire. If the proud and magic "Civis Sum <lb/>
Romanus" has had a rival in the talismanic "I <lb/>
am a British subject," it is due, in a great meas<lb break="no"/>ure, to the liberal and generous policy of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, more than to the fear of her military power. <lb/>
The founder of the German Empire, Frederick <lb/>
the Great, understood the advantages which the <lb/>
conservative principles of the Catholic religion <lb/>
could give him in the Catholic provinces which <lb/>
he had subdued. He protected his new subjects <lb/>
in spite of the narrow-minded advisers who pre<lb break="no"/>dicted that the court of Vienna would be served, <lb/>
in its intrigues, by the protection given to the <lb/>
Catholics of Silesia. The great emperor took no <lb/>
heed of those short-sighted counsels. In one of <lb/>
his letters I read these memorable words: <lb/>
"Emperor Joseph continues his work of secular<lb break="no"/>isation without interruption. Here everybody <lb/>
remains as he was. I respect the rights of posses<lb break="no"/>sion, upon which society is founded." And his <lb/>
Catholic provinces of Silesia remained faithful to <lb/>
him. Examples of the same kind are to be found <lb/>
in the history of all the great nations of Europe, <lb/>
where union began under the warm and beneficial <lb/>
influence of generosity and forbearance, leaving <lb/>
to the action of time the work of blending <lb/>
together nationalities and languages in the direc<lb break="no"/>tion of perfect homogeneity. The great masters <lb/>

<cb/>

in political science, the founders of vast and per<lb break="no"/>manent empires, were above the prejudices of <lb/>
class, creed or race. Their wisdom enacted the <lb/>
    great <hi rendition="simple:italic">Jus Gentium</hi>, which is so, as Montesquieu <lb/>
observes, that "victory leaves to the conquered <lb/>
nations, besides life, those great things, liberty, <lb/>
laws, property, and religion always, when one is not <lb/>
blind, voluntarily." I might quote again, if I did <lb/>
not fear to weary the patience of the House, the same <lb/>
authority that I quoted a moment ago, to confirm <lb/>
my assertion, that Great Britain acted wisely in <lb/>
granting those liberties and privileges to Canada, <lb/>
and that Canadians merited such a liberal treat<lb break="no"/>ment at the hands of the mother country. Lord <lb/>
Dufferin, in his reception at Windsor, Ontario, on <lb/>
the 19th August, 1874, spoke as follows:‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"But it is not merely on this ground that we are under <lb/>
obligation to the French Canadian race. It must not be <lb/>
forgotten that it is to its loftiness of spirit to its love of <lb/>
liberty, and to its just appreciation of the civil rights <lb/>
contained in germ in the constitution originally granted <lb/>
by England to Canada, that we owe the development of <lb/>
this parliamentary autonomy of which the nation is so <lb/>
justly proud; and I can assure you that, in the eyes of <lb/>
an Englishman, there are few things more delightful to <lb/>
observe than the dignity the moderation, and the politi<lb break="no"/>cal capability, with which the French statesmen of <lb/>
Canada aid their English colleagues in applying and in <lb/>
putting into active operation these grand principles of law <lb/>
and of constitutional practice, which are the foundation <lb/>
of the free government of this country." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>After such high tributes given to our nationality <lb/>
I was surprised, Mr. Speaker, and I was shocked <lb/>
when I heard the hon. member for North Norfolk <lb/>
(Mr. Charlton) using the following language:‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"As to the loyalty of the Canadian bishops in refusing <lb/>
the offer of the Americans to join in the insurrection <lb/>

more than to the true impulse of patriotism and loyalty." <lb/></p>

to have been guilty of such a cruel anachronism. <lb/>

faults of a part of our clergy‚Äîand I am ready <lb/>
to admit that such amargin can be made use of‚ÄîI <lb/>
affirm, without fear of contradiction, that no more <lb/>
admirable and uninterrupted succession and tradi<lb break="no"/>tion of loyalty and devotion to the British Crown <lb/>
can be traced than to the history of the Roman <lb/>
Catholic Episcopacy of Lower Canada. I say, <lb/>
hoping that my words are not unparliamentary, <lb/>
that no more undeserved, no more unwarranted <lb/>
slander was ever written than the page of our <lb/>

the Catholic King of France had sent to assist the <lb/>

</quote>
<p>Are these the words of disloyal men? And can a <lb/>
man in his senses find an excuse for saying that <lb/>
those loyal appeals were not sincere? That noble <lb/>
priest, Mr. Speaker, became, very soon after, a <lb/>
prelate of our church, Bishop Plessis, one of the <lb/>
most eloquent, one of the most illustrious, one of <lb/>
the most loyal bishops of the Province of Quebec, <lb/>
who fought for the rights and liberties of his country<lb break="no"/>men, and who was afterwards favored with the <lb/>
friendship of the first statesman in England, and <lb/>
who received from the British Crown an acknow<lb break="no"/>ledgment of the services that he had rendered, <lb/>
both to his fellow-countrymen and to the British <lb/>
Empire. Wrongly informed by the books he read, <lb/>
the hon. member for North Simcoe said that the in<lb break="no"/>surrection in 1837 was a war of races and not the <lb/>
result of misgovernment. I am at a loss to know <lb/>
in what book the hon. gentleman has read the <lb/>
history of Canada. First, he forgets that the in<lb break="no"/>surrection was not limited to Lower Canada, that <lb/>
Upper Canada had its share of it; then, that several <lb/>
prominent Englishmen of the Province of Quebec <lb/>
took part in the Rebellion. Does he not know also <lb/>
that the principles upon which the constitutional <lb/>
battle was fought from 1791 to 1837 were those for <lb/>
which the English had been fighting for more than <lb/>
a century‚Äîin fact, for the articles of the Magna <lb/>
Charta‚Äîfor the pure, prompt and impartial ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of justice, for the control by the people <lb/>
of the expenditure of public money, for the redress <lb/>
of abuses and shocking favoritism from the personal <lb/>
and tyrannical chief of the Executive. The hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) and his <lb/>
friends‚Äîfor, after all, we must take them together, <lb/>
because they have a plan of campaign, they have <lb/>
entered upon an agitation which has been carried <lb/>
throughout the country‚Äîthese gentlemen submit <lb/>
three reasons in support of the Bill now before the <lb/>
House. These are: First, that the North-West has <lb/>
been rapidly filled by Anglo-Saxon immigration, and <lb/>
that the number of people speaking the French <lb/>
language is so small in the Territories that the <lb/>
expenditure involved in the use of a second lan<lb break="no"/>guage in official proceedings is a waste of money. <lb/>
econd, a dual language is a source of contention <lb/>
and division, and should never be allowed in the <lb/>

<cb/>

framing of the constitution of a new country. <lb/>
Third, the use of the French language was not <lb/>
allowed to the first inhabitants of the country after <lb/>
it fell into British hands; that it has always been <lb/>
a source of division and discord in this country, <lb/>
that it is inconsistent with true British loyalty; <lb/>
and that the sooner it disappears the better. I <lb/>
have endeavored to give answers to the two <lb/>
last reasons. But let us face squarely the argu<lb break="no"/>ment with regard to the Territories themselves. <lb/>
What is the reason given for objecting to the dual <lb/>
language in the North-West Territories? The <lb/>
hon. gentleman has said that the Act amending the <lb/>
first North-West Territories Act was passed at a <lb/>
time when there were no people in the Territories <lb/>
to assent or consent to it. But the hon. gentleman <lb/>
should remember that there was a population there <lb/>
at that time; and they were people who, with <lb/>
their ancestors, had occupied the country for <lb/>
nearly a century. The North Saskatchewan, Lac <lb/>
a la Fourche, Prince Albert, Edmonton and <lb/>
Battleford were settled. The Territories had a <lb/>
population in 1877, although it was not a teeming <lb/>
population. And why was it that the French <lb/>
language was allowed to those people? It was be<lb break="no"/>cause at that time the great majority of the people <lb/>
of those Territories was French. Time has passed, <lb/>
and the country has been conquered peacefully by <lb/>
another race. Do hon. gentlemen imagine that <lb/>
we French Canadians of another Province find fault <lb/>
with that result? No; I speak here the sentiments <lb/>
of my fellow-countrymen when I say that the <lb/>
greater the Anglo-Saxon immigration is into those <lb/>
Territories the better for the Territories and for <lb/>
the country at large. They have put their <lb/>
money and their energies into that country. <lb/>
They have shown themselves good settlers, and <lb/>
they are now a large majority in these Territories. <lb/>
I am not sorry of it. I speak of it without any feel<lb break="no"/>ing or without any prejudice. As I have stated on <lb/>
many occasions, I have invited English to be <lb/>
spoken in my home, and the peace of that home <lb/>
has not been disturbed by the difference of lan<lb break="no"/>guage in our prayers to the Almighty. I do not <lb/>
envy my neighbor because he succeeds in the path <lb/>
of life, with another language, another creed than <lb/>
mine. The sun shines for all, and I leave him his <lb/>
right as I want him to leave me mine. We find <lb/>
from the census returns, which no one will con<lb break="no"/>trovert, that the French and French half-breed <lb/>
population in the Territories is in the proportion <lb/>
of 13 per cent. ‚Äîthat is to say, that one-seventh, or a <lb/>
little more, of the population, is French, as to the <lb/>
language, in the North-West Territories. Now, in <lb/>
the Province of Quebec about one-sixth of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation is English, but nobody has ever dreamed <lb/>
of denying them the use of their language. <lb/>
My hon. friend may say you could not take <lb/>
from them the use of their language, because <lb/>
the constitution of the Province of Quebec would <lb/>
prevent you; nor could you do it, in view of the <lb/>
importance of the Anglo-Saxon race, their industry, <lb/>
their energy and the capital they have in the <lb/>
Province of Quebec. I will admit all that, but I <lb/>
say, and I speak for my countrymen when I say <lb/>
so, that, leaving those reasons aside, and consider<lb break="no"/>ing only the paramount right of minorities, if a <lb/>
measure were proposed in the Province of Quebec <lb/>
to abolish the use of the English language, I would <lb/>
be the first to denounce it and am sure the <lb/>
immense majority of my fellow-countrymen would <lb/>

do the same. My conservative instincts would pre<lb break="no"/>vent me from endorsing a proposition, which would <lb/>
be, in my estimation, unfair, unjust, demagogic <lb/>
in its tendencies as is the measure advocated by <lb/>
my hon. friend. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I rise to a question of <lb/>
order. An expression was used by the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister, for which my hon. friend on my right (Sir <lb/>
Richard Cartwright) was ruled out of order on a <lb/>
former occasion. I do not know if it is proper that <lb/>
it should be allowed to be used on one side of the <lb/>
House and not on the other. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. I am ready to withdraw it <lb/>
for the hon. gentleman, although I must say I was <lb/>
not thinking of him at the time. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. He was addressing it with <lb/>
regard to me, and I prefer that the word should <lb/>
not be withdrawn. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. I was referring to the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe when the member for North <lb/>
Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) called me to order, and I <lb/>
was calling this measure of the member for North <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) a revolutionary measure, <lb/>
a demagogic measure and I do not think the expres<lb break="no"/>sion unparliamentary. I say, that if such a meas<lb break="no"/>ure were proposed in the Province of Quebec, <lb/>
even though the English race occupied only the <lb/>
same position with regard to the French as the <lb/>
French do with regard to the English in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories, I would say "no" to such a pro<lb break="no"/>position. I would declare that no offensive predomin<lb break="no"/>ance should be given to the majority in a country <lb/>
where both races should be united. I ask myself <lb/>
what is the object to be gained by the measure <lb/>
proposed by my hon. friend? Is it to make the <lb/>
members of the Legislature of the North-West <lb/>
speak English? That cannot be the object, be<lb break="no"/>cause they all speak English now, and I understand <lb/>
there is not a single elected man who is French. <lb/>
Is it his object to prevent the votes and deliber<lb break="no"/>ations of the North-West Assembly being printed <lb/>
in French? That cannot be, for I believe they <lb/>
are, in fact, only printed in the English language <lb/>
now, for the obvious reason that the members are <lb/>
all English. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. They never have been printed <lb/>
in French. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. My hon. friend tells me, as <lb/>
a matter of fact, they never have been printed in <lb/>
French, and there is, therefore, no reason to make <lb/>
a law that they shall not be printed in that lan<lb break="no"/>guage. In the Privy Council at Ottawa our pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings are all in English, and there is no neces<lb break="no"/>sity for having them printed in French, not by <lb/>
law, but for the mere convenience of the case, <lb/>
and nobody complains. So it would be in the <lb/>
North-West Assembly. But, as regards the pro<lb break="no"/>mulgation of the laws, I appeal to the hon. <lb/>
member for Simcoe if it is not necessary that a <lb/>
large portion of that population, who understands <lb/>
only the French language, are entitled to know <lb/>
what laws they should obey and to have them <lb/>
printed in their own language? The French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians can lay claim to the title of being the first <lb/>
settlers of that country, and there is some value in <lb/>
that title. That title has been acknowledged to the <lb/>

<cb/>

Indians, even by the American Government, at a <lb/>
time when their policy towards the Indians was‚Äî <lb/>
I will not say barbarous‚Äîbut most severe, and <lb/>
in the North-West the first settlers were French, and <lb/>
the Hudson Bay Company respected their lan<lb break="no"/>guage and their customs. Why should we not <lb/>
treat them as well as they were treated when <lb/>
there was no regular government in those Terri<lb break="no"/>tories? I say that if the measure of my hon. <lb/>
friend became law, a large portion of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion would be without knowledge of the laws <lb/>
they are supposed to obey. And as the Legislature <lb/>
has in its hands the whole of the municipal govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the country, the injustice would be more <lb/>
cruel. If he had only said: it is useless that <lb/>
the Legislature of the North-West should have <lb/>
French in their proceedings, the answer would <lb/>
be the sentimental one that they have, as an <lb/>
important minority composed of the first settlers <lb/>
of the land, a right to speak French in that <lb/>
Legislature. But against that I would have <lb/>
said: Wait for the sub-division of the country, <lb/>
when there will likely be three or four French-<lb break="yes"/>speaking members elected to that body; then <lb/>
we would not have to pass Draconian laws <lb/>
here to prevent them having French, because they <lb/>
would have it. The English-speaking people of <lb/>
the North-West would be as courteous to them as <lb/>
the French-speaking majority in the Province of <lb/>
Quebec have been to the English-speaking minority <lb/>
in that Province; and we know very well that if <lb/>
there were French members in the North-West <lb/>
Council it would be allowed to them to speak <lb/>
French. There will soon be a very large German <lb/>
immigration into that country‚Äîand I hope there <lb/>
will be, the Germans make very good settlers‚Äîand <lb/>
suppose three or four members elected for the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature were German; if they wanted to speak Ger<lb break="no"/>man, they would have a right to do so. Sir, if you do <lb/>
not respect the covenants which have been entered <lb/>
into between the two important races in the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion, to the extent of permitting the laws of the <lb/>
land to be published in the language of the minority, <lb/>
you are committing a cruel injustice, and retarding <lb/>
the progress of the country. Why, Sir, we spend <lb/>
thousands of dollars every year to publish pamph<lb break="no"/>lets for distribution in France, Switzerland, <lb/>
Alsace-Lorraine and elsewhere‚Äîfor what purpose? <lb/>
To bring French immigration to Canada, to say <lb/>
to those people that when they arrive here they <lb/>
will find the ordinances of the country and many <lb/>
of those ordinances refer mainly to local interests <lb/>
and objects‚Äîand its laws printed in their own <lb/>
language. To deprive them of this privilege <lb/>
would be a gross injustice. But my hon. friend <lb/>
knew this very well; he knew that if he could pre<lb break="no"/>vent the promulgation and publication of the laws <lb/>
and ordinances of the North-West in French, he <lb/>
would prevent French immigration into that <lb/>
country. He knew it, and he did it with that <lb/>
object in view; he had the courage to acknowledge <lb/>
it. I am sorry to say that the Equal Righters who <lb/>
are acting with the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
are to blame if a war of races is the result of their <lb/>
agitation; but I hope I am not mistaken in believ<lb break="no"/>ing that many hon. gentlemen, whose names have <lb/>
been connected with those of the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe and the hon. member for North <lb/>
Norfolk, do not carry their feelings to that extent. <lb/>
I know that amongst them there are men who do not <lb/>
wish anything of that kind to happen. It is very <lb/>

<fw type="num">831</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">832</fw> 

easy to set fire to this very inflammable piece of <lb/>
timber, a race agitation, and take that agitation <lb/>
as a means to achieve success; but I must say that <lb/>
if there is a glow for the ambition of a public man, <lb/>
it should not be a glow coming from the fires of <lb/>
prejudice and passion which he himself has kindled. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman has taken charge of a measure <lb/>
which the people of the North-West would have <lb/>
confided to any of the members representing them <lb/>
here if a real grievance had existed. Who has <lb/>
moved him to introduce this Bill? Has he done <lb/>
it of his own motion or had he a mandate for doing <lb/>
it? He went up to the North-West on a mission, <lb/>
and he has accomplished it; but I hope and believe <lb/>
that he will accomplish nothing by his measure. <lb/>
This question should have been settled quietly <lb/>
among the people of the North-West as a local ques<lb break="no"/>tion, to be determined between them and the Federal <lb/>
Government, from whom the legislative power of <lb/>
the territories emanates. But the promoters of this <lb/>
measure do not think of making it a local question. <lb/>
Leave the question to the people to settle, and you <lb/>
may be sure that probably in two years hence there <lb/>
will be nothing left of the little fire which has been <lb/>
raised by the hon. member for North Simcoe. Has <lb/>
not the North-West disinterested members enough <lb/>
in this House to take charge of such a measure? Is <lb/>
it not an insult to them that a member from an <lb/>
eastern Province should take upon himself to put it <lb/>
forward and advocate it? It shall not pass here, <lb/>
because on every side of the House people are <lb/>
alarmed, if not disgusted, by the way in which <lb/>
it has been taken up and agitated. We might very <lb/>
well agree among ourselves to leave to the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Legislature the settlement of this question. <lb/>
We would say to them: You have not been <lb/>
elected in the North-West to settle that question; <lb/>
it relates to one of the organic articles of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of those Territories, which only the <lb/>
Parliament of Canada has a right to change; <lb/>
but we will be a paternal Parliament to you, and <lb/>
we will say to you, consult the people, and let the <lb/>
people of the. North-West say whether there is <lb/>
any use of your speaking French when you sit <lb/>
around the table of the Legislature. The elections <lb/>
would come, and after those elections they may come <lb/>
back and say: If we are to have a useful repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in that assembly, if we are to have a <choice><sic>pupu<lb break="no"/>lation</sic><corr>population</corr></choice> in those Territories, who will live harmoni<lb break="no"/>ously with their neighbors. we must not repeat the <lb/>
mistake of hurting the feelings of those with whom <lb/>
we are in partnership for the building up of this <lb/>
country. I say that to try to prevent those people <lb/>
publishing their laws in the language of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation, either in the French language or the English, <lb/>
would be an atrocity, a cruel measure, and a measure <lb/>
which would not induce immigrants or settlers to <lb/>
go into that country. There is one thing which I <lb/>
eel bound to say to correct a wrong impression, <lb/>
unjust to the hon. gentleman. My hon. friend <lb/>
from North Simcoe has been taken to task as being <lb/>
a Tory. I do not attach much importance to that <lb/>
little digression of my hon. friend, the leader of the <lb/>
Opposition. That is an eye‚Äîcatching color which <lb/>
he puts in his political paintings when before an <lb/>
election audience; the " Tory " is always brought <lb/>
into the back ground so as to bring out in greater <lb/>
contrast the great displa of the liberal principles <lb/>
which it is the hon. gentleman's wont to picture to <lb/>
his hearers. But in the subject under discussion <lb/>
there should be no question of party politics. The <lb/>

<cb/>

right hon. the leader of the Government answered <lb/>
my hon. friend from Quebec East (Mr. Laurier), by <lb/>
showing that the Tories have been at times the best <lb/>
protectors of our French Canadian nationality in <lb/>
this country. But in calling this Bill a Tory meas<lb break="no"/>ure, my hon. friend wanted to make out that it <lb/>
was an arbitrary, a retrograde measure. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. It was in<lb break="no"/>flamma-tory <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. No, it was that "or-a-tory" <lb/>
of my hon. friend that brought it out. My hon. <lb/>
friend wished to give a political meaning to this <lb/>
discussion. It has none, and I think it is but <lb/>
just to those who, on other occasions, have voted <lb/>
with the hon. member for North Simcoe, to say <lb/>
that the hon. gentleman himself had the courage <lb/>
‚Äîand it is not courage he wants ‚Äî to say that <lb/>
on this occasion he had separated himself entirely <lb/>
from the Conservative party. My hon. friend, the <lb/>
leader of the Opposition, calls all the Conservatives <lb/>
Tories; and I know that whatever denial we may <lb/>
give to the expressibn, he is bound to call us Tories. <lb/>
If he enjoys in calling us by that name, let him be <lb/>
happy. The hon. member for North Simcoe has in <lb/>
this question completely disassociated himself <lb/>
from his party; he has declared that on this <lb/>
question he is not in harmony with his party, but <lb/>
he declared, and had a right to do so, that upon other <lb/>
questions he would follow those whom he had always <lb/>
followed, and would continue to vote as a conserva<lb break="no"/>tive on such matters as, for instance, the National <lb/>
Policy. It would not be right to close the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party against the hon. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe and those who hold his views. This Bill <lb/>
which he has introduced has nothing to do with <lb/>
that party; it is a Bill of his own, and I hope, be<lb break="no"/>fore the debate is over, he will see that it is greatly <lb/>
restricted in his following. The hon. member for <lb/>
West Durham argued that the Federal Government <lb/>
should keep, in a certain measure at least, aportion <lb/>
of the power over the Territories. True, we have <lb/>
granted to the Territories a constitution; we have <lb/>
given them legislative power to some extent; but <lb/>
as we still have the administration of the Territories <lb/>
in our hands and to protect those whom we are <lb/>
inviting to come and settle there, this Government <lb/>
should keep a certain control over these Territories. <lb/>
We are bound to do that, as we are bound to give to <lb/>
the French population a free and easy access to the <lb/>
judicial tribunals we have established there. I do <lb/>
not believe that there are many in this House dis<lb break="no"/>posed to say that they are at heart in favor of the <lb/>
measure proposed. Its preamble is a provocation and <lb/>
a just cause of irritation to a large section of our <lb/>
people, and the principle of the Bil and its practical <lb/>
effect, if carried into a conclusion, would work in<lb break="no"/>justice and bad feeling in the old Provinces as well as <lb/>
in the North-West Territories. There are amongst <lb/>
those who support the measure of the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe men who, if they do not call them<lb break="no"/>selves Equal Rights advocates, are Imperial Feder<lb break="no"/>alists. Many of them pose as the advocates of what <lb/>
they deem to be the grand and the loyal policy of <lb/>
Imperial Federation. Let me ask them how they <lb/>
expect to help on their cause by this unfair, un<lb break="no"/>seemly, this persecuting agitation. The British <lb/>
Empire is composed of a eater variety of nations <lb/>
and creeds than was the Roman Empire. Do the <lb/>
Imperial Federalists think they are going to help <lb/>

on their scheme by prosecuting a minority, even in <lb/>
such a remote territory as the North-West? We <lb/>
are not in the same condition of things in which <lb/>
we were some years ago. Modern science has given <lb/>
new wings to political thought; every incident that <lb/>
occurs in Canada, of any importance, is known to<lb break="no"/>morrow as far as Cape Colony and in the remote <lb/>
regions of India; and I appeal to Imperial Federa<lb break="no"/>lists, who might be tempted to support the Bill <lb/>
before the House, not to injure their own cause, <lb/>
and to remember that all men interested and <lb/>
responsible for the future of the Queen's dom<lb break="no"/>inion will condemn them for entering into an <lb/>
agitation which would tend to destroy the loyalty <lb/>
of a portion of Her Majesty's subjects. These <lb/>
gentlemen pose as the representatives of Ontario <lb/>
and pretend to speak the voice of Ontario <lb/>
in protest against the use of the French language <lb/>
in Canada. I venture to tell them that they do not <lb/>
represent Ontario in this matter, that they do not <lb/>
speak the voice of Ontario in this agitation. The <lb/>
true voice of Ontario may still be heard in the <lb/>
echoes of that splendid demonstration made in <lb/>
December, 1884, in Toronto, in honor of Sir John <lb/>
A. Macdonald. It was my good fortune to be <lb/>
present at that grand and imposing reunion of the <lb/>
forces of the great Conservative party. I shall never <lb/>
forget the ovation given to the Old Chief when he <lb/>
entered the hall where five thousand voices <lb/>
acclaimed him with enthusiastic cheers. I shall <lb/>
never forget the warm, the cordial reception given <lb/>
to my hon. friends the Minister of Public <lb/>
Works and the Minister of Militia, and to myself. <lb/>
It was my first visit to Toronto and the impression <lb/>
I received, an impression which will never be effaced <lb/>
from my memory, was that the bond of friendship, <lb/>
nay, the bond of affection, that linked together the <lb/>
two great races of this Confederation, would resist <lb/>
any attack which interest, jealousy or preju<lb break="no"/>dice might direct against it. It was, it is true, <lb/>
a political demonstration, but it had a great <lb/>
character beyond that, which proved that differ<lb break="no"/>ent races, and different creeds, and different <lb/>
nationalities, might unite and work together in <lb/>
the best manner for the progress of our common <lb/>
country. This was the voice of Ontario, and I <lb/>
think it would be the voice of Ontario still. I say <lb/>
to the supporters, if there are any in Ontario, of <lb/>
the measure of the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
(Mr. McCarthy), that I believe the voice of Ontario <lb/>
would be still the same if the right hon. the leader <lb/>
of the House would appeal, on the same generous <lb/>
principles, to the same fair-minded population of <lb/>
Ontario to-day. Sir, I protest against that agitation, <lb/>
I protest against that plan of campaign as sug<lb break="no"/>gested in the speeches of the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), and indicated here <lb/>
and outside by the speeches of the hon. member <lb/>
for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton). I do not quote <lb/>
their expressions here. They are too ugly for me <lb/>
to quote them or, at all events, they are too pro<lb break="no"/>voking. It is not for us here to talk about opening <lb/>
a free road through the St. Lawrence for the <lb/>
Anglo-Saxon to pass to the conquest of the <lb/>
world. If that course is to be persisted in, Sir, I <lb/>
cannot qualify it in any other words, that if it is a <lb/>
political game it is a dangerous mistake, and if it <lb/>
is a determined and premeditated movement to be <lb/>
earnestly carried on, it is a criminal attack against <lb/>
the "peace, order and good government of the <lb/>
country." Sir, I hope that the hon. gentlemen will <lb/></p> 

<p>27 <lb/>

<cb/>

pause before venturing any further in the dark <lb/>
and dangerous path they have entered into. <lb/>
They will look in the past and around them, and <lb/>
they will see written on the walls the fate which <lb/>
awaits them. All public men who have tried to <lb/>
build up a political platform of such materials as <lb/>
prejudices and fanaticism have found out that the <lb/>
beams and rafters of their building did not long <lb/>
resist the action of time and the pressure of com<lb break="no"/>mon sense; they went down with the wreck, <lb/>
helpless and crippled, giving to the world a cruel <lb/>
lesson as to the inevitable fate of those who would <lb/>
attempt to imitate their example. Sir, I appeal <lb/>
to the higher instincts, to the nobler feelings of <lb/>
those who sincerely wish the consolidation of these <lb/>
British possessions, and whom the chances of <lb/>
politics do not affect. I ask them to think calmly <lb/>
of all this. They must know how dangerous are <lb/>
the elements which are brought into contact in <lb/>
the agitation which is carried on. They may be <lb/>
in earnest in believing that the strong currents <lb/>
thus put in motion will produce great and good <lb/>
results. Let them not forget that in dealing with <lb/>
these questions of race, nationality and religion <lb/>
they are dealing with the great electric currents <lb/>
of national life. Guide and govern these currents <lb/>
wisely, and you may draw from their united <lb/>
influences power and light and all the beneficent <lb/>
effects of the natural forces with which Providence <lb/>
has provided you. Misguide and misgovern <lb/>
them‚Äîuse them with ignorance, recklessness, <lb/>
or malice, ‚Äî and you may draw down on <lb/>
your heads unknown and uncounted disasters, <lb/>
ruin to individuals, confusion to communities, and <lb/>
disaster to the State. Sir, I agree with the hon. <lb/>
member for West Durham (Mr. Blake), I am not <lb/>
ready to accept the amendment proposed by the <lb/>
hon. memberfor Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil), although <lb/>
I am in accord with the principles of it, but I <lb/>
cannot find too strong language to express my <lb/>
repudiation of the principles, the form, the sur<lb break="no"/>roundings of the measure submitted. The Bill of <lb/>
the hon. member for North Simcoe is opposed to <lb/>
his own political record, principles and career. <lb/>
He supported with intelligence and vigor the <lb/>
policy of unity of action and harmony of thought <lb/>
of the different races which form this Dom<lb break="no"/>inion, irrespective of creed or language. He was <lb/>
present when the Acts giving a constitution to <lb/>
the North-West Territories were initiated, revised <lb/>
and passed, and he gave his acquiescence to that <lb/>
legislation. The Bill is opposed to the policy that <lb/>
has prevailed in Canada, of protecting the rights <lb/>
of minorities in the schools, in the Legislatures, <lb/>
in the Senate. It is opposed to the law of the <lb/>
land, which was approved by two Administrations <lb/>
and three Parliaments. It is opposed to the <lb/>
spirit of British legislation, which, in the case of <lb/>
Manitoba, provided a perpetual guarantee to the <lb/>
minority in regard to schools and language, and, <lb/>
in the case of any new Province hereafter created <lb/>
in the Territories, provided a guarantee of stability <lb/>
to the constitution given to it at the time of its <lb/>
creation. It is opposed to the general policy of the <lb/>
modern British Empire, which, in India, in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, in Cape Colony, respects the right of the <lb/>
people of different origin to have the legal and <lb/>
legislative use of their own language. It is opposed <lb/>
to the plainest facts of science, which prove that <lb/>
race is stronger than language, as may be seen in <lb/>
the case of the Irish and the Scotch, the German-<lb break="yes"/>

speaking Russians, the French, German and Italian-<lb break="yes"/>speaking Swiss, the Jews, the Spanish-speaking <lb/>
Mexicans, the German-speaking Alsacians. It is <lb/>
opposed to the true spirit of loyalty to the Crown, <lb/>
because no man, who is truly loyal to the Crown, <lb/>
would endeavor to stir up strife among the Queen's <lb/>
subjects by attempting to repeal, for the avowed <lb/>
purpose of persecution and extinction, laws which <lb/>
have had the sanction of the Crown in one form <lb/>
or another ever since the Cession of Canada. <lb/>
I wish to make one more remark as to the political <lb/>
record of the hon. member for North Simcoe. Let <lb/>
me refer to that great demonstration in Toronto, <lb/>
which showed so well the fraternity of the two <lb/>
races, and I wish that fraternity was more widely <lb/>
practised. I think that the public men of each <lb/>
Province ought to visit the other Provinces, and try <lb/>
to develop that good feeling which is so easily de<lb break="no"/>veloped when we are better acquainted with one <lb/>
another. In that great demonstration in Toronto <lb/>
what do we find? An address was presented to <lb/>
Sir John A. Macdonald by the Liberal Conservative <lb/>
party of Ontario. My hon. friend from Simcoe <lb/>
knows something of that address. On that occasion <lb/>
the chairman was appointed on the motion of Mr. <lb/>
Dalton McCarthy, and when the meeting was <lb/>
organised the chairman read an elaborate, an elo<lb break="no"/>quent address to Sir John Macdonald, two or three <lb/>
paragraphs of which I will read to this House, with <lb/>
as full an assurance of their being accepted here as <lb/>
they were accepted there: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The happy results of British rule in North America <lb/>
begun when the policy of Pitt was accomplished by the <lb/>
valor of Wolfe, would have been imperfect, if not <lb/>
frustrated, but for the cordial relations which you have <lb/>
for nearly half a century maintained, in spite of unjust <lb/>
and unpatriotic criticism, with the great men who have <lb/>
been the chiefs of the loyal Canadians of Quebec; and on <lb/>
this occasion we would mingle with our felicitations to <lb/>
yourself a tribute of grateful remembrance of Cartier, <lb/>
whose statue rises in another city to bear witness to his <lb/>
public deeds and to keep his memory green. * * * In <lb/>
a Confederation in which the people are divided by a very <lb/>
earnest and sincere difference of opinion in race, religion <lb/>
and political sentiment, unity of action and harmony of <lb/>
thought have been maintained with striking success by <lb/>
the wisdom, tact and true liberality with which you have <lb/>
made alike the Cabinet, the Provincial Executives, the <lb/>
Bench, the Bar, and the Public Service, bear witness to <lb/>
your forethought and care for the interests of races, <lb/>
creeds and opinions, as part of the forces by which <lb/>
nations are governed, and by the wise conduct of which <lb/>
they grow strong, united and prosperous." <lb/></p>

<p>No better inspired, no better worded sentiments <lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. Before this House rose at <lb/>
six o'clock I had been showing that it would be <lb/>
an injustice to the population of the North-West <lb/>
Territories, who were the first settlers there, and <lb/>
who, surely, deserve our consideration, if we were <lb/>
to deprive them of the privilege of having the laws <lb/>
published in a language that they understand. <lb/>
What has been the cause of the large influx of <lb/>
Anglo-Saxon settlers into the North-West? It is <lb/>
the millions of money that the old Provinces have <lb/>
voted to build the Canadian Pacific Railway. We <lb/>
all agreed to that; we all applauded the enterprise <lb/>

<cb/>

and the energy of those who built that road. What, <lb/>
again, has brought that immigration into the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory? It was the great, the richly subsidised colon<lb break="no"/>isation societies which brought thousands of im<lb break="no"/>migrants from Great Britain to take possession of the <lb/>
soil, and the railway companies who acquired large <lb/>
tracts of land as railway subsidies and have invested <lb/>
their capital there. All these newcomers were char<lb break="no"/>acterised by that spirit of enterprise which belongs <lb/>
to the English immigrants, and which leads them <lb/>
to take possession of the world wherever the world <lb/>
and its resources presents itself to them. We wel<lb break="no"/>come those desirable immigrants, we help them in <lb/>
the full measure of a dutiful Government. But <lb/>
must we, for all that, despise and forget the first <lb/>
settlers of those remote regions, those who re<lb break="no"/>vealed to us the treasure we had there? Sir, will <lb/>
not my hon. friend from North Simcoe give to <lb/>
these old settlers of the North-West, at least, time <lb/>
to learn English? It has taken me a long time to <lb/>
learn to speak it, badly as I do. I think he ought <lb/>
to give them, at least, a few years to learn how to <lb/>
read the laws which will be enacted in those Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. But there is something more. These <lb/>
people who live there, who are the owners of the <lb/>
soil, have disputes amongst themselves. The law <lb/>
must be obeyed, must be administered, and is he <lb/>
going to deny them the right of having justice <lb/>
administered to them in a language which they <lb/>
understand? He does deny them of that right; <lb/>
we must not be unjust as he wants us to be. I <lb/>
think that if this House comes to the conclusion that <lb/>
a certain measure of liberty to settle that question <lb/>
of language ought to be given to the Legislature <lb/>
of the North-West, we must in justice reserve <lb/>
to the old settlers, to that population which is <lb/>
now in the minority, the right to speak their <lb/>
language, to be heard in their language, as wit<lb break="no"/>nesses, jurors, and pleaders before the courts. I <lb/>
desire, in closing my remarks, to quote some obser<lb break="no"/>vations from a powerful writer and a keen obser<lb break="no"/>ver, who has visited this country, Sir Charles <lb/>
Dilke. How does he speak of the population, of <lb/>
whom the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy) and the hon. member for North Norfolk <lb/>
(Mr. Charlton) spoke, I will not say with contempt, <lb/>
but with suspicion as to their loyalty and with fear <lb/>
as to the future of the country so far as they were <lb/>
concerned. Sir Charles Dilke referred to one of the <lb/>
most prominent statesmen who represented the <lb/>
French Canadians, Sir George Cartier. Speaking <lb/>
of Sir George Cartier, who was very often accused by <lb/>
his opponents in politics, of being too much of a <lb/>
Britisher in Canada, Sir Charles said this: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Sir George Cartier, the Conservative statesman who <lb/>
led the French Canadians at the time of Confederation, <lb/>
had himself as a young man taken part in Papineau's re<lb break="no"/>bellion, but there was never a stronger supporter of a <lb/>
United Empire than my host at Ottawa in the year of the <lb/>
passing of the Bill." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Drawing a comparison between the French in <lb/>
Lower Canada and the South African Dutch, the <lb/>
author said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"In both cases we found the alien people in the land <lb/>
had dispossessed the mother country of the province. <lb/>
In each case they have clung to their language and <lb/>
institutions, and in each country the language of the <lb/>
non-English Calvinists may now be made use of in the <lb/>
legislature. Both races are filled with intense Conser<lb break="no"/>vatism, and the French of Canada and the Dutch of <lb/>
South Africa are now in fact the only surviving true Con<lb break="no"/>servatives living under free institutions." <lb/></p>

<p>This may not please the leader of the Opposition, <lb/>
but it could not but please an old Tory, like the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). <lb/>
Speaking of the loyalty of the French Canadians at <lb/>
the time of the American Revolution, Sir Charles <lb/>
Dilke said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Curiously enough, the only moments at which we were <lb/>
ever popular in Lower Canada, until we gave her free <lb/>
institutions, were the moments when the Americans <lb/>
were trying to expel us." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>These few lines must be significant to those <lb/>
who believe that because we speak a foreign <lb/>
language we cannot be loyal to the Crown and true <lb/>
supporters of the British nation. I will not say, <lb/>
true as it may be, that Canada would have been <lb/>
American except for the assistance given by the <lb/>
French Canadians at the time of the American Re<lb break="no"/>bellion, but as a loyal Britisher, I would say, with <lb/>
Sir Charles Dilke: we have been able to preserve <lb/>
our supremacy in North America with the approval <lb/>
and assistance of the French Canadians, and <lb/>
"curiously enough the only moment at which we <lb/>
were ever popular in Lower Canada, until we gave <lb/>
her free institutions, were the moments when <lb/>
the Americans were trying to expel us." Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, I claim for our people, as I read it in the <lb/>
opuscules of a late friend, Oscar Dunn, that "the <lb/>
first man who spoke of responsible government in <lb/>
this country was a French Canadian, Pierre Bedard, <lb/>
and the one who contributed the most to establish it <lb/>
was another French Canadian, Lafontaine. Our <lb/>
nationality had the honor to furnish the states<lb break="no"/>man who introduced British liberties into this <lb/>
country. It was the only revenge we drew from <lb/>
our conquerors." I do not speak here as a French <lb/>
Canadian; I speak as a Canadian. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe has said, that, in order to <lb/>
judge of the nationality of a man, you must ascer<lb break="no"/>tain the language he speaks; that a German sub<lb break="no"/>ject speaking another language can hardly be a full <lb/>
German; that a man who speaks French as his <lb/>
mother tongue, even if he knew and could speak <lb/>
English, cannot be really and truly a British sub<lb break="no"/>ject. But we claim to be Canadians, and although <lb/>
we may speak in French or English we are really <lb/>
not English or French, but we are truly Canadians, <lb/>
and we intend to remain such. I heartily endorse <lb/>
the sentiments of that eloquent and fervent apostle <lb/>
of Canadian nationality, Principal Grant, when, <lb/>
speaking before St. Andrew's Society, in Montreal, <lb/>
he said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Scotch are but one nationality in Canada, and <lb/>
not the first. That place belongs to the French Canadians: <lb/>
a sacred obli ation is imposed upon the Canadian race as <lb/>
upon ours. We ought to be, the one more than Scotch, <lb/>
and the other more than French, we ought to be Canadians. <lb/>
There can be but one Canadian nation, and all the races <lb/>
which have chosen the sky of Canada as their own ought <lb/>
to contribute to the building up and the consolidating of <lb/>
this nation. Every other dream is but a folly and every <lb/>
effort to realise it is but treason. And against treason all <lb/>
Canadians must unite, to combat and chastise it." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Sir, if the hon. gentleman intends to carry out his <lb/>
purpose, interpreted as it must be by the preamble <lb/>
of this Bill and by the speech which accompanied <lb/>
its first reading, if the hon. gentleman wants <lb/>
to go to the end of his programme, if he really <lb/>
intends to do as he has stated in this House <lb/>
and outside this House he intends to do, I can <lb/>
only tell him this, that if he wants to destroy <lb/>
and efface the French language from the Dominion <lb/>

<cb/>

of Canada he should begin higher up and remove <lb/>
its use from the highest order of chivalry in En<lb break="no"/>gland; he should efface it from the arms of <lb/>
England; if he thinks in speaking French we are <lb/>
disloyal to our beloved Sovereign, Her Majesty <lb/>
    the Queen, he must have forgotten the words "<hi rendition="simple:italic">Honi <lb/>
soit qui mal y pense.</hi>" If he wants to destroy <lb/>
French I answer him, in company with all my <lb/>
fellow-countrymen and all true British subjects <lb/>
in this Dominion: Sir, you shall not touch that <lb/>
language; you cannot efface it. We keep it with <lb/>
our religion, as a gift we owe to Divine Provi<lb break="no"/>dence and to the kind liberality of Our beloved <lb/>
Sovereign. And whenever it is attempted to <lb/>
deprive us of that sacred deposit, we shall not <lb/>
despair as long as we read on the Royal Arms of <lb/>
    England: "<hi rendition="simple:italic">Dieu et mon Droit.</hi>" <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CART3">Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT</persName>. I would say <lb/>
to the hon. member for North Simcoe(Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) that I interfere with him with very con<lb break="no"/>siderable reluctance, but it is necessary for me for <lb/>
certain reasons to speak to-night. I will speak <lb/>
briefly, but, as he must of necessity speak at very <lb/>
considerable length, I hope, therefore, that he <lb/>
will not consider that I am treating him with <lb/>
discourtesy. I will take care that it does not <lb/>
interfere with his prerogative in any respect. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CART3">Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT</persName>. I think, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, that we all must agree. that this debate, <lb/>
even so far as it has already gone, has been one of <lb/>
a very remarkable character. It is a debate which <lb/>
is calculated to shed considerable light on divers <lb/>
dark places in our political firmament. It has at <lb/>
any rate one notable feature. The present debate, <lb/>
coupled with a debate which took place on an<lb break="no"/>other subject, within this chamber about a year <lb/>
ago, constitutes a very important new departure <lb/>
on the part of hon. gentlemen opposite‚Äîa very <lb/>
important new departure, indeed. It is per<lb break="no"/>fectly wonderful to see the zeal which is now ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by so many of these hon. gentlemen for <lb/>
provincial rights, and to remember that these <lb/>
same hon. gentlemen‚Äînot even the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe excepted‚Äîonly a little more <lb/>
than thirteen months ago, certainly within a period <lb/>
of two years, did not see their way to stand side <lb/>
by side with us in defending the clearest and best <lb/>
established rights of his and my native Province. <lb/>
We find now that the sacredness of provincial <lb/>
rights is clearly held by a great majority in this <lb/>
House, we find that it is becoming a fundamental <lb/>
article of faith, and by none more (although his <lb/>
conversion was very late in the day) than by the <lb/>
venerable and pious Premier, may I say, who gave <lb/>
such excellent advice to us last year, as well as on <lb/>
the present occasion, on the subject of provincial <lb/>
rights. I am an old enough member of Parliament <lb/>
to remember when the First Minister of this Domi<lb break="no"/>nion had very little faith indeed in Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion; when he began by doubting and disbelieving <lb/>
the possibility of a federal union, and when in <lb/>
point of fact, as I remember and as the record <lb/>
shows, he only accepted the situation when he <lb/>
saw that it was his last chance of safety from <lb/>
political shipwreck. From that time, although <lb/>
I will not say that he has plotted steadily <lb/>
and persistently to undermine this same Confe<lb break="no"/>deration, I will say that for twenty years, to <lb/>

<pb n="839" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00839.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">839</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">840</fw> 

all outward seeming, at any rate, the policy <lb/>
of that right hon. gentleman has been to be<lb break="no"/>little, in every possible way, the rights of the <lb/>
several Provinces, of which to-day he has blossomed <lb/>
out so strong and stout a champion. In the <lb/>
case of the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy), we can all remember that last year <lb/>
that hon. gentleman was not apparently disposed <lb/>
to pay any very great respect to the provincial <lb/>
rights of one of the oldest and most important <lb/>
Provinces of this Dominion, although now he is <lb/>
suddenly smitten with the most extraordinary re<lb break="no"/>gard for the declarations‚Äînot of a Provincial <lb/>
Assembly in the proper sense of the term‚Äîbut of <lb/>
the representative council of a fledging territory <lb/>
of this Dominion. For my part, I much suspect <lb/>
the fervent zeal which new born converts evince <lb/>
on these occasions. I may say to this House, <lb/>
without respect to parties, that while we are here <lb/>
bound by every obligation to see that the rights of <lb/>
the Provinces are maintained, it may be as well for <lb/>
us to recollect that we are also here as Dominion re<lb break="no"/>presentatives, and that the Dominion of Canada <lb/>
has its rights in this and other matters as well <lb/>
as the Provinces. This debate, as I have said, is <lb/>
one of a remarkable character, but I must add that <lb/>
I, for one, think that every true friend of Canada <lb/>
must regret that this subject has been forced upon <lb/>
us at this time. I say that no good has come of <lb/>
this Bill; I say that no good can come of it, and <lb/>
I am sorry to have to add that, in my judgment, <lb/>
speaking without prejudice or malice, I cannot <lb/>
but believe that no good was intended to come <lb/>
out of the proposal which we are now discussing. <lb/>
Whatever may be the motives which have caused <lb/>
the hon. gentleman (Mr. McCarthy) to assume the <lb/>
grave responsibility of throwing on the floor of <lb/>
this House What he well knew must be an apple <lb/>
of discord, calculated to set friend against friend, <lb/>
race against race, and religion against religion, <lb/>
I admit that this question having been raised, <lb/>
and the judgment of this House having been <lb/>
challenged, we are, in my opinion, bound to <lb/>
pass upon the question. Of all the faults and of all <lb/>
the follies which this House could commit in dealing <lb/>
with this question the worst, in my opinion, would <lb/>
be to leave it as a festering and ever-open sore. <lb/>
We are asked to decide on this question, and we <lb/>
should decide. In that I agree with the hon. <lb/>
gentleman and some of his friends. This House <lb/>
is called upon to pass judgment, and this House <lb/>
should pass such judgment as will set this ques<lb break="no"/>tion finally at rest, if such a thing can be. At <lb/>
all events, it should be set at rest so far as this <lb/>
branch of it is concerned. I believe that by this <lb/>
motion and by the agitation which has taken place <lb/>
throughout the length and breadth of the chief <lb/>
Provinces of Canada on the issues raised by the <lb/>
hon. gentleman and his friends, very considerable <lb/>
harm has been done. I do not think we can <lb/>
wholly undo that harm by anything we may ac<lb break="no"/>complish here, at best I believe that all it is <lb/>
possible for us to do is to minimise the mischief <lb/>
which reckless hands have wrought. I will ven<lb break="no"/>ture to suggest, before I sit down, certain consid <lb/>
erations which occur to me as best calculated to <lb/>
bring about that end. I shall now consider in <lb/>
rotation the several propositions at present before <lb/>
the House. First of all, I must take the Bill which <lb/>
the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) <lb/>
asks shall be read for the second time. I am sorry <lb/>

<cb/>

to have to say that I cannot but regret the language <lb/>
of the preamble of that Bill as being decidedly <lb/>
offensive, as being calculated to do grave harm in <lb/>
this community and as being calculated as I have <lb/>
said to set members of this House of different <lb/>
creeds and nationalities at issue to no good pur<lb break="no"/>pose. More than that, Sir, I take objection in the <lb/>
strongest possible manner with the preceding lines <lb/>
of this preamble: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Whereas it is expedient in the interest ofthe national <lb/>
unity of the Dominion that there should be community <lb/>
of language among the people of Canada, and that the <lb/>
enactment in 'The North-West Territories Act' allow<lb break="no"/>ing the use of the French language should be expunged <lb/>
therefrom." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Sir, that preamble is in no way necessary to the <lb/>
Bill, it should never have been there, and was <lb/>
intended to affront and offend my friends of the <lb/>
French nationality; and small blame to them if <lb/>
if they felt affronted and offended when asked to <lb/>
consider a Bill introduced by a preamble like that. <lb/>
But I have a more important objection to make to <lb/>
that preamble: I say that on the plainest grounds <lb/>
of common sense and common prudence, the asser<lb break="no"/>tion contained in it that the best way to produce <lb/>
unity among us is to do what is known to be <lb/>
affronting to one‚Äîthird or one‚Äîfourth of the people <lb/>
of this Dominion is entirely false and incorrect. <lb/>
That is not the way to produce national unity <lb/>
among Canadians; it is not the way to build up a <lb/>
nation here. The way to make Canadians proud <lb/>
of their country is to say, clearly and distinctly, to <lb/>
every race in Canada, that they may expect fair <lb/>
play and honest dealings at the hands of their <lb/>
fellow-countrymen, whether they are English, <lb/>
French, Scotch, Irish, Canadian or any other <lb/>
nationality. Looking at this matter, Sir, as a <lb/>
practical man, as one who hopes to end his life in <lb/>
Canada, I say that the hon. gentleman, be his <lb/>
motives or intentions what they may, is attempting <lb/>
a downright impossibility, if he hopes by legisla<lb break="no"/>tive enactment to wipe away the French language <lb/>
and to induce a million or a million and a-quarter of <lb/>
our people to abandon their mother tongue, sol<lb break="no"/>emnly guaranteed to them by treaty and in every <lb/>
possible way that a government or a nation can <lb/>
guarantee, that it shall be left undisturbed in their <lb/>
native Province or in the Dominion of Canada. I <lb/>
say it is absurd. It might have come to pass‚Äî <lb/>
though I do not know but the hon. gentleman and <lb/>
his friends have now rendered it impossible‚Äînot <lb/>
to-day or to-morrow, but in the course of a genera<lb break="no"/>tion or two, that mutual convenience in communi<lb break="no"/>cating and dealing with each other in the prevailing <lb/>
tongue of North America might have induced the <lb/>
people of Quebec to adopt that language, as has <lb/>
been done in Ireland, where, in many places, a <lb/>
number of years ago, the bulk of the population <lb/>
spoke Irish and Irish alone, but where now <lb/>
the English tongue has practically superseded the <lb/>
Irish language. But I tell the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe and other hon. gentlemen who think <lb/>
with him that there is no case in history, and I <lb/>
cannot conceive of a case, where such result has <lb/>
been brought about by legislative enactment. <lb/>
Persecute a religion, a race, or a language, and <lb/>
you enlist every worthy, manly and self-respecting <lb/>
sentiment in the minds of the men who profess <lb/>
that religion, belong to that race, or speak that <lb/>
language in maintaining it against all odds; and <lb/>
I do not think so meanly of my French fellow-<lb break="yes"/>countrymen as to wish or believe that they <lb/>

will be dragooned out of rights which have been <lb/>
solemnly guaranteed to them. Sir, I do not know <lb/>
what visions of victory or what aspirations may <lb/>
float through the minds of the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe and his followers. Peradventure, as has <lb/>
been suggested, it has entered into the mind of <lb/>
the hon. member to play the part of an Ontario <lb/>
Parnell, and to return to this House with twenty <lb/>
or thirty stout Protestant Home Rulers like the <lb/>
hon. member for Muskoka (Mr. O'Brien), to hold <lb/>
the balance of power and to dictate terms‚ÄîI was <lb/>
going to say to his adversary, but as I suppose I <lb/>
should say, his beloved Chieftain who sits opposite <lb/>
to me. <lb/></p> 

<p>An hon. MEMBER. Who said so? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CART3">Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT</persName>. Why, the <lb/>
hon. member for Simcoe himself, and he ought to <lb/>
know. But if, as I have said, the language of the <lb/>
preamble of this unfortunate Act was needlessly <lb/>
afl'ronting and offensive to gentlemen of French <lb/>
nationality, what must I say of the speech in <lb/>
which, without provocation, in cold blood, the <lb/>
hon. member for Simcoe thought fit to introduce <lb/>
it? Sir, I regretted exceedingly to hear that <lb/>
speech, and most of all for this reason: I knew‚Äî <lb/>
my parliamentary experience taught me, as the <lb/>
parliamentary experience of any hon. gentleman <lb/>
who has sat for a few sessions in this House would <lb/>
teach him‚Äîthat one such mischievous and <lb/>
injudicious speech was sure to be the parent <lb/>
of others equally mischievous and injudicious, <lb/>
which would go far to widen the breach and <lb/>
render the task of moderate and reasonable men in <lb/>
composing our differences more difficult than ever; <lb/>
and I am sorry to say that one member of the <lb/>
Government at least‚ÄîI mean the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Public Works‚Äîwas betrayed into following the <lb/>
evil example of the hon. member for Simcoe, and <lb/>
into delivering a speech which the hon. member: <lb/>
for Simcoe must have listened to with delight <lb/>
but which I am sure no considerate man on <lb/>
either side of the House could have regarded as <lb/>
other than injudicious and ill-timed. I am very <lb/>
sorry that an old parliamentary veteran like the <lb/>
hon. Minister of Public Works should have deliber<lb break="no"/>ately played the game of the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe, as he most undoubtedly did, when he deliv<lb break="no"/>ered that speech, which will prove an arsenal from <lb/>
which the hon. member for Simcoe and those as<lb break="no"/>sociated with him could saw barbed and poisoned <lb/>
arrows to disturb the sentiments and feelings of a <lb/>
great number of worthy people throughout this <lb/>
community. Sir, I wish I could confine my regret <lb/>
1n that respect entirely to the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Public Works. I would have thought that the <lb/>
trap laid by the hon. member for Simcoe was per<lb break="no"/>fectly transparent. I would have thought that <lb/>
any hon. member in this House who listened to his <lb/>
speech, who read his preamble, who considered <lb/>
what his whole course has been, must have seen <lb/>
that the object that hon. gentleman was driving at, <lb/>
the thing he wanted to bring about, was, if possi<lb break="no"/>ble, to array in a solid mass, if that were possible, <lb/>
the members of the French nationality on the one <lb/>
side, and the members of the English nationality <lb/>
on the other side; or, what is worse still, to array <lb/>
the members of one religious persuasion on one side, <lb/>
and the members of other religious persuasions <lb/>
on the other side. I regret exceedingly that a gen<lb break="no"/>tleman for whom I entertain such high regard as I <lb/>
do for the hon. member for Berthier (Mr. Beauso<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

leil) should have walked deliberately into such a <lb/>
trap, and should have brought forward a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion which looks‚Äîthough I acquit the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman of any such intention‚Äîas if it were de<lb break="no"/>signed to play into the hands of the hon. member <lb/>
for Simcoe. I am very sorry for it. I admit that <lb/>
there were extenuating circumstances in the case <lb/>
of the hon. member for Berthier. I am sometimes <lb/>
myself accused, most unjustly, of having hasty blood <lb/>
in my veins, and I dare say I would have felt angry <lb/>
at the language used by the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe; but however angry I might have felt, <lb/>
I do not think I would have walked into the <lb/>
trap he set and supplied him with material for <lb/>
future mischievous operations. Now, as far as I <lb/>
am concerned, my own course in this matter is <lb/>
clear enough. Last year‚Äîand I ask my French <lb/>
compatriots to recollect the circumstance‚Äîlast <lb/>
year, in common with the great mass of the <lb/>
Liberal party and the lonservative party in the <lb/>
Province of Ontario, I and they voted upon a <lb/>
certain question in a way which offended the <lb/>
prejudices of many of our constituents. I laid <lb/>
down then, as I am disposed to lay down to-night, <lb/>
the principle that in affairs of this kind, as in all <lb/>
affairs which properly belong to them, the Provin<lb break="no"/>cial Legislatures should have the sole right to <lb/>
legislate. The principle which I applied in favor <lb/>
of the Province of Quebec last year I am disposed <lb/>
to apply on the present occasion in favor of the <lb/>
North-West Territories. I ask now the same rights <lb/>
for our fellow-countrymen of the North-West <lb/>
Territories that I asked for our fellow-countrymen <lb/>
in the Province of Quebec last year. I am prepared <lb/>
to recognise their right, but I require that that <lb/>
right be properly asserted and clearly stated, and <lb/>
that I should be well assured, when I interfere <lb/>
in a matter of this kind, that I, in my place, <lb/>
and as far as I can, am giving assent to the <lb/>
deliberately expressed opinion and conviction of <lb/>
the people of those Territories. It may be asked <lb/>
why will I not acknowledge that the North-West <lb/>
Council, as at present constituted, do really repre<lb break="no"/>sent the views and the wishes of the people of those <lb/>
territories? I am bound to recall to the attention <lb/>
of hon. members this plain fact. No doubt, to a <lb/>
a certain extent, these gentlemen may be said to <lb/>
represent the people of the North-West Territories, <lb/>
although they are not their only representatives; <lb/>
but they have not all the powers, and they were <lb/>
not elected to discharge all the duties of a Provin<lb break="no"/>cial Parliament or Assembly. I say, without any <lb/>
desire to belittle their important functions, <lb/>
that they are somewhat of a hybrid between <lb/>
a municipal council and a Provincial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and I cannot admit that they are entitled <lb/>
to speak with perfect authority on a question <lb/>
which was notoriously not before the people <lb/>
when the North-West Council were elected. More <lb/>
than that: I have another reason why I decline to <lb/>
accept what may, for ought I know, have been <lb/>
a hasty resolution passed by the North-West <lb/>
Council. So far as I am advised, there is every <lb/>
reason to believe that it was in no way the <lb/>
spontaneous declaration of the Council of the <lb/>
North-West, but was a suggestion from outside. <lb/>
Probably the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy) knows best whence it came. It did not <lb/>
deal, in any proper sense of theterm, with a real sub<lb break="no"/>stantial grievance underwhich those people groaned, <lb/>
and in voicing which the Council merely voiced <lb/>

<pb n="843" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00843.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">843</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">844</fw> 

the true sentiments of their constituents. I am <lb/>
quite prepared, on proper opportunity being given <lb/>
me, to advocate provincial rights to the fullest <lb/>
extent; I am quite prepared to lay down the <lb/>
principle that the people of the North-West, when <lb/>
this matter has been fairly submitted to them, <lb/>
when they have passed upon it‚Äîif in two or three <lb/>
years hence they continue in the same mind‚Äî <lb/>
should be sustained by this Parliament; but be<lb break="no"/>yond that I must decline to go. I admit that it <lb/>
was best for all parties that a decision should be <lb/>
come to on this subject; it will serve no good <lb/>
purpose that I can see to allow this matter to be <lb/>
kept open for debate and to continue to be made a <lb/>
cause of agitation between the conflicting races. I <lb/>
cannot however quite agree with the doctrine laid <lb/>
down by the hon. member for Berthier (Mr. Beau<lb break="no"/>soleil) that a sort of vested right has been established <lb/>
by the mere fact of the concession which was made <lb/>
some ten or twelve years ago. I am prepared, as fully <lb/>
as any man, to maintain treaty rights formerly <lb/>
granted to our French brethren in the Province of <lb/>
Quebec, but I think that in all reason we ought to <lb/>
stop there. If the French settlers should become <lb/>
numerous in any Province of this Dominion, either <lb/>
near us or in the far West, and if they persuaded <lb/>
the Legislature, or the Legislature saw fit, for <lb/>
mutual convenience, for good fellowship or <lb/>
courtesy, to decree that the French language <lb/>
should be used in such Province, so let it be. <lb/>
No one on this side, I believe, would raise his <lb/>
voice or give his vote to prevent that extension of <lb/>
privileges; but, I say, in all conscience, that ought <lb/>
to be enough. I have no possible ground or pre<lb break="no"/>tence to dictate to my friends from Ontario <lb/>
what they should do in this matter. It is a matter <lb/>
in which they must judge for themselves, and no <lb/>
doubt they will be able to do that. But if they will <lb/>
allow me to make a suggestion to them, it will be <lb/>
this: I think they ought to oppose to the utter<lb break="no"/>most the passage of the Act introduced by <lb/>
the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc <lb/>
Carthy)‚Äîand on these grounds: that the Act <lb/>
itself is mischievous, the language is offensive, <lb/>
and it deals with no real substantial griev<lb break="no"/>ance. Why, I am told that the whole cost of the <lb/>
evil which the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
designs to remedy amounted in thirteen years to <lb/>
something like $20,000, about one-tenth or about <lb/>
one-twentieth of the cost which the blundering at<lb break="no"/>tempt to usurp the property and the rights of the <lb/>
Province of Ontario, made partly under the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's auspices, has already cost this country. <lb/>
Looking at this matter from a practical point of view, <lb/>
I think after the hon. gentleman's exhibition, after <lb/>
the speech he made, which showed his animus, <lb/>
which showed his design to make mischief, my <lb/>
hon. friends from Ontario need have no fear that <lb/>
any but a few bigots will condemn them for refus<lb break="no"/>ing to vote against this Bill. I may tell them they <lb/>
have lost those bigots' votes already. While that <lb/>
is true, it is equally true‚Äîand my hon. friends <lb/>
will pardon me for reminding them of it‚Äîthat, be<lb break="no"/>sides the bigots who would dare to join so wicked <lb/>
an agitation for it is wicked (to stir up an anti-French <lb/>
crusade, considering the circumstances under which <lb/>
the hon. gentleman desires to initiate it) besides <lb/>
those there are, I must confess, men known to all <lb/>
of you, moderate and reasonable men, who, while <lb/>
they are well content to accept the grounds on <lb/>
which we voted last year, who, while they <lb/> 


<cb/>

admit we did right, and, in fact, had no option <lb/>
but to vote as we did, would hold us to a strict <lb/>
account if we should now go back on our own record, <lb/>
and having a year ago voted to defend the rights <lb/>
of the Province of Quebec should now appear <lb/>
unwilling, on proper terms and conditions, to <lb/>
maintain the rights of our fellow-countrymen in <lb/>
the North-West. To my friends of the French <lb/>
nationality I speak with great diffidence; I admit <lb/>
that I think their anger very natural, I sym<lb break="no"/>pathise with their feelings, and I do not think they <lb/>
had any right to be addressed as they were on the <lb/>
door of this House. But is that a reason‚Äîand I <lb/>
speak now, not merely to my political friends on this <lb/>
side, but to my French compatriots on the other side <lb/>
‚Äîthat they should deliberately allow themselves to <lb/>
De goaded and driven into playing the game of the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe? I repeat there <lb/>
can be no possible step they will take that would <lb/>
serve the ends of that hon. gentleman better than <lb/>
if they would display here, what I would regret <lb/>
to see displayed, the spectacle of a solid French <lb/>
minority voting against a solid English majority. <lb/>
It would be a grave political mistake which <lb/>
would injure themselves, and‚ÄîI was going to say <lb/>
for once in my life, but I think I have had occasion <lb/>
to do it once or twice before‚ÄîI am disposed to <lb/>
agree in substance with the advice tendered to the <lb/>
House by the hon. the leader of this Government. <lb/>
I am bound to admit‚Äîand I make him a present <lb/>
of the fact‚Äîthat, if he had not spoken as he did, <lb/>
and cut me out, I would probably have made a <lb/>
similar suggestion myself, and my hon. friends <lb/>
beside me know right well what my feelings have <lb/>
been on this subject since it was broached. What <lb/>
I would advise‚Äîspeaking entirely from a non-party <lb/>
point‚Äîmy French friends to do would be to drop <lb/>
this motion of my hon. friend from Berthier <lb/>
(Mr. Beausoleil), or, if it cannot be dropped, not <lb/>
to vote for it, but to consent to an amendment on <lb/>
the lines suggested by the hon. gentleman. That <lb/>
is to say, disclaiming, as we ought to disclaim, all <lb/>
intention or desire to interfere with the rights <lb/>
guaranteed to our French friends in Quebec, and <lb/>
in the Dominion, and we should disclaim that, and <lb/>
should disavow all complicity or agreement <lb/>
with the anti‚ÄîFrench crusade which the hon. <lb/>
gentleman has been preaching; but, at the <lb/>
same time, and on the same ground as we <lb/>
defended the rights of Quebec last year, We must <lb/>
now feel it our duty to record our conviction that, <lb/>
when this matter has been put fairly and clearly <lb/>
before the people of the North-West, they in the <lb/>
last resort, must be the judges of it. I believe <lb/>
that nine-tenths or nineteen-twentieths of this <lb/>
House, if they were free on both sides to vote as <lb/>
they think, would accept the suggestion I have <lb/>
made, and which was made before by the right, <lb/>
hon. the First Minister, and I hope they will not <lb/>
allow themselves to be bulldozed into acting <lb/>
contrary to their convictions by a few fanatics in <lb/>
the House or outside of it. One word more, <lb/>
because, as I said, I am anxious not to delay the <lb/>
hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. McCarthy). I believe <lb/>
myself that, if time is given, if two years are <lb/>
allowed to elapse, if the right is conceded which <lb/>
the people of the North-West demand to regulate <lb/>
their own affairs, it is extremely probable that <lb/>
those people would be content with the knowledge <lb/>
that they had that right conceded, and would not. <lb/>
force that right to its extreme conclusion. For<lb/>

myself, I would be glad it they could see their way to <lb/>
do that until such time as we saw whether or not <lb/>
there was going to be such a large immigration into <lb/>
that country as might affect the decision of this <lb/>
difficult and vexed question <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. I think it is not unreason<lb break="no"/>able that, at this hour, I should claim the indul<lb break="no"/>gence of the House. The debate has lasted over <lb/>
five days, or nearly so, and during that time I <lb/>
have been subjected to as much abuse certainly as <lb/>
the rules of Parliament permit, and perhaps a <lb/>
little more than the rules would warrant. I look <lb/>
at my friends who are opposite to me and I find <lb/>
no sympathetic glances, and I have no reason to <lb/>
expect them. I look to the band of Nationalists <lb/>
who think I am assailing their race and nationa<lb break="no"/>lity and language, and I do not find any and I do <lb/>
not expect any. And even when I look amongst <lb/>
those on this side who were once my friends and <lb/>
allies, I find, perhaps, more hostile glances than I <lb/>
do elsewhere. I am standing here alone, or almost <lb/>
alone, doing what I believe to be my duty, and, <lb/>
notwithstanding the sneers, and the taunts, and the <lb/>
insinuations that have been made, I propose to do <lb/>
my duty to the end, if I stand alone, or almost <lb/>
alone, on the floor of this House in the vote <lb/>
which is shortly to be taken. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who has last spoken (Sir Richard Cart<lb break="no"/>wright) has made not disguise of his feelings or <lb/>
his principles. He speaks not from the principle <lb/>
of statesmanship but from a purely partisan or <lb/>
party point of view. He argues with his <lb/>
friends behind him and his friends before him <lb/>
on that ground, and he appeals to them not to <lb/>
fall into the trap which I am accused of having <lb/>
laid and which some of those friends, he thinks, <lb/>
have already fallen into, but to reject the Bill <lb/>
which I have had the honor to introduce. He <lb/>
makes this appeal without one word of argument <lb/>
upon the merits of the Bill, without a word as to <lb/>
whether it is right or wrong in the interests of the <lb/>
people of the North-West, for whom we are here <lb/>
to judge and to legislate upon this question, but <lb/>
simply with a view to the effect it my have on <lb/>
the votes of the people whom he thinks he leads <lb/>
from the Province of Ontario. He warns them as <lb/>
to the results. He knows well enough that they <lb/>
have gone away from him never to return, but he <lb/>
tells them that they will have lost all if they <lb/>
support such a measure as this and had better <lb/>
return to their allegiance. I looked for better <lb/>
things from that hon. gentleman, but have looked <lb/>
in vain. His speech was a purely partisan speech, <lb/>
without one redeeming feature, without one thing <lb/>
to raise it above the level of the mere party <lb/>
machine. I welcome his statement even from <lb/>
a party point of view if from no other, because <lb/>
it leaves that hon. gentleman without a shred <lb/>
of reputation as a statesman, which he once <lb/>
pretended to be. But I have to address myself <lb/>
not only to the hon. gentleman from South Oxford <lb/>
(Sir Richard Cartwright). I have to speak of the <lb/>
attack which has been made upon the measure <lb/>
from other sources, and to endeavor to clear up, if <lb/>
I can, the accusations which have been made. <lb/>
The hon. members who have supported me are <lb/>
small in number, though they are as true as steel. <lb/>
They have been overborne in this debate by the <lb/>
power of numbers‚Äînot of argument; and I will <lb/>
endeavor to show that, amid the tissue of mis<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

representation which has been poured out upon <lb/>
our devoted heads, hon. members will find that <lb/>
there has been no warrant for any part of it. I <lb/>
am accused of having got up this agitation, of <lb/>
having originated it not only on matters of race, <lb/>
but on matters of religion, and I am accused of <lb/>
doing that for selfish purposes and ends. I would <lb/>
like to know what end I had to serve in severing <lb/>
myself from the gentleman I have hitherto sup<lb break="no"/>ported, and from those hon. gentlemen behind me, <lb/>
who, I have reason to believe, would not have <lb/>
been unwilling to see me advanced in the ranks of <lb/>
my party. What could have led me to take this <lb/>
course as it has been untruly represented to the <lb/>
House, and through the House to the country? <lb/>
My whole course in regard to this matter did <lb/>
not originate last July in my address to my <lb/>
constituents. But on the floor of this chamber, in <lb/>
the presence of hon. members who hear me now, <lb/>
I state that I had discovered‚Äîas, I am ashamed <lb/>
to say, I discovered for the first time‚Äîthat the dual <lb/>
language clause was in the North-West Act. We <lb/>
then talked it over, and I appeak to the hon. member <lb/>
for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) if we did not call <lb/>
him across the floor and ask him how it was, as out <lb/>
attention had been called to the subject by a speech <lb/>
having been delivered by a Lieutenant Governor of <lb/>
the North-West Territories, for the first time, in <lb/>
French, in the preceding session. That is what <lb/>
aroused our attention to this fact, and, if I am not <lb/>
misinformed, that is what first drew attention to <lb/>
the fact in the North-West‚Äîthat a French Gover<lb break="no"/>nor who was sent up there to govern what was <lb/>
practically an English speaking people‚Äîtrue, Sir, <lb/>
to the policy of his race, true to the object which <lb/>
my hon. friends from Quebec have had in view <lb/>
from the very first day that this country was ceded <lb/>
to Great Britain, namely, to perpetuate their race; <lb/>
and they know full well, if other hon. members <lb/>
choose to disregard it, that the perpetuation of <lb/>
that race can only be by the perpetuation of their <lb/>
language‚ÄîI say, knowing that the Lieutenant <lb/>
Governor of the North-West delivered there his <lb/>
speech in French and English, and imported into <lb/>
that Territory a secretary, in order that the laws <lb/>
might be translated into French and published in <lb/>
that language. This, Sir, it was, if I am not <lb/>
grossly misinformed, which raised the indignation <lb/>
of the members of the Legislative Assembly of the <lb/>
North-West so much that they threatened, if that <lb/>
occurred again, that they would withdraw in a body. <lb/>
Well, Sir, whether that be so or not, so far as I <lb/>
am concerned it was as I have stated. I con<lb break="no"/>sulted some of the hon. gentlemen who are <lb/>
sitting about me and we agreed‚Äîsome of these <lb/>
hon gentlemen have been true to their pledges, <lb/>
but the voices of some others have been stifled <lb/>
because they feared to hurt their party‚Äîwe then <lb/>
and there pledged ourselves that we would, at the <lb/>
earliest opportunity, bring to the notice of this <lb/>
House the iniquitous legislation which the hon. <lb/>
member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) had fathered, <lb/>
which he pretended he had acquiesced in reluc<lb break="no"/>tantly, but, as it now appears, he had deliberately <lb/>
connived at its introduction into the Act of the <lb/>
North-West Territories in the year 1878. That <lb/>
was the beginning of it, and I notified my leader <lb/>
at an early day that I would take this course. I <lb/>
had nothing to do with the agitation in connection <lb/>
with it. The agitation which has been spoken of <lb/>
with regard to the Equal Rights Association got <lb/>

<pb n="847" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00847.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">847</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">848</fw> 

no strength from my connection with it. I had <lb/>
never even attended the convention which assem<lb break="no"/>bled at Toronto; all I had to do with it was to send <lb/>
a telegram of regret that I was unable to attend, <lb/>
being otherwise engaged in professional duties, <lb/>
and that I sympathised with the motives and the <lb/>
objects which had brought together the great band <lb/>
of people from all parts of Ontario to take such <lb/>
measures that for the future, at all events, their <lb/>
voice should be heard on the floor of this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. When it became my duty to visit my <lb/>
constituents, as I did upon the 12th July‚Äîthe <lb/>
first time, I may state, that I ever addressed a <lb/>
body of my constituents on that day, or made any <lb/>
political utterance on the 12th July‚ÄîI then an<lb break="no"/>nounced publicly, that I would take the earliest <lb/>
opportunity of asking this Parliament to undo <lb/>
what, according to the records‚ÄîI will not use the <lb/>
word "surreptitiously"‚Äîbut what, according to <lb/>
the records, had been stolen through in the dying <lb/>
hours of the Session of 1878, under the charge of <lb/>
the hon. member for Bothwell. Was that an agita<lb break="no"/>tion of which any man need be ashamed? Was <lb/>
that pandering to the already aroused passions? <lb/>
What followed? It is said that I have undertaken <lb/>
to act for the people of the North-West Territories; <lb/>
that no mission has been given me so to act for <lb/>
them, and that I am an intruder. Sir, when it <lb/>
became known that I purposed to take my holidays <lb/>
in the North-West, I was invited to address <lb/>
meetings throughout the Province of Manitoba. <lb/>
I had to decline to do so, except at one place, <lb/>
which, ultimately, was fixed for me, at Portage la <lb/>
Prairie. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:WATS2">Mr. WATSON</persName>. A Conservative centre. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. When I got to Portage la <lb/>
Prairie, and was on my way up to the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, it was not that I was seeking to intrude <lb/>
myself upon the domain of the North-West, <lb/>
but my difficult was to deny myself to <lb/>
those who desire that I should address them <lb/>
and in the end I merely addressed one meeting, <lb/>
and that was at Calgary. I refused to make ad<lb break="no"/>dresses in British Columbia, only to find on the <lb/>
next morning that the newspapers abused me for <lb/>
passing them by. I refused to address a meeting <lb/>
at Winnipeg, only to find that I was subject to <lb/>
castigation for passing by the important centre of <lb/>
that Province. The hon. member says I spoke at <lb/>
a Conservative centre. He knows pretty well, I <lb/>
think, he will be honest enough to admit, that <lb/>
the choice of place for holding the meeting, which <lb/>
happened to be at Portage la Prairie, was not my <lb/>
choice; but when I stated, as I did state, that I <lb/>
would only deliver one address in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, and those who invited me fixed on Portage <lb/>
la Prairie as the place of the meeting, and I had <lb/>
no choice in the matter, one way or the other. <lb/>
I know the charge was made that it was chosen, <lb/>
because it was in a constituency represented by the <lb/>
hon. member who has just made the interruption, <lb/>
but I think that hon. member will do me the <lb/>
justice to say that, at all events, that charge was <lb/>
not founded so far as I am concerned. The charge <lb/>
has also been made that I was playing the game <lb/>
of the First Minister, that I was a mere tool in <lb/>
his hands, that I was going through this country <lb/>
without being sincere in my pledges, that in what <lb/>
I stated I was carrying on an agitation in collusion <lb/>
with him. Sir, I do not think that charge was <lb/>

<cb/>

even worthy of contradiction, as it ought to be <lb/>
denounced, but it is a charge which I now take <lb/>
the opportunity, in the presence of the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister, to say, as every hon. member on the floor of <lb/>
this House must realise, was certainly wanting in <lb/>
a tittle of foundation. I did what I thought was <lb/>
honorable and fair by this hon. gentleman whom I <lb/>
have hitherto followed. I have been careful to <lb/>
hold no intercourse with my former leader, my <lb/>
still leader in all questions affecting the general <lb/>
policy of the country. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, Oh. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Yes; I am not ashamed to <lb/>
announce this fact. There is no reason why I <lb/>
should cross the floor of this House, for there is, <lb/>
in my judgment, on that side an inability and an <lb/>
unwillingness to grapple with the questions which <lb/>
are looming up, and which call for settlement, <lb/>
and I find a bigotry still more profound upon the <lb/>
other side, a still greater truckling to that which, <lb/>
as every man from the Province of Ontario knows, <lb/>
I propose to devote the rest of my political life to <lb/>
denounce, and, if possible, to overturn. There<lb break="no"/>fore, why should I cross the floor of the House and <lb/>
follow the banner of hon. gentlemen opposite? <lb/>
I took an opportunity long ago of stating exactly <lb/>
where I stood; I spoke in the Opera House in this <lb/>
city‚ÄîI do not know whether the First Minister <lb/>
took the trouble of reading it, but it was there for <lb/>
him to read‚ÄîI stated then exactly where I stood. <lb/>
I stated that when these questions came up, if my <lb/>
party differed from the view which ought to be <lb/>
taken, I must stand alone, and I must follow these <lb/>
questions to their end. On other questions I <lb/>
stated there, as I have stated elsewhere, that as I <lb/>
was elected a supporter of the general policy of <lb/>
the Government, I was still a supporter of, and <lb/>
still a believer in that policy. If my connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the party that I have hitherto sup<lb break="no"/>ported is an injury to that party, as I think <lb/>
perhaps it is, if the gentlemen who sit behind <lb/>
me do not want me here, I am willing <lb/>
to go here or there, I care not where. I think I . <lb/>
can find a seat in this House, and I can still voice <lb/>
the opinions of my own constituency, and a large <lb/>
proportion of the people of Ontario, whether I <lb/>
am turned out of this party or not, and Whether <lb/>
I am accepted in that party or not. Such has been <lb/>
my course, and I am not ashamed of it. I de<lb break="no"/>nounce that man as a traitor to his country, I care <lb/>
not who he may be, who endeavors to arouse <lb/>
political passions and race passions by misrepre<lb break="no"/>senting my views; he is the man who is doing the <lb/>
wrong, he is the man who is endeavoring in this <lb/>
Parliament and in this country to set race against <lb/>
race and religion against religion, because if my <lb/>
views are fairly looked at, if my statements are <lb/>
fairly examined, if my speeches are fairly read, I <lb/>
think no taint of bitterness will be found, because <lb/>
no taint of bitterness exists, towards my French <lb/>
Canadian fellow-citizens. <lb/></p> 

<p>An hon. MEMBER. Oh, oh. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. The hon. gentleman may <lb/>
laugh, but he must know that I have a perfect . <lb/>
right to the opinion which I entertain, that the <lb/>
best interests of this country are to be subserved <lb/>
by a unity of language, that the future of this <lb/>
great Dominion, with which this Parliament is <lb/>
charged, will be best worked out by the people of <lb/>
this country coming together and speaking the <lb/>

<pb n="849" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00849.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">849</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 18, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">850</fw>
    
language of the majority, the tongue that ulti<lb break="no"/>mately must be spoken on all this continent of <lb/>
North America. And, if I am right in that, I do <lb/>
no injustice to my Canadian fellow-subjects; I do <lb/>
only what is my right and my duty, if among <lb/>
those hon. gentlemen and their constituents I <lb/>
endeavor to propagate my views and to support <lb/>
those views by arguments. I frankly admit, I do <lb/>
not deny it, that to many of these hon. gentlemen <lb/>
these are unpalatable views; but is that any good <lb/>
reason why, if I do think, and there are many who <lb/>
think with me, I should hesitate upon the floor of <lb/>
Parliament in temperate language, and my lan<lb break="no"/>guage was temperate, to express these views. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. My language, I re-assert, <lb/>
Was temperate, and I will refer to it to support <lb/>
these views. My language was temperate wher<lb break="no"/>ever I spoke, and it was more especially temperate <lb/>
on the cor of Parliament, as an hon. gentleman's <lb/>
language ought to be temperate here. No such <lb/>
words escaped my lips as those which the Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State used towards me here to-day; no <lb/>
language of that kind has ever escaped my lips in <lb/>
this debate, and I trust, notwithstanding the pro<lb break="no"/>vocation of the Minister of Public Works, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the provocation I received from the <lb/>
Secretary of State, who denounced me in language <lb/>
not fit for this Assembly, I trust no word will <lb/>
escape my lips which will resemble those used in <lb/>
the course they have pursued towards me. My <lb/>
arguments may tend to a certain conclusion, but <lb/>
my tone was temperate, and I venture to say that <lb/>
my argument was fairly drawn. Now, what was it? <lb/>
I ventured, in the first place, to give a short ac<lb break="no"/>count of the history of this legislation. I ventured, <lb/>
in the second place, to demonstrate, what I am <lb/>
glad to know I did succeed in demonstrating be<lb break="no"/>yond the region of contradiction, that the French <lb/>
language was not, according to any treaty rights, to <lb/>
be given, if you choose to call it so, to be made a part <lb/>
of the system in the North-West Territory. For <lb/>
that purpose it was necessary that I should trace <lb/>
the history of the cession. I was sorry I intro<lb break="no"/>duced even the word conquest, if it was offensive <lb/>
to any hon. gentleman, and I am quite willing <lb/>
to put the fact in any words, although most men <lb/>
will admit that the words make very little diffe<lb break="no"/>rence when the history is known to us all. I said, <lb/>
tracing that history step by step from the cession <lb/>
of 1763 to the passage of the British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica Act in 1867, that no word was to be found in <lb/>
all that history to show why that Act was passed, <lb/>
for which the hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. <lb/>
Mills) is responsible, which was represented in <lb/>
that day to the House, but which I am sorry to <lb/>
say was not fairly or correctly represented to the <lb/>
House at that time, by the hon. gentleman, <lb/>
as a piece of legislation warranted upon a ground <lb/>
of that kind. My next argument, and I think it <lb/>
was a not unreasonable one, was this. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). The hon. gentleman <lb/>
was himself a member of the House. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. I am not at all unaware of <lb/>
that fact. What I repeat is, that the matter was <lb/>
misrepresented to this House. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). In what way? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. By the hon. member for <lb/>
Bothwell. <lb/></p>

<cb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). I deny it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. I will tell the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man in what way. That legislation was introduced <lb/>
into the Senate upon the suggestion of Mr. <lb/>
Girard, the Senator for Manitoba, but it was <lb/>
placed there by the member of the Government <lb/>
leading the Senate, Hon. Mr. Scott. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). I do not believe it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. I have better information <lb/>
than the hon. gentleman, and, therefore, I shall <lb/>
not withdraw my statement. I speak by the book; <lb/>
I speak on the authority of a gentleman who was <lb/>
present; I speak in a way I can prove. I can prove <lb/>
that Senator Girard merely asked that some pro<lb break="no"/>vision should be made by which the French half-<lb break="yes"/>breeds would have the right to speak in their own <lb/>
language in the courts; and the matter was taken <lb/>
into consideration by Hon. Mr. Scott. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. That is not the only thing <lb/>
that was asked. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. That is correct according <lb/>
to my information, and it is probably quite as good <lb/>
as that possessed by the Secretary of State. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. I have sat for five days in <lb/>
this House listening to this debate. I have been <lb/>
abused by almost every hon. gentleman who has <lb/>
spoken, but I have made no interruption. It is <lb/>
strange that if with ten to one against me they <lb/>
cannot give me even free speech. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. You stated as a fact that <lb/>
which was not correct. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Whether correct or not, the <lb/>
hon. gentleman knows the rules of debate. Sir, I <lb/>
am speaking by the book of what I know from infor<lb break="no"/>mation on the very highest authority. The leader of <lb/>
the Senate then stated that during the recess he would <lb/>
consult his colleagues, and after recess he came down <lb/>
and put the clause, which is now clause 110, into the <lb/>
hands of Mr. Girard, who moved it, and it was <lb/>
carried in the Senate. If that be so‚Äîand we had no <lb/>
clear explanation about it, although I threw out the <lb/>
challenge in my opening remarks‚Äîthen the respon<lb break="no"/>sibility for this trouble rests not upon my shoul<lb break="no"/>ders but upon the shoulders of the hon. member <lb/>
for Bothwell and his friends in the Government at <lb/>
that time. Those are the men who are responsible <lb/>
for the trouble, and it became my duty to bring it <lb/>
forward. I do not say I have not failed in my duty <lb/>
heretofore; I failed in my duty probably in not being <lb/>
present when that was done, but I do not suppose <lb/>
that a young member, for I was then only in my <lb/>
second year of my parliamentary life, would have <lb/>
ventured to interpose at that stage of the Session. <lb/>
That I have failed in my duty since I do not <lb/>
pretend to deny, but when I did ascertain the facts <lb/>
I would have been wanting in my duty, feeling and <lb/>
believing as I do feel and believe with respect to <lb/>
this matter, if I had not brought it to the attention <lb/>
of the country in the first place, and, in the second <lb/>
place, to the attention of this House. With respect <lb/>
to other matters on which I desire to speak before <lb/>
I deal with the question itself: It is true I ad <lb/>
dressed a meeting in Montreal; it is true I addressed <lb/>
a meeting in this city of Ottawa, but those who <lb/>
know the facts must know that those meetings <lb/>
which I have had the honor to address were not of <lb/>
my seeking. I have a list of places and a bundle of <lb/>
papers which would satisfy hon. gentlemen that <lb/>

<pb n="851" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00851.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">851</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">852</fw> 

I, at all events, was not seeking to force myself upon <lb/>
the public, but my attendance was demanded by the <lb/>
great city of Montreal and by the city of Ottawa, <lb/>
and it was only in answer to repeated calls that I <lb/>
went to those different cities. So much with <lb/>
respect to what has been said in regard to this <lb/>
agitation. If hon. gentlemen will deal with the <lb/>
matter fairly, they will see that there was no other <lb/>
course open to me, feeling as I feel, and realising <lb/>
my responsibility as a member of this House, but <lb/>
to take the action I have pursued. But exception <lb/>
has been taken to some of my language. I had the <lb/>
misfortune to miss the speech of the hon. leader <lb/>
of the Opposition, and I have not yet had time, <lb/>
    having only received <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> this evening, to <lb/>
peruse his speech throughout; but I am told the <lb/>
hon. gentleman assailed my speech on the ground <lb/>
that I had used harsh expressions with regard <lb/>
to his nationality. If the hon. gentleman under<lb break="no"/>stood my remarks were with respect to his <lb/>
nationality and his race, then I do not wonder <lb/>
at the hon. gentleman's indignation. If the hon. <lb/>
gentleman supposes that I was capable of speak<lb break="no"/>ing of any people of this Dominion, or any sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the people of this Dominion in these <lb/>
terms, he was perfectly within his duty in calling <lb/>
attention to the language and denouncing it in the <lb/>
most vigorous terms. But that was not the mean<lb break="no"/>ing of my words, and I think my hon. friend, a <lb/>
master as he is of our own tongue, perfectly well <lb/>
realised that was not the meaning. I spoke of the <lb/>
national cry and the national party that he among <lb/>
others has been establishing and fomenting in one <lb/>
of the Provinces of this Dominion, and I denounced <lb/>
that nationality, or rather that pretending nation<lb break="no"/>ality as a bastard nationality. I again denounce <lb/>
it here on the floor of Parliament as such. I say <lb/>
that the legitimate nationality, and there is but <lb/>
one, is the nationality common to us all, the <lb/>
nationality that spreads from ocean to ocean and <lb/>
embraces all races and peoples within this great <lb/>
Dominion. I say that if any one in any portion or <lb/>
corner of this Dominion gathers a party together, <lb/>
whether English, Irish, Scotch or French, and en<lb break="no"/>deavors to rise a cry on the nationality of that <lb/>
particular race, there is no word that describes it <lb/>
other than the word that I used, and to which the <lb/>
hon. gentleman called attention. Although the <lb/>
hon. gentleman thought I dare not, I have no <lb/>
hesitation of repeating that statement on the floor <lb/>
of this House, and there is no hon. member under<lb break="no"/>standing the sense in which I stated it before, and <lb/>
in which I repeat it now, who can deny that the <lb/>
expression used was applicable. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. The expression was unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. The hon. gentleman may <lb/>
say so, but I do not know how else he could put it. <lb/>
In justice to him I will say that he quoted my <lb/>
words fairly, or otherwise I would have quoted <lb/>
them myself. There is but one nationality that I, <lb/>
at all events, am willing to recognise in this coun<lb break="no"/>try. I do not speak of our loyalty to the Throne; <lb/>
I do not speak of our allegiance to the mother <lb/>
country; I speak of that higher nationality of Can<lb break="no"/>adians to Canada. I speak not of one nationality, <lb/>
not of one race, but of all Canada and all Canadians <lb/>
joined together as we should be joined and proud <lb/>
to acknowledge our allegiance. I regret that so <lb/>
much time has been taken up by a somewhat per<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

sonal explanation, but, perhaps, if I was to do the <lb/>
subject justice with which I propose to deal, it was <lb/>
necessary that I should clear away from the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion those extraneous matters which those <lb/>
opposed to me have thought well to introduce. We <lb/>
perfectly well understand the arts of the politician. <lb/>
We do not always spread it so exactly or plainly <lb/>
to the public as the innocent member for South <lb/>
Oxford (Sir Richard Cartwright); we do not <lb/>
always exactly announce that we are giving party <lb/>
instructions when we speak on the floor of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment as that hon. gentleman has thought fit to do, <lb/>
but it has been perfectly plain and perfectly clear <lb/>
to the vision of the most uninitiated among, us that <lb/>
the object here has been not to discuss this matter <lb/>
on its merits, not to deal with this question, as it <lb/>
ought to be dealt with, as to wether it should or <lb/>
not become law, but by abusing the plaintiff's attor<lb break="no"/>ney‚Äîthe unfortunate promoter of the Bill‚Äîand by <lb/>
raising clouds of race prejudices and religious <lb/>
prejudices as well, to have this Bill rejected because <lb/>
of matters which ought not to have been mentioned <lb/>
in connection with it. What is the proposition we <lb/>
are dealing with here? It is a simple one. It is <lb/>
said that it is the entering of the thin end of <lb/>
the wedge; it is said that I have commenced a <lb/>
crusade, and that this is the first thing I have <lb/>
attempted and that my success in this will mean <lb/>
success later on in other matters. Even if that were <lb/>
so, and if the continuance of the present condition <lb/>
of things is an injury to the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West‚Äîif this is calculated to do that great portion <lb/>
of our Dominion an injustice, are the people of the <lb/>
North-West to suffer under this grievance because <lb/>
of the unfortunate language‚Äîif it be unfortunate‚Äî <lb/>
because of the unfortunate terms‚Äîif they be <lb/>
unfortunate‚Äîin which the Bill was presented to <lb/>
the House of Commons. I do not think the prac<lb break="no"/>tical people of this country will accept any such <lb/>
excuse. I will just add as a rider to the advice of the <lb/>
hon. member for South Oxford (Sir Richard Cart<lb break="no"/>wright): "Do not I beseech you hon. members who <lb/>
sit behind him allow yourselves to be carried away <lb/>
with such ill advice as that." This Bill and this <lb/>
only must be dealt with on its merits. It is not <lb/>
for the speech of the member who introduced it <lb/>
you are going to vote, it is not for his speech in <lb/>
the Opera House at Ottawa you are going to vote, <lb/>
but you must vote "yea" or "nay" upon the Bill <lb/>
itself which is now before you. If that Bill is one <lb/>
which in the interests of our common country should <lb/>
be passed, I do not think that excuses such as are <lb/>
presented here will save hon. gentlemen from the <lb/>
just indignation of their constituents. Again, <lb/>
there has been a very great misrepresentation of <lb/>
what I stated in my speech. My argument upon <lb/>
the question of language is to be found in these <lb/>
words: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Now I venture to think I have to advance some <lb/>
explanation of the proposition which I am dealing with‚Äî <lb/>
that is, that language is of great importance, that it is of <lb/>
vital consequence to the nation, that the language s oken <lb/>
by its people should be common to them all, an that <lb/>
they should not at all events be encouraged and trained <lb/>
in speaking different languages." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Is there anything revolutionary in that? Is this <lb/>
the language of the incendiary? Is there anything <lb/>
here that ought not to have been uttered on the <lb/>
floor of Parliament. You can look throughout the <lb/>
speech and you will find nothing more radical than <lb/>
that. I gave my reasons and I cited What my <lb/>
hon. friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) was <lb/>
    
<pb n="853" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00853.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">853</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 18, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">854</fw>
    
good enough to sneer at as my "authorities." We <lb/>
are not all, like the hon. member for Assiniboia, <lb/>
versed in literature, history, philology, ethnology <lb/>
and in all the other subjects he is so well acquainted <lb/>
with, nor is the country so learned as that hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman; and I thought in justice to my position that <lb/>
I should quote my authorities. This subject is a <lb/>
comparatively new one to most of us, and I do not <lb/>
repent of it in the slightest degree that in the <lb/>
introduction of this Bill I stated my reasons and <lb/>
gave my authorities, which have been open to the <lb/>
criticisms of hon. members who did me the honor <lb/>
to listen to my address or who read my observa<lb break="no"/>tions. After all the impassioned language we have <lb/>
heard, after all the abuse that has been heaped <lb/>
upon my devoted head, I ask: Do not those words of <lb/>
mine stand unrefuted and incapable of refutation? <lb/>
The hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) and <lb/>
the hon. member for North York (Mr. Mulock)‚Äî <lb/>
the loyal embryo knight from that constituency‚Äî <lb/>
have first set up a man of straw and then <lb/>
attacked him. The hon. member for Bothwell <lb/>
contended that I had not gone far enough‚Äîthat <lb/>
I ought to have struck at the language here in <lb/>
this chamber and in the Province of Quebec‚Äî <lb/>
that I ought to have prevented its use in the pulpit, <lb/>
on the platform, in the schools, and so on. Why, Sir, <lb/>
we have nothing to do with these matters; we have <lb/>
no call to meddle with them; but I am glad to be able <lb/>
to inform the hon. gentleman that the North-West <lb/>
Legislative Assembly are themselves dealing with <lb/>
this matter of the schools, which is, perhaps, the <lb/>
most important of all. They, discovering as they <lb/>
did lately, just as we have discovered lately, what <lb/>
was going on in the so-called Separate schools in <lb/>
the French settlements, have already, in advance <lb/>
of the Province of Ontario, put an end to that, and <lb/>
the teaching is now in the English tongue. What <lb/>
I have sought for here is that which is in our <lb/>
power. We have this enormous territory yet to <lb/>
be peopled by millions, and do we want to have <lb/>
repeated there the spectacle which is presented on <lb/>
the floor of this House, or the spectacle, still more <lb/>
deplorable from a patriotic point of view, which is <lb/>
depicted in the Legislative Chamber of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec? Do you want that, Sir? It <lb/>
would be better that we all spoke French than <lb/>
that half of us should speak French and half of us <lb/>
English. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. The hon. gentleman says <lb/>
"hear, hear," and he is quite right. I do not pre<lb break="no"/>tend to know the glories of the French language, but <lb/>
I do know enough from what I have been told to <lb/>
believe that it is a beautiful tongue. But that is <lb/>
not the question we are dealing with. We know <lb/>
that the French language is not and never can be <lb/>
the language of British North America and we <lb/>
ought to realise‚Äîmore especially ought the French <lb/>
Canadians of this country to realise‚Äî that their true <lb/>
interest, as our true interest, is at as early a day <lb/>
as possible to have but the one language spoken in <lb/>
this country. Well, of course, I do not expect, <lb/>
and it would be hardly reasonable to expect, that <lb/>
those hon. gentlemen who agree with me that we <lb/>
should all be better speaking French will go the <lb/>
other step with me and agree that we should be <lb/>
all the better speaking English, though the hon. <lb/>
leader of the Opposition I am told‚Äîfor I had not <lb/>
the honor of hearing him‚Äîrather leaned to that <lb/>

<cb/>

view. Now, I am not going to follow the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the other side of the House in their excursions <lb/>
into Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Cape Colony, <lb/>
Mauritius, and other places which have been <lb/>
brought to our notice. I have stated before, and <lb/>
I repeat, that these cases are not the rule, but <lb/>
the exception; and while I quite admit that the <lb/>
Province of Quebec is also an exceptional case, <lb/>
the legislation proposed here has no reference to <lb/>
that Province; it has no reference even to this <lb/>
Parliament; it is with regard to the great terri<lb break="no"/>tories of the North-West, which have always be<lb break="no"/>longed to the Crown of England, which never be<lb break="no"/>longed to the French in any sense, notwithstanding <lb/>
the statement of the bishop which is in our Votes <lb/>
and Proceedings. History tells us that north of <lb/>
the Height of Land and from there to the Pacific <lb/>
Ocean the Frenchman, although he went there. <lb/>
went there as a trespasser, and was expelled as a <lb/>
trespasser. I see a smile on the face of the philo<lb break="no"/>sopher from Bothwell, who endeavored to prove that <lb/>
the French territory extended as far as the Rocky <lb/>
Mountains. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). So it did. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. But that was settled by the <lb/>
boundary decision. Those who represented the <lb/>
Province of Ontario in that dispute, before the <lb/>
Privy Council, put forward that pretension, and <lb/>
the hon. gentleman sat there with his wig on his <lb/>
head ready to argue, if he were only allowed, in <lb/>
favor of it, but it was better argued by his seniors. <lb/>
But the Privy Council rejected his contention, and <lb/>
the boundary was placed where we now have it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). Not at all; it was on <lb/>
the ground of acquiescence that they decided. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. The hon. gentleman is, of <lb/>
course, wiser than the rest of us. As the Privy <lb/>
Council gave no reason for their judgment, but <lb/>
simply reported to Her Majesty where the bound<lb break="no"/>ary was, I do not know where he got that infor<lb break="no"/>mation. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). During the argument. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. There was not one word <lb/>
during the argument, which I took part in, which <lb/>
would lead to that conclusion. At all events, the <lb/>
observation of a judge during an argument is not <lb/>
a decision. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell) The observation of Lord <lb/>
Selborne‚Äî <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. If the hon. gentleman will <lb/>
keep his soul in patience we shall get on more <lb/>
easily with this debate. That being so, on what <lb/>
pretense, I want to know, did that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's Government introduce this clause into the <lb/>
North-West Territories Act? I am not now dis<lb break="no"/>cussing the Province of Manitoba; but with regard <lb/>
to the North-West Territories, is there a shadow of <lb/>
reason for this provision? If so, it has not yet been <lb/>
given to show why the dual language should be <lb/>
imposed on the people of the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. If there be no answer, as no answer there <lb/>
can be, then I want to know what is the duty of <lb/>
this Parliament? Is the duty of this Parliament to <lb/>
leave it there? In that respect I understand that <lb/>
the politician of the party, the hon. member for <lb/>
South Oxford (Sir Richard Cartwright) differs from <lb/>
the hon. member for West Durham, and he is wise <lb/>
to difl'er with him and withdraw himself from his <lb/>
protection. The proposition of the hon. member <lb/>

<pb n="855" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00855.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">855</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">856</fw> 

for West Durham, the most monstrous ever sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to any assembly, is to keep the language <lb/>
as an encouragement to the French to emigrate to <lb/>
the North-West, and to settle this question, by-and-<lb break="yes"/>bye, after they get there. If they go in masses, <lb/>
says the hon. member, I shall much regret it; but <lb/>
if they do go there in masses‚Äîand we perfectly <lb/>
well know that they do not go in any other way‚Äî <lb/>
then, he said, something will have to be done. If <lb/>
I might appeal to the reason of the House without <lb/>
prejudice, I would say, let us look at the position <lb/>
of the North-West to-day. We are told, and the <lb/>
census confirms it, that in 1885 there were but <lb/>
1,500 French Canadians in the North-West. If you <lb/>
add the number of the half-breeds of French descent, <lb/>
the number will still be less than 5,000. I have <lb/>
got the exact figures here. We know that at the <lb/>
time to which I refer, there were in the three dis<lb break="no"/>tricts 23,285 English-speaking people; I am leaving <lb/>
the Indians out of consideration. The ratio is <lb/>
therefore 83 to 17 per cent., and if our records are <lb/>
correct that disproportion has been vastly increased, <lb/>
and it is not too much to say that there are not to<lb break="no"/>day in the North-West one-tenth of the people who <lb/>
speak the French language to the nine-tenths who <lb/>
speak the English language. And moreover, when <lb/>
we look at the record we find that these French <lb/>
are scattered. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). Then they are not in <lb/>
the mass? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. "Then they are not in the <lb/>
mass" is the very erudite observation made by the <lb/>
hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills). They are <lb/>
here, there and everywhere, in small bands and <lb/>
surrounded by a large population of English-<lb break="yes"/>speaking people That being so, can there be any <lb/>
better time for settling this question than the <lb/>
present? Should there be an immigration in the <lb/>
North-West, in the near future of the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, should they go in there induced by the speech <lb/>
of the hon. member for West Durham (Mr. Blake), <lb/>
or should this House be insane enough to adopt <lb/>
the proposed resolution of that hon. gentleman, I <lb/>
do not know, in common justice, how it would be <lb/>
possible to say, by-and-bye, to those who had immi<lb break="no"/>grated upon the faith of such resolution, that this <lb/>
dual language should be done away with. There<lb break="no"/>fore, this is the time to deal with the question, and <lb/>
I venture to say that this is the place. The hon. <lb/>
member for South Oxford threw another insinua<lb break="no"/>tion, and it certainly would be more satisfactory, <lb/>
if instead of insinuating, he would make his state<lb break="no"/>ments so clear that they could be understood. He <lb/>
said that the North-West Council had been moved <lb/>
to present the petition I spoke of by some outside <lb/>
influence, about which he indicated I knew some<lb break="no"/>thing. What did the hon. gentleman mean? Has <lb/>
the hon. gentleman ever been in the North-West? <lb/>
Has he ever seen the members of the Council or of <lb/>
the Assembly? Does he know the character of <lb/>
the men there? My whole connection with the <lb/>
North-West Assembly commenced with stopping <lb/>
over at Calgary and then passing on; and I had only <lb/>
one communication with one of the members of that <lb/>
Council after this matter was dealt with by the <lb/>
Council, and that was with reference to the form in <lb/>
which the petition ought to be presented to this <lb/>
House. But to suppose that the North-West <lb/>
Council, composed of 22 members, representing <lb/>
three districts, which are in a much less degree <lb/>

<cb/>

represented in this House, were not competent to <lb/>
deal with this question; to suppose that their <lb/>
opinion is to have no weight with us, but it is to <lb/>
be set at naught; to suppose that the great doc<lb break="no"/>trine of provincial rights in the case of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Council is not to have even the support of <lb/>
hon. gentlemen opposite, is a very extraordinary, <lb/>
conclusion to arrive at. Now, what is the posi<lb break="no"/>tion? The North-VVest Council, by a petition <lb/>
Which is practically unanimous‚Äîcarried by 20 <lb/>
to 2‚Äîand which has been laid on the Table, asks <lb/>
for the passage of a measure such as the one I have <lb/>
introduced. Hearing that petitions were being <lb/>
presented here from certain settlements, there was <lb/>
at once‚Äîand without the slightest communication, <lb/>
so far as I know, with any member of this House; <lb/>
without any communication at all events with me <lb/>
‚Äîa burst of indignation at what appeared to these <lb/>
men to be the imposition which was being prac<lb break="no"/>tised upon this House. The petitions which the <lb/>
hon. members presented, and which aroused this <lb/>
indignation, were couched as follows:‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

of Alberta, N. W. T., held this second day of January, <lb/>

been unanimoasly adopted: <lb/></p> 

<p>"Whereas, the French language is, under the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion and the laws, one of the two official languages of the <lb/>

the settlers of French origin, who were the pioneers of <lb/>
this country. and towards those of the same race, who, <lb/>
upon the faith of the constitution and existing laws, came <lb/>
and established themselves in the North-West, and have <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"At a mass meeting in Calgary to-night, Mayor Lafferty, <lb/>
chairman, the following resolutions passed by 250 to 7:‚Äî <lb/></p> 

<p>"'No. 1. That the use of a dual language in oflicial pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings in the North-West Territories is unnecessary, <lb/>
expensive and calculated to prevent the complete union <lb/>
of the several nationalities who reslde in the Territories. <lb/>
and that to bring about a united Canadian people in this <lb/>
part of the Dominion, the English language alone should <lb/>
be legalised in the proceedings of the Legislative Assem<lb break="no"/>bly, the courts, and all other official bodies. <lb/></p> 

<p>"'No. 2. That this meeting heartily endorses the action <lb/>
of the Legislative Assembly at Regina, in reference to the <lb/>
dual language, and requests that the petition presented <lb/>
to the Dominion Government in pursuance of such action <lb/>
be granted. <lb/></p> 

<p>"'No. 3. That a copy of the above resolutions be for<lb break="no"/>warded to D. W. Davis, M.P., D'Alton McCarthy, M.P., <lb/>
the Hon. James Lougheed and the Dominion Parliament, <lb/>
and that D. W. Davis, M.P., be requested to forward in <lb/>

<p>Now, let us see where we stand in regard to this <lb/>
question, considered as a local one. The members <lb/>
of the North-West Council were elected two years <lb/>
ago, if my memory serves me, since the members <lb/>
of this House who sit for that district were elected. <lb/>
They are twenty-two in number. They are spread, <lb/>
of course, and come much more in contact with <lb/>
the people of their respective territories than do <lb/>
the members who sit here, whose districts are so <lb/>
much larger. They have unanimously, or with <lb/>
practical unanimity, petitioned this House to <lb/>
abolish this clause in the North-West Territories <lb/>
Act. On the motion being made here, and the <lb/>
matter being brought before Parliament, and it <lb/>
appearing that certain cut-and-dried petitions were <lb/>
presented here from certain places in that Terri<lb break="no"/>tory, the people there at once set about getting up <lb/>
counter-petitions which I have had the honor to <lb/>
present to the House. They are not petitions pur<lb break="no"/>porting to be signed by the chairmen and secretaries <lb/>
of public meetings, which may conceal the fact that <lb/>
no such meetings were held, but they are signed <lb/>
by the leading men in the places from which they <lb/>
come. For instance, in Calgary, the petition was <lb/>
signed by the mayor at the head, by two ex-mayors <lb/>
and over 500 others; and, in another place, the peti<lb break="no"/>tion is signed by a French Catholic gentleman, who, <lb/>
I think must be the gentleman who grows coffee, to <lb/>
whom the member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) <lb/>
referred to the other night, though of that I am <lb/>
not quite sure. Then we have a public meeting at <lb/>
which a vote of 250 to 7 was recorded in favor of <lb/>
this change; and yet we are told that we do not <lb/>
know what the feelings of the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West are in regard to this question, and that we <lb/>
ought to give them time for consideration, and to <lb/>
allow the members of the Assembly there another <lb/>
opportunity of appealing to their constituents. <lb/>
There are many other questions which come before <lb/>
this House with which, if that argument is to pre<lb break="no"/>vail, we would find it difficult to deal at all. But <lb/>
I do not conceal the fact that I do not look upon <lb/>
this matter as a local question. When I addressed <lb/>
the people of Calgary, and they were good enough <lb/>
to say that they understood I was to take a part <lb/>
in the movement to abolish the separate school <lb/>
system and the dual language in the North-West, <lb/>
I said, as to the dual language I shall move in Par<lb break="no"/>liament, Whether you petition or not; I look upon <lb/>
that question as a matter of national importance, <lb/>
as a matter affecting the whole Dominion, as a <lb/>
matter which is proper to be dealt with in <lb/>
Parliament and not by a Local Legislature. <lb/>
I found at the same time, in the organ of <lb/>
the hon. gentleman which is published in the city <lb/>
of Toronto, a statement that if the people in the <lb/>
North-West signified their desire to abolish the <lb/>
use of that language officially, effect would be <lb/>
given to their wish. When the Assembly met, al<lb break="no"/>most their earliest act‚Äîand I think not their least <lb/>
important act‚Äîwas to adopt this petition, which <lb/>
placed on two grounds their desire to abolish the <lb/>
use of that language: one, that it was not required <lb/>
in the interest of the country; and the other, that <lb/>
it was contrary to sound public policy that two <lb/>
languages should prevail. Follow that up by the <lb/>
petitions I have had the honor to present, and by <lb/>
the report which I have read from my place in <lb/>
Parliament, and then, if the House is not seized of <lb/>

the opinions of the North-West in regard to this <lb/>
matter, I fail to see how we will ever be able to <lb/>
obtain the views of that people on the subject. Do <lb/>
not let us exaggerate, I have no desire at all to ex<lb break="no"/>aggerate the importance of this question of <lb/>
language. I admit as freely as it can be admitted <lb/>
that there are cases‚Äîand the case of Switzerland <lb/>
is one‚Äîwhere, under peculiar circumstances, people <lb/>
speaking different languages, those languages <lb/>
being officially there three instead of two, have <lb/>
enjoyed a certain amount of prosperity, or <lb/>
very great prosperity if you like. But do hon. <lb/>
gentlemen see any analogy between Switzer<lb break="no"/>land and Canada? The cantons of Switzer<lb break="no"/>land came together as independent bodies under <lb/>
bargains and terms and conditions to which every<lb break="no"/>one of them had to agree, and that possesses nothing <lb/>
of an analogy to the case of our own North-West. <lb/>
But, if we look at the history of the Swiss Con<lb break="no"/>federation, what do we find? I hardly expected <lb/>
from the historian of the House, the hon. member <lb/>
for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), that so much stress <lb/>
would be laid upon the case of Switzerland. Let <lb/>
us look at this case of Switzerland for a few mo<lb break="no"/>ments, while I give a short statement of its history. <lb/>
It is quite true that Switzerland is composed of 22 <lb/>
cantons, it is quite true that there are three official <lb/>
languages there, it is equally true that there is a <lb/>
fourth language which is not recognised. But the <lb/>
history of the Swiss constitution may briefly be <lb/>
summarised thus: Between 1291 and 1874, the <lb/>
confederation has passed through no less than seven <lb/>
phases, of which, since 1798, there have been four <lb/>
‚Äîone in 1798, one in 1803, another in 1815, another <lb/>
1848, and a revision in 1874. Is that the evidence <lb/>
of a stable constitution? Is that the kind of con<lb break="no"/>stitution that the hon. member would like to have <lb/>
fastened upon the people of his beloved North-<lb break="yes"/>West? Just let us see: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The third phase lasted till 1798 "‚Äî <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>I am reading from the best work, I believe, on <lb/>
the subject, the work of Sir F. O. Adams‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>‚Äî" without modification, and was marked by internal <lb/>
discord, religious wars, and revolts of peasants." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>That is the first beautiful picture we have of the <lb/>
Confederation of Switzerland. This phase lasted <lb/>
from 1815 to 1848: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Then came an epoch of agitation and of discord. <lb/></p> 

<p>"The Confederation suffered from a fundamental vice, <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">i. e</hi>., the powerlessness of the central authority. The <lb/>
Cantons had become too independent, and gave to their <lb/>
deputies instructions differing Widely from each other." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Now, here is what we find happening in 1847: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"On the 4th November, 1847, after the deputies of the <lb/>
Sonderbond had left the Diet, this league was declared to <lb/>
be dissolved,and hostilities broke out between the two con<lb break="no"/>tending parties. A short and demsxve campaign of twenty-<lb break="yes"/>five days ensued; Frelburg was taken by the Federal <lb/>
troops under General Dufour, later Luzern opened its <lb/>
gates, the small cantons and the Valais capitulated, and <lb/>
the strife came to an end." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Now, let me give you a comment upon this from <lb/>
a paper which, perhaps, will not command the <lb/>
    attention of the members of this House, the Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh <hi rendition="simple:italic">Review</hi> which, so late, as the month of <lb/>
January last, spoke of the Swiss Executive in <lb/>
these words: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"It (the Swiss Executive) guides the policy of a state <lb/>
eternally menaced by foreign complications; it reserves <lb/>
harmony throughout a confederacy made up of twenty-<lb break="yes"/>two cantons, each jealous of one another an sympathis<lb break="no"/>ing only in common jealousy of the Federal power." <lb/></p> 
</quote>


<cb/>

<p>I do not think that any of us would like to plant <lb/>
in the virgin soil of the North-West, a constitution <lb/>
such as the Swiss constitution, with the results <lb/>
which have attended its use, and, therefore, the <lb/>
illustration is very far fetched. Take another <lb/>
illustration which we have had, take Cape Colony; <lb/>
I dare say some hon. gentleman know more about <lb/>
Cape Colony than I do, possibly some members of <lb/>
this House may have visited it; but is it not a fact <lb/>
that the Dutch Boers, as they are called, have <lb/>
rebelled and have left the English colony and have <lb/>
formed an independent republic on its borders? <lb/>
Have not, within recent times, the British arms <lb/>
suffered a defeat at their hands, and today is <lb/>
there not very great trouble between the Dutch <lb/>
who remain in the English colony? Certainly, it <lb/>
is the last example I would expect to be given by <lb/>
any persons, cognisant with the facts in support of <lb/>
a duality of language in any country. But need we <lb/>
go so far afield? Let me give one more instance, <lb/>
wearisome as these instances may be. I cannot <lb/>
forbear quoting to the House the striking example <lb/>
of Bohemia. Bohemia, we all know, is inhabited <lb/>
by two nationalities, the Germans, and the Zechs, <lb/>
speaking each their language. We know an at<lb break="no"/>tempt was made, not long ago, to put down one of <lb/>
these languages, and how has a settlement been <lb/>
arrived at? What has been the only possible solu<lb break="no"/>tion? Under the influence of the Emperor Francis <lb/>
Joseph, who is beloved by his subjects, and who <lb/>
has great influence among them, they have resolved <lb/>
to settle the difficulty in this extraordinary fashion: <lb/>
the Diet is informally divided into two Curiae, one <lb/>
German and the other Zech, which sit and debate <lb/>
together, although each possesses the full power of <lb/>
a separate and co-ordinate House. That is the only <lb/>
solution for a duality of language which could be <lb/>
found in Bohemia, and it was found necessary to <lb/>
resort to that in order to prevent these people <lb/>
from flying at one another's throats, it was found <lb/>
necessary to resort to that to prevent the Germans <lb/>
from deserting to Bismark. Now, what is the <lb/>
position here?‚Äîbecause, it is useless for us to go <lb/>
further than our own country. If this language is <lb/>
not designedly perpetuated with the view of keep<lb break="no"/>ing up the French nationality‚Äîwhich the hon. <lb/>
leader of the Opposition has been the only French <lb/>
Canadian on the floor of Parliament to denounce, <lb/>
or to say that he does not sympathise with it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. What? <lb/></p>

one which is pointed out to us in newspapers in <lb/>

when I had the honor to introduce this Bill? I know <lb/>
no other. But I deny the right of any gentleman in <lb/>
this House to repudiate the language of the mounte<lb break="no"/>bank, as the hon. member for West Assiniboia <lb/>
(Mr. Davin) calls him, the "mountebank Premier" <lb/>
of the Province of Quebec. The language is not <lb/>
mine. I differ from Mr. Mercier as much as it is <lb/>
possible to differ from any public man, but yet I <lb/>
have too great a respect for my French Canadian <lb/>
fellow-subjects to speak of their First Minister in <lb/>
the language which was used by the champion of <lb/>
their cause on the floor of this Parliament; for I <lb/>
recognise in him, whatever his other faults may <lb/>
be, one of the greatest men which his nationality <lb/>
has produced in Canada. We know that although <lb/>
it may suit the purposes of the leader of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to say that he does not sympathise with these <lb/>
aspirations, his words are not uttered in the Prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Quebec. We know that the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is going hand in hand with the Premier of the <lb/>
Province of Quebec in all his local contests, in all <lb/>
his endeavors to fasten what he calls the Nation<lb break="no"/>alist Party upon that Province, and in which, up <lb/>
to this time, he has been successful. We know, Sir, <lb/>
that the hon. gentleman was present at a great <lb/>
public meeting at which the Premier of Quebec <lb/>
announced the aspirations of the French Canadian <lb/>
people to be the formation of a great French nation<lb break="no"/>ality, not under the glorious Union Jack, of which <lb/>
we hear so much in this House from some hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men who do not say so much about it in the Province <lb/>
of Quebec, but under the Tricolor, and he advised <lb/>
the members of both parties to join under the <lb/>
Tricolor of France, the flag of France, not that <lb/>
they wished to unite with France; I quite agree <lb/>
that is not their aspiration; the Republic of <lb/>
France does not suit the French Canadians of that <lb/>
view in the Province of Quebec; but that they did <lb/>
announce that their nationality was typified by <lb/>
the French flag, the Tricolor of France. That <lb/>
that language was uttered at a great meeting of <lb/>
their fellow-countrymen, that that language was <lb/>
uttered by the Premier of Quebec in the presence <lb/>
of the leader of the Opposition in this House, <lb/>
without demur, without contradiction, without <lb/>
remonstrance, and without reproach, goes without <lb/>
saying. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. Would the hon. gentleman <lb/>
permit me to interrupt him? On the occasion to <lb/>
which he alludes I spoke after Mr. Mercier, and I <lb/>
spoke afterwards in Toronto, quoting word for word <lb/>
the language I had used in Quebec. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. The hon. gentleman is <lb/>
perfectly right, and yet my statement remains <lb/>
uncontradicted. The hon. gentleman did speak <lb/>
in honeyed words, first of his love for his own <lb/>
nationality, and secondly of his love for the other <lb/>
nationalities of the Dominion. What I am com<lb break="no"/>plaining of is this: if that was not the view of the <lb/>
hon. gentleman, then and there, before the thou<lb break="no"/>sands who were assembled, before the great body <lb/>
of his fellow-countrymen, was the time for prompt <lb/>
repudiation and not here. But no repudiation <lb/>
came. Is it possible under these conditions for us <lb/>
to stand still? Have we no other evidence of the <lb/>
aspirations of the hon. gentleman's party, because <lb/>
he is reaping the benefit of that party, that party <lb/>
which is is strength in the Province of Quebec? <lb/>
It is only a few days ago, certainly only a few <lb/>
weeks ago, since the hon. gentleman wrote an <lb/>

<cb/>

open letter calling upon his people, notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing the rebellion of the old Liberal Party of which <lb/>
he was at one time a member, when they rebelled <lb/>
against this new proposed national cry of the Pre<lb break="no"/>mier of the Province of Quebec; the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man instead of joining with his own confr√®res, <lb/>
wrote to the constituency or a prominent member <lb/>
in it, urging their support to the new party formed <lb/>
by the Premier of Quebec. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. Against the Tories. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. He had been a Tory or a <lb/>
Bleu, and he became a convert to the Nationalist <lb/>
cry and went over to the Nationalist Party against <lb/>
the reinonstrances of the old Liberal Party of the <lb/>
Province. The hon. gentleman thought fit to <lb/>
interpose and interfere. Is that all? When the <lb/>
hon. gentleman joined in the agitation with res<lb break="no"/>pect to Riel, I wonder did he ever think that he <lb/>
would be denouncing a member of this House for <lb/>
incendiarism? I wonder did he ever think he <lb/>
would be denouncing a brother member for raising <lb/>
a cry and appealing to the passions of the people? <lb/>
Does the hon. gentleman remember his course <lb/>
upon that occasion? Sir, does he remember that <lb/>
when Riel, after a fair trial, after being ably <lb/>
defended and impartially tried, was justly exe<lb break="no"/>cuted. <lb/></p>

hon. member for West Durham (Mr. Blake) who <lb/>
sits here for western Ontario ‚Äî influenced by <lb/>
purely patriotic considerations for the good of the <lb/>
country‚Äîthis extraordinary language was used by <lb/>
the present leader of the Opposition at that excited <lb/>
time, when a statesman would have naturally used a <lb/>
language tending to quiet and subdue the disturbed <lb/>
passions of the multitude. And what were the <lb/>
words? <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"If he (Laurier) had been on the banks of the Saskat<lb break="no"/>chewan when the rebellion broke out, he would have <lb/>
taken up arms against the Government." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>He further said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"It must be well understood by all that this was not a <lb/>
war of races, but rather a vindication of the rights of one <lb/>
race that claimed for the French that which is granted to <lb/>
all other nationalities. The crime of Regina would still be <lb/>
avenged, not only by the French, but by all other races. <lb/>
They were asking for no favor, but they only wanted <lb/>
common justice pure and Simple. They were as jealous <lb/>
of the liberties of others as of their own; and if injustice <lb/>
was done one class, injustice might be done to others." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>He further said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"They cannot bring Riel back to life, but by patrio<lb break="no"/>tically uniting together they can drive from power the <lb/>
wretches who had so pitilessly put him to death." * * <lb/></p> 

<p>"Sir John had not had the courage of dealing leniently <lb/>
by a man who represented a cause which he had not <lb/>
treated fairly and justly." * * * <lb/></p> 

<p>"This was a free country and not even the Government <lb/>
had the right of committing judicial murder." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>This was the language of the hon. gentleman, who <lb/>
has had the hardihood to speak of my moderate <lb/>
terms as being calculated to arouse angry passions, <lb/>
race difficulties and troubles. Does the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman repent of those words? No. His benches <lb/>
are filled by his fellow-countrymen by reason of <lb/>
those words, and although some of them sit there <lb/>
to-day not following or supporting him, it is simply <lb/>
by reason of the accident that he did not secure a <lb/>
majority. The hon. gentleman profits by that <lb/>
language, and he has no reason to regret it. We <lb/>
recognize that by means of this cry the then <lb/>

Government of the Province of Quebec, the best <lb/>
Government the Province has had since Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation was ejected from office. Why? Because they <lb/>
declined to vote censure upon the Administration <lb/>
at Ottawa. Mr. Mercier, taking advantage of the <lb/>
excited feeling of the Province, gathered together <lb/>
the Nationalist Party, nationalist in the narrow <lb/>
sense to which I have referred, and, joining hands <lb/>
with the hon. gentleman here, brought about a <lb/>
result which deprived this House of many suppor<lb break="no"/>ters from the French Province for hon. gentlemen <lb/>
on this side of the House, and brought strength to <lb/>
hon. gentlemen opposite. People might not con<lb break="no"/>sider the words of politicians of such serious <lb/>
moment, but we cannot disregard what we see <lb/>
going on before our eyes. The other day a young <lb/>
lady, Miss Maybee, was sent down to the Post <lb/>
Office Department in Quebec. She had the misfor<lb break="no"/>tune to speak English and to come from Ontario; <lb/>
and will it be believed, and yet we know it perfectly <lb/>
well to be the case, that those supporting the hon. <lb/>
gentleman opposite at once denounced the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the Postmaster General for making the <lb/>
appointment. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. And the Ministerial papers, <lb/>
too. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. I am astounded at it. I <lb/>
did not think that matters had gone to that length; <lb/>
I have not seen the references, and I will be <lb/>
delighted if the hon. gentleman will furnish them <lb/>
to me. So it now happens, if the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
statement is correct, and he would not make a <lb/>
statement if it was not correct, that both French <lb/>

it. I repeat that they object to an English lady <lb/>

them. The howl was raised, and it was successful <lb/>
I am sorry to say. I am sorry to know that the <lb/>
old politeness of the French race seems to have <lb/>
departed, for I thought a young lady would have <lb/>

<p>I can assure the hon. gentleman that if a <lb/>
young lady is sent to Ontario or Toronto she will <lb/>
not be denounced in the public press, but she will <lb/>
be received with kindness, courtesy and considera<lb break="no"/>tion. Another article follows, which I need not <lb/>
trouble the House by reading. That is another <lb/>
result of these race troubles and race difficulties. <lb/>
But it is not the most serious in my humble judg<lb break="no"/>ment that we have to deal with. I find in a French <lb/>
publication of recent date, M. Tardivel, under the <lb/>
heading "Anglicism‚ÄîBehold the Enemy," writes: <lb/></p>

<cb/>
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Reflecting a little upon the situation I saw a great <lb/>
danger for the future of the French Canadian race. <lb/>
Language is the soul of a nation. If the Basques have <lb/>
been able so long to preserve intact their ancient institu<lb break="no"/>tions amidst the revolutions and the wars which have <lb/>
convulsed France and Spain; if the Bretons and the <lb/>
Welsh have remained distinct from the races which sur<lb break="no"/>round them, they have their language to thank for it. If <lb/>
Ireland struggles in vain to regain her independence, it <lb/>
is because she no longer speaks the language of her old <lb/>
kings. Do you wish to cause a people to disappear? <lb/>
Destroy its language. It is because they comprehend <lb/>
this truth that Russia shows herself so inexorable to<lb break="no"/>wards the Polish language, and that Germany seeks to <lb/>
prescribe the French language of Alsace-Lorraine. It <lb/>
is then important for a people, especially a conquered <lb/>
people, to preserve its language." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>The same writer again says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I stop here. I make no claim to have exhausted the <lb/>
subject, far from it. I have simply desired to utter this <lb/>
note of alarm; 'Fight the anglification of the French <lb/>
language,' and at the same time to we some proofs that <lb/>
this enemy is really to be feared. Let others with more <lb/>
authority than I possess continue the combat; and if one <lb/>
day those who love the French language decide to make a <lb/>
grand assault, all along the line, he assured that I shall <lb/>
not fail to respond to the appeal." <lb/></p>

</quote>
<p>I will not trouble the House with more extracts <lb/>
of this description, but I will draw the attention <lb/>
of my hon. friends on both sides to the instruction <lb/>
given in the French schools, and if there is then an <lb/>
hon. member who thinks that children so taught <lb/>
or instructed with regard to this history of our <lb/>
country can grow up as British citizens, or British <lb/>
subjects, or as loyal except to their own French <lb/>
Canadian nationality, or that anything can be <lb/>
    expected from them except the language of <hi rendition="simple:italic">La <lb/>
V√©rit√©</hi> and the language of the Premier of the <lb/>
Province of Quebec; then I think that hon. <lb/>

history I find the following: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"1774. England, fearful of losing Canada, in view of the <lb/>

</quote>
    <p>I think I have read of similar language in <hi rendition="simple:italic">La <lb/>
V√©rit√©</hi>. If this is the teaching of the schools, if <lb/>
these are the writings of the different writers, if <lb/>
this is the language of the Premier of the Province, <lb/>
if these are the utterances at the great public <lb/>
meetings held in that Province (and no man is bold <lb/>
enough to assert a single word of dissent to them) <lb/>
what possible outcome can there be except the <lb/>
natural outcome which is here announced on the <lb/>
floor of Parliament. If my ears did not deceive <lb/>
me I think I heard the Minister of Public Works <lb/>
speak of the autonomy of his race, and state <lb/>
that his nation would live in spite of <lb/>
all that might be done against it. We must <lb/>
remember that this has been a British colony for <lb/>
over a century and a quarter, and that within a <lb/>
very short period after the cession‚ÄîI was nearly <lb/>
using the unfortunate word conquest‚Äîa distin<lb break="no"/>guished French traveller passing through here was <lb/>
able to announce that the French Canadians were <lb/>
better treated under the English than they were un<lb break="no"/>der their own Kings. We must remember that from <lb/>
that time to this they have enjoyed a liberty which <lb/>
they could not possibly have enjoyed under the <lb/>
Crown of France yet; notwithstanding this, they <lb/>
are endeavoring to perpetuate this race and nation <lb/>
cry mainly by their language, which is the soul of <lb/>
the nation, as this writer says. If the language was <lb/>
permitted to die out, as it would naturally do, all <lb/>
this ambition, which must end in delusion, which <lb/>
can never end in anything but delusion and which <lb/>
can never lead to any accomplished fact, would soon <lb/>
disappear. We have no jealousy of the Germans, <lb/>
we have no jealousy of any other nationality,because <lb/>
we know that while they speak in their own tongue, <lb/>
and for years after they come here are not able to <lb/>
speak any other tongue, yet they do not propose to <lb/>
divide the people of this country by their race cries <lb/>
and race feelings. Now these are the problems we <lb/>
have to deal with. There is no use our going to <lb/>
Switzerland or to Austro-Hungary for examples. <lb/>
We have to deal with the question we have here at <lb/>
home; and the practical question is, whether, under <lb/>
these circumstances, we should permit this kind of <lb/>
thing to go on. Whatever I might do bye-and-<lb break="yes"/>by, no man is responsible for my acts. The <lb/>
gentlemen who vote with me now, and the <lb/>
gentlemen who disagree with me, are not respon<lb break="no"/>sible for what I may do bye-and‚Äîby. I may state‚Äî <lb/>
as these hon. gentlemen who have done me the <lb/>
honor of followin my utterances with so much <lb/>
care know well‚Äîthat I have never pretended to <lb/>
believe or to say that it was possible to deal with <lb/>
the dual language in the Province of Quebec. I <lb/>
realise that that is beyond the hope of being dealt <lb/>
with by any possible legislation. I realise that <lb/>
that has been allowed to grow into such monstrous <lb/>
proportions that we can never hope to cope with it, <lb/>
except by natural ways and by natural causes <lb/>
which possiblymay work a cure. Not in our day, but <lb/>
within perhaps a time that one can imagine, it may <lb/>
work out its own cure. I look forward to the <lb/>
assimilation that is going on by reason of the <lb/>
travelling backwards and forwards between the <lb/>
French Canadians of Quebec and the Eastern <lb/>
States of the Union. Do what you will, the people <lb/>
do go and will go to the Eastern States. Do what <lb/>
you will, they will more or less imbibe the language <lb/>

<cb/>

of that great country and disseminate it amon st <lb/>
those whom they have left behind. From t is <lb/>
side we are taking care that the Province of <lb/>
Ontario will maintain its character as an Eng<lb break="no"/>lish speaking Province. This process is going on, <lb/>
I have great hope, and it is a hope which <lb/>
does no injustice to my French Canadian fellow <lb/>
citizens, that bye-and-by the difficulty even <lb/>
in the Province of Quebec may vanish. So <lb/>
that I have never had the ambition, I have never <lb/>
dreamed of interfering. I do not say, Sir, that the <lb/>
time may not come when it will be proper to move‚Äî <lb/>
though in that I do not find much sympathy in this <lb/>
House‚Äîto do away with the dual language in this <lb/>
Chamber. The time has not come yet, that is quite <lb/>
certain. What we are dealing with now is this <lb/>
question in the North-West, and do not let us mix <lb/>
up questions that have nothing at all to do with it. <lb/>
One hon. gentleman said I had introduced even a <lb/>
religious cry. Why, Sir, is freedom of speech so <lb/>
gone in this country that I cannot express my dissent <lb/>
from the system of separate schools which exists in <lb/>
my own Province without being told that I am <lb/>
raising a religious cry? Is that a question of reli<lb break="no"/>gion? Is not that a question of great state policy <lb/>
as to how our children shall be educated? And I <lb/>
do hope that before very long the delegation from <lb/>
the Province of Ontario will call on this House for <lb/>
its aid to blot out the Separate School clause from the <lb/>
British North America Act, which limits and fetters <lb/>
the people of that Province. That clause was carried <lb/>
by a majority of French Canadians, and was imposed <lb/>
upon the people of Ontario against their will; and <lb/>
I am sorry to differ from my hon. leader on that <lb/>
question. He tells us ‚Äî aud I never feel more <lb/>
humiliated than when I hear him speak on that <lb/>
subject ‚Äî that he participated in imposing that <lb/>
Separate School system upon us. But is it <lb/>
possible that the free people of Ontario are not to be <lb/>
placed in the same position as the people by the <lb/>
sea on both sides of them, in the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and in British Columbia? If they could <lb/>
not ask this Parliament to aid in freeing them from <lb/>
the restrictions imposed upon them I would despair <lb/>
of the freedom of this country. But that has no<lb break="no"/>thing to do with this question. All these are aside <lb/>
from it, and will be properly dealt with when they <lb/>
come up and not before. What we are dealing <lb/>
with now is the question whether this Bill for the <lb/>
repeal of the duallanguage in the North-West should <lb/>
or should not become law; that and that only is the <lb/>
question before us. I am sorry, Sir, that the hon. <lb/>
member for West Durham (Mr. Blake) has been <lb/>
compelled by the unfortunate event to which he <lb/>
alluded to absent himself from this discussion. It <lb/>
is not pleasant to speak of an hon. gentleman be<lb break="no"/>hind his back, for I cannot quite accept the theory <lb/>
put forward by the hon. member for East Simcoe <lb/>
(Mr. Cook), that that gives one a better privilege <lb/>
to abuse a man; but, perhaps, I may be allowed to <lb/>
say a few words about that hon. gentleman's pro<lb break="no"/>position. You will remember, Sir, that he read <lb/>
us a lecture: he told us how we were not to dis<lb break="no"/>turb the harmony that at present existed; how we <lb/>
were to be careful of raising race cries; how he <lb/>
recognised that there was a mass of ignorance, <lb/>
prejudice and bigotry which only required the <lb/>
hand of an incendiary to inflame it, and he rather <lb/>
intimated that the hand of the incendiary had <lb/>
already been laid to that mass; and then he <lb/>
wound up with a fervent appeal that we should <lb/>

<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">868</fw> 

never interfere with the covenant, as he called it, <lb/>
made at the time of Confederation. I felt that if <lb/>
that hon. gentleman had not already surrendered <lb/>
to French influences of the Province of Quebec <lb/>
he made his capitulation the other night. But his <lb/>
most extraordinary statement was that we were not <lb/>
informed of the opinion of the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, that their representatives had no mandate <lb/>
from them to take up and deal with this question. <lb/>
Did that hon. gentleman remember that when in the <lb/>
Province of Ontario he agitated the country from end <lb/>
to end with regard to the murder of poor Thomas <lb/>
Scott, he sat in the Legislature of Ontario, where <lb/>
he had no mandate to deal with that question? <lb/>
Did the hon. gentleman remember that on one <lb/>
occasion he himself brought into this House a re<lb break="no"/>solution which was offensive to a great many of us <lb/>
with regard to the Irish question, in order that he <lb/>
mi ht secure the Irish section of our population <lb/>
an draw them to his standard, although he had <lb/>
no mandate, and although this House had no <lb/>
authority to speak with regard to Imperial con<lb break="no"/>cerns? Did that hon. gentleman remember that <lb/>
on another occasion he voted for, if he did not <lb/>
move, a resolution on the subject of the dis<lb break="no"/>establishment of the Irish Church? And yet <lb/>
he undertook to assert that the Legislature of <lb/>
the North-West had no right to petition this Par<lb break="no"/>liament. We had a right to pass offensive resolu<lb break="no"/>tions and send them home to England, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the rebuff we met with from the Imperial <lb/>
authorities; but the hon. gentleman ventured to <lb/>
assert that the representatives of the North-West <lb/>
had no right to petition or to express their wishes that <lb/>
this clause should be stricken out of the North-West <lb/>
Territories Act. I will say no more in the absence <lb/>
of that hon. gentleman. I now desire, before <lb/>
closing, to say a word or two on the merits of the <lb/>
various motions before the Chair. The amendment <lb/>
of the hon. member for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil) <lb/>
has received but little favor from any of the <lb/>
English-speaking members. It is one,I think, impos<lb break="no"/>sible of acceptance. It announces that if we repeal <lb/>
a clause in the North-West Act, put in under the <lb/>
extraordinary circumstances to which reference <lb/>
has been made, and allowed to remain because <lb/>
attention has not been drawn to it, we shall be <lb/>
shaking the stability of our institutions and des<lb break="no"/>troying the peace and progress of the North-West. <lb/>
The mere recital of that resolution carries its <lb/>
condemnation with it. The other amendment with <lb/>
which we have to deal, and which seems to find a <lb/>
good deal of favor, is the amendment of my hon. <lb/>
friend the member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin); <lb/>
and before I deal with that I have somewhat of an <lb/>
apology to make to that hon. gentleman and <lb/>
to this House. I am accused of interfering <lb/>
with the prerogatives of the members from <lb/>
the North-West. Surely, said the hon. Minister <lb/>
of Public Works, echoed by the hon. Secretary of <lb/>
State, there were members in this House repre<lb break="no"/>senting the North-West whose duty it was to <lb/>
bring this question to the attention of this <lb/>
chamber, and there was rather an insinuation <lb/>
thrown out by the hon. member for Assiniboia <lb/>
himself in his very opening words that my action <lb/>
was an intrusion on his domain; and, if you will <lb/>
pardon me saying so, the bitterness‚Äîbut that is <lb/>
too strong a word, for he could not be bitter if he <lb/>
tried, but the appearance of bitterness‚Äîwhich <lb/>
characterised his observation I thought had its <lb/>

<cb/>

origin somewhat in pique, that anyone except that <lb/>
hon. gentleman himself should venture to deal <lb/>
with questions affecting the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West. He and he alone is the guardian of their <lb/>
interests, the only member who has a right to <lb/>
speak on their behalf, and any one else who at<lb break="no"/>tempts to do so must expect to meet with the <lb/>
castigation administered to me in the opening of <lb/>
this debate. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I said you had a right. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Yes; but the very observa<lb break="no"/>tion rather suggested an apology from me. This <lb/>
is my excuse, and the only excuse I give‚ÄîI am <lb/>
    reading from the Qu'Appelle <hi rendition="simple:italic">Progress</hi> of 7th Feb<lb break="no"/>ruary inst.:‚Äî <lb/></p>

</quote>
<p>That is not the way my feeble efforts were charac<lb break="no"/>terised in this House; but that seems to be the <lb/>
opinion of the outside world, at all events. <lb/></p>

constituents should call upon them to resign forthwith. <lb/>
We are also informed that Mr. N. F. Davin will speak <lb/>
against it. West Assiniboia is about the best mis-repre<lb break="no"/>sented constituency in the North-West. This country is <lb/>
almost unanimous in favor of Mr. McCarthy's Bill, but its <lb/>

represent the machine in preference to the country." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>That, Mr. Speaker, is my apology for venturing to <lb/>
introduce this point to the notice of the House. <lb/>
Now, with regard to the amendment of that hon. <lb/>
gentleman: what is it? My motion is that the Bill <lb/>
be read the second time. Great fault is found with <lb/>
the preamble. The preamble is worse than the <lb/>
enacting clause; the enacting clause is harmless <lb/>
and the preamble is something fearful. Well, to <lb/>
the laymen of the House, perhaps, explanations are <lb/>
necessary about the preamble. To the lawyers of <lb/>
the House an explanation is not called for. It is <lb/>
quite certain, as every lawyer in this House knows, <lb/>
that the preamble neither adds to nor takes from <lb/>
the effect of the enacting clause. The preamble, in <lb/>
this case, I quite admit, was unnecessary. While I <lb/>
do not at all withdraw from the sentiment con<lb break="no"/>tained in that preamble, yet as an effective piece of <lb/>
legislation I am free to admit the Bill would be <lb/>
perfectly as good without as with the preamble. <lb/>
Now, if the hon. gentlemen in this House are <lb/>
sincere, and I am bound to believe in their <lb/>
sincerity; if they desire that this dual clause <lb/>
should be expunged or repealed‚Äîthe hon. member <lb/>
for West Durham thought "expunge" was a very <lb/>
improper word to use; one has to be very careful <lb/>
of his language and must not use words, no matter <lb/>
how plain they may be, except with the greatest <lb/>
care‚Äî well, I will call it repeal, or anything you <lb/>
will. But, I say, if hon. gentlemen are sincere in <lb/>
their desire to repeal this clause, the way to do <lb/>
that is to pass the Bill to the second reading, and <lb/>
those who are opposed to the preamble can then <lb/>
have it struck out. The preamble of a private Bill <lb/>
is the all-essential portion; if the preamble be not <lb/>
carried, the Bill does not pass. The preamble of a <lb/>
public Bill is wholly unessential; its only possible <lb/>
use can be to make an ambiguous portion of the <lb/>
enacting clause plain, if ambiguity there be; and I <lb/>
say here that While I do not withdraw from that <lb/>

<pb n="869" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00869.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">869</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 18, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">870</fw>

preamble, while I think the statement in it is per<lb break="no"/>fectly true, namely: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Whereas it is expedient in the interest of the national <lb/>
unity of the Dominion that there should be community <lb/>
of language among the people of Canada." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Who will say nay to that? It may not be abso<lb break="no"/>lutely essential; that is not the proposition. I <lb/>
say, it is expedient, and every gentleman who has <lb/>
spoken on this question has admitted its expedi<lb break="no"/>ency. Even the hon. member for West Durham <lb/>
said that if we were all of one race and one <lb/>
nationality, speaking one tongue, the task before <lb/>
us would be simpler and easier, and, therefore, the <lb/>
proposition before us is not incorrect and un<lb break="no"/>founded. But to any hon. gentleman who objects <lb/>
to it, all I can say is, when the Bill goes to Com<lb break="no"/>mittee, should it pass the second reading, let him <lb/>
object to the preamble, and I shall be the first to <lb/>
withdraw it. I want the body of the Bill, and do <lb/>
not care for the preamble, and if there be a member <lb/>
of this House who desires the Bill and objects to the <lb/>
preamble, there shall be no opposition, as far as I <lb/>
am concerned, to this preamble being obliterated, <lb/>
or expunged, to use any term you please. I will <lb/>
say more. I did not in the least dream that the <lb/>
words should be taken up in an offensive sense, <lb/>
and I can only most heartily express my regret <lb/>
that any of my French Canadian friends should be <lb/>
offended by this clause in the Bill, or that I should <lb/>
have hurt the sentiments of French speaking mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House, or the French Canadians <lb/>
throughout the country‚Äîfor such was far from my <lb/>
intention. But what was the proposition of the <lb/>
hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin)? <lb/>
It was that the Bill be not now read a second <lb/>
time. That is, he does not want the dual language <lb/>
expunged, nor does he want to give the power to <lb/>
the North-West Territories to expunge it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I do. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. Then the hon. gentleman <lb/>
has not taken the proper course. If he wanted <lb/>
that, his proper course was to let the Bill be <lb/>
read a second time, and to move into Committee <lb/>
that clause 1 be struck out and the words of his <lb/>
amendment inserted in its stead: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"That the said Bill be not now read a second time, but <lb/>
that it be resolved,‚ÄîThat it is expedient that the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Assembly of the North-West Territories be authorised <lb/>
to deal with the subject‚Äîmatter of this Bill by Ordinance <lb/>
or enactment after the next general election for the said <lb/>
Territories." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>But the effect of the hon. gentleman's amendment <lb/>
is to kill the Bill. Make no mistake about it. If <lb/>
the Bill is not read a second time, there it stops. <lb/>
Then what takes place? Hon. gentlemen say they <lb/>
want to repeal the dual language clause, but they <lb/>
want to do that with as much gentleness and con<lb break="no"/>sideration for the feelings and susceptibilities of <lb/>
the French-speaking people as possible. Then, the <lb/>
way to do that is to pass the Bill, rejecting the <lb/>
preamble, and inserting the clause of the hon. <lb/>
member for West Assiniboia as the substantial <lb/>
part of the Bill. But if you say that the Bill do <lb/>
not pass, but that it be resolved, &amp;c., and make that <lb/>
resolution as long as you please, what follows? <lb/>
Who is to move? The Government cannot move, for <lb/>
they are at sixes and sevens on this subject. There <lb/>
is the resolution. I certainly would not move it, <lb/>
as I do not approve of it. The hon. member for <lb/>
Assiniboia would not move it, because he would <lb/>
offend the powers that be. <lb/></p> 


<cb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I would move it if necessary. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. Does the hon. gentleman <lb/>
doubt the necessity? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. No. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. Then I think the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman would have to move, and instead of being <lb/>
the admired of all his surroundings, he will oc<lb break="no"/>cupy the position I do. He will be belated and <lb/>
berated, and will fall from the highest stage or <lb/>
pinnacle of greatness which he has occupied for <lb/>
the last few days. Do not now rush in where angels <lb/>
fear to tread; and I do not think the hon. gentleman <lb/>
will make any such mistake. Why, let us not <lb/>
deal with this subject in a simple way. Punish <lb/>
me if you will; expel me if you please; because I <lb/>
venture to put in this preamble, and to speak at <lb/>
the Opera House, and because I ventured to claim <lb/>
that the English language should rule in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, but pass the Bill. The way to pass the Bill <lb/>
is to go to a second reading and then to expunge <lb/>
what is in the preamble. Do not pas the Bill, if it <lb/>
suits your pleasure, but vote the amendment of the <lb/>
hon. member for Berthier. That is honest and <lb/>
straightforward, and that, at all events, we can <lb/>
understand. We can understand the views and <lb/>
the policy of the hon. gentlemen who are absolutely <lb/>
opposed to any change. But hon. gentlemen who <lb/>
wish to get rid of this question by a side issue, who <lb/>
try to do and not to do it, will not, although they <lb/>
may deceive this country. That they may depend <lb/>
upon. I listened to the argument of the hon. <lb/>
member for Kent (Mr. Landry), and I listened to <lb/>
the argument of my hon. friend from Rouville (Mr. <lb/>
Gigault), and no more straightforward or honor<lb break="no"/>able statement of the case was given on that side of <lb/>
the House. It contrasted greatly with the state<lb break="no"/>ment from the Treasury benches of its compatriots <lb/>
from Quebec; it was arguments, not abuse. It <lb/>
was a reason for us to pause in our course, and <lb/>
was not simply denunciation of those who differ <lb/>
from the views which those hon. gentlemen both <lb/>
take. But I say their view is the correct view. It <lb/>
is this Parliament, and it is this Parliament alone, <lb/>
which has the power to deal with this question. It <lb/>
is this Parliament which put that clause in, unin<lb break="no"/>vited. It is this Parliament which has the <lb/>
authority to take that clause out. Why should <lb/>
we abnegate our duties or our functions on <lb/>
the ground of expediency or to get rid of a tempor<lb break="no"/>ary difficulty? Will we, in the interest of our <lb/>
country, be doing a service? Will we not be <lb/>
keeping open that running sore of which the <lb/>
hon. gentleman from South Oxford (Sir Richard <lb/>
Cartwright) spoke? We put the trouble on the <lb/>
people of the North‚ÄîWest, but, although we should <lb/>
denude ourselves of our authority and endeavor to <lb/>
get rid of this question for the moment, it will <lb/>
remain a burning question in old Canada and in the <lb/>
new Provinces, more especially, if on postpone <lb/>
the decision of this question until after the next <lb/>
general elections. I am commissioned to read the <lb/>
opinion of a senator who once occupied a seat in <lb/>
this House, and whose voice is now unable to be <lb/>
heard here. <lb/></p>

Particulary might this be the ease in those constituencies <lb/>
where it was stated by Mr. Bits, member of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Assembly, that so few of the people could read in <lb/>
any language and their prejudices so easily excited. I <lb/>
contend it is wrong to submit a question of such a cha<lb break="no"/>racter to the vote of the people. Discussion and election<lb break="no"/>eering talk on such an issue would tend to disturb the <lb/>
harmony and good-feeling that is fast being obtained <lb/>
between the people of different nationalities and creeds <lb/>
1n the North-West Territories. I write this advisedly and <lb/>
with the full knowledge of the responsibility of a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of the people in the North-West Territories <lb/>
from end to end. <lb/></p>

<p>Is not that reasonable? Is it reasonable, when we <lb/>
have this matter before us now‚Äîa matter which <lb/>
has excited, we are told, a great deal of feeling in <lb/>
this chamber, a matter which has excited at good <lb/>
deal of feeling out of doors, having opinions formed <lb/>
one way or the other about it, having a means of <lb/>
knowledge denied to the representatives of the <lb/>
North-West Territories, we, who have this great <lb/>
duty thrown upon us here, should refuse to dis<lb break="no"/>charge it and ask the unfortunate people of the <lb/>
North-West to have this bone of contention thrown <lb/>
upon them. That may be right from a party point <lb/>
of view; I venture to say it is not right from a <lb/>
statesman's point of view. This Bill may be wrong, <lb/>
it may be that the Bill ought to be rejected, but <lb/>
there can be no justification for sending it to the <lb/>
people of the North-West to be dealt with. I deny <lb/>
that I have gone back upon any views that I have <lb/>
advocated in regard to provincial rights. If the <lb/>
people of the North-West did not wish to have <lb/>
this measure passed, we might postpone it at the <lb/>
present time, but the people have shown that they <lb/>
are in favor of it, and every newspaper in the <lb/>
    North-West‚Äîexcepting always the Regina <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> <lb/>
‚Äîhas spoken infavor 0f the abolition of the dual <lb/>
    language. I cannot look upon the Regina <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> <lb/>
as an authoritative representative of public opinion <lb/>
in the North-West. We know that the Re ina <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> occupies a peculiar position in regard to <lb/>
the existing state of affairs in the North-West. I <lb/>
am told‚ÄîI may be wrong‚ÄîI do not connect it <lb/>
with any hon. member of this House, but I <lb/>
am told that it was owing to the fact that the <lb/>
Lieutenant Governor of the North-West insisted <lb/>
    upon giving to the Regina <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> the printing of <lb/>
that Government at a higher rate than it could be <lb/>
done for elsewhere, that the deadlock was brought <lb/>
about in the North-West Council, that the Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant Governor's advisers refused to agree to <lb/>
that, and then resigned. Of course, the longer the <lb/>
dual language is preserved, the better it is for the <lb/>
    publisher of the Regina <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi>, and, therefore, I do <lb/>
    not think that the Regina <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> is to be quoted <lb/>
as an authority on this question. Putting the <lb/>
    Regina <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> aside, we have the unanimous opin<lb break="no"/>ion of the press of the North-West, as we have the <lb/>
opinion of the people of the North-West, that they <lb/>
do not want the dual language. Why should we <lb/>
pause? Why should we hesitate? I have done. <lb/>
I have endeavored to make my case as plain as I <lb/>
possibly can. I have endeavored to show why this <lb/>
question should be dealt with at the earliest pos<lb break="no"/>sible moment. I have endeavored to show that it <lb/>
ought to be dealt with here. I have endeavored <lb/>
to show that, if this resolution which has <lb/>
been moved by the hon. member for West <lb/>

<cb/>

Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) is passed, that is the end of <lb/>
the Bill, but the end is not accomplished. I have <lb/>
stated that I am prepared, if any hon. gentleman <lb/>
objects to the recital in this Bill, that it shall be <lb/>
stricken out, and every hon. gentleman in this <lb/>
House knows that, when the Bill reaches committee, <lb/>
it can then be debated whether it is for us here or <lb/>
for the North-West to deal with this question; but, <lb/>
if the amendment of the hon. gentleman is carried, <lb/>
it is away to do this little Bill to death, instead of <lb/>
its becoming the law of the land, which is the <lb/>
desire of the people in the North-West who have <lb/>
taken an interest in this matter, and I am sure is <lb/>
the desire of the great majority of the people of the <lb/>
country. The sooner this question is set at rest, <lb/>
the better. It is a question which is calculated to <lb/>
disturb us on a question of race cleavage. That <lb/>
alone should be a reason for dealing with the <lb/>
matter now. Does the House suppose that, if the <lb/>
Bill is defeated, whether upon the amendment of <lb/>
the hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. <lb/>
Davin) or upon the amendment of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil), that would in <lb/>
any way end the question? Can any one imagine <lb/>
that, if I stand alone with my seconder in voting for <lb/>
this Bill, the same difficulties and troubles which <lb/>
certain hon. gentlemen profess to lament will not be <lb/>
brought up again? Is it not in the interest of the <lb/>
harmony and the good-will of the people of differ<lb break="no"/>ent nationalities that we should deal with this ques<lb break="no"/>tion here, this question which is now before us, <lb/>
and do they not suppose that we can deal with it <lb/>
in such a manner as to be as satisfactory to the <lb/>
people as if it were dealt with by the Council of <lb/>
the North-West? For myself, I may say that my <lb/>
political extinction has been prophesied by hon. <lb/>
gentlemen on both sides of the House. If that be <lb/>
my fate, in doing what I consider to be my duty, <lb/>
I shall cheerfully submit to it. I am acting simply <lb/>
according to my convictions, and not only as one <lb/>
hon. gentleman has suggested, because of the <lb/>
debate of the Jesuits' Estates Act. I wonder that <lb/>
that hon. gentleman should not have had better <lb/>
judgment than to introduce that question into <lb/>
this debate. I have nothing to be ashamed of, I <lb/>
have nothing to lament in regard to the vote <lb/>
which I gave on the Jesuits' Estates Act. I did <lb/>
not prosecute any agitation on that subject after<lb break="no"/>wards, because I realised that the vote of this <lb/>
House in regard to it was conclusive; but it is not <lb/>
conducive to harmony in the party to which I did <lb/>
belong and to which, to a certain extent, I still <lb/>
belong, that an hon. gentleman should taunt me <lb/>
for the fiasco which he says was the end of <lb/>
that matter. I have been taunted with the <lb/>
statement that I objected to the preamble of <lb/>
the Jesuits' Estates Act, and yet I was <lb/>
making nothing of the preamble to this Bill. <lb/>
There again the two matters are wholly and ab<lb break="no"/>solutely separate. In the Jesuits' Estates Act we <lb/>
had to take the Bill as it was, we had no power of <lb/>
amendment. It came to this House and it had <lb/>
either to be vetoed as it was, or allowed to go into <lb/>
operation as it was; whereas a Bill introduced in<lb break="no"/>to this House has to undergo the gauntlet of the <lb/>
first, second and third reings, of a consideration <lb/>
in committee, to be amended and improved to suit <lb/>
the opinions of the majority of the House. There<lb break="no"/>fore, there is nothing in common between the two <lb/>
cases. But, as I said before, those who voted with <lb/>
me on that question had nothing to regret, and I <lb/>

can only say that if a similar occasion arose again, <lb/>
I should not hesitate to repeat my vote. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I wish to trouble the House for a <lb/>
few minutes, while I make one or two remarks; <lb/>
called for, I think, by the speech of my hon. and <lb/>
learned friend. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER</persName>. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has already spoken. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I have not spoken on this amend<lb break="no"/>ment. Now, Sir, the hon. and learned gentleman <lb/>
read to us the authority of Senator Perley. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I rise to a question of order. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman has spoken already on this <lb/>
question, and I ask the ruling of the Chair. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER</persName>. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man can speak upon the amendment. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I am glad my hon. friend from <lb/>
North Norfolk, whom I have met on other fields, <lb/>
is so anxious to observe the rules of the House and <lb/>
the decencies of debate. The hon. and learned <lb/>
gentleman, for he is entitled to be called the hon. <lb/>
and learned gentleman, has read to us a letter <lb/>
from Senator Perley. The hon. Senator has been <lb/>
a member of this Parliament; I have known <lb/>
him a long time; some of you have known <lb/>
him, and I need not say that I recognise him, <lb/>
as you do, as a great authority, this "guide, <lb/>
philosopher and friend" of the hon. and learned <lb/>
member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). He appears <lb/>
in a character eminently suitable to himself, <lb/>
to his own views of what his duty to the public <lb/>
is, and I think he is eminently suitable as a <lb/>
guide to the hon. member from Simcoe. Sir, <lb/>
Senator Perley and the hon. member for Simcoe; <lb/>
the hon. member for Simcoe and Senator Perley. <lb/>
You will remember the line of Pope: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"And dunce the second follows dunce the first." <lb/></p>
    </quote>
    <p>
Now, I did not know the cause of the conversion <lb/>
of my hon. and learned friend from Simcoe. I had <lb/>
read a speech delivered by the hon. and learned <lb/>
member at Collingwood; I have it before me; it is <lb/>
        reported in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Empire</hi>, and in this speech he de<lb break="no"/>clares to the people of Collingwood that he did not <lb/>
want this Parliament to deal with this question, <lb/>
but he wanted the people of the North-West to deal <lb/>
with it, the very thing that he denounces to-night. <lb/>
I will read to you his words: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I want it understood that our great North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories shall be left free to deal with certain matters <lb/>
which will affect them for all time to come." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>He is speaking of the dual language. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Will the hon. member par<lb break="no"/>don me? I am sure he does not wish to misrepre<lb break="no"/>sent me. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. Certainly not. Here is the paper. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. The paper is perfectly cor<lb break="no"/>rect, so far as it geos. My reference was to the <lb/>
question of separate schools in the North-West. <lb/>
I had already spoken about the dual language and <lb/>
my action in this House, and I was inviting the <lb/>
confidence of my constituents. I was then refer<lb break="no"/>ring to the question of separate schools, which I <lb/>
understand they petitionned should not be dealt <lb/>
with here, but should be remitted to them to be <lb/>
dealt with. That is what I alluded to in the lan<lb break="no"/>guage my hon. friend is now reading. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. Well, separate schools are a <lb/>
matter that can beleft to the North-West, but the <lb/>

<cb/>

dual language cannot be left to the North-West; <lb/>
so I suppose he thinks the dual language is a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of more importance than the separate schools. <lb/>
Now, I want to point out the want of logic of my <lb/>
hon. friend. He comes here and tells us that we <lb/>
ought to pass his Bill. Why? Because he has <lb/>
heard from the North-West. Why has he heard <lb/>
from the North-West? Because an assembly has <lb/>
been elected on an extended suffrage, and that' <lb/>
assembly has passed a resolution in a given direc<lb break="no"/>tion. Why is that resolution of the least validity? <lb/>
Simply because these people represent the people <lb/>
of the North-West, and yet, forsooth, he tells us <lb/>
that the proposal to go to the source of power, to <lb/>
the source of authority, is a proposal that we ought <lb/>
not to entertain. He is just as illogical as the <lb/>
hon. and learned gentleman from West Dur<lb break="no"/>ham (Mr. Blake) in his remarks the other night. <lb/>
I was delighted, of course, to hear his voice again <lb/>
in this House. I know very well of what import<lb break="no"/>ance it is to this House, and of what importance it <lb/>
is to the country at large, that we should have <lb/>
his great experience, his legal knowledge and his <lb/>
great parliamentary power; but when I heard a <lb/>
man who is president of a university, talk what <lb/>
‚ÄîI say it without the least offence‚Äîwas fallacious <lb/>
trash, I was perfectly amazed. Let me point out <lb/>
to you what the hon. and learned gentleman said. <lb/>
He said that he could not listen to the represent<lb break="no"/>ation that was made‚ÄîI am now making a point <lb/>
for the hon. and learned gentleman for Simcoe‚Äî <lb/>
that no message whatever had come from the <lb/>
people of the North-West. Why? Because this <lb/>
assembly had not got any authority from its creator <lb/>
to deal with this question. By dealing with this <lb/>
question he must mean to legislate on it; so he <lb/>
says that we cannot receive any representation <lb/>
from them because they had no power to legislate <lb/>
on it; but if they had any power to legislate on it, <lb/>
they would not require to make any representation <lb/>
at all. The point was taken up very properly by <lb/>
my hon. and learned friend that it was only <lb/>
three short years before that we heard the <lb/>
hon. and learned member for West Durham <lb/>
propose in this House a resolution with regard <lb/>
to Home Rule of which we were not in any <lb/>
wise seized; yet he asked us to pass a resolution, <lb/>
and showed that he thought our representation <lb/>
ought to have some effect, or might have some <lb/>
effect, on an assembly so closely connected <lb/>
with us as the assembly in the North-West. Now, <lb/>
I want to refer to a personal matter. I saw a criti<lb break="no"/>cism‚ÄîI do not know whether it was correct or not <lb/>
‚Äîon a few remarks that I happened to make in <lb/>
reply to the speech of the hon. and learned member <lb/>
for Simcoe; and the critic said‚ÄîI do not know <lb/>
whether that is correct or not, but I hope it was <lb/>
correct‚Äîhe said that the weapons I used against <lb/>
the hon. and learned gentleman were the weapons <lb/>
of a gentleman. The hon. and learned gentleman <lb/>
comes here with an innuendo that is absolutely <lb/>
false, for which there is not atittle of foundation. He <lb/>
has listened‚ÄîI do not know where, I am sure‚Äîpro<lb break="no"/>bably in the vestibule of an hotel, to the gospel of <lb/>
    some <hi rendition="simple:italic">gobe mouche</hi>, and he comes here and makes a <lb/>
statement about a matter which has no truth what<lb break="no"/>ever in it. Now he says that a paper called the <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> never advocated the abolition of the dual <lb/>
language. Why, I read the other night how the hon. <lb/>
and learned gentleman made a statement that that <lb/>
paper never referred to it. I then read an article <lb/>

<pb n="875" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00875.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">875</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">876</fw> 

<choice><sic>rom</sic><corr>from</corr></choice> that paper advocating the doing away with it, <lb/>
but without bitterness; it deprecated bitterness, it <lb/>
deprecated language that was calculated to inflame <lb/>
passions, and said, let us go and discuss this <lb/>
question calmly and practically. I may tell <lb/>
the hon. and learned member, who threw out <lb/>
the sneer, that it was a very good thing for <lb/>
newspapers, and the more French published <lb/>
the better, that most of the ordinances which <lb/>
were printed in French were not printed in the <lb/>
    North-West, and that the company which pu<lb break="no"/>blishes the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> had no advantage from <lb/>
most of them. A few were printed there, but <lb/>
the great bulk were printed somewhere else. <lb/>
So the hon. and learned member, who occupies a <lb/>
high position in his profession, a profession to <lb/>
which gentlemen of the highest honor have been <lb/>
proud to belong, comes here and at the close of his <lb/>
speech throws out a sneer without the slightest <lb/>
foundation, and it was a vulgar sneer, even if there <lb/>
had been any foundation for it. I do not intend <lb/>
to make any reply to the hon. gentleman's speech, <lb/>
and I merely rose in regard to these matters <lb/>
to which I have alluded, but I want to point out that <lb/>
in the speech towhich we have listened the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has not touched the case I made against him; <lb/>
he has not touched a single point of it and it remains <lb/>
there unshaken. I showed that the hon. and learned <lb/>
gentleman had cited authorities that proved the <lb/>
very reverse of that which he said those authori<lb break="no"/>ties would prove, and I also showed that he <lb/>
came before the House and laid down two <lb/>
propositions that were utterly false. Switzerland <lb/>
has been referred to by one hon. gentleman after <lb/>
another. Hon. gentlemen do not seem to have <lb/>
seen the point of my reference to Switzerland. My <lb/>
sole object was to show that the two propositions <lb/>
which the hon. and learned gentleman was <choice><sic>dis<lb break="no"/>eminating</sic><corr>disseminating</corr></choice> throughout the country were without <lb/>
any foundations, namely, that a single language <lb/>
necessarily made a nation, and that with diver<lb break="no"/>sity of languages you could not have a nation; for, <lb/>
of course, if these two propositions were true, then <lb/>
we never could have a nation here in Canada. I <lb/>
showed those propositions were untrue. I showed <lb/>
that his authorities instead of supporting his case <lb/>
proved the contrary, and the statements I made <lb/>
in that little speech remain unshaken, and the <lb/>
hon. gentleman has not attempted to reply to <lb/>
them. The only thing he did in the way of <lb/>
attempting to reply to my speech was to descend <lb/>
to sneers without foundation, to innuendoes <lb/>
that in an Assembly far inferior to this would be <lb/>
held to be unworthy, and he fell back on a flippant <lb/>
reference what was without any cogency whatever. <lb/>
The hon. and learned gentleman told us, and <lb/>
I heard it with some astonishment, that he had no <lb/>
desire to create bitterness, that he had no ill-feeling <lb/>
to the French race. This reminds me of what <lb/>
Thackeray said of an Englishman: that if an <lb/>
Englishman sees a stranger come into the country <lb/>
he looks at him as who should say: "Damn you, <lb/>
who are you?" Yet that Englishman might no doubt <lb/>
feel an universal benevolence. The hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) talks here as <lb/>
if he felt universal benevolence towards every <lb/>
citizen of this country, whether he talks French or <lb/>
not; but you have to observe the general tenor of <lb/>
his conduct and of this agitation, and the face may <lb/>
be Jacob's but the hands are the hands of Esau. <lb/>
The statement made in that letter of Senator <lb/>

<cb/>

Perley, that there would be a disturbance in case <lb/>
this question were referred to the constituencies, <lb/>
is absolutely without the least foundation. There <lb/>
will be no disturbance whatever. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Alberta (Mr. Davis), if he is here, will tell <lb/>
you that the reference can be made without the <lb/>
least disturbance. Everything will go on as quietly <lb/>
as possible, and once the question has been referred <lb/>
to the people, and they have elected a new House, <lb/>
you can then feel you have given it to a tribunal <lb/>
to deal with that has authority from the real source <lb/>
of power. <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:THOM21">Sir JOHN THOMPSON</persName>. I am very much <lb/>
obliged to the hon. member for Northumberland, <lb/>
and I will endeavor to return the courtesy by <lb/>
making my observations so short as to leave ample <lb/>
opportunity for him to speak before the House is <lb/>
wearied of the debate to-night. Notwithstanding <lb/>
the great attention the House has given to this <lb/>
question, the fact that its discussion has occupied <lb/>
five days, and that wehave already reached midnight <lb/>
of the day preceding a statutory holiday, are rea<lb break="no"/>sons why, apart from the courtesy extended to me by <lb/>
the hon. member for Northumberland (Mr. Mitchell), <lb/>
I should detain the House for only a short while in <lb/>
offering the proposition which I am about to make <lb/>
in reference to the question under consideration. <lb/>
Before stating the view which I wish to present to <lb/>
the House as the decision which ought to be ar<lb break="no"/>rived at on this question, I may be permitted to <lb/>
make some observations with regard to certain <lb/>
arguments which have been put forward in defence <lb/>
of the preamble of this Bill. Some members have <lb/>
stated in the course of this debate that a different <lb/>
doctrine was laid down last Session in reference to <lb/>
another measure, from that which has been pro<lb break="no"/>nounced by those who have declared that the <lb/>
preamble of the Bill now before us is offensive to <lb/>
the good taste of the House and menaces the per<lb break="no"/>manency of institutions established by law. They <lb/>
have stated that that doctrine is inconsistent with <lb/>
the doctrine laid down last Session, which my hon. <lb/>
friend from Toronto (Mr. Cockburn), by mistake, <lb/>
asserted to be a statement that the preamble was <lb/>
no part of the Act and had nothing to do with <lb/>
it. No statement of that kind, as a general <lb/>

<cb/>

proposition, was put before the House last Session. <lb/>
When I had the honor to address the House in <lb/>
regard to the Bill, then under discussion, I was <lb/>
speaking on a set of facts which were then before <lb/>
the House. I was speaking not of preambles in <lb/>
general, but of the preamble to a statute which was <lb/>
under our consideration; I was calling the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the House to the fact that the part <lb/>
of that preamble to which most exception had <lb/>
been taken was merely the recital of a <lb/>
correspondence which had taken place, and <lb/>
had no immediate connection with the enact<lb break="no"/>ing part of the Bill. More than that, when we <lb/>
come to consider the position in which we are <lb/>
now placed with regard to the preamble of the <lb/>
present Bill with the position which the House <lb/>
occupied last Session, voting yea or nay, on a <lb/>
motion to disallow the Act of another Legislature, <lb/>
because there was something in the recital offensive <lb/>
to the good taste of the House, there is this funda<lb break="no"/>mental difference that, in voting for this Bill, we <lb/>
are not merely criticising the action of another <lb/>
Legislature, we are not criticising a preamble which <lb/>
might or might not have influenced the adoption <lb/>
of a statute in another Parliament, but we are now <lb/>
called on to vote, yea or nay, on this preamble which <lb/>
has been offered to us by the member for North <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). I submit, therefore, that <lb/>
the comments made by some members, in regard <lb/>
to our action of last Session are not founded on <lb/>
reasons which apply to the present case, and <lb/>
that the objection taken to this preamble is not <lb/>
inconsistent with the observations made last <lb/>
Session by myself, or by any other person, who <lb/>
then took the view I had the honor to express. In <lb/>
hurrying forward so as to detain the House only for <lb/>
as short a time as possible let me call attention to a <lb/>
subject from which attention has somewhat wan<lb break="no"/>dered in the course of this heated debate. Let me <lb/>
ask the calm consideration of the House to the very <lb/>
few points which are involved in the section of the <lb/>
North-West Territories Act which it is proposed <lb/>
to repeal. Section 110 provides, in relation to four <lb/>
subjects. First of all as to the debates of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Assembly of the North-West Territories, and <lb/>
the provision in respect of these debates is that <lb/>
either the French or English language may be used. <lb/>
In the second place the provision relates to the <lb/>
records and Journals in that Assembly, and it is <lb/>
that the French and English languages must both <lb/>
be used in the records and Journals. We have <lb/>
first of all the provision that the use of either of the <lb/>
two languages is optional as regards the debates <lb/>
and compulsory as regards the printing and record<lb break="no"/>ing in the Journals of that Assembly. But we <lb/>
have in the next branch of this subject two other <lb/>
questions, both of which were touched upon by the <lb/>
Secretary of State this afternoon, and both of <lb/>
which, in my humble opinion‚Äîand I shall ask the <lb/>
opinion of the House upon it‚Äîare of far greater <lb/>
importance, as regards this question of language <lb/>
than the mere question of what language shall be <lb/>
used in the debates of the Assembly or the records <lb/>
or Journals of that body. As my hon. friend the <lb/>
Secretary of State says, it is a matter of little con<lb break="no"/>sequence what rule is applied as to the mode <lb/>
in which the debates shall be conducted in <lb/>
the Assembly. If the population in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories of French origin and French <lb/>
speech is sufficiently numerous to send to that body <lb/>
intelligent and active men, capable of taking part <lb/>

in the proceedings of that body they will assert <lb/>
their rights to speak their own language, which will <lb/>
be recognised, at least in courtesy, as it is recognised <lb/>
in every other Province of Canada where it is <lb/>
claimed upon the ground that a representative <lb/>
should speak in the tongue which suits him best. I <lb/>
have seen that right conceded frequently in the <lb/>
legislature of my own Province where there is no <lb/>
legislative guarantee on the subject, and the man <lb/>
who would object to an Acadian in Nova Scotia <lb/>
speaking his own tongue in the Legislature of his own <lb/>
Province would he laughed to scorn, as unworthy <lb/>
to sit in that Assembly. We can safely leave <lb/>
that subject to the Assembly, which I am <lb/>
sure, will be guided by as patriotic a feeling <lb/>
as actuates the other legislative bodies in <lb/>
Canada. I shall ask the House, in the proposition <lb/>
I am about to make, to give to the Assembly, in <lb/>
due time, the power to regulate its own debates, and <lb/>
to say in what manner, in what tongue, or in what <lb/>
mode its records and its Journals may be published <lb/>
from time to time. There are two subjects which <lb/>
remain and which, as I have already mentioned, <lb/>
stand upon a somewhat different footing. When <lb/>
we undertake to say that we shall expunge <lb/>
from the Statute-book a provision that justice <lb/>
shall be administered, or may be administered, in <lb/>
either of the two languages used in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories, we are touching a subject far <lb/>
more important than the mere language of debate, <lb/>
and the mere language of the publication of the <lb/>
Journals of a legislative body. These, Sir, are our <lb/>
courts; these are the courts of the Dominion of <lb/>
Canada. In respect of the Provinces, power is given <lb/>
to the Provincial Legislatures, by the British North <lb/>
America Act, to establish the courts, and to regulate <lb/>
their organisation, their maintenance, and the ex<lb break="no"/>tent of their jurisdiction. That power which rests <lb/>
on them, as regards the Provincial courts, rests <lb/>
directly on this Parliament as regards the courts of <lb/>
the North-West Territories. We have imposed <lb/>
upon us the duty, not only of creating those courts, <lb/>
but of breathing into them the breath of life by <lb/>
giving them the jurisdiction they exercise and the <lb/>
procedure by which that jurisdiction is to be carried <lb/>
on. Nay, more, it is our duty, just as it is the <lb/>
duty of a Provincial Assembly, to see that they are <lb/>
properly equipped to exercise their jurisdiction, in <lb/>
every detail, whether relating to mere procedure or <lb/>
to substantive enactment, so as to carry jus<lb break="no"/>tice to every section of the people, in their homes <lb/>
in the wide territories where we have established <lb/>
them; and the proposal that this Parliament should <lb/>
on such short notice, without enquiry‚Äîfor it <lb/>
is only within twelve months that we have <lb/>
heard of this agitation, or that the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe discovered that such a pro<lb break="no"/>vision existed on the Statute-book‚Äîexpunge the <lb/>
provision that either language may be used <lb/>
in the courts of the country, seems to me to <lb/>
carry with it consequences more alarming than <lb/>
this House is prepared to risk. It is not mere fancy, <lb/>
but I am repeating what has been said to me, that <lb/>
in some distant sections of that country, if that <lb/>
provision be obliterated, we may have the misfor<lb break="no"/>tune of seeing men brought to the bar of justice in <lb/>
our own courts, tried before our own judges, con<lb break="no"/>victed, condemned and sentenced in a language <lb/>
not one word of which they understand, and <lb/>
unable to offer a plea for justice or for mercy. <lb/>
Surely, Sir, it is unreasonable to say, in respect <lb/>

<cb/>

of property or civil rights, that the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of justice must be carried on in one lan<lb break="no"/>guage only, or that we shall permit ourselves to <lb/>
say hastily that it shall be expunged from the <lb/>
Statute-book, and that the courts of the country <lb/>
shall be left without any provision at all for the <lb/>
case of people who cannot understand the English <lb/>
language, if that should be the language prescribed. <lb/>
If that would be the case with respect to new <lb/>
comers, aware that they were going to a country <lb/>
where English law and language alone prevail, the <lb/>
case is made ten times stronger when applied, as <lb/>
my hon. friend the Secretary of State said this <lb/>
evening, to those who were the first settlers in the <lb/>
country; and where the new comers, who have <lb/>
established the new laws and the new language, <lb/>
should surely be willing to incur the obli<lb break="no"/>gation of permitting the old inhabitants of <lb/>
the country to use, for a time at least, their own <lb/>
language in their own defense and in the assertion <lb/>
of their rights before our courts of justice. The <lb/>
remaining subject which is touched upon in this <lb/>
provision is the printing of the ordinances of the <lb/>
North-West Assembly in both languages. This is <lb/>
a matter on which we are not required to hear the <lb/>
Legislative Assembly; it is a duty which we have <lb/>
ourselves to discharge. True, the enactment makes <lb/>
necessary the printing in both languages; but it is <lb/>
a duty which this House has charged itself with <lb/>
from year to year. The ordinances have been <lb/>
printed in both languages not merely because sec<lb break="no"/>tion 110 of the North-West Territories Act so pro<lb break="no"/>vides, but more especially because at our table the <lb/>
money has been voted at every session since that <lb/>
Act was passed, and probably long before, for that <lb/>
purpose. That matter may safely be left in the <lb/>
hands of this Parliament, where it has always been <lb/>
dealt with down to this moment; and if this <lb/>
Parliament should think fit from year to year to <lb/>
order that the ordinances of the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories should be printed in any language in which <lb/>
it should be necessary to print them, in order to <lb/>
make them fully known to the people of the <lb/>
North-West Territories who are to be affected <lb/>
by them, I should like to ask what interests <lb/>
in this country would be injured thereby, <lb/>
or why any legislator or any person in the <lb/>
North-West Territories should say that it is dis<lb break="no"/>tasteful to him that any of the ordinances should <lb/>
be printed in any but his own tongue? Therefore, <lb/>
Sir, in regard to that question, as well <lb/>
as in regard to the use of the language <lb/>
in the courts, I shall ask this House to <lb/>
come to the decision that these two provisions of <lb/>
the Act should be maintained; but with respect to <lb/>
the records, the Journals, and the debates of the <lb/>
North-West Assembly, we may yield them the <lb/>
deference and the confidence of permitting them to <lb/>
regulate their own affairs to the fullest extent. As <lb/>
to the time when this shall be done, I propose that <lb/>
it shall be done after the next election to the <lb/>
Assembly of the North-West Territories, and for <lb/>
the obvious reason that until then there can be <lb/>
nobody in the Territories capable of representing <lb/>
to this Parliament the sentiments and wishes of <lb/>
the people of those Territories in a constitutional <lb/>
manner, and nobody in the Territories, as the hon. <lb/>
member for West Durham said, having the man<lb break="no"/>date of the people to deal with that subject. It is <lb/>
well known, Sir, that the constitution of the <lb/>
Legislative Assembly of the North-West is limited <lb/>

<pb n="881" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-18_Page_00881.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">881</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 18, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">882</fw>

in many other particulars as well as in that; and <lb/>
in that particular, to say nothing of the others, <lb/>
the members of the Legislative Assembly were <lb/>
quite aware when they held their elections and <lb/>
passed the resolution which has been to some <lb/>
extent made the basis of this measure, that they <lb/>
were holding an election for a legislative body bound <lb/>
by the provisions of section 110 of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories Act; and it will be fair that <lb/>
the electors of that territory should have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of instructing the representatives who will <lb/>
go to the future assembly as to their wishes in this <lb/>
regard. I cannot imagine any weaker reason <lb/>
against ascertaining in that way what the wishes <lb/>
of the people of the Territories are, than the letter <lb/>
which was read to influence the judgment of the <lb/>
House on this question to-night. I cannot imagine <lb/>
it being gravely asserted to this Legislature in one <lb/>
breath that the French people of the North-West <lb/>
Territories are numerically so insignificant that it is <lb/>
not worth while to use the French language in the <lb/>
Territories at all, and that its abolition is a matter <lb/>
of absolute certainty, and in the next breath that <lb/>
the French there are so strong and feel so keenly on <lb/>
this question that there will be bloodshed if they <lb/>
should be allowed to go to the polls upon it. I <lb/>
cannot understand how it can be urged that in <lb/>
a free country, or in a territory to which we <lb/>
have given the right, of self-government to <lb/>
any extent, we shall have a legislative assem<lb break="no"/>bly there, give a free and liberal franchise <lb/>
to the people, and then say to them, we are <lb/>
afraid we cannot trust you to go to the polls, <lb/>
and, therefore, we must govern you without <lb/>
hearing your voice on your own affairs. By <lb/>
all means let the constitutional rights of the <lb/>
people be respected; let the people speak <lb/>
through their representatives; let them vote, <lb/>
and let us see that the votes shall be counted, in <lb/>
order that we may ascertain which of the many <lb/>
conflicting statements made to this chamber <lb/>
as to the comparative numbers of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of the Territories is the safer one to adopt. <lb/>
I have always been under the impression that we <lb/>
had equal rights in this country, but I should begin <lb/>
to doubt it if we were to say, with regard to any <lb/>
section of the country: we are afraid there will <lb/>
be riots if you go to the polls, and we will close <lb/>
the polls against you and legislate for you against <lb/>
your will. Therefore, I will propose to the House <lb/>
the amendment I am about to read. I shall <lb/>
make but one other observation, which I had <lb/>
forgotten to make in its proper place, as regards <lb/>
the preamble, because it is touched upon in the <lb/>
amendment I am about to move. The mover of <lb/>
the Bill cannot fail to admit that, while it is true <lb/>
the preamble may be eliminated from the Bill, in <lb/>
proposing the second reading he puts the preamble <lb/>
forward as the basis of the Bill, and the reason <lb/>
which is assigned on the face of the Bill as the <lb/>
reason why this House should pass it is that <lb/>
community of language is necessary to the unity <lb/>
of a country. <lb/></p>

use of the French language in old Canada, and to the cove<lb break="no"/>

nants on that subject embodied in the British North <lb/>
America. Act, cannot agree to the declaration contained <lb/>
in the said Bill as the basis thereof, namely, that it is ex<lb break="no"/>pedient in the interest of the national unity of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion that there should be community of language amongst <lb/>
the people of Canada. That, on the contrary,this House <lb/>
declares its adherence to the said covenants, and its deter<lb break="no"/>mination to resist any attempt to impair the same. That, <lb/>
at the same time, this House deems it expedient and pro<lb break="no"/>per, and not inconsistent with those covenants, that the <lb/>
egislative Assembly ofthe North-West Territories should <lb/>
receive from the Parliament of Canada power to regulate, <lb/>

<p>I need not hardly say to the House before closing‚Äî <lb/>
and it is the only other remark I have to make‚Äî <lb/>
that a portion of that resolution is taken from the <lb/>
one which was suggested by the hon. member for <lb/>
West Durham in his speech the other evening. <lb/>
The opinions he expressed with regard to the <lb/>
avowal this House ought to make, with regard to <lb/>
its adherence to those covenants and its future <lb/>
action upon questions of this kind, in so far as <lb/>
they touch the constitution of the country as estab<lb break="no"/>lished by the British North America Act I endorse <lb/>
almost entirely. <lb/></p>

like to ask him does the Government contemplate <lb/>
a redistribution of seats in the North-West <lb/>
Assembly? because otherwise the population of the <lb/>
North-West will not have the fair representation <lb/>
they are entitled to. <lb/></p>

will have to be dealt with by Parliament, as the <lb/>
subject-matter of this resolution will be should it be <lb/>
adopted. The Government will consider that sub<lb break="no"/>ject before bringing down a Bill. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. MACDOWALL</persName>. I understand there will be <lb/>
a re-distribution of seats for the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, and the French population will be given a <lb/>

no vote would be taken to-night. Of course, it was <lb/>

<p>Motion agreed to. <lb/></p> 

<p>FIRST READINGS. <lb/></p>

<p>DRILL HALL IN MONTREAL. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. LANGELIER (Montmorency) (Translation) <lb/>
asked, Whether the Minister of Militia has given <lb/>
instructions to repair the recently damaged eat<lb break="no"/>ing apparatus in the Montreal drill hall? If not, <lb/>

<cb/>

Sir ADOLPHE CARON. (Translation) In an<lb break="no"/>swer to my hon. friend, I must say that I have <lb/>
given instructions to repair the heating apparatus <lb/>
in the Montreal drill hall. <lb/></p> 

<p>FLOODS IN LAPRAIRIE. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. DOYON (Translation) asked, Whether it is <lb/>
within the knowledge of the Government that each <lb/>
year, and often twice each year, the village and the <lb/>
parish of Laprairie are inundated by the rising of <lb/>
the waters of the St. Lawrence, and suffer consi<lb break="no"/>derable damage? Whether it is the intention of <lb/>
the Government to take measures for the construc<lb break="no"/>tion of works which may be judged necessary for <lb/>
the prevention of the destruction caused by these <lb/>
inundations? <lb/></p> 

<p>Sir HECTOR LANGEVIN. (Translation) It is <lb/>
within the knowledge of the Government that <lb/>
floods happen in Laprairie, and the Government is <lb/>
now considering the matter. <lb/></p> 

<p>HARBOR OF MONTREAL. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. LANGELIER (Montmorency) for Mr. <lb/>
BEAUSOLEIL (Translation) asked, Whether the <lb/>
plans adopted by the city of Montreal for the <lb/>
improvement of the harbor of Montreal were sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the Government before their adoption, or <lb/>
since? Have they received the approval and the <lb/>
sanction of the Government? Does the Government <lb/>
propose to contribute towards the construction of <lb/>
the projected works during the coming season? <lb/>
And, if so, to what extent? Does the Government <lb/>
intend to lay before the House the correspondence <lb/>
and the documents respecting the said project and <lb/>
its execution? <lb/></p> 

<p>Sir HECTOR LANGEVIN. (Translation) The <lb/>
plans adopted by the council of the city of <lb/>
Montreal and the Board of Harbour Commissioners <lb/>
of Montreal were submitted to the Government <lb/>
before their adoption; they have not received the <lb/>
approval or the sanction of the Government. The <lb/>
Government is now considering the matter. As to <lb/>
whether the Government intend to contribute to<lb break="no"/>wards the carrying out of the proposed works during <lb/>
the coming season, I am not in a position to <lb/>
answer that question. The Government does not <lb/>
intend to lay before the House the correspondence <lb/>
and documents respecting the said scheme and its <lb/>
carrying out until the whole matter has been <lb/>
considered and the Government has reached a <lb/>
decision for or against, or any decision. <lb/></p>

during the calendar year ending 31st July, 1889, <lb/>
from Ontario? What amount on logs exported from <lb/>
Quebec? and what amount on logs exported from <lb/>

<p>DAM AT VALLEYFIELD. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. BERGERON. The question I intend to <lb/>
put is not the same in the French paper as it is in <lb/>
the English paper. I will read it from the latter, <lb/></p>
