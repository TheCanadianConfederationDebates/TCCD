<head rendition="simple:centre">NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES ACT.</head> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DEWD1">Mr. DEWDNEY</persName> moved first reading of Bill (No. <lb/>
178) further to amend the Acts respecting the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. He said: I stated yesterday we <lb/>
found after the census returns came in, that the <lb/>
proportions of the districts were not as they would <lb/>

<cb/>

have been if we had had the returns when we made <lb/>
the electoral districts. On consultation with the <lb/>
members from that western country, we concluded <lb/>
the most satisfactory way would be to reduce the <lb/>
Saskatchewan district to five members instead of <lb/>
six, that would give Assiniboia twelve and Saskat<lb break="no"/>chewan and Alberta eight. That was the nearest we <lb/>
could come to, and the only way we found to bring <lb/>
this about was by a short Bill in the Senate. Of <lb/>
course, if the House has no objection, I would like <lb/>
to put that through. <lb/></p> 

<p>Motion agreed to, and Bill read the first time. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:THOM21">Sir JOHN THOMPSON</persName> moved that when the <lb/>
House adjourns it stands adjourned until 11 a.m. <lb/>
to-morrow morning. <lb/></p> 

<p>Motion agreed to. <lb/></p>
