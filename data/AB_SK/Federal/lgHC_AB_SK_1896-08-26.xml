            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName> moved for leave to introduce 
     <lb/>
     Bill (No. 7) to amend the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories Act. He said : Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, this Bill is entirely on all 
     <lb/>
    tours with the Bill that I introduced 
     <lb/>last session, and covers precisely the same 
     <lb/>ground as the Bill that Mr. Martin, the late 
     <lb/>member for Winnipeg, introduced and which 
     <lb/>passed a second reading. Unfortunately 
     <lb/>that Bill did not pass into law. The object 
     <lb/>is to restore the franchise in the North-west 
     <lb/>Territories to the same position it was in 
     <lb/>before the legislation complained of so 
     <lb/>strongly by my hon. friend (Mr. Martin), 
     <lb/>and which did not allow the elector on going 
     <lb/>forward to the returning officer's desk to 
     <lb/>make an oath that he was a qualified voter, 
     <lb/>but which required that the name should 
     <lb/>be on the list two days before the election. 
     <lb/>The legislation which my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>Martin) and I myself sought to undo, never 
     <lb/>had my approval, and now, after a trial of 
     <lb/>

     the franchise as it exists under the obnox<lb break="no"/>ious legislation, it is, I am persuaded, still 
     <lb/>
     more desirable that we should pass this Bill. 
     <lb/>
     The Bill, as I say, will be found to be pre<lb break="no"/>cisely the same Bill as my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Martin) introduced last session and which 
     <lb/>
     passed a second reading. How it came that 
     <lb/>
     we had no legislation in the matter, it would 
     <lb/>
     be hard to say.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">The MINISTER OF MARINE AND FISH<lb break="no"/>ERIES</persName> (Mr. Davies). The Government op<lb break="no"/>posed it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. Well, I do not know that 
     <lb/>
     they did oppose it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. It passed a second reading, 
     <lb/>
     anyway. I think it highly desirable that

     this Bill should pass into law.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Motion agreed to, and Bill read the first

     time.
