<p>[...]which should have been the same in the French <lb/>

of the Government to allow the public to use the <lb/>
dam connecting the mainland with Grand Ile, at <lb/>
Valleyfield, as sanctioned by custom since the first <lb/>
existence of the said dam, which is the only highway <lb/>
available for traffic; and in view, also, of the inten<lb break="no"/>tion to build an iron bridge thereon, which expense <lb/>
would not be justifiable unless the Government <lb/>
would promise that such use would be continued? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. There does not <lb/>
appear to be any objection to allow the dam con<lb break="no"/>necting the mainland with Grand Ile at Valleyfield <lb/>

itself that such use would be continued. <lb/></p>

<cb/>

Mr. TUPPER. It is not the intention of the <lb/>

House to a reply given by the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man the leader of the Government a few days ago, <lb/>
to the member for Northumberland (Mr. Mitchell), <lb/>
When he stated that the matter of the Behring Sea <lb/>
fishery negotiations was then under consideration <lb/>
at Washington. On a subsequent occasion, in <lb/>
reply to an enquiry of my own respecting the <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">modus vivendi</hi>, the hon. gentleman stated that both <lb/>
the Behring Sea fishery question and the question <lb/>
of the fisheries generally, were under consideration <lb/>
at Washington between the British Minister and <lb/>
the United States Government. Now, this is a <lb/>
question in which the people of the Dominion <lb/>
naturally feel a very great interest, and, therefore, <lb/>
I would ask the right hon. gentleman whether, in <lb/>
view of the negotiations which he has announced <lb/>
are proceeding at Washington, it is the purpose of <lb/>
the Government to have a representative of Canada <lb/>
at Washington to look after Canadian interests, as <lb/>
on previous occasions? I think the people of <lb/>
Canada would naturally expect, in a matter of so <lb/>
much interest to this country, that the views of <lb/>
the Government and the people of Canada should <lb/>
be represented there. <lb/></p>

Sir John Thompson in amendment to the amend<lb break="no"/>ment.<lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MITC2">Mr. MITCHELL</persName>. Mr. Speaker, I feel that on <lb/>
an occasion like this even an old Politician like my<lb break="no"/>self might rise with a good deal of hesitation to <lb/>
address this House, and through this House, the <lb/>
country, upon, perhaps, one of the most important <lb/>
questions we have had before us since 1867. It <lb/>
is no ordinary matter that has been brought before <lb/>
our attention in this country, in which the popu<lb break="no"/>lation is composed of various races, and especially <lb/>
of two leading races, the French and the English, <lb/>
comprising, also, a population of different religious <lb/>
convictions, and having various interests in respect <lb/>
to education and language, and in respect to other <lb/>
matters which many large sections of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation consider of the most vital importance. <lb/>
Under these circumstances, it is natural that a <lb/>
member getting up to address this House should <lb/>
feel under considerable reserve and restraint in <lb/>
the expression of his opinions. Sir, I have felt <lb/>
that during the course of this debate a good <lb/>
deal of unnecessarily strong language has been <lb/>
used, and I will take this opportunity of saying in <lb/>
the beginning‚Äîas my remarks will not be long on <lb/>
this occasion‚Äîthat I think a good deal of unneces<lb break="no"/>sary severity has been shown in regard both to the <lb/>
motives and the language of the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). I do not sym<lb break="no"/>pathise with those who find fault with that hon. <lb/>
gentleman, if he has acted on his convictions, in <lb/>
taking the course he has done; and while I dissent <lb/>
from the Bill which he has introduced, and shall <lb/>
vote against it if an opportunity is offered, I am <lb/>
.not one of those who would blame that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man for taking the course that his convictions im<lb break="no"/>pel him to pursue; I am not one of those who <lb/>
would find fault with his having the courage of his <lb/>
convictions and bringing this matter before the <lb/>
House. Sir, if there is one thing that recommends <lb/>
the onduct of a statesman to myself it is when he <lb/>
has he courage of his convictions, no matter <lb/>
whether it results in his unpopularity, no matter <lb/>
whether it results, as has been the case with that <lb/>
hon. gentleman, in his having had to sit under the <lb/>
most scathing denunciations and the most brilliant <lb/>
sarcasm, such as have been directed against the <lb/>
hon. gentleman from both sides of the House for <lb/>
the five days that this debate has lasted. I must <lb/>
say that I admire the courage and pluck which <lb/>
be displayed, and I admire the ability which he <lb/>
showed in fighting the matter out to the bitter end. <lb/>
I entirely dissent from the spirit and intention of <lb/>
this Bill, and, while I agree with those who believe <lb/>
that its introduction at the present time is calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to do harm in the country and raise strife,I can <lb/>
find no fault with the hon. gentleman‚Äîif he believes, <lb/>
as he has stated to this House he does believe, that <lb/>
this course should be adopted and this Bill intro<lb break="no"/>duced‚Äîin regard to the course he has followed, <lb/>
for it was his duty to bring the matter before <lb/>
Parliament in order that the uestion might be <lb/>
discussed and decided. Some of the hon. members <lb/>
of this House have a peculiar responsibility in <lb/>
regard to this matter; I refer to those who took <lb/>
part in forming the Constitution of the country. <lb/>
The right hon. gentleman opposite (Sir John A. <lb/>
Macdonald), and the hon. gentleman who sits at <lb/>
his left (Sir Hector Langevin), with myself and <lb/>
one or two others not now in this <choice><sic>Houso</sic><corr>House</corr></choice>, met with <lb/>

<cb/>

considerable difficulty many years ago, in dealing <lb/>
with the questions of language and schools. One <lb/>
of the great difficulties we experienced in London, <lb/>
when we were preparing the Constitution of this <lb/>
Dominion to submit to the British Parliament for <lb/>
its approval and enactment-and the right hon. <lb/>
leader of the Government will agree that I do not <lb/>
exaggerate the facts when I say that these questions <lb/>
almost broke up the conference-and those difficul<lb break="no"/>ties arose out of these questions of language and <lb/>
schools. We felt the importance of conciliation <lb/>
and concession, the importance of conceding to the <lb/>
minority certain rights which they should enjoy, <lb/>
and the difficulty connected with this subject very <lb/>
nearly, as I have stated, broke up the conference <lb/>
in London. I realised then, that the people of <lb/>
Canada were composed mainly of two races, and, I <lb/>
admit, that I was not so liberal-minded then as now, <lb/>
and did not realise the difficulties as strongly as I <lb/>
do to-day. With respect to the amendment sub<lb break="no"/>mitted by the Minister of Justice, I have come to <lb/>
the conclusion, that, while I do not entirely con<lb break="no"/>cur with it, I am prepared to adopt a similar <lb/>
course to that which I followed in 1867 in Eng<lb break="no"/>land‚Äîto accept it as probably the best solution pre<lb break="no"/>sented of the question under consideration. I <lb/>
have, myself, given this matter some little consider<lb break="no"/>ation, and several days ago I prepared a resolution <lb/>
which I thought would meet the wishes of the House. <lb/>
I may state, that I should prefer this resolution <lb/>
to be adopted rather than that of the Minister of <lb/>
Justice, but I do not see any chance of this being <lb/>
done, and, therefore, I am prepared to give my <lb/>
approval to the motion of the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Justice, not as affording a perfect solution, but as <lb/>
one affording a temporary solution of these difficul<lb break="no"/>ties which now stare us in the face in this Canada <lb/>
of ours. If the amendment of the hon. Minister <lb/>
should fail, and I should have an opportunity to <lb/>
submit my resolution to the House, I will do so. <lb/>
It is in the following terms:‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>That all after the word "Resolved" be struck out <lb/>
and the following substituted therefor: <lb/></p> 

<p>That at present it is inexpedient to further amend <lb/>
the Act relating to the Nort-West Territories, but the <lb/>
question should be left until Parliament is prepared to <lb/>
grant to the said Territories a full measure of Provmeial <lb/>
Government such as is enjoyed by the existing Provinces <lb/>
of the Dominion. <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>I do not suppose I will obtain an opportunity to <lb/>
present my motion, for I believe there is sufficient <lb/>
good sense in this House and sufficient desire to <lb/>
promote harmony and community of feeling <lb/>
throughout this country, to induce hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers to accept, as a compromise, the amendment <lb/>
moved by the Minister of Justice. What I am <lb/>
prepared to do is, to throw the responsibility of <lb/>
dealing with this matter on the Administration. <lb/>
They have chosen that amendment, after five <lb/>
da s discussion, as a means of solving this diffi<lb break="no"/>culty, and upon them I would place the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility. I would have preferre not to vote for <lb/>
this amendment, if I could see any other way out <lb/>
of the difficulty, but I do not; and therefore I am <lb/>
prepared to accept it, not as a perfect measure, <lb/>
but as a solution‚Äîand it is a temporary solution <lb/>
only‚Äîof the difficulty that resents itself. Some <lb/>
views have been expresse during this debate <lb/>
with which I am not in accord. The question of <lb/>
schools has come up. It has been contended <lb/>
by the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
(Mr. McCarthy) that a community of language <lb/>

<pb n="889" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00889.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">889</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 20, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">890</fw> 

should prevail throughout the Dominion. I quite <lb/>
agree with my hon. friend that, if it were possible <lb/>
to have a community of language from one end of <lb/>
the country to the other, it is most desirable; but <lb/>
it is impossible. Not only in the North-West and <lb/>
in the Province of Quebec, do racial difficulties exist. <lb/>
In Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, there is a large French Canadian and <lb/>
Acadian population, a population which I regret <lb/>
to say is not in as affluent circumstances as many <lb/>
of the Anglo-Saxon people there, a population <lb/>
which has not had the same facilities for educating <lb/>
their children and themselves as are possessed by <lb/>
many of us in the more advanced and older com<lb break="no"/>munities. If the hon. gentleman's community of <lb/>
language were to be applied in those schools, the <lb/>
result would be, first, teachers could not be found <lb/>
to educate the pupils in English; and second, <lb/>
the scholars themselves would be unable to under<lb break="no"/>stand anything except French. The effect <lb/>
would be that the poor children would remain <lb/>
ignorant and would have to go without an educa<lb break="no"/>tion. For that reason, I do not believe the pro<lb break="no"/>position of the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy), would work satisfactorily throughout <lb/>
the country. Again, the hon. gentleman has <lb/>
referred to alleged difficulties which would arise <lb/>
respecting Provincial rights. I fail to preceive <lb/>
that any difficulty would occur regarding Provin<lb break="no"/>cial rights in the North-West Territories. That <lb/>
country will receive its charter from this <lb/>
Parliament. It will come in on an entirely <lb/>
different footing from the original Provinces <lb/>
of the Dominion. They came in as independent <lb/>
Provinces with laws and rights recognised by the <lb/>
British North America Act, which were in exist<lb break="no"/>ence at that time, and which were to remain in <lb/>
existence until altered. The North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, however, were purchased by the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion, and when they receive their Provincial <lb/>
constitution the Canadian Parliament will decide <lb/>
the terms upon which it will be given. No <lb/>
question of Provincial rights can come into this <lb/>
issue. When this Parliament creates a Province or <lb/>
a number of Provinces in the North-West, Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment will define and particularise in the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of those Provinces the powers they will <lb/>
exercise. I differ with the hon. member for <lb/>
Bothwell (Mr. Mills) as to what rights can be <lb/>
accorded to those Provinces, the hon. member for <lb/>
Bothwell taking the ground that we cannot give <lb/>
less or more extensive powers to the new <lb/>
Provinces we create than are ossessed by the old <lb/>
Provinces under the British North America Act. <lb/>
With all due deference to the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
view, I do not agree with it; but I admit that it <lb/>
is a question open to discussion. But I will say <lb/>
this, that if the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
(Mr. McCarthy), who introduced the Bill now <lb/>
under discussion, had allowed the matter to remain <lb/>
in abeyance for ten years and had not introduced <lb/>
this Bill, the question would have settled itself. <lb/>
Either the French population in the country, which <lb/>
is now admittedly very small, would have increas<lb break="no"/>ed sufficiently to have enabled them to have de<lb break="no"/>manded the exercise and use of their language, at if <lb/>
the Anglo-Saxon population or a foreign population <lb/>
had increased, the French population there never <lb/>
would have demanded it, and the consequence is that <lb/>
the language would have been eliminated by the <lb/>
operation of time and by the natural course of events. <lb/>

<cb/>

That is the view I take of this part of the question. <lb/>
While I quite recognise the power of the member <lb/>
for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), and his right <lb/>
to bring this question before Parliament, I regret <lb/>
that he should have raised it at this time, because <lb/>
I believe that if he had not raised it, not five <lb/>
years‚Äîcertainly not more than ten years‚Äîwould <lb/>
have elapsed before, by the natural operation of <lb/>
events, the question would have settled itself. <lb/>
Now, Sir, after the very elaborate speeches which <lb/>
have been made on this question, and almost every <lb/>
branch of the question having been exhausted <lb/>
by the different very able speakers, I think it will <lb/>
be unnecessary for me to take up the time of the <lb/>
House longer. What I rose to do, was not to make <lb/>
a speech, but to give utterance to the views which <lb/>
I entertain on the matter, in order to justify the <lb/>
vote I gave the other day, and to explain the <lb/>
vote which I will give on the amendment of the hon. <lb/>
Minister of Justice. I would say that I have lived <lb/>
among the French people for very many years and <lb/>
I can vouch that they are, as an almost universal <lb/>
rule, good citizens, living peaceably amongst them<lb break="no"/>selves and in friendship with the people of other <lb/>
races, and most friendly in their relations <lb/>
with their English-speaking fellow countrymen. <lb/>
Where they are in power, as they are in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec by a large majority, they deal <lb/>
with the English-speaking people with a liberality <lb/>
which does credit to them. In that Province the <lb/>
Protestants have their separate schools and their <lb/>
separate eleemosynary and benevolent institutions, <lb/>
such as insane asylums, which receive Government <lb/>
aid in proportion to that given to the French and <lb/>
Catholic institutions. The English minority has <lb/>
all these privileges freely accorded by a Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture in which there is only a fragment of English <lb/>
speaking representatives. If where the English-<lb break="yes"/>speaking people have the power, as they have in <lb/>
the North-West Territories and in this Parliament, <lb/>
we deal less liberally with the French minority <lb/>
than they do with the English minority, what kind <lb/>
of position will we place ourselves in? One thing <lb/>
is certain: that in the interest of peace and har<lb break="no"/>mony in this country, and in a mixed community <lb/>
such as ours, there must be compromise. If there <lb/>
are not concessions on both sides, it can only end in <lb/>
the disruption of the Dominion, and the breaking <lb/>
up of what, when we laid its foundation, we believe <lb/>
would be a great nation. I again repeat that while <lb/>
voting for the amendment of the Minister of Justice, <lb/>
although I do not entirely approve of it, I throw <lb/>
the responsibility for the measure on the right <lb/>
hon. gentleman at the head of the Government. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. After the re<lb break="no"/>marks which I made on a previous occasion during <lb/>
this debate, and the suggestion which I then of<lb break="no"/>fered across the floor to hon. gentlemen opposite, <lb/>
I think it right that I should at once address this <lb/>
House on the resolution presented by my hon. friend <lb/>
the Minister of Justice. I should have then moved <lb/>
this resolution myself, but it was late at night and <lb/>
I was fatigued, and my hon. friend the Minister of <lb/>
Justice has moved it at my special request. The <lb/>
hon. member for Northumberland (Mr. Mitchell), <lb/>
in the calm and wise speech he has delivered just <lb/>
now, has made the statement that he threw the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility for action on this question upon the <lb/>
Government. Mr. Speaker, the Government ac<lb break="no"/>cepts that responsibility. <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:MITC2">Mr. MITCHELL</persName>. Hear, hear.</p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. The Government <lb/>
think that the resolution moved by my hon. friend <lb/>
the Minister of Justice is a measure of peace, and <lb/>
a means of getting over this unfortunate feeling of <lb/>
irritation which has grown up between the two <lb/>
great races that make the strength and power of <lb/>
Canada. This resolution is for the purpose of <lb/>
getting rid of the temporary feeling‚Äîbecause it <lb/>
will only be temporary‚Äîwhich threatens for the <lb/>
moment to disturb the quiet of Canada, and there<lb break="no"/>by to hurt its prestige and its credit and to hamper <lb/>
its development. This resolution of the Minister <lb/>
of Justice is, as I have said, a measure of peace, <lb/>
and I implore and urge all my hon. friends on both <lb/>
sides of the House who look with anxiety for the <lb/>
future peace of Canada to accept it as such. The <lb/>
hon. member for West Durham (Mr. Blake), in his <lb/>
speech, and in the resolution which he suggested, <lb/>
stated that the time had not arrived for the solu<lb break="no"/>tion of this question and that it ought to be post<lb break="no"/>poned. In my short reply I stated that while I <lb/>
accepted the greater part of his resolution, yet I <lb/>
thought that while the first portion of it would <lb/>
quiet the irritated feelings of the people in the <lb/>
eastern part of Canada, the postponement of this <lb/>
question for an unspecified time would, <lb/>
perhaps, arouse feelings of irritation in the <lb/>
western portion of this Dominion. I sug<lb break="no"/>gested across the floor that for the sake of <lb/>
peace we ought, after the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West had an opportunity of expressing their <lb/>
opinion, throw the responsibility upon them. The <lb/>
hon. member for West Durham (Mr. Blake), cast<lb break="no"/>ing aside all partisan desire of triumph, accepted‚Äî <lb/>
although, perhaps, against his own opinion‚Äîthe pro<lb break="no"/>position that I then made. If we examine and <lb/>
compare the resolution which my hon. friend the <lb/>
Minister of Justice has moved with the suggested <lb/>
motion of my hon. friend for West Durham (Mr. <lb/>
Blake) it will be seen that the first portion of it is <lb/>
in his exact language, a little condensed, and it <lb/>
concludes with the proposition which I made and <lb/>
which that hon. gontleman accepted. It was a <lb/>
compromise, and in a question of this kind in<lb break="no"/>volving racial feelings, and prejudices, and arous<lb break="no"/>ing a sense of pride of race and nationality, such a <lb/>
course is wise and patriotic. I hold that this <lb/>
resolution is one which meets the case, and I <lb/>
implore the House that it may be accepted. Some <lb/>
of my hon. friends think that the power to deal with <lb/>
this subject should be at once given to the <lb/>
Assembly of the North-West Territories. Now <lb/>
there are great political considerations against that <lb/>
course, and, looking to the future, I think it would be <lb/>
a mistake. As my hon. friend from West Durham <lb/>
(Mr. Blake) says, the present Legislature of the <lb/>
North-West Territories had no commission from <lb/>
the people to pronounce upon this subject of the <lb/>
two languages; they had no means of knowing <lb/>
what the opinion of the poople was upon that <lb/>
point, and therefore, they did not speak with the <lb/>
authority of representatives in regard to the wishes <lb/>
and opinions of the people of the North-West. <lb/>
Those who look at history will see that the great <lb/>
and grave errors committed in France at the time <lb/>
when the people arose against the despotism of the <lb/>
Bourbons, and from which most of the evils follow<lb break="no"/>ing the revolution of 1798 arose, were due to the <lb/>
fact that the representatives of the people <lb/>

<cb/>

who were elected for the purpose of reform under <lb/>
the laws of that day resolved themselves again <lb/>
and again into constituent assemblies, assuming <lb/>
for themselves the power of altering the consti<lb break="no"/>tution under which they were elected, instead of <lb/>
trying to effect reforms under the constitution as <lb/>
it existed, and with the powers which had been <lb/>
conferred upon them by the people. Now, there <lb/>
is no power conferred upon the Legislative <lb/>
Assembly of the North-West to alter their consti<lb break="no"/>tution. The members of that body are all, I <lb/>
believe, respectable men; they are all men having <lb/>
the interest of the North-West at heart; but not <lb/>
one of them had ever before sat in a Legislative <lb/>
Assembly or knew the limits of their powers. If <lb/>
you look at their various ordinances, you will find <lb/>
that they attack ever limit conferred upon them <lb/>
by the Act of 1888. They assumed that having <lb/>
been once elected they could do as they pleased; <lb/>
and in some of the resolutions passed at that time, <lb/>
they have asserted rights and powers which we do <lb/>
not exercise or venture to exercise in this Assembly. <lb/>
Therefore, it is of the very greatest importance <lb/>
that we should draw a distinction between a <lb/>
constituent assembly and a Legislative Assembly. <lb/>
The North-West Assembly is a Legislative <lb/>
Assembly with certain powers conferred upon it <lb/>
by the Act which brought it into being; but it <lb/>
has no right to represent the people on questions <lb/>
which were not before the people at the time it <lb/>
was elected as a Legislative Assembly with limited <lb/>
powers. It is of the very greatest importance that <lb/>
we should observe that distinction, and, therefore, I <lb/>
quite agree with all those hon. gentlemen on both <lb/>
sides who have said that any action taken in this <lb/>
matter should be deferred until the people of the <lb/>
North-West have an opportunity of saying to their <lb/>
representatives what they want. There is a differ<lb break="no"/>ence of opinion on that point. Some hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men who have come from that part of the country <lb/>
say that they believe that after the next general <lb/>
election the abolition of the dual language will not <lb/>
be pressed. I do not know how that may be; but <lb/>
we can afford to wait until the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West have seen and read the discussions which <lb/>
have taken place in this House, and have seen in <lb/>
the press of Canada how much this question has <lb/>
excited the attention of the people of the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion; they will then go to the polls fully charged <lb/>
with this question, having made up their minds <lb/>
what they will instruct their representatives to <lb/>
carry out. Then, Sir, not before, ought we to act <lb/>
upon the representations of the Legislative As<lb break="no"/>sembly of the North-West. Now, Sir, an objection <lb/>
will be taken, I have no doubt, to the fact that <lb/>
this resolution of my hon. friend the Minister of <lb/>
Justice does not allude at all to the printing of the <lb/>
ordinances of the North‚ÄîWest. Sir, it ought not <lb/>
in any way to allude to that, or to bring that sub<lb break="no"/>ject into the consideration of this question; and <lb/>
why? Because the printing of the ordinances of <lb/>
the North-West Assembly is no matter of concern <lb/>
to that assembly. It has no more authority with <lb/>
respect to the printing of those ordinances than <lb/>
this House of Commons of Canada has with respect <lb/>
to the printing of the statutes which we, in con<lb break="no"/>junction with the Senate, pass. The resolution <lb/>
which my hon. friend proposes says: <lb/></p> 
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"That at the same time this House deems it expedient <lb/>
and proper, and not inconsistent with those covenants, <lb/>
that the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>

tories should receive from the Parliament of Canada <lb/>
power to regulate, after the next general election of the <lb/>
Assembly, the proceedings of the Assembly, and the <lb/>
manner of recording and publishing such proceedings." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>That gives them the whole control, the sole regula<lb break="no"/>tion of every proceeding and every paper with <lb/>
which they have anything to do, from the time <lb/>
they meet until the time they present the Bills <lb/>
which they have passed to the Governor for his <lb/>
sanction. The Journals, the Votes and Proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, the motions and resolutions, the Bills, the <lb/>
first, second and third readings, can, under the <lb/>
resolution of my hon. friend, be limited, if they so <lb/>
choose to limit them, to the English language. <lb/>
This resolution, if passed, gives them the whole <lb/>
authority to decide whether those things shall be <lb/>
printed in English, in French, in both English and <lb/>
French, in German, or in any other language. <lb/>
But, Sir, as here, so there; from the moment the <lb/>
Bills are passed, and presented to the Governor <lb/>
for his sanction, from that moment all their <lb/>
authority over them ceases. Here we pass Bills, <lb/>
we send them to the Senate, and then, so far as we <lb/>
are concerned, our power is ended. We know we <lb/>
could have them, if it were not for the clause in the <lb/>
British North America Act, printed in any <lb/>
language we like; but after they are sent up to <lb/>
the Senate and the Senate passes them, they are <lb/>
then handed over to the representative of the <lb/>
Sovereign, and from that moment they cease to be <lb/>
the property of the Legislature, and become the <lb/>
laws of the land, to be published by the Governor. <lb/>
Our statutes, when they are published, are pub<lb break="no"/>lished not by virtue of the authority of this House <lb/>
or both Houses together; they are published by <lb/>
the representative of the Sovereign, who, after <lb/>
having given his sanction to them, publishes them <lb/>
under constitutional rule. So in the North-West. <lb/>
We will suppose that under the authority given by <lb/>
this resolution the Acts of the North-West Assem<lb break="no"/>bly are presented to the Lieutenant-Governor in <lb/>
English, and in English alone; he gives his assent, <lb/>
and then, and not before, do they become ordin<lb break="no"/>ances, and the moment they become ordinances, <lb/>
it is the Crown that publishes them, and the <lb/>
Legislative body, which initiated the legisla<lb break="no"/>tion, has nothing more to do with it. The con<lb break="no"/>sequence is that, so far as that Legislature is <lb/>
concerned, it can carry out its wishes by print<lb break="no"/>ing its measures in one or in both languages. <lb/>
Let them adopt their ordinances under the present <lb/>
system, and the Lieutenant-Governor, being a <lb/>
Dominion officer, will see that they are published <lb/>
certainly in the language in which they are <lb/>
presented. The Assembly, however, will have no<lb break="no"/>thing to say as to whether they may not, by in<lb break="no"/>structions from the Government here or the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion Parliament, be published in half-a-dozen <lb/>
languages. This resolution, Sir, is a measure of <lb/>
peace. This House will, by a large majority, I <lb/>
believe, reject the measure, presented as it has <lb/>
been, the harsh measure of my hon. friend from <lb/>
North Simcoe. Then, if this resolution be adopted, <lb/>
the matter will stand over for the opinion of the <lb/>
people of the North-West. If they declare that <lb/>
all the proceedings of their Legislature are to be in <lb/>
English, so let it be, and so it will be if this House <lb/>
adopt this resolution. But, after they have exer<lb break="no"/>cised their full right of limiting their documents, <lb/>
their resolutions, their Bills, their Journals, and <lb/>
their Votes and Proceedings, to the one tongue, it <lb/>

<cb/>

will be left to the Lieutenant-Governor to order, <lb/>
under instruction from the Dominion Government <lb/>
‚Äîand that Dominion Government acting under <lb/>
instructions from the representatives of the people <lb/>
here‚Äîthem to be printed in any other language <lb/>
as well as in English. Should, however, this House <lb/>
choose to say that any portion of the people of <lb/>
the North-West are to be deprived of the means of <lb/>
reading their laws in their own language, they will <lb/>
have to submit; but, in the meantime, we will <lb/>
have conferred full power and authority on the <lb/>
North-West Council to act on this unfortunate <lb/>
question just as they please, after having received <lb/>
an amended warrant from the people. Now, I <lb/>
must again say that it is of the very greatest im<lb break="no"/>portance that we should bury this question as soon <lb/>
as possible. It is quite true, as the hon. member <lb/>
for Durham (Mr. Blake) said, that a small spark <lb/>
may kindle a great conflagration, and we will be <lb/>
wilfully, on a question of sentiment‚Äîon a question <lb/>
of feeling, which does not deserve to be dignified <lb/>
by the name of sentiment‚Äîhazarding the future of <lb/>
the country, arousing the feelings of race against <lb/>
race, which I hoped had been forever buried in <lb/>
1867, and ruining the credit of Canada in foreign <lb/>
countries. Aye, and in the mother country too. <lb/>
For, what credit can we, financially or otherwise, <lb/>
hope to obtain if it is known in England, if it is <lb/>
known especially on the Stock Exchange‚Äîthe most <lb/>
fearful and timorous of all bodies‚Äîthat the two <lb/>
races which inhabit Canada are drawn up against <lb/>
each other, on matters of sentiment, feeling and <lb/>
prejudice, which are more important and less <lb/>
easy to be soothed than mere material questions. <lb/>
It will stop the development of this country. It <lb/>
will prevent its future progress, and if this coun<lb break="no"/>try should fall from the proud position it now <lb/>
holds in the eyes of the world, it will be because <lb/>
by our own insensate conduct we have destroyed <lb/>
our credit, destroyed our prestige, and ruined our <lb/>
future. In the few remarks I made the other <lb/>
night I intended to have called the intention of <lb/>
my hon. friends from the Province of Ontario to <lb/>
what was the action of the Province of Upper <lb/>
Canada in 1793, but I was tired, and held it over <lb/>
for another opportunity. I will call attention to <lb/>
it now, to show what was the feeling of the people <lb/>
of Upper Canada a century ago. By a very unwise <lb/>
measure, although introduced by a very great man, <lb/>
Mr. Pitt, in 1790, the old Province of Quebec was <lb/>
divided into two‚ÄîUpper and Lower Canada. It was <lb/>
thought that matters would be simplified by keeping <lb/>
the French in one corner of this vast country, and the <lb/>
English in another, and they divided the Prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Quebec into two provinces. From that <lb/>
unwise measure came most of our troubles. The <lb/>
Legislature met in 1791 at Newark, afterwards <lb/>
Niagara, and was composed of Englishmen. They <lb/>
were severed from the French, but they had a <lb/>
colony of French on the western frontier of the <lb/>
Province of Canada, what is now the County of <lb/>
Essex. These Frenchmen were few in number, <lb/>
but their rights were protected at the second meet<lb break="no"/>ing of the Legislature of Upper Canada. The <lb/>
Province was a small one and poor, and could not <lb/>
afford even to print the proceedings of its Legis<lb break="no"/>lature; but its people regarded the feelings of <lb/>
their fellow-countrymen. Let me read the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, which is still in manuscript. The original <lb/>
volume will be found in our Library. This is the <lb/>
order of June 3, 1793: <lb/></p>

Forbid it, Mr. Speaker. In the name of humanity, <lb/>

friends in this House, without reference to party, <lb/>
to forget what may be an inconvenience when they <lb/>
go back to their constituents on both sides, to for<lb break="no"/>get that for a moment, and to merge everything in <lb/>
the great desire to make Canada, French and <lb/>
English, one people, without any hostile feeling, <lb/>
without any difference of opinion, further than that <lb/>
which arises from the different literatures and the <lb/>
different strains of mind that run always in differ<lb break="no"/>ent races, and which sever the Scotchman and the <lb/>
Irishman from the Englishman as much as it severs <lb/>
the Frenchman from the Englishman. Let us for<lb break="no"/>get this cry, and we shall have our reward in <lb/>
seeing this unfortunate fire, which has been kindled <lb/>
from so small a spark, extinguished for ever, and <lb/>
we shall go on, as we have been going on since 1867, <lb/>
as one people, with one object, looking to one <lb/>
future, and expecting to lay the foundation of one <lb/>
great country. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:EDGA1">Mr. EDGAR</persName>. I think it is a fortunate thing <lb/>
that this debate has taken so wide a range. If <lb/>
there is one thing more than another which should <lb/>
make a man feel proud of being a member of this <lb/>
Assembly, it is to have listened to a great debate <lb/>
like this. The questions which are before us for <lb/>
discussion are those which underlie our national <lb/>
existence, and upon the peaceful settlement of these <lb/>
questions depends our hope for the future of <lb/>
Canada. The speakers in this debate have, for <lb/>
the most part, been equal to the occasion, and <lb/>
they have displayed the courage to grapple with <lb/>
the real issues, they have shown a breadth of <lb/>
statesmanship to look at the lesson which history <lb/>
has taught us, and I do not think I am going too <lb/>
far in saying that they have dealt with the whole <lb/>
subject with an eloquence which could be found in <lb/>
few deliberative assemblies in the world. I think <lb/>
it is well that this debate has taken so wide a <lb/>
range for another reason. It has gone to the <lb/>
country. Day after day the Opinions of the <lb/>
wisest statesmen of Canada, the most experienced <lb/>
of our public men, have been sent abroad by the <lb/>
press to educate the people on this subject before <lb/>
it shall have got into the hands of the <lb/>
uninformed and irresponsible platform craters <lb/>
who might use it to inflame thepassions of race <lb/>
and of creed. Why has this debate, commencing <lb/>

<cb/>

from so very small a Bill, and so very small a mat<lb break="no"/>ter on its face, taken so wide a range as it has? <lb/>
There are several reasons for it. One is to be <lb/>
found in that unfortunate preamble. The hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) has told <lb/>
us that he was surprised to find that the preamble <lb/>
was the occasion of so great an explosion of alarm <lb/>
and wrath in this House. I dare say he was sur<lb break="no"/>prised, because he says so, but it seems to me that <lb/>
he is making the same excuse as the boy made, in <lb/>
whose hands the fire-arm exploded, when he said <lb/>
that he did not know it was loaded. But the <lb/>
hon. gentleman not simply knew that that pream<lb break="no"/>ble was loaded, but he loaded it himself, and, <lb/>
therefore, he has no such excuse to make. The <lb/>
next reason that I find for the wide range <lb/>
of this debate was the speech by which it was <lb/>
introduced in this House by the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). My judg<lb break="no"/>ment might be wrong, if I only depended on <lb/>
it to tell me that the hon. gentleman's intro<lb break="no"/>ductory speech was sufficient to cause this widely <lb/>
extended debate. I do not depend upon my judg<lb break="no"/>ment alone, but upon that of an experienced par<lb break="no"/>liamentary hand, the leader of the House and the <lb/>
leader of the Government. It is not the custom <lb/>
of the leader of the Government to introduce an <lb/>
unpleasant subject into this House when he can <lb/>
avoid it, but I can show that the speech of the <lb/>
First Minister, made a few minutes after the in<lb break="no"/>troductory speech of the hon. gentleman, was <lb/>
ample ground for the range the debate has taken. <lb/>
On that occasion, referring to the speech of the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe on the first reading <lb/>
of the Bill, the First Minister said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The line of argument my hon. friend has taken raises <lb/>
questions of such anature, his whole line of argument is <lb/>
of such a kind, as to involve most serious and grave <lb/>
questions‚Äîso grave that I think we must take full time <lb/>
to consider what his arguments are, what they tend to, in <lb/>
what direction they lead, and what consequences may <lb/>
follow if the measure is persisted in." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>I will say no more in reference to the hon. <lb/>
gentleman's speech in this House after that <lb/>
quotation, but, when a public man of the pro<lb break="no"/>minence of the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
brings forward a measure in this House, it is <lb/>
impossible for any of us or for the country not to <lb/>
have regard to the discussions which the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has taken part in before the people of the <lb/>
country, at a recent date. If we had had no pre<lb break="no"/>amble to this Bill, but the simple terms of the Bill <lb/>
itself, if we had had no speech from the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman in introducing it of such a character as the <lb/>
First Minister has described, we still had a cause <lb/>
for alarm. Our French friends in this House and <lb/>
in the country had cause for alarm when they had <lb/>
read‚Äîas I fancy all the members of this House <lb/>
had read‚Äîthe speech which the hon. gentleman <lb/>
delivered almost under the shadow of this build<lb break="no"/>ing, in Ottawa, on the 12th December, 1889. <lb/>
I am not going back to any 12th July speeches of <lb/>
the hon. gentleman. On that exciting occasion, I <lb/>
suppose, he ought to be allowed a little latitude, <lb/>
but I was lad to find that my leader on this <lb/>
side of the House compelled the hon. gentleman <lb/>
to withdraw or to explain away some of the lan<lb break="no"/>guage he used in one of those 12th July speeche <lb/>
made before the assembled brethren. However, <lb/>
we will not go into that. Let us see what the hon. <lb/>
gentleman promised the ple of Ottawa he <lb/>
would do in the way of egislation; let us see <lb/>

what he stated our grievances were. In this <lb/>
speech, he quoted with approval the report of <lb/>
Lord Durham in reference to the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage. Now, whether this report was written <lb/>
by Lord Durham himself, or by Mr. Charles <lb/>
Buller, or by Mr. Turton, whose reputation was <lb/>
very unsavory in his own country, or by Mr. <lb/>
Gibbon Wakefield, who was also in the entou<lb break="no"/>rage of Lord Durham, and whose reputation <lb/>
was even more unsavory than that of Mr. Turton, <lb/>
it is certain that this report was never accepted by <lb/>
the French people as a policy which was likely to <lb/>
reconcile the different people of this land. How<lb break="no"/>ever, my hon. friend thinks that he will disinter <lb/>
Lord Durham's report and make it do service <lb/>
again in this country. Again we read in his <lb/>
December speech: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Lord Durham realised that so long as the use of the <lb/>
French language was permitted, so long as they were <lb/>
permitted to be educated in their schools in the French <lb/>
language, to be instructed in the literature of France, <lb/>
instead of the literature of England, they would remain <lb/>
French in feeling." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Then he says: <lb/></p>
        <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
        <p>
"Is there any shadow of doubt that Lord Durham was <lb/>
right?" <lb/></p>
        </quote>
        <p>
The hon. member goes on, and says in the next <lb/>
sentence: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"There must be the obliteration of one of these lan<lb break="no"/>guages." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Now, this was not applied to the North-West, <lb/>
this was not applied to Manitoba, it was applied <lb/>
to what Lord Durham applied it to, the Province <lb/>
of Quebec, and, therefore, the hon. gentleman, in <lb/>
that public place, advocated‚Äîand I am sure he is <lb/>
not the man to shirk responsibility on the floor of <lb/>
this House for what he advocates outside; <lb/>
at any rate, we do not expect it of him‚Äî <lb/>
he advocated the obliteration of one of these <lb/>
languages, and I do not think he meant the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish language. Again, he says in that speech, <lb/>
speaking about the material progress of the <lb/>
country: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"While we were advancing at this sufficiently rapid <lb/>
pace of prosperity, we were forgetting the one thing <lb/>
needful to the consolidation of the Dominion; but all this <lb/>
time we were forgetting that this great trouble‚Äî" <lb/></p>
        </quote>
        <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
        <p>
That is to say, the use of the French language. <lb/></p>
        </quote>
        <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
        <p>
"‚Äîwhich was an enormous difficulty in 1837‚Äî" <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>That was certainly not in the North-West Territo<lb break="no"/>ries, that was in the old Province of Quebec. <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"‚Äîhad quadrupled itself in 1867, and that we were leav<lb break="no"/>ing for our children to settle that respecting which I <lb/>
used the expression, on will remember‚ÄîI did not say in <lb/>
our generation‚Äîbut said that in the next generation the <lb/>
bayonet would do it, if we did not settle it by the ballot in <lb/>
this." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, he has laid out for us a pro<lb break="no"/>gramme for the next generation, which, I hope, we <lb/>
will never see carried out. I am sure that I do not <lb/>
want to see any of my children in the next genera<lb break="no"/>tion have to shoulder their muskets in a war of <lb/>
races in Canada; but that is the programme, un<lb break="no"/>less‚Äîwhat, Mr. Speaker? Unless we settle it by <lb/>
the ballot in this. What does he mean by the <lb/>
ballot in this? Does he not mean by legislation, <lb/>
by the votes of the people acting upon the legisla<lb break="no"/>tors in this Parliament; and does he not mean by <lb/>
the act of this, or of a future Parliament, under <lb/>
the direction of the ballot? That is what he pro<lb break="no"/>mises, that is what he threatens in that speech‚Äî <lb/>
legislation or war. No wonder our French friends <lb/>
were a little alarmed at it. Then he says: <lb/></p>

<cb/>
        <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>
"This trouble was already lifting up its hideous head <lb/>
while we were fighting over matters of comparative un<lb break="no"/>importance," <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>"Lifting up its hideous head." The beautiful <lb/>
French language is described in that way. Why, <lb/>
Mr. Speaker, when the occupant of that chair, <lb/>
every alternate day in this Chamber, before the <lb/>
doors are opened, lifts up his voice in the French <lb/>
language, in supplication to the God of both the <lb/>
French and the English, I suppose the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Simcoe feels that this language is then <lb/>
lifting up its "hideous head." He goes on and says <lb/>
that the Legislature of 1844 <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Undid the good work which Lord Durham's wisdom had <lb/>
given us in the year 1840 or 1841." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>But, Sir, he goes beyond that. He does not post<lb break="no"/>pone this thing for the next generation, he does <lb/>
not even postpone it till there is another general <lb/>
election, when the ballot can be brought into force; <lb/>
but he proposes to do it in this very Parliament, if <lb/>
the words of the English language mean anything. <lb/>
What does he say? <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I will point out to you that this may be a very useful <lb/>
precedent‚Äî" <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>That is, the action of the Legislature at Kingston <lb/>
in 1844, when they introduced the French language <lb/>
unanimously again: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"That if, in 1844 or 1845, the Parliament of United Canada <lb/>
petition for the repeal of a clause of the Union Act, I do <lb/>
not know whether in 1890 or 1891, if the necessity arises, <lb/>
the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, cannot peti<lb break="no"/>tion for an amendment to the British North America. <lb/>
Act also." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Therefore, he promises that even in this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, in the year 1890 or 1891, an Address may be <lb/>
presented to the Crown in England asking the <lb/>
Imperial Parliament to alter the British North <lb/>
America Act. Now, remember that course is <lb/>
not necessary, in order to affect the language in <lb/>
the North‚ÄîWest; it is only necessary to attack, <lb/>
what he thinks so terrible, the French language <lb/>
in Quebec, and the French language in this <lb/>
House, and, perhaps, the French language in <lb/>
Manitoba. He knows perfectly well that if he has <lb/>
the courage of his convictions he can put a notice <lb/>
on the paper to-day for an address from this House <lb/>
to the Queen, asking her to introduce legislation <lb/>
to amend the Imperial Act in this particular. Sir, <lb/>
when this solemn threat was read, no wonder the <lb/>
members of Parliament felt alarmed. Why this <lb/>
speech of 12th December last, which I hold in <lb/>
my hand, was sent to me, unless as a member <lb/>
of Parliament, I cannot say. I do not know <lb/>
whether the hon. gentleman sent copies to all his <lb/>
fellow members, in order to give them full notice <lb/>
of what he was doing; but if he did not, some <lb/>
of his friends did, who were anxious that the whole <lb/>
Parliament and country should know what the <lb/>
hon. member for Simcoe was so ostentatiously pro<lb break="no"/>posing to do. His programme is a large one, <lb/>
larger, he admits, even than the programme of the <lb/>
Equal Rights Association which he was addressing, <lb/>
because he says this: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Are we to have Separate Schools in Upper Canada, <lb/>
tithe assessments in Lower Canada, dual language in the <lb/>
Dominion Parliament, and dual languages in Quebec, the <lb/>
North-West and Manitoba?" <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>His programme is an extensive one. No won<lb break="no"/>der the French speaking people thought that <lb/>
this was but the entering o the small end <lb/>
of a very large wedge, to be driven home <lb/>
by the hammer of the eloquence of the hon. <lb/>

member for North Simcoe. Now, however, <lb/>
a change has certainly come over the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man; and I congratulate him upon it. His first <lb/>
speech in this House was not quite as brave as <lb/>
the speech he had delivered in the opera house <lb/>
here; and his last speech in the House was <lb/>
not nearly so aggressive as the first one he de<lb break="no"/>livered here. He has been convinced by something <lb/>
during the course of this debate. I do not know <lb/>
whether it was his opponents who convinced him, <lb/>
or his own friends; I think he must have heard <lb/>
enough from his own friends and supporters to <lb/>
convince him that whatever they might think or <lb/>
say about the merits of this question of language <lb/>
in the North-West, they had no sympathy what<lb break="no"/>ever with the larger crusade which the hon. <lb/>
gentleman pointed out to them on former <lb/>
occasions. Now, I listened to most of the debate, <lb/>
    and I looked over the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi>, and I find that, <lb/>
on this subject, the hon. member from West <lb/>
Toronto (Mr. Denison), who seconded the <lb/>
introduction of this Bill, does not hold out <lb/>
much encouragement to his leader. For <lb/>
he says he is talking of the case of Switzerland, <lb/>
the hon. gentleman says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I am not referring to Quebec; it is out of the question <lb/>
to speak of Quebec." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Then another, the hon. member for Centre <lb/>
Toronto (Mr. Cockburn) also fired a hot shot at <lb/>
that unfortunate preamble; and he went still <lb/>
further, and disclaimed any idea of interfering with <lb/>
the French language in the Province of Quebec or <lb/>
in the Dominion. The hon. member for Albert <lb/>
(Mr. Weldon), who spoke, as he said, for one <lb/>
million of his fellow-subjects down by the sea, <lb/>
advocated the substance of the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
Bill, the one clause which it contains; but he also <lb/>
took occasion to say that the people in the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces, the million of people for whom he <lb/>
spoke, were truth-loving and treaty-keeping <lb/>
people, and they would never be a party to break<lb break="no"/>ing a treaty under which the French language was <lb/>
established in Quebec and the Dominion. Another <lb/>
of the hon. gentleman's followers, the hon. member <lb/>
for North Bruce (Mr. McNeill), also repudiated the <lb/>
preamble‚Äîand he not only repudiated the preamble, <lb/>
but he poured a torrent of his turgid invective upon <lb/>
the head of his hon. friend, and denounced any <lb/>
clause abolishing the French language as "unjust, <lb/>
un-English, tyrannical and cruel." The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), who also <lb/>
sympathises with the one clause of the Bill, spoke <lb/>
as follows with respect to the treaty rights of the <lb/>
French: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"We do not propose‚Äî" <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>I do not know who the "we" means; it certainly <lb/>
does not include the hon. member for Simcoe,‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"‚Äîto interfere with any rights that exist in Canada by <lb/>
the virtue of the provmions of the British North America <lb/>
Act; not with one of them." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Then, the hon. gentleman said further: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"There is not a right guaranteed to the race under the <lb/>
constitution which I wish to see impaired; there is not <lb/>
a right the integrity of which I wish to see impaired <lb/>
in the slightest degree." <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Yet, the programme of the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr.McCarthy), was‚ÄîI do not think it <lb/>
is so now‚Äîbut a. short time ago it was, to do <lb/>
what the hon. member for West Toronto (Mr. <lb/>
Denison) says, is "out of the question;" What the <lb/>
hon. member for North Bruce (Mr. McNeill) said <lb/>

<cb/>

would be "tyrannical and cruel, un-English and <lb/>
unjust," and to destroy rights which the <lb/>
hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) <lb/>
says he does not wish to impair in the slightest <lb/>
degree. The hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy) now says he will strike out the pre<lb break="no"/>amble. That is all very well, if the Bill ever <lb/>
reaches the House in Committee; but it is too late <lb/>
now to back down in that fashion, and it is a rare <lb/>
sight to see in this Parliament or in the courts <lb/>
of Ontario one of the brilliant leaders of the bar, <lb/>
which the hon. gentleman is, back down from any <lb/>
position he has boldly taken; yet the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man backs down and says he is willing to withdraw <lb/>
the preamble of this Bill. It is too late to say that <lb/>
now; he should have thought of that before; he <lb/>
has sown the whirlwind and must reap the storm. <lb/>
I am glad to have heard so much from the <lb/>
other side of the House in favor of Provincial <lb/>
rights. It is proverbial that fresh converts are <lb/>
always a little over-zealous, and I think we have <lb/>
seen a display in this debate of a good deal of zeal <lb/>
a little misdirected on that subject. The question, <lb/>
of course, I know is a new one to those hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, and we can scarcely expect that they <lb/>
should understand it very well. They appear to <lb/>
have forgotten that there are two kinds of Provin<lb break="no"/>cial rights. There are the rights of the majority <lb/>
of the Legislature in the Province to pass such <lb/>
laws as come within the scope of the British <lb/>
North America Act. Those are the Provincial <lb/>
rights of the majority. But there are rights, also, <lb/>
be onging to the minority, guaranteed by the British <lb/>
North America Act, which are just as sacred as <lb/>
the rights of the majorities to govern themselves. <lb/>
Such rights would prevent the French majority in <lb/>
Quebec from taking away Protestant schools from <lb/>
the minority, for example. That is a question of <lb/>
the Provincial rights of the minority, which hon. <lb/>
gentlemen opposite, who are now advocating Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights, have forgotten in their definition of <lb/>
that term. I think when the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) better understands <lb/>
this country and its citizens, he will know that <lb/>
Confederation, as was pointed out by the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister and by the hon. member for Northumberland <lb/>
(Mr. Mitchell), is a compromise. Confederation is <lb/>
a compromise in itself, and without Confederation <lb/>
what is Canada, where is it, or where would it be? <lb/>
Canada, therefore, is a compromise, and I believe <lb/>
if Confederation were broken up into its original <lb/>
fragments on a financial question, for example, <lb/>
it is just possible that the scattered members of <lb/>
the old Confederacy might remain in some sense <lb/>
connected with Great Britain and in some sense <lb/>
united to one another; but if this Confederation <lb/>
were torn to pieces by a war of races, there would <lb/>
be no hope of any harmony among its scattered <lb/>
members, there would be no hope of continuing <lb/>
the connection, which so many people desire, <lb/>
with Britain; and there would be no chance, <lb/>
which I feel to be an even more important <lb/>
thing, to build up a great Canadian nation. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman repudiates the idea of being <lb/>
an annexationist. He says, and I do not deny <lb/>
he thinks so too, that he is not working for annexa<lb break="no"/>tion; but I tell him that if his speeches were not <lb/>
answered on this floor, if his sentiments were not <lb/>
repudiated by the great majority of this House, if <lb/>
this Bill were not voted down, he would maketens <lb/>
of thousands of annexationists in the Province of <lb/>

Quebec. If the hon. gentleman will read the history <lb/>
of Canada, even for the last thirty years, he will <lb/>
learn that this very point, which is the object of his <lb/>
attack, formed one of the compromises agreed upon, <lb/>
in which the rights of the minorities were establish<lb break="no"/>ed. Perhaps the hon. gentleman will not acknowledge <lb/>
the authority of the late George Brown on that <lb/>
question, but I think that name will be acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged as a high authority in the Province of <lb/>
Ontario, and the hon. member for North Norfolk <lb/>
(Mr. Charlton) will acknowledge it too. What did <lb/>
George Brown say on that point during the Con<lb break="no"/>federation debates? He put the matter in a nut<lb break="no"/>shell: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The framers of this scheme had immense special diffi<lb break="no"/>culties to overcome. We had the prejudices of race and <lb/>
language and religion to deal with. To assert, then, that <lb/>
our scheme is without fault would be folly. It was ne<lb break="no"/>cessarily the work of concession." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>The hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) <lb/>
expresses the hope that in some mysterious way or <lb/>
other our French Canadian citizens will become <lb/>
Anglo-Saxon. Now, I do not know whether he <lb/>
means Anglo-Saxons of America or Anglo-Saxons <lb/>
of England. A great many attempts have been <lb/>
used, by promises and threats, and even by force, <lb/>
to make the French Canadians Yankees, but they <lb/>
have all failed, and I do not think that by legis<lb break="no"/>lation my hon. friend can hope to make the French <lb/>
Canadians English either. What is, I think, more <lb/>
important to us, is, that by proper and fair treatment <lb/>
we can keep the French people of this country true <lb/>
and loyal Canadians, loyal to the only form of <lb/>
Government which we have in Canada, the <lb/>
Government of Canada by Canadians, under the <lb/>
name of the Sovereign Lady, around whose <lb/>
throne the free people of England also govern <lb/>
themselves. There is no country under the <lb/>
sun in which fanaticism in politics or bigotry <lb/>
in religion is more dangerous than in Canada. <lb/>
Our materials are most inflammable, and it is not <lb/>
only culpable, but it is indeed a political crime for <lb/>
any public man to set the spark to that inflam<lb break="no"/>mable material. We must frown down fanaticism, <lb/>
whether it be shown on the floor of this House or on <lb/>
the streets of Hull, for if it be allowed to take its <lb/>
course, this country would not only be an im<lb break="no"/>possible one to govern, but an unfit one to live <lb/>
in. In view of the present position of affairs, in <lb/>
view of the feeling which has been aroused in <lb/>
this House‚Äînecessarily aroused, as I have shown‚Äî <lb/>
and in view of the fact that there was no real <lb/>
pressing grievance to be remedied by this legisla<lb break="no"/>tion, that there was no outcry from the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, that there was no unnecessary tax put upon <lb/>
the people of the North-West for printing the <lb/>
proceedings in French; this question could have <lb/>
well been left in abeyance. I will not say <lb/>
that the whole thing originated with my hon. <lb/>
friend, for he says it did not, but I know that if <lb/>
the hon. gentleman did not cause the petition to <lb/>
be sent from the North-West Council, it was, at all <lb/>
events, not sent until after he visited the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. I think the origin of the trouble <lb/>
may be very naturally traced to the same source <lb/>
as the origin of the trouble we are now dealing <lb/>
with in this House. The grievance in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories was a small one, an infinitesimal <lb/>
one, and I think it might have been borne with a <lb/>
little longer rather than that bitter feelings should <lb/>
have been aroused. I think We could have waited <lb/>

<cb/>

until the question of a new Constitution for the <lb/>
North-West came up in its natural course before <lb/>
this Parliament by a proposition for creating one <lb/>
or more Provinces in the North-West. If this <lb/>
delay were allowed, I do not see that either the <lb/>
people of the North-West or the Canadian Consti<lb break="no"/>tution would have suffered. I believe that there is <lb/>
no necessity for this Bill at present, and holding this <lb/>
view, had I been within sound of the division bell <lb/>
the other evening, I should have voted for the <lb/>
amendment moved by my hon. friend from Ber<lb break="no"/>thier (Mr. Beausoleil). <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA5">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:EDGA1">Mr. EDGAR</persName>. Yes; I would unquestionably <lb/>
have so voted. I would have moved the six <lb/>
months' hoist, or anything else which would have <lb/>
postponed this Bill, not altogether because of the <lb/>
character of the Bill itself, but because of its pre<lb break="no"/>amble and surroundings, and chiefly of the speeches <lb/>
made by the hon. gentleman, and because the ques<lb break="no"/>tion would settle itself at no distant day. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman says "hear, hear," and appears to be sur<lb break="no"/>prised that I should make that announcement, but <lb/>
I again repeat that I am sorry I was not here to <lb/>
vote for that amendment. In taking this course, <lb/>
I cannot be accused of trying to gain French votes <lb/>
in my constituency, because, so far as I know, these <lb/>
is not one French Canadian in it. The fine con<lb break="no"/>stituency which I represent is largely English and <lb/>
Protestant, but at the same time it is largely liberal, <lb/>
and I shall be very much disappointed if the broad <lb/>
and liberal sentiments which I am tryin to express <lb/>
here, will not meet with the approval of the liberal <lb/>
English-speaking Protestants of my riding, which <lb/>
is in the heart of the great Province of Ontario. I <lb/>
do not hope to catch votes, nor am I afraid of losing <lb/>
votes by the course which I take. While I may <lb/>
not have any claim or right to do so, I will ven<lb break="no"/>ture to make an appeal to my French fellow <lb/>
members in this House. I do hope that they will <lb/>
receive a proposition of a conciliatory character, <lb/>
such as that contained in the amendment of the <lb/>
Minister of Justice, without alarm. Although <lb/>
they may not like everything that is in that propo<lb break="no"/>sition, they have no ground for alarm, in my <lb/>
opinion, when they hear the sentiments expressed <lb/>
towards them by the majority on both sides of this <lb/>
House. I shall also take the liberty of counselling <lb/>
them not to ask for anything unreasonable, or for <lb/>
anything which will give their enemies an excuse <lb/>
for open and continued hostility towards them. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:WHIT4">Mr. WHITE</persName> (Renfrew). At this stage of the <lb/>
debate, and after the many lucid and able argu<lb break="no"/>ments that have been advanced on both sides, I <lb/>
cannot hope to add anything to the information of <lb/>
the House, or to interest it on this question to any <lb/>
degree. Nor, Sir, would I have ventured to <lb/>
have said a word were it not that I do not <lb/>
wish to record a silent vote upon the question <lb/>
now before the House. In the debate that has <lb/>
taken place during the last five or six days, I <lb/>
have been struck with the great unanimity <lb/>
with which hon. members who opposed the pro<lb break="no"/>position of my hon. friend from North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy) have opposed, not the Bill itself, but <lb/>
the preamble with which that Bill has been intro<lb break="no"/>duced. It has been stated by many hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men who have spoken upon this question, that the <lb/>
Bill itself was an innocent measure, but that its <lb/>
preamble is one calculated to excite the feelings of <lb/>

<pb n="903" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00903.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">903</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">904</fw> 

the community, and, therefore, that the Bill ought <lb/>
on that account to be opposed. I have also <lb/>
been struck with the fact that the hon. gentlemen <lb/>
who have opposed the proposition of my hon. <lb/>
friend for North Simcoe, have criticised, not so <lb/>
much the speeches which he has delivered on the <lb/>
floor of Parliament in reference to this measure, as <lb/>
the speeches he has delivered outside of this House. <lb/>
I may say, Sir, frankly, that with many of the aspi<lb break="no"/>rations of my hon. friend for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy) I have no sympathy whatever. There <lb/>
were many things said by that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man during the recess which, perhaps, might <lb/>
as well have been left unsaid, and with which <lb/>
I do not at all concur; but I think every <lb/>
hon. member in this House must admit that <lb/>
the hon. member for North Simcoe has presented <lb/>
his case on the floor of this Parliament with a <lb/>
degree of moderation that ought to commend itself <lb/>
to the House, and which is in marked contrast to <lb/>
many of the speeches that have been delivered in <lb/>
opposition to his measure. Sir, the few words I <lb/>
have to say on this question and the will be <lb/>
very few indeed‚Äîwill have particular reference to <lb/>
the proposition now before the Chair, namely, the <lb/>
amendment moved by the hon. Minister of Justice. <lb/>
I have just stated that the greatest objection <lb/>
offered to this Bill refers to the preamble; that <lb/>
was one of the objections urged by the Minister <lb/>
of Justice in the speech he delivered here the <lb/>
other night. Well, Sir, we had before us last <lb/>
year the consideration of a Bill, the preamble of <lb/>
which was obnoxious to a very large portion of the <lb/>
people of this country‚Äîa preamble calculated to <lb/>
arouse the prejudices, if I may so express it, of <lb/>
a very large number of people, of whom I myself <lb/>
was one. I listened to the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Justice on that occasion taking the ground <lb/>
that the preamble of a Bill was no essential <lb/>
part of the Bill at all. During the recess fol<lb break="no"/>lowing the last Session of Parliament, many of <lb/>
us were called to account by our constit<lb break="no"/>uents for the position we had taken on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion I have just referred to; and I undertook <lb/>
to justify the position I took on that ques<lb break="no"/>tion because I believed that the Government <lb/>
were right and did what they ought to do in <lb/>
the interest of the country. In doing so, <lb/>
I took the ground that the hon. Minister of Justice <lb/>
had taken, that the preamble formed no essential <lb/>
part of the Bill, and ought not to be considered in <lb/>
reference thereto. But we find the hon. Minister <lb/>
of Justice now laying down a new principle and taking <lb/>
the opposite view; he says he has a very strong <lb/>
objection to this Bill because of its preamble. Well, <lb/>
Sir, the hon. member for North Simcoe has stated <lb/>
distinctly that if this Bill passes a second reading, <lb/>
he has no objection to changing the preamble‚Äîthat <lb/>
the House can amend it in any direction they <lb/>
please, or they can strike it out if they please. The <lb/>
whole question presented to this House, divested <lb/>
of all sentiment, and of all appeals to the Province <lb/>
of Quebec or to any other section of the country, <lb/>
is whether it is desirable that that particular clause <lb/>
of the North-West Territories Act should be con<lb break="no"/>tinued on the Statute-book or not. I have no sym<lb break="no"/>pathy with those hon. gentlemen who say that the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe ought not to have <lb/>
moved in this matter, but that it ought to have <lb/>
been left to the members representing North-West <lb/>
constituencies. If the hon. member for North <lb/>

<cb/>

Simcoe believed, as he evidently does believe, that <lb/>
this clause of the North-West Territories Act <lb/>
should be expunged from the Statute-book, <lb/>
it was his bounden duty to bring the question <lb/>
before Parliament, whether he represented a con. <lb/>
stituency in Ontario, in the North-West Territories, <lb/>
or in any other portion of the Dominion. Now, let <lb/>
me say that with the first part of the proposition <lb/>
submitted by the hon. Minister of Justice I concur <lb/>
to a very great extent: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"That this House, having regard to the long continued <lb/>
use of the French language in old Canada, and to the <lb/>
covenants on that subject embodied in the British North <lb/>
America Act, cannot agree to the declaration contained <lb/>
in the said Bill as the basis thereof, that it is expedient <lb/>
in the interest of the national unlty of the Dominion that <lb/>
there should be community of language amongst the <lb/>
people of Canada. That, on the contrary, this House de<lb break="no"/>clares its adherence to the said covenants and its de<lb break="no"/>termination to resist any attempt to impair the same." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Why should we make that declaration, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker? We are not called on to deal with that <lb/>
question at the present time. My hon. friend <lb/>
from North Simcoe, with all his ardor in the di<lb break="no"/>rection he is moving, declared in the speech <lb/>
he made the other night, that it was not <lb/>
his intention to interfere in the slightest degree <lb/>
with the rights conferred on the minorities in the <lb/>
different Provinces by the Act of Confederation. <lb/>
The recognition of those rights is, to a very great <lb/>
extent, the basis of Confederation; it was because <lb/>
of the concession of them to the minorities in the <lb/>
different Provinces that Confederation was made a <lb/>
possibility; and, therefore, I would be one of the <lb/>
last to interfere with them in the slightest degree, <lb/>
whether in the Province of Quebec, the Province <lb/>
of Ontario, or any other Province in this Dominion. <lb/>
But I take it that we are not called upon, <lb/>
on the present occasion, to deal with that <lb/>
question at all. No proposition has been <lb/>
submitted to this House to interfere in the <lb/>
slightest degree with the rights of the minorities <lb/>
conferred upon them by the Act of Confederation, <lb/>
and, therefore, in my judgment at any rate, the <lb/>
recital in this resolution is entirely unnecessary. <lb/>
Then, I come to the other part of the question. <lb/>
The hon. Minister of Justice has laid down the <lb/>
proposition here that certain matters should be <lb/>
left to the final decision of the North-West Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, after the next general election. Well, Sir, <lb/>
if he had enlarged the scope of his proposition <lb/>
I do not say I would not agree with him; <lb/>
but he has confined it to two points. The first, <lb/>
refers to the use of the French language in the <lb/>
Legislative Assembly of the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories; but, in the speech he delivered here the <lb/>
other night, the hon. Minister stated, that if a <lb/>
number of French gentlemen were elected to repre<lb break="no"/>sent portions of the North-West Territories in the <lb/>
Legislature, they would be permitted to use their <lb/>
language on the floor of that Legislature, as a matter <lb/>
of courtesy if not as a matter of right, so that it <lb/>
seems to me that the concession proposed to be <lb/>
made by this resolution is no concession at all. <lb/>
The second point refers to the printing of the <lb/>
roceedings of the North-West Legislature in the <lb/>
French language. Why, Sir, we have the autho<lb break="no"/>rity of my hon. friend from West Assiniboia <lb/>
(Mr. Davin), who ought to know, perhaps, better <lb/>
than any other man in Canada‚Äîalmost as <lb/>
    well even as the Regina <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> itself‚Äî <lb/>
what is the practice in that section of the <lb/>

<fw type="num">905</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 20, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">906</fw>

country; and he stated as a fact that the <lb/>
proceedings of the North‚ÄîWest Legislature were <lb/>
not printed in the French language at all. So that <lb/>
it seems to me the proposition submitted to the <lb/>
House by my hon. friend the Minister of Justice <lb/>
will confer on the North-West Legislature practi<lb break="no"/>cally no benefit whatever; and, therefore, while <lb/>
they have been asking this House for bread, we <lb/>
shall, if we pass this resolution, be giving them a <lb/>
stone. What does the hon. Minister say with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the use of the French language in the <lb/>
courts? He says that it would be a manifest <lb/>
injustice to the people of that country if they were <lb/>
precluded from using the French language in the <lb/>
courts. What argument did the hon. Minister <lb/>
use in respect to that contention‚Äîleaving aside <lb/>
altogether the constitutional argument, with which <lb/>
I do not propose to deal, but to speak of the <lb/>
injustice which he declared would be perpetrated <lb/>
upon the 1,500 French people and upon the 3,000 <lb/>
odd French half-breeds, a large proportion of <lb/>
whom, it has been stated in this debate, are <lb/>
incapable of speaking the French language at all, <lb/>
and only understand their mother tongue, the <lb/>
Indian? I say there would be no greater in<lb break="no"/>justice in not allowing them to have the use of <lb/>
French in their courts than there is in not allow<lb break="no"/>ing the use of the French or the German language <lb/>
in the courts of the Province of Ontario, where <lb/>
there are over 200,000 Germans, and upwards <lb/>
of 100,000 French people. Can it be argued for <lb/>
a moment that any greater injustice will be <lb/>
perpetrated on the people of the North-West <lb/>
Territories by preventing the use of the French <lb/>
language in the records and proceedings before <lb/>
the courts, than is perpetrated upon the French; <lb/>
or Germans in the Province of Ontario by not <lb/>
using the languages of these people in that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince? I have yet to learn that any miscarriage of <lb/>
justice has occurred, or that there has been any <lb/>
complaint of any miscarriage of justice because of <lb/>
the non-use of the French or of any other foreign <lb/>
language in the courts in that Province. It seems <lb/>
to me, therefore, that the argument of the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Justice in that respect has very little force. <lb/>
I would have been pleased, I frankly admit, be<lb break="no"/>cause I have the greatest respect for the opinion of <lb/>
my leader, if I could have agreed to the proposi<lb break="no"/>tion which the Minister of Justice proposed to this <lb/>
House; but holding the views I do on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and believing, as I do, that the opinion of the <lb/>
people of the North-West Territories, as shown by <lb/>
their petitions to this Parliament, ought to have <lb/>
some force and effect, I find myself incapable of <lb/>
voting for that resolution. <lb/></p> 

<p>It being six o'clock, the Speaker left the chair. <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:BARR6">Mr. BARRON</persName>. When, before recess, I had the <lb/>
pleasure of hearing my hon. friend the member for <lb/>
Northumberland (Mr. Mitchell) rise in his seat and <lb/>
say that he, an old parliamentarian, an old member <lb/>
of this House, rose to speak on this serious and <lb/>
important question with a good deal of diffidence, <lb/>
I confess to having then experienced some feeling <lb/>
of regret that I, a young member, had made up my <lb/>
mind to speak on this burning question; but I <lb/>
hope the hon. members of this House will see that, <lb/>
in rising to speak, notwithstanding my youth, I <lb/>

<cb/>

do so solely under a keen sense of duty to my <lb/>
constituents, who expect me in this matter to give <lb/>
my decided views one way or the other. I do not <lb/>
think any hon. member of this House feels more <lb/>
conscious than I, of the great necessity we are under <lb/>
to say nothing to-night. or hereafter during this de<lb break="no"/>bate, which may in any way continue the ill-feeling <lb/>
that, perhaps, has been engendered during this <lb/>
debate. I am conscious of this necessity, not only <lb/>
out of respect for the high official position which <lb/>
you, Sir, so worthily occupy, not only out of <lb/>
respect for our own individual selves, and not only <lb/>
out of respect for the French members from the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, representing a great and free elect<lb break="no"/>orate, but because, Sir, I know full well that a harsh <lb/>
or hasty word spoken to-night, however true its text <lb/>
may be, is more calculated to repel than to induce <lb/>
a calm and dispassionate judgment; and so I hope, <lb/>
when I shall have resumed my seat, that I shall be <lb/>
able, on looking back over what I have said, to <lb/>
conclude that I have spoken calmly and dispassion<lb break="no"/>ately, although already words have been spoken <lb/>
which have grated somewhat harshly on the ears <lb/>
of hon. gentlemen who may think as I do, and who <lb/>
may vote as I intend to vote on this important ques<lb break="no"/>tion. But if I do give offence to any creed or to any <lb/>
person, I hope hon. gentlemen will see it is because I <lb/>
am now in the years of enthusiasm, because I be<lb break="no"/>lieve in the assertion of free speech and free thought, <lb/>
knowing. as I do, that in past history these two ele<lb break="no"/>ments have led to the highest kind of legislation‚Äî <lb/>
legislation tending to peace on earth and goodwill to<lb break="no"/>wards men. I have said that words have been <lb/>
spoken during this debate which fell unpleasantly <lb/>
on the ears of hon. gentlemen in this House. Need <lb/>
I say to whose language I refer? Need I say that <lb/>
the hon. the Minister of Public Works, more than <lb/>
any hon. gentleman in this House, has, during this <lb/>
debate, made use of language calculated to do <lb/>
serious harm throughout the country at large. <lb/>
I say, Sir, that his language was most fanatical, <lb/>
most inflammatory, and not justified at all by <lb/>
that of the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
(Mr. McCarthy); but, assuming for a moment, <lb/>
which I do not now admit, that the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe did say what, perhaps, in <lb/>
his calmer judgment, he would not have said, two <lb/>
wrongs do not make a right; and, therefore, the <lb/>
hon. the Minister of Public Works ought not to <lb/>
have used the language he did, and, coming from <lb/>
a gentleman in his exalted position, it was most <lb/>
dangerous to the peace and the welfare of the <lb/>
community at large. Bad enough would that <lb/>
language have been had it come from an ordinary <lb/>
member; bad enough would it have been had <lb/>
it come from a member of the Government, sitting <lb/>
behind the hon. gentleman, but, infinitely mis<lb break="no"/>chievous was it coming from the Minister of <lb/>
Public Works, who is second in command to the <lb/>
right hon. gentleman who leads this House. The <lb/>
hon. the Minister of Public Works spoke of the <lb/>
loyalty of the French Canadians. I admit, and I <lb/>
rejoice in the fact, that there are no more loyal <lb/>
men in the community than the French Canadians, <lb/>
but I do not propose to admit, as worthy of our <lb/>
admiration‚Äîif I may be allowed to speak for a <lb/>
moment in their behalf‚Äîthe example set us by the <lb/>
hon. the Minister of Public Works in the gentle<lb break="no"/>man to whom he referred, for British Cana<lb break="no"/>dians cannot see much loyalty to admire or <lb/>
respect in a gentleman, who one moment re<lb break="no"/>

joiced in the tricolor of France, and the next <lb/>
gave three cheers for the British Crown. <lb/>
The loyalty I admire is that of such a man <lb/>
as Montcalm, who fought to the bitter end. The <lb/>
loyalty I admire is that of the French Canadians, <lb/>
who, when tempted by the Americans, re<lb break="no"/>fused to yield to temptation and remained <lb/>
loyal to the British Crown. Then, I can<lb break="no"/>not but recall the remarks made by the <lb/>
hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) when he <lb/>
undertook to criticise the remarks of the hon. <lb/>
member for West Durham (Mr. Blake). He devoted <lb/>
half an hour to abuse and vituperation against the <lb/>
hon. member for West Durham‚Äîagainst the very <lb/>
gentleman whom the right hon. the First Minister <lb/>
asked to come to his assistance in this serious and <lb/>
important matter. What must have been the <lb/>
feelings of the hon. member for East Grey when, <lb/>
after abusing that hon. gentleman, he heard, a <lb/>
day or two later, his leader ask him to come to <lb/>
his assistance, in order to bridge over this diffi<lb break="no"/>culty? When I heard the hon. member for East <lb/>
Grey presuming to criticise the course of the hon. <lb/>
member for West Durham, and when I saw the <lb/>
dignified, stately form of the hon. member for <lb/>
West Durham, and contrasted his hearing with <lb/>
that of the hon. member for East Grey, I could <lb/>
not help thinking of the cartoon in which asinged cat <lb/>
was depicted as hissing and spitting at a great <lb/>
Bengal tiger. But, much as I respect and admire <lb/>
the hon. member for West Durham, exalted as is <lb/>
his ability, I regret to have to say that, in some <lb/>
particulars, I cannot follow him in the speech he <lb/>
addressed to this House a few nights ago. It is <lb/>
not my fault, but my misfortune, and no one <lb/>
regrets it more than I, that the constituency <lb/>
which I have the honor to represent did not send <lb/>
a gentleman of greater ability and of more astute <lb/>
mind to follow the hon. member for West Durham <lb/>
in the vote he proposes to give, and in the language <lb/>
he addressed to this House. But I shall refer to his <lb/>
remarks a few minutes later, when I come to that <lb/>
portion of my speech. For the present I wish to <lb/>
refer to the remarks addressed to this House last <lb/>
night by the hon. the Minister of Justice. It is <lb/>
with pride and pleasure that I see that hon. <lb/>
gentleman rise to address this House. It is with <lb/>
delight that I look forward to a literary treat when <lb/>
I see he intends to speak; and it was with pleasure <lb/>
that I saw him rise to move, as he did move, the <lb/>
amendment which is now before the House. But <lb/>
I confess to a feeling of great disappointment when <lb/>
he sat down; I confess that my idol was struck to <lb/>
the ground, because we found that the Minister of <lb/>
Justice had actually swallowed himself; that he, who <lb/>
within one year since declared that the preamble to <lb/>
an Act was of no moment, now declared that it <lb/>
was of the greatest possible importance. In the <lb/>
debate on the Jesuits' Estates Act, he said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Now, let me again, before I leave the subject of the <lb/>
Act, call the attention of the House to the fact that all <lb/>
the argument which has been made with regard to the <lb/>
necessity for disallowance is based on objections to the <lb/>
preamble of the Act. In the history of disallowance in <lb/>
this country, in the history of the disallowance of our own <lb/>
statutes in the mother country‚Äîand we know that scores <lb/>
of them were disallowed‚Äîthe records will be searched in <lb/>
vain to find one which was disallowed because the pre<lb break="no"/>amble was not agreeable to anybody. I do not retend <lb/>
to dispute the statement of my hon. friend from Muskoka <lb/>
(Mr. Brien) that the preamble is a part of the Act. So <lb/>
is the title a part of the Act, and so are the head-notes of <lb/>
sections; but has anyone ever heard of a Government be<lb break="no"/>ing asked to disallow an Act because they did not like the <lb/>

<cb/>

wording of the title or of the head-notes. The preamble <lb/>
is understood to be a part of the Act for the purpose of in<lb break="no"/>terpreting the Act, but there is nothing in this Act for <lb/>
which interpretation is needed, and I distinguish, in refer<lb break="no"/>ring to this the most trivial and technical objection which <lb/>
could be taken to a statute, between those parts of the <lb/>
preamble which assert that certain correspondence has <lb/>
passed, such as this between the Premier and the Cardinal <lb/>
at Rome, and those preambles which recite certain agree<lb break="no"/>ments which the statute validates." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Then, further on, he says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I assert, without fear of contradiction among people <lb/>
who will consider this matter in a calm and businesslike <lb/>
way, that that part of the preamble which is the only part <lb/>
relevant to the purposes of the Act itself, is utterly harm<lb break="no"/>less, entirely businesslike, free from the slightest suspi<lb break="no"/>cion of derogating from any right of Her Majesty, and <lb/>
from the slightest suspicion of infringement of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>These were the words spoken a short year ago <lb/>
by the hon. the Minister of the Justice, when it <lb/>
appeared to be his purpose to minimise the import<lb break="no"/>ance of a preamble to an Act. But it will be in <lb/>
the recollection of hon. members that, on that <lb/>
occasion, the preamble was made, by a special <lb/>
enacting clause, part and parcel of the Act itself; <lb/>
and, therefore, it was that some hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposed, as I did, the Act, because the pre<lb break="no"/>amble which was made a part of it was most offen<lb break="no"/>sive. What lawyer in this House will assume <lb/>
that the preamble is of any importance so long as <lb/>
the Act itself is clear and beyond doubt? First, <lb/>
however, let me draw attention to the fact that <lb/>
the member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), <lb/>
having heard the objections made to the preamble, <lb/>
said at once, in effect, I do not consider it offensive, <lb/>
but, if any hon. gentleman does so, I will <lb/>
consent to have it struck out in Committee. The <lb/>
Minister of Justice, the other night, did not <lb/>
take a particle of notice of the concession or offer <lb/>
made by the hon. member for North Simcoe. It <lb/>
appeared to me that he refused to take notice of <lb/>
that offer or to comment upon it. It appeared to <lb/>
me that he was anxious that this apparently <lb/>
offensive preamble should continue in the Bill, so <lb/>
that he might have some argument and grievance <lb/>
on which to build an argument in this House. <lb/>
I say that there was nothing in the preamble to <lb/>
this Act. I mean by that, that no matter how <lb/>
offensive it might be‚Äîand I am not going to argue <lb/>
that just now‚Äîthis House has no right to consider <lb/>
the preamble so long as the enacting clause is <lb/>
beyond any doubt, and I think there are very few <lb/>
lawyers in this House who will deny the truth of <lb/>
that proposition. I will not venture, young as I <lb/>
am, to address a legal argument to this House <lb/>
coming from myself, and I prefer to read authori<lb break="no"/>ties proving my contentions. I shall read from <lb/>
Maxwell on Statutes, an authority which, I think, <lb/>
will be acknowledged as sufficient. On page 56, <lb/>
Maxwell says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"But the preamble cannot either restrict or extend the <lb/>
enacting part when the language of the latter is plain, <lb/>
and not open to doubt either as to its meaning or its <lb/>
scope." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BARR6">Mr. BARRON</persName>: The hon. member for Bothwell. <lb/>
interrupts me by saying "hear, hear" ‚Äîmeaning, I <lb/>
suppose, that the language of the enacting clause <lb/>
is not plain. The hon. gentleman can read English <lb/>
and so can I, and neither he nor anyone else can <lb/>
contend that the enacting clause of this Bill is not <lb/>
so plain that any child can understand it. What <lb/>

<fw type="num">909</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 20, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">910</fw>

is the Bill? Simply that the 110th section of the <lb/>
North-West Territories Act shall be repealed, so <lb/>
there can be no ambiguity about the enacting <lb/>
clause, and therefore the preamble is a matter of no <lb/>
possible moment. The authority I have quoted <lb/>
goes on to say: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"It is not unusual to find that the enacting part is not <lb/>
exactly co-extensive with the preamble. In many Acts <lb/>
of Parliament, although a particular mischief is recited, <lb/>
the legislative pro visions extend beyond it. The reamble <lb/>
is often no more than the recital of some of the incon<lb break="no"/>veniences, and does not exclude any others for which a <lb/>
remedy is given by the statute. The evil recited is but <lb/>
the motive for legislation; the remedy may both con<lb break="no"/>sistently and wisely be extended beyond the cure of that <lb/>
evil; and if on a review of the whole Act a wider inten<lb break="no"/>tion than that expressed in the preamble appears to be <lb/>
the real one, effect is to be given to it, notwithstanding the <lb/>
less extensive import of the preamble." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>But it may be said that in this case the preamble <lb/>
is more extensive than the enacting clause, and, if <lb/>
I stop there, it would be said that I had not <lb/>
answered the question as to the importance of the <lb/>
preamble. But, on page 62, I find: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Where the preamble is found more extensive than the <lb/>
enacting part, it is equally inefficacious to control the <lb/>
effect of the latter, when otherwise free from doubt." <lb/></p></quote>

<p>Then on page 61, this work proceeds: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"It has been sometimes said that the preamble may <lb/>
extend but cannot restrain the enacting part of a statute. <lb/>
But it would seem difficult to support this preposition. * * * <lb/>
In a word, then, it is to be taken as a fundamental <lb/>
principle, standing, as it were, at the threshold of the <lb/>
whole subject of interpretation, that the intention of the <lb/>
Legislature is invariably to be accepted and carried into <lb/>
effect, whatever may be the opinion of the judicial inter<lb break="no"/>preter of its wisdom or justice. If the language admits of <lb/>
no doubt or secondary meaning, it is simply to be obeyed, <lb/>
without more ado. If it admits of more than one construc<lb break="no"/>tion , the true meaning is to be sought, not on the wide sea of <lb/>
surmise and speculation, but 'from such conjectures as <lb/>
are drawn from the words alone or something contained <lb/>
in them;' that is, from the context viewed by such light <lb/>
as its history may throw upon it, and construed with the <lb/>
help of certain general principles, and under the influence <lb/>
of certain presumptions as to what the Legislature does <lb/>
or does not generally intend." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>Great as my respect is for the hon. member for <lb/>
Bothwell (Mr. Mills), great as is my admiration <lb/>
for the hon. member for West Durham (Mr. <lb/>
Blake), much as I respect and admire the hon. the <lb/>
Minister of Justice, I prefer to take the views of <lb/>
Maxwell as to the meaning of the preamble to an <lb/>
Act. Let me give the House an instance where <lb/>
the preamble to an Act proved entirely ineffica<lb break="no"/>cious. There was a statute under which the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was raised as to the legality of the Orange <lb/>
Association in England, in or about the year 1832. <lb/>
The preamble to the Act recited that it was <lb/>
"directed against secret or oath-bound societies," <lb/>
and the argument was made that by reason of that <lb/>
statute, 29 George III, and by reason of that pre<lb break="no"/>amble, the Orange society was illegal. But it was <lb/>
found that the enacting clause did not go to the <lb/>
extent of the preamble, and the opinion was given by <lb/>
such gentlemen as Sergeant Lewis, Sir Wm. Howe, <lb/>
Sir Robert Gifford, Mr. Gurney, Mr. Gasalee and Mr. <lb/>
Adolphus, men, some of whom afterwards adorned <lb/>
the bench, and reached high positions in the ser<lb break="no"/>vice of their country; all of them gave the opinion <lb/>
that by reason of the enacting clause not going to <lb/>
the extent of the preamble, therefore the society <lb/>
itself was not illegal. Now, the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Justice proposes an amendment, and I must say <lb/>
that it struck me that that amendment was as <lb/>
inconsistent and as incongruous as the far-famed <lb/>
autumn leaves of Vallambrosa; but after all, what <lb/>
does it amount to? It admits the principle of the <lb/>

<cb/>

hon. member for North Simcoe as advanced by his <lb/>
Bill; it admits that the time may come when dual <lb/>
language must be abolished in the North-West; it <lb/>
says in effect that we will not do to-day what we <lb/>
shall do to-morrow; therefore I say that when the <lb/>
Minister of Justice brings in his amendment pro<lb break="no"/>posing to do this a few days, months or years hence <lb/>
‚Äîperhaps not by this House, but to give others the <lb/>
power to do it‚Äîwhy, Sir, he practically gives <lb/>
away the case to the member from North Simcoe. <lb/>
What is that amendment? <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"That all the words after 'Resolved' be expunged, and <lb/>
the following substituted: <lb/></p> 

<p>"That this House, having regard for the long continued <lb/>
use ofthe French language in old Canada and to the <lb/>
covenants on that subject embodied in the British North <lb/>
America Act, cannot agree to the declarations contained <lb/>
in the said Bill as a basis thereof, namely, that it is ex<lb break="no"/>pedient in the interest of the national unity of the <lb/>
Dominion that there should be unity of languuge amongst <lb/>
the people of Canada. That, on the contrary, this House <lb/>
declares its adhesion to the said covenants and its de<lb break="no"/>termination to resist any attempt to impair the same." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>Now, it seems to me that the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe has never disputed these premises. <lb/>
So far as I am concerned, I here declare that if the <lb/>
member for North Simcoe attempted in any way <lb/>
to interfere with the rights of our fellow-country<lb break="no"/>men in the Province of Quebec, so far as the use of <lb/>
the French language is concerned, I would resist <lb/>
that attempt to the utmost. But we have heard <lb/>
it here declared by the member for North Simcoe, <lb/>
time and time again, both in his speech in intro<lb break="no"/>ducing this Bill and in his speech the other night, <lb/>
that that was not his intention, and, therefore, it <lb/>
seems to me that we may agree with these premises. <lb/>
The amendment of the Minister of Justice then <lb/>
goes on: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"That at the same time this House deems it expedient <lb/>
and proper, and not inconsistent with those covenants that <lb/>
the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories <lb/>
should receive from the Parliament of Canada power to <lb/>
regulate, after the next general election of the Assembly <lb/>
the proceedings of the Assembly and we manner of <lb/>
recording and publishing such proceedings." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>Sir, I was prepared to take the objection that that <lb/>
amendment did not go far enough, that it did not <lb/>
include the ordinances, it did not include the <lb/>
statutes, it did not include the proceedings in the <lb/>
courts; but this objection, on my part, was <lb/>
anticipated by the First Minister when he spoke <lb/>
to-night, and explained that it was no matter, that <lb/>
the reason they were not included in this amend<lb break="no"/>ment was that the ordinances were published by <lb/>
this Parliament, or were under the control of this <lb/>
Parliament, and, therefore, this amendment went <lb/>
far enough. I confess that that answer of the <lb/>
First Minister is a complete answer to the objec<lb break="no"/>tion I would have raised to this amendment not <lb/>
including the ordinances and the statutes. But <lb/>
the Bill of the hon. member for Simcoe may be <lb/>
passed, and still the ordinances and statutes will <lb/>
be published in both languages. Why? Because, <lb/>
what the Bill of the member for North Simcoe <lb/>
proposes is simply to repeal the 110th section <lb/>
of the North-West Territories Act , which <lb/>
has nothing whatever to do with the public<lb break="no"/>ation of the ordinances and the statutes which, <lb/>
as the First Minister stated this afternoon, <lb/>
were under the control of this Parliament, and <lb/>
therefore would be published in both languages. <lb/>
Now, if the Bill of the member from North Simcoe <lb/>
were to become law the statutes and the ordinances <lb/>
relating to the North-West Territories would still <lb/>

<pb n="911" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00911.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">911</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">912</fw> 

be published in both languages for the reason I <lb/>
have stated. Now, I stated in the opening of my <lb/>
remarks that I would be compelled to refer briefly <lb/>
to the remarks of the hon. member for West Dur<lb break="no"/>ham (Mr. Blake), and in doing so let me state that <lb/>
no one has any idea of the reluctance with which I do <lb/>
so, because I have such an unbounded respect and <lb/>
high admiration for that hon. gentleman, and I am <lb/>
always ready and willing, so far as I can, to bend <lb/>
my will to the will of the hon. member for West <lb/>
Durham, so long as my conscience and my better <lb/>
judgment allow me to do so. But upon this occa<lb break="no"/>sion I am unable to do so, and I want to refer to <lb/>
one or two matters upon which he has spoken, and <lb/>
upon which, to my mind, he appeared to me to <lb/>
take up a wrong position. He said that the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Council had no right to speak upon this im<lb break="no"/>portant matter, and he used this language: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The North-West Assembly had no permission or <lb/>
authority from this Parliament, its creators, to deal with <lb/>
this question at all, and the electors to that Assembly had <lb/>
not before them, when the Assembly was elected, any pro<lb break="no"/>position upon that subject. So, neither was there an <lb/>
authority in the body, nor was there the provision in the <lb/>
constitution." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, there can be no possible doubt <lb/>
of the truth of that proposition, nobody ever denied <lb/>
it; but at the same time, to say that the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories had no right to speak out upon <lb/>
this matter, is setting forth a proposition which <lb/>
cannot possibly be accepted. Why, Sir, if it is <lb/>
correct that the North-West Council had no right <lb/>
to speak out upon the subject-matter of this Bill, <lb/>
then how much more are we stultifying ourselves <lb/>
in this House in the action we have taken, when, <lb/>
during my short period in Parliament, we have <lb/>
already spoken out upon matters relating to the <lb/>
entire Empire, more especially the subject of Home <lb/>
Rule. Sir, if the hon. member is right in his con<lb break="no"/>tention, then we never had the right to do that; <lb/>
still we did it, and if we did that, with still greater <lb/>
reason may the representatives of the North-West <lb/>
Assembly speak out upon that question which <lb/>
peculiarly affects themselves. But in addition to <lb/>
the fact that the North-West Council have, by the <lb/>
resolution forwarded to the member for North <lb/>
Simcoe and placed upon the Table of this House, <lb/>
spoken out in very strong and plain language upon <lb/>
this subject, we have also other means of <lb/>
information whereby we know that it is the <lb/>
almost unanimous wish of the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories to abolish the dual language. The <lb/>
hon. member from North Simcoe read, I believe, <lb/>
some telegrams the other night which were ques<lb break="no"/>tioned by the hurried interruption of the Secretary <lb/>
of State. He read one, I believe, signed by a <lb/>
gentleman named McCaul. I happen to have the <lb/>
pleasure of knowing that gentleman, and I am <lb/>
quite confident from my knowledge of him, he <lb/>
being a son of the late Dr. McCaul, President of the <lb/>
University Of Toronto, that he is utterly incapable <lb/>
of sending such a telegram as was read by the <lb/>
member from North Simcoe, unless the statements <lb/>
contained in it were accurate in everyparticular. Let <lb/>
    me read from the Calgary <hi rendition="simple:italic">Harold</hi>, February 7, in <lb/>
regard to the dual language in the North-West: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Here is a system which none of us ever asked for, <lb/>
which was imposed upon the North-West without its pre-<lb break="yes"/>knowledge or consent; a system which we have no need <lb/>
of, which we most decidedly object to as useless and <lb/>
costly; and the opportunit bein offered of assisting a <lb/>
movement to rid the North-West of the system, our duty <lb/>
is plain." <lb/></p> 
</quote>

<cb/>

        <p>Then I have a quotation from the Calgary <hi rendition="simple:italic">Herald</hi> <lb/>
of 13th February, sent by a gentleman whose posi<lb break="no"/>tion ought not to be disputed, because he is one of <lb/>
the Queen's Counsel lately appointed by the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Justice himself. I refer to Mr. James Bruce <lb/>
Smith, of Calgary. He has sent me the Calgary <lb/>
            <hi rendition="simple:italic">Herald</hi> of the 13th February, containing certain <lb/>
resolutions passed at a public meeting at Calgary <lb/>
on the evening before, which I shall read to the <lb/>
House: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Resolved, That the use of a dual language in official <lb/>
proceedings in the North-West Territories is unneces<lb break="no"/>sary, expensive, and calculated to prevent the complete <lb/>
union of the several nationalities who reside in the <lb/>
Territories, and that to bring about a united Canadian <lb/>
people in this part of the Dominion, the English language <lb/>
alone should be legalised for use in the proceedings of <lb/>
the Legislative Assembly, the courts, and all other <lb/>
official bodies. <lb/></p> 

<p>"Resolved, That this meeting heartily endorses the <lb/>
action of the Legislative Assembly at Regina, in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the dual language, and requests that the petition <lb/>
presented to the Dominion Government in pursuance of <lb/>
such action be granted. <lb/></p> 

<p>"Resolved, That a copy of the above resolutions be <lb/>
forwarded to D. W. Davis, M,P., Dalton McCarthy, M.P., <lb/>
the Hon. James A. Lougheed, and the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and that D. W. Davis, M.P., be requested to for<lb break="no"/>ward in every way the movement for the abolition of <lb/>
French as an official language in the Territories." <lb/></p>
        </quote>
        <p>
I may, perhaps, be allowed by way of interjection, <lb/>
to read a statement prepared by Mr. Cayley, a <lb/>
gentleman well known to the First Minister, who, <lb/>
speaking of the cost of publishing the ordinances, <lb/>
resolutions, proceedings, and so forth, in the <lb/>
French language, says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The estimated population of the Territories is 100,000, <lb/>
of whom French an Half-breeds form one-fifth. The <lb/>
cost of French printing in 1883 was $350: in 1887 it had <lb/>
risen to $1,000 for printing and $1,000 for translation. <lb/>
The latter cost $3,000 for three years. Of 500 copies of <lb/>
the Territorial ordinances printed, 126 were distributed; <lb/>
the balance lay on the shelves at Regina and a large pro<lb break="no"/>portion of the 126 went to persons (official and others) who <lb/>
could speak English." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>So I think we have sufficiently heard from the <lb/>
North-West Territories as to their views regard<lb break="no"/>ing this important matter. But I have heard it <lb/>
said that there have been counter-petitions pre<lb break="no"/>sented by the hon. member for Alberta (Mr. Davis), <lb/>
petitions purporting to be very numerously signed, <lb/>
asking for the retention of the dual language. I <lb/>
do not doubt that if any one takes the trouble to <lb/>
examine these petitions he will be very much im<lb break="no"/>pressed with some of them. There is a great sim<lb break="no"/>ilarity of writing between the signatures to those <lb/>
petitions, and I think we all know that about the <lb/>
easiest thing in the world is to get up a petition. <lb/>
I recollect perfectly well that petitions were <lb/>
sent here very numerously signed against the Fran<lb break="no"/>chise Act, that iniquitous measure to which the First <lb/>
Minister is so strongly pledged, and upon an exa<lb break="no"/>mination of the petitions it appeared that among <lb/>
the names of those asking for the repeal of the <lb/>
Franchise Act was the name of the First Minister <lb/>
himself. The celebrated Chartist petitions con<lb break="no"/>tained the signatures of Her Majesty the Queen, <lb/>
Prince Albert, the Duke of Wellington, Sir <lb/>
Robert Peel and Lord John Russell. We find <lb/>
also that upon an investigation into the question <lb/>
of petitions addressed to the House of Commons <lb/>
in England, it was found that numerously signed <lb/>
petitions contained only two or three different forms <lb/>
of handwriting. I read somewhere that a petition <lb/>
was addressed to ex-President Cleveland, when he <lb/>
was Sheriff in the State of New York, purporting <lb/>

<pb n="913" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00913.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">913</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 20, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">914</fw>

to have been signed by the friends and relatives of <lb/>
the ex-President himself, asking Mr. Cleveland as <lb/>
Sheriff that instead of hanging a criminal he would <lb/>
hang himself. So, I think, we see that very little <lb/>
importance is to be attached to any petitions, no <lb/>
matter how they are prepared, but especially <lb/>
petitions coming from the North-West Territories, <lb/>
containing prayers against the wishes of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people there. I think all hon. <lb/>
members must have been greatly impressed with <lb/>
the speech of the hon. member for Bothwell <lb/>
(Mr. Mills), and I certainly was so impressed. <lb/>
I read it with a great deal of pleasure and care, <lb/>
because, as a literary effort, it could hardly be <lb/>
excelled; but I think that his whole speech from <lb/>
the beginning to the end was based on a wrong <lb/>
assumption. It appears to me that the hon. <lb/>
gentleman started with wrong premises entirely on <lb/>
which he built his argument; that his contention <lb/>
from the beginning to the end of his speech was <lb/>
that it was the intention of the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) to entirely eradicate <lb/>
the French language. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). So he says. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BARR6">Mr. BARRON</persName>. And upon these premises the <lb/>
hon. gentleman built his argument. The hon. <lb/>
member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) says, so the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe says. If he says so, I <lb/>
have not heard it; and if he says so now, I will <lb/>
take my seat and not support his Bill, because I <lb/>
say it would be criminal, indeed, to endeavor <lb/>
to shut the mouths entirely of the French people, <lb/>
and eradicate the French language. What did <lb/>
the hon. member for Bothwell say? <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The hon. gentleman proposes to act towards the <lb/>
French population of this country in much the same <lb/>
way that the brother of Robert, Duke of Normandy, <lb/>
acted towards him. He proposes to put out their eyes. <lb/>
He says: Forget your mother tongue, forget the craters <lb/>
and statesmen, the novelists and historians, the poets <lb/>
and philosophers of France, and then you will begin to <lb/>
qualify yourselves for becoming good British subjects. <lb/>
If you understand the language, if you appreciate its <lb/>
beauties, if you admire its expressmn or its wisdom, or <lb/>
its elasticity, then it is impossible that you can be a loyal <lb/>
subject, it is impossible that you can be devoted to the <lb/>
maintenance of the Federal union. This is the position <lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:BARR6">Mr. BARRON</persName>. The hon. member for Bothwell <lb/>
says "hear, hear." All I can say is this, that I do <lb/>
not understand that to be the position of the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy); but, <lb/>
on the contrary, if language means anything, if the <lb/>
English language can be comprehended, I under<lb break="no"/>stood him to say the direct opposite‚Äîthat he has <lb/>
no desire to eradicate the French language or des<lb break="no"/>troy it, but that, simply for purposes of conveni<lb break="no"/>ence, he desires that in the North-West Territories, <lb/>
as his Bill says, section 110 of the North-West <lb/>
Territories Act, providing that the proceedings be <lb/>
printed in both languages, should be repealed. <lb/></p> 

<p>An <persName ref="pers:ANON1">hon. MEMBER</persName>. Ask him. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BARR6">Mr. BARRON</persName>. We have asked him; we have <lb/>
his speech. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). Did the hon. member <lb/>
for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) not argue that there <lb/>
could be no such thing as national unity without <lb/>
one language, and did he not quote Freeman and <lb/>
Max Miiller for the purpose of establishing that <lb/>
proposition? <lb/></p>

<cb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA5">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. I disclaim having argued <lb/>
any such ridiculous proposition. I argued that <lb/>
community of language tended to unity, not that <lb/>
it was necessary. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). That it was necessary. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA5">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. No. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BARR6">Mr. BARRON</persName>. But the member for Bothwell <lb/>
(Mr. Mills) says it is the same thing. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). I did not say it was <lb/>
the same thing. I stated he said so. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BARR6">Mr. BARRON</persName>. Well, he argues, as I understand, <lb/>
that the proposition of the member for North Sim<lb break="no"/>coe is the same thing almost as if he proposed to <lb/>
reject the French language entirely. That conten<lb break="no"/>tion reminds me of a story in a little book called <lb/>
"Alice in Wonderland," which all hon. gentlemen <lb/>
who may be happy enough to have families, no <lb/>
doubt, have read. Little Alice was seated at the <lb/>
head of the table, and there were present a hatter, <lb/>
a March hare, and a dormouse. An argument <lb/>
announced by little Alice did not seem quite to suit <lb/>
the hatter, and so the hatter said: "You might <lb/>
just as well say, little Alice, that because 'I see <lb/>
what I eat,' that it is the same thing as 'I eat <lb/>
what I see;'" and the March hare also rejoined: <lb/>
"You might just as well say that because 'I like <lb/>
what I get," it is the same thing as that 'I get What <lb/>
I like;'" and the dormouse said: "Because, little <lb/>
Alice, I breathe when I sleep, you might say it is <lb/>
the same thing as that I sleep when I breathe;" and <lb/>
the hatter, summing up the propositions, said <lb/>
that little Alice must expect such inconsistent <lb/>
propositions as these, if she was to stand by the <lb/>
argument she advanced a few moments ago. I think <lb/>
if the hatter in the story were in this House he <lb/>
would have addressed the hon. member for Both<lb break="no"/>well (Mr. Mills) regarding his argument in much <lb/>
the same way as he admonished little Alice on <lb/>
the particular occasion I have spoken of. It is <lb/>
impossible for me, not being a historian, to <lb/>
follow the hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) <lb/>
in his historical crusades throughout the universe. <lb/>
He travelled up and down longitudes and back and <lb/>
forward over latitudes to find authorities to show <lb/>
that it is in the interests of the unity of the Empire <lb/>
and of the country that dual language should be <lb/>
retained. The hon. member introduced us to the <lb/>
Jews, to the Gentiles, and to the Greeks; he <lb/>
then took us among the Parthians, the Medes, <lb/>
the Alamites; then he brought us to dwell in <lb/>
Mesopotamia and Judea, and back again to the <lb/>
reign of Ahasuerus; then he asked us to travel <lb/>
with him mentally among the Italians of Malta, <lb/>
and then jumped across the Atlantic to take us <lb/>
among the French of Quebec. Then he introduced <lb/>
us among the Dutch of the Cape, took us to Cal<lb break="no"/>cutta among the Hindoos, and then among the <lb/>
Chinese of Hong Kong. He talked of the Helots of <lb/>
Sparta, and travelled in and out among the Ionian <lb/>
Islands. He took us back to the Roman Empire, and <lb/>
then with one stupendous bound brought us among <lb/>
the Algonquin tribes of the North-West. All this <lb/>
for the purpose of showing us that dual language <lb/>
is not harmful, but that it is, in fact, rather <lb/>
desirable to have a variety of languages, and <lb/>
thereby the unity of the Empire is perpetuated and <lb/>
secured. But, Sir, the hon. member for Bothwell <lb/>
(Mr. Mills), from the Alpha to the Omega of his <lb/>
speech, never said one word about that great exam<lb break="no"/>

ple shown us by the country to the south of us‚Äî <lb/>
I refer to the United States. Although the hon. <lb/>
gentleman referred to almost every country of the <lb/>
universe, he never once said a solitary word about <lb/>
the example shown us by the United States. There <lb/>
is not a doubt that in that great country their <lb/>
stupendous advance in civilisation and their im<lb break="no"/>mense advance in national strength and power, <lb/>
have been to a very great extent secured by the <lb/>
fact that they have one common school system, <lb/>
and one language from the Atlantic to the Pacific <lb/>
and from the Gulf of Mexico to the boundaries <lb/>
which separate them from Canada. I do not pro<lb break="no"/>pose to follow the different members of this House <lb/>
who have given us the examples of Germany, <lb/>
Poland, Finland, Russia and other countries. I <lb/>
prefer to take the statement of the hon. gentleman <lb/>
from Albert (Mr. Weldon), a gentleman whom <lb/>
this House recognises as a great student of history <lb/>
and as one more able to speak on this important <lb/>
matter than gentlemen who within the last three <lb/>
or four months have refreshed their memories and <lb/>
secured new information with the object of address<lb break="no"/>ing the House on this question. The member for <lb/>
Albert says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I concur in the opinion that it is desirable, other <lb/>
things being equal, without breaking faith, that govern<lb break="no"/>ment is easier and that friction is less among a people in <lb/>
a country which has a homogeneous people. This remark <lb/>
is made by one whose duty all his life has been to study <lb/>
history, and I venture to say there is not in Europe a <lb/>
single example of a nation with two rival races jealously <lb/>
preserving their own nationality, and nearly equal in <lb/>
strength which is at all commensurate with her resources <lb/>
and population as compared with a homogeneous nation." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>I listened to the remark of the hon. the Premier <lb/>
himself when he replied to the leader of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition‚Äîa leader for whom we all have more than <lb/>
ordinary respect and towards whom we entertain <lb/>
feelings akin to love and affection. This makes it <lb/>
all the harder for me to speak on this occasion, for <lb/>
I know that in saying what I do say and in feel<lb break="no"/>ing as I do feel, I am not in accord with the views <lb/>
of the Liberal leader; but, on the contrary, I am <lb/>
doing that, and I am saying that, and I shall vote <lb/>
that way which is contrary to his wishes, and <lb/>
perhaps shall hurt his feelings in a way I would <lb/>
not like. I think that the hon. the leader of the <lb/>
Opposition was right when he said that at all times <lb/>
in the history of Canada the rights of the minority <lb/>
were disregarded by the Conservative party. We <lb/>
have only to go back to the times of the "Family <lb/>
Compact." We have only to go back to the seign<lb break="no"/>iorial tenures‚Äîthe abolition of which the right <lb/>
hon. gentleman took credit for the Conservative <lb/>
party, to prove this. Why, Sir, everything in the <lb/>
way of reform which has been done by the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party (if my reading of history is cor<lb break="no"/>rect) has been brought about by the bayonet of <lb/>
argument addressed by the Reform party to the <lb/>
Conservative party of this country. The Conserva<lb break="no"/>tives have been forced time and time again to do <lb/>
that which they say now they did willingly, but <lb/>
which they only did willingly because it was done <lb/>
for the purpose of preserving themselves in <lb/>
power. We find now that the Conservative <lb/>
party in this House are actually, partially acceding <lb/>
to the proposition of the hon. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). If the hon. the First <lb/>
Minister regards the rights of the minority, why <lb/>
did he not support the amendment of the hon. <lb/>
member for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil)? No; on the <lb/>

<cb/>

contrary, to please a certain portion of the com<lb break="no"/>munity, he goes against that which he has spoken <lb/>
for this afternoon, and brings in a clear amendment <lb/>
in favor of abolishing the dual language. The only <lb/>
difference between the amendment of the hon. <lb/>
Minister of Justice and the Bill of the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe is that the hon. Minister refuses <lb/>
to do to-day that which the hon. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe wants done to-day, but he says he will do <lb/>
it to-morrow, which after all, becomes, except <lb/>
in point of time, practically the same thing. The <lb/>
hon. Minister appeals to this House, not to be <lb/>
possessed of animus, not to create racial or creed <lb/>
animosity. We know that the right hon. First <lb/>
Minister is the general-in-chief of Mr. Meredith, <lb/>
who is carrying on a crusade against Mr. Mowat <lb/>
in respect to Separate Schools and the alleged use of <lb/>
French in the schools in Ontario; and if the right <lb/>
hon. gentleman is consistent, after the language he <lb/>
used this afternoon, he will write to Mr. Meredith <lb/>
and tell him to stop this crusade; and not only so, <lb/>
but he will support Mr. Mowat in his efforts to do <lb/>
what is right and just to the French minority in <lb/>
that Province. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). Follow the example of <lb/>
the Opposition here. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BARR6">Mr. BARRON</persName>. Yes; he has had to appeal to <lb/>
the hon. leader of the Opposition here, and to the <lb/>
hon. member for West Durham, and they, being <lb/>
possessed of patriotic feeling, desire to help the <lb/>
Premier in this great difficulty; but the right hon. <lb/>
the Prime Minister cannot be consistent so long as <lb/>
he assists and upholds Mr. Meredith in Ontario in <lb/>
his present crusade, and addresses the House as he <lb/>
did this afternoon. I was surprised, Sir, to hear <lb/>
the right hon. gentleman stigmatise the resolution <lb/>
of the hon. member for North Simcoe as the sting <lb/>
of a gnat. I do not know whether he meant that <lb/>
the resolution itself was a gnat, or that the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe was a gnat; if he <lb/>
referred to the hon. member, he made a very <lb/>
unhappy reference. Let me tell the House, what <lb/>
the gnat really is‚ÄîI suppose he meant the com<lb break="no"/>mon gnat, because that is the animal that does the <lb/>
stinging: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The usual special representative of the family is the <lb/>
common gnat, whose blood-sucking propensities have <lb/>
rendered it too well known. It pierces the skin with the <lb/>
needle-like lancets of its rostrum, which are barbed at <lb/>
the tips, and gradually inserts the whole of these organs, <lb/>
at the same time liquifying the blood by some fluid secre<lb break="no"/>tion, which apparently adds to the subsequent irritation." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>And the hon. First Minister spoke of the irritation <lb/>
caused by the sting of the gnat. But here is the <lb/>
peculiar part of it. If the hon. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe is a common gnat, he must be a female <lb/>
gnat, because it is only the female gnat that inserts <lb/>
this irritating fluid which is spoken off: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The female alone attacks man, and in default of her <lb/>
favorite food will feed on the honey of flowers." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>But there is danger in calling my hon. friend from <lb/>
North Simcoe a gnat, because the gnat has a very <lb/>
numerous family and it increases very rapidly, and <lb/>
if there are very many of them produced, it will <lb/>
be a very serious matter for the Government: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"One little gnat will produce millions of its kind in a <lb/>
single summer. So short a time is occupied by the entire <lb/>
series of metamorphoses that many generations are per<lb break="no"/>fected in a single season. Their spontaneity and ease in <lb/>
their evolutions is such that they will fly untouched in a <lb/>
shower of rain." <lb/></p>

<p>But here is some little comfort for the hon. First <lb/>
Minister. I think it is the poet Spencer who states <lb/>
that when gnats collect numerously around steeples <lb/>
firemen have been called out, only to discover that <lb/>
the alarm was not for a real fire, but only for the <lb/>
appearance of smoke; so that I may offer this <lb/>
consolation to the First Minister, that, perhaps, all <lb/>
the efforts of the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
will only end in smoke. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. LISTER</persName>. You should have left that part <lb/>
out. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BARR6">Mr. BARRON</persName>. I do not say that, but I want <lb/>
to give the First Minister some little comfort under <lb/>
the circumstances. Now, I want to refer to a <lb/>
point made by the hon. member for Albert (Mr. <lb/>
Weldon), for whom, as a constitutional lawyer, we <lb/>
must have the greatest possible respect, and I refer <lb/>
to it more particularly because the point was also <lb/>
raised by the hon. Minister of Justice. The hon. <lb/>
member in his speech said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"As I sit down my attention has been called by the <lb/>
hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Girouard) to a con<lb break="no"/>stitutional point which, I think, might be very well stated <lb/>
at this juncture, namely, that whatever we desire to do in <lb/>
the North-West Territories in regard to the schools or the <lb/>
Assembly or the printing of papers or judicial proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, we have no power under the constitution to deal with <lb/>
the use of the French language in the courts; for section <lb/>
133 of the British North America Act reads as follows:‚Äî <lb/></p> 

<p>"'Either the English or the French language may be <lb/>
used by any person in the debates of the Houses of Par<lb break="no"/>liament of anada and of the Houses of the Legislature <lb/>
of Quebec; and both those languages shall be used in the <lb/>
respective records and journals of those Houses; and <lb/>
either of those languages may be used by any person, or <lb/>
in any pleading or process in or issuing from any court <lb/>
of Canada established under this Act."' <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>The hon. Minister of Justice advanced the argu<lb break="no"/>ment that the Bill would not be effectual in des<lb break="no"/>troying the use of the French language in the <lb/>
courts of the North-West Territories, because those <lb/>
courts were courts of Canada established under <lb/>
this Act. I deny that proposition. I say the courts <lb/>
in the North-West Territories are simply local <lb/>
courts. It is true, they were created by the <lb/>
Parliament of Canada; but they are not the courts <lb/>
to which this section refers. It refers to the <lb/>
Supreme Court and the Exchequer Court in the <lb/>
city of Ottawa; but, you might as well say that the <lb/>
different courts in the Province of Ontario were <lb/>
courts of Canada under this section, as to claim <lb/>
that the courts of the North-West Territories are <lb/>
courts of Canada established under this Act. Now, <lb/>
Sir, I desire to thank the House for the patient <lb/>
hearing they have given me speaking on this <lb/>
question, which has been discussed for four or five <lb/>
days, and which must be more or less threshed out <lb/>
at all points. But I may be permitted in closing <lb/>
to read from a little work on the Upper Houses <lb/>
published by the late Senator Trudel in 1880, an <lb/>
extract which I think justifies me in coming to the <lb/>
conclusion that it would be well indeed, in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories, not to perpetuate the social, the <lb/>
religious, and the national feelings which Mr. <lb/>
Trudel says must be perpetuated in the Province of <lb/>
Quebec. What I am about to read is my own trans<lb break="no"/>lation, and, therefore, I read it subject to correc<lb break="no"/>tion. At page 6 Senator Trudel says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"And if the Federal idea prevailed, it was owing to <lb/>
the Province of Quebec which at no price would have <lb/>
accepted 'Legislative Union.' <lb/></p> 

<p>"In the case of Quebec, there was a host of social, re<lb break="no"/>ligious and national distinct interests, which she <lb/>
could not dream, for an instant, of entrusting to a <lb/>
maiority of race, creeds, and customs essentially differ<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

ent from those of the greater part of her population, <lb/>
however well disposed this majority might be towards <lb/>
us. <lb/></p> 

<p>"That she would not have desired, on any considera<lb break="no"/>tion, to accept such a union, our Province has evidenced <lb/>
by contending, with all the energy of men fighting to the <lb/>
death, against representation based on population. <lb/></p> 

<p>"The Federal sytem might have been organised by con<lb break="no"/>centrating, under the general Government, all matters <lb/>
of pre-eminent importance, or of superior social and <lb/>
economic interest, leaving to the control ofthe Local <lb/>
Legislatures matters of inferior moment, in such a way <lb/>
as to leave them only large municipal councils. <lb/></p> 

<p>"But then Quebec would have refused to enter the <lb/>
Union, because this federation would have been equiva<lb break="no"/>lent, so far as she was concerned. to a Legislative men, <lb/>
and then, good-bye to Confederation! <lb/></p> 

<p>"Because it was not in matters of lower importance, <lb/>
and of merely municipal interest, that our Province <lb/>
wished to have under its sole control. What Quebec de<lb break="no"/>sired, was to see placed under the jurisdiction the <lb/>
Provincial Legislature, and consequently under its ex<lb break="no"/>clusive protection, all its interests the most dear in a <lb/>
social, religious and national point of view, that is to <lb/>
say, the greater portion of interests of importance, <lb/>
which it is of consequence that a people should preserve <lb/>
inviolate." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>The sentiments and the views expressed in that <lb/>
article I think are such we ought not to desire to <lb/>
perpetuate in the North-West Territories; and I‚Äî <lb/>
therefore, say, in conclusion, that I am glad to be <lb/>
able to support the Bill of the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe, believing that if there is anything <lb/>
offensive in it, it will be amended in Committee, so <lb/>
as to make it satisfactory to the keenest sensibili<lb break="no"/>ties of any hon. gentleman in this House. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:COOK5">Mr. COOK</persName>. Some days ago, when the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), was <lb/>
making an arrangement with the right hon. the <lb/>
First Minister to set apart a day for the discussion <lb/>
of this question, I stated that I would not be able <lb/>
to be present on account of an engagement which <lb/>
I had, and would, therefore, be prevented, if the <lb/>
question then came to a vote, giving expression to <lb/>
my opinions before this House; and I took occa<lb break="no"/>sion to state, in view of this possibility, that I <lb/>
intended to vote against the Bill of the hon, mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe. Fortunately, however, I <lb/>
was present last night to give my first vote on this <lb/>
question. I may add that as the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe was engaged in a matter pertaining <lb/>
to his profession in which I happened to be on <lb/>
the side opposite to him, and which was postponed <lb/>
by arrangement, he is here, I may say, at my will. <lb/>
But the hon. gentleman stated, when I declared <lb/>
my intention of voting against his Bill, that I <lb/>
had made up my mind to vote without hearing <lb/>
the discussion. Well, the hon. gentleman forgot <lb/>
that he had made a speech in this House, and <lb/>
several speeches in the country, foreshadowing <lb/>
his measure, and he forgot also that I had read <lb/>
the Bill and the preamble, and was, therefore, in a <lb/>
position to come to a decision. The Bill of itself, with<lb break="no"/>out the preamble, was sufficient ground for me, with<lb break="no"/>out hearing any further discussion‚Äîwithout hear<lb break="no"/>ing any of the speeches made‚Äîto determine to <lb/>
vote against the Bill; because I am opposed to <lb/>
the extermination of the French language in any <lb/>
part of the Dominion. I must confess that I was <lb/>
somewhat surprised when I first heard of the hon. <lb/>
gentleman's intention to move in this direction. <lb/>
This discussion has taken a very wide range. It <lb/>
has travelled from one end of the world almost to <lb/>
the other, and references have been made during it <lb/>
to questions affecting many other countries, some<lb break="no"/>what similarly situated to ours. I do not pro<lb break="no"/>pose, even if I deemed myself sufficiently versed <lb/>

in historical knowledge to do so, to follow hon. <lb/>
gentlemen who have so ably discussed this ques<lb break="no"/>tion from a historical point of view, but shall <lb/>
confine myself more particularly to our own <lb/>
country and to the antecedents of my hon. friend <lb/>
from North Simcoe. I have said that I was con<lb break="no"/>siderably surprised to see my hon. friend moving <lb/>
in this direction; for I well remember the time <lb/>
when he was bowing the knee to the French people <lb/>
of his constituency, and professed to be as true <lb/>
and loyal a supporter of theirs as any man in this <lb/>
House or out of it. I well remember the time when <lb/>
that hon. gentleman, instead of being in line with <lb/>
this crusade against race and religion, which has <lb/>
been mapped out by the Mail newspaper, and is sup<lb break="no"/>ported by a few of his friends throughout the coun<lb break="no"/>try, took the opposite course; for I well remember <lb/>
when that hon. gentleman, one Saturday night in <lb/>
his constituency, when he found he could not reach <lb/>
Toronto the next day, Sunday, engaged a special <lb/>
train to go to that city, and arrived there in the <lb/>
morning, in order to interview Archbishop Lynch <lb/>
on Sunday, to obtain His Grace's support in that <lb/>
county. I well remember then how loyal the <lb/>
hon. gentleman was to a paternal ancestor of his <lb/>
of a more remote date than his immediate paternal <lb/>
ancestor, who supported a different religion from <lb/>
the one the hon. member for North Simcoe does, <lb/>
or the one his father did. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
was then holding out his hand to a certain class; <lb/>
or it might be said that he was bowing the knee to <lb/>
Rome, and at the same time, on the other hand, <lb/>
bowing the knee to Ulster. In each case he was <lb/>
true to his blood. In the one he was true to his <lb/>
paternal ancestor of a more remote date, and in the <lb/>
other to his father. Therefore he could, with some <lb/>
show of fairness, say that he was true to both of <lb/>
his paternal ancestors. I do not know how far the <lb/>
hon. gentleman went himself in both directions; <lb/>
but I know that in the contests in which I had <lb/>
the honor of being his opponent in North Simcoe, <lb/>
my hon. friend did receive the support of a large <lb/>
number of the Roman Catholics and of the French <lb/>
people in that riding. But the gerrymander has <lb/>
removed a certain portion of these people from his <lb/>
riding, and he is not now quite so dependent on <lb/>
them as he was on that occasion. <lb/></p> 

<p>An hon. MEMBER. Not so dependent. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:COOK5">Mr. COOK</persName>. Not so dependent. I believe they <lb/>
were all gerrymandered out. I have no doubt hon. <lb/>
members will recollect the Act that was passed by <lb/>
the First Minister, by which he placed my hon. <lb/>
friend in a safe Tory constituency, but I warn my <lb/>
hon. friend from North Simcoe to look out for his <lb/>
political hide at the next election. Formerly <lb/>
he had the support, as I have said, of the French, <lb/>
the Catholics and the Orangemen, and so well did <lb/>
he carry on this warfare, and so ingeniously did he <lb/>
proceed, that he had a member of his family lead<lb break="no"/>ing the singing in a Roman Catholic church at mass <lb/>
every Sunday. Then we have the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
exemplification of the way in which he did things. <lb/>
You all remember the way in which he acted in <lb/>
reference to the dismissal of Mr. Letellier from the <lb/>
Lieutenant Governorship of the Province of Quebec. <lb/>
At that time the hon. gentleman's heart was still <lb/>
"true to Poll." He stood by his friends, he stood <lb/>
by the Ultramontanes, and assisted to dislodge the <lb/>
Lieutenant Governor of that Province. Now, what <lb/>
is the meaning of this crusade? There are a great <lb/>

<cb/>

many opinions given by a great many different <lb/>
people. Some say that the hon. gentleman is <lb/>
in league with the First Minister. Some say <lb/>
it is a Tory dodge, that he is appealing to <lb/>
the Ontario portion of the electors and that <lb/>
some other parties are appealing to the Que<lb break="no"/>bec portion of the electors of this Dominion <lb/>
so as to prepare a jumble for the next election. I <lb/>
do not pretend to say which opinion is the correct <lb/>
one. It is stated that a certain newspaper would <lb/>
like to have some assistance from places in high <lb/>
quarters, the newspaper which, within a few <lb/>
years, has been feeding pretty liberally at the Tory <lb/>
crib, since the hon. gentlemen have been in power, <lb/>
even since they have pretended to abandon it, the <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mail</hi> newspaper, and have built up the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Empire</hi>, in <lb/>
order to show that they had the two organs. Now, <lb/>
they have the two organs. The hon. the leader of <lb/>
    the Government is backed up by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Empire</hi>; the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) has <lb/>
    the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mail</hi> at his back; and it is said that the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mail</hi> <lb/>
demands that a new party should be formed to <lb/>
force matters upon the attention of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment; that is, that they should have the balance <lb/>
of power in this House. We know what use <lb/>
would be made of it by some gentlemen <lb/>
in this House. I am sure my hon. friend <lb/>
from North Victoria (Mr. Barron) would not be <lb/>
a party to that, though he criticised very freely <lb/>
the speeches of some of the members in this House. <lb/>
They were principally on the Liberal side, because <lb/>
he did not find anything in the speeches on the other <lb/>
side worth criticising, and he wanted to make a <lb/>
    speech. Then there is another theory. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mail</hi> <lb/>
newspaper had an agent at Washington not long <lb/>
since, and it appears that he was giving some extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary views and statements to the Congressional <lb/>
Commission who were sitting there at that time. <lb/>
        This gentleman, who is the editor of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mail</hi> news<lb break="no"/>paper, declared that there was a strong annexation <lb/>
feeling in this country, and even went so far as to say <lb/>
that it would be found in this House. When the <lb/>
loyal motion of my hon. friend from North York <lb/>
(Mr. Mulock) was voted upon and unanimously <lb/>
adopted here, I think that Commission would come <lb/>
to the conclusion that the statements of that man <lb/>
were fallacious. I must say that I would have <lb/>
preferred if that loyal resolution had contained a <lb/>
clause showing that we were to be more loyal to <lb/>
Canada. I think some hon. gentlemen need a little <lb/>
training on the score of loyalty to Canada. I <lb/>
think a little advice on that subject would not hurt <lb/>
the leader of the Government. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>.I would like to <lb/>
have the advice. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:COOK5">Mr. COOK</persName>. I think the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
who supported that resolution, would do better to <lb/>
show a little more of that loyalty to his own country <lb/>
which he expressed in his speech. I regret <lb/>
exceedingly that I have to refer to one matter <lb/>
which I dislike very much to refer to. I have to <lb/>
refer to my hon. friend from North Norfolk <lb/>
(Mr. Charlton), a gentleman who, I admit, stands <lb/>
high in this country, a man of great intellectual <lb/>
ability, a man who made a very strong and well <lb/>
reasoned speech from his point of view. It was <lb/>
not such an inflammatory speech as that made by <lb/>
my hon. friend the member for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy) in introducing his Bill. That was a <lb/>
speech which was intended to set the people by <lb/>

<pb n="921" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00921.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">921</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 20, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">922</fw> 

the ears, to set the Protestant element against the <lb/>
Roman Catholic element, to throw a torch into the <lb/>
magazine, a speech which showed that the man <lb/>
who wanted to get his Bill through the House <lb/>
had no other object than that. I cannot believe <lb/>
that any man of common sense-and we know that <lb/>
the member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) has <lb/>
a great deal of common sense-would have intro<lb break="no"/>duced the Bill in the way in which he did intro<lb break="no"/>duce it without such a motive. But my hon. <lb/>
friend from North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) referred <lb/>
to the French Half-breeds and held them respons<lb break="no"/>ible for the rebellion. I remember when that hon. <lb/>
gentleman stood up in this House, and made a <lb/>
charge against the Government in that respect, <lb/>
and exonerated the Half-breeds from the charge of <lb/>
bringing about the rebellion. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
should not attempt to remove so important a <lb/>
matter from the shoulders of a Government who <lb/>
are distinctly responsible for that, and to place it <lb/>
on the shoulders of the Half-breeds who had been <lb/>
suffering for seven long years without obtaining <lb/>
redress. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I referred to the Half-<lb break="yes"/>breeds of the North‚ÄîWest as having been in re<lb break="no"/>bellion, and I said the question to be settled was <lb/>
whether they were more to be blamed or the hon. <lb/>
gentlemen who sat upon the Treasury benches. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:COOK5">Mr. COOK</persName>. I read the hon. gentleman's speech, <lb/>
and thought I was correct, but of course I accept <lb/>
his statement. I regret also to have to refer <lb/>
to the speech of the hon. the Minister of <lb/>
Public Works. I have been supporting the cause <lb/>
which he supports. I believe it is the proper and <lb/>
just course to take in this House; but I am afraid <lb/>
that, notwithstanding the usual calmness of the <lb/>
hon. gentleman, he was too inflammatory on that <lb/>
occasion. It was not the words so much as the <lb/>
manner, and the manner was very bad. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman should be a little more cautious, and if he <lb/>
had only read carefully and pondered over the <lb/>
speech made by the Governor General at Quebec, <lb/>
when he received the committee of Equal Righters <lb/>
there, and told them to be tolerant and go home <lb/>
and be good boys and not to do it again‚Äîif he <lb/>
had only used a little tolerance in his language, I <lb/>
think it would have been better for his cause in <lb/>
this House. I am very sorry to say that I believe <lb/>
that it was the means of diverting from the cause <lb/>
he has at heart some members on both sides of <lb/>
this House‚Äîalthough I will not say so, because, <lb/>
probably, I am not entitled to say much on that <lb/>
point. Sir, I would just refer, while we are upon <lb/>
this French question, to the fact that a <lb/>
great many members in this House and <lb/>
people throughout the country who read the <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mail</hi> newspaper, speak of the French in very <lb/>
slighting terms-I will not say the members of <lb/>
this House, but I know that many people in this <lb/>
country speak of the French in such terms. Now, <lb/>
I have been associated with the French more or <lb/>
less all my life, and it is not necessary for me to <lb/>
vindicate their habits and course of life, or any<lb break="no"/>thing of that sort, or their motives. But there is <lb/>
one thing that we owe to the French people of this <lb/>
country, and it is a debt of gratitude, after passing <lb/>
the loyal resolution to Her Majesty that we had <lb/>
the privilege of doing here a short time ago. If it <lb/>
had not been for the United Empire loyalists, of <lb/>
which I am a lineal descendant, and the French <lb/>

<cb/>

people, we would not have any Canada to-day, <lb/>
we would have been annexed to the United States, <lb/>
and we would not have had the privilege of passing <lb/>
that loyal resolution. Sir, nothing good can come <lb/>
from the attacks upon the French, nothing but had <lb/>
blood, rebellion and civil war. As the Premier said <lb/>
to-night, supposing anything of that sort should <lb/>
arise, where would we be? Why, Sir, we would be <lb/>
nowhere; we would be nowhere as Canadians, as <lb/>
a British dependency; we would be in the hands <lb/>
and in the arms of the United States in a very short <lb/>
time. <lb/></p> 

<p>Some <persName ref="pers:ANON1">hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh; hear, hear. <lb/></p>
        <p>
<persName ref="pers:COOK5">Mr. COOK</persName>. The very hon. gentlemen who <lb/> 
are now screaming out at the top of their <lb/>
voices, the very men who claim to be patriots <lb/>
in this country to-day, are the men who would <lb/>
drive Canada to annexation. I do not say <lb/>
they would do it intentionally, but they would <lb/>
do it in ignorance of the facts of the case. We. <lb/>
do not want a repetition in this country of the <lb/>
difficulties that have beset Ireland for the last few <lb/>
centuries; we do not want any of their fire-brands <lb/>
in this country, we do not want any of those agi<lb break="no"/>tators coming over here to ruin our country. <lb/>
The Secretary of State has passed an Act to pro<lb break="no"/>hibit the Chinese; perhaps he had better include <lb/>
gentlemen of this class, gentlemen who are agita<lb break="no"/>tors; but my hon. friend, when he was imported, <lb/>
was so small that we could not have told whether <lb/>
he was an agitator or not. Now, Sir, it has been <lb/>
said that the Premier of this country is very de<lb break="no"/>sirous that the Local Government of Ontario <lb/>
should not be sustained. It has been stated that <lb/>
"Mowat must go." That is an old saying, an old <lb/>
by-word, but as yet he has not gone. Now, <lb/>
some people are wicked enough to say that even Mr. <lb/>
Meredith is included in this controversy. We know <lb/>
he made a speech on this very line in the city of <lb/>
London; but, if he takes that ground, I will guar<lb break="no"/>antee that he will not be successful at the next <lb/>
general election. Sir, it has been stated by some of <lb/>
our friends‚Äîand I differ with the greater number <lb/>
            of my friends in that respect‚Äîthat we, as a party, <lb/>
are provincial rights men. We go for provincial <lb/>
rights, but, Sir, I draw the line at this race ques<lb break="no"/>tion; most of my friends do not. I say that if this <lb/>
House passes that Bill, and difficulties arise in the <lb/>
North‚ÄîWest, the minority in Lower Canada may be <lb/>
in jeopardy some time, and not very far off, because <lb/>
we know the intention of the hon. gentleman. How<lb break="no"/>ever he may disclaim his intention to the House, <lb/>
we know from his organs, and from his speeches all <lb/>
along the line, that unless his words belie his <lb/>
meaning, he proposes to exterminate the French <lb/>
language throughout the length and breadth of <lb/>
this Dominion. Now, suppose that provincial rights <lb/>
were extended to cover this question of race. In <lb/>
Lower Canada the English language might be <lb/>
expunged, and what would be the result? The <lb/>
result would be that the English people of Ontario <lb/>
would not submit to that, and civil war would <lb/>
<choice><sic>he</sic><corr>be</corr></choice> sure to take place, and the result would be <lb/>
disastrous. Why, Sir, this is a wicked thing, <lb/>
when you come to look at it. When you come to <lb/>
look at it in all its phases, when you see that the <lb/>
hon. gentleman intends to set race against race, <lb/>
and religion against religion, and when all men <lb/>
will have hold of each other's throats, you see that <lb/>
it is a wicked thing. Now, I do not like the motion <lb/>

<pb n="923" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00923.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">923</fw>

of the Minister of Justice, because this question is <lb/>
only to be left until the next election in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, and then a decision is to be given, and I <lb/>
believe hon. gentlemen know pretty well what that <lb/>
decision is going to be. They want to put off the <lb/>
evil day, and I believe that it would have been <lb/>
better to have met the thing boldly and moved the <lb/>
six months' hoist, and so do away with the matter <lb/>
altogether. I believe that is the best way to put <lb/>
down these fanatics. I was somewhat amused at the <lb/>
hon. leader of the Government this afternoon. He <lb/>
was a very bold man this afternoon, he was very <lb/>
courageous, and he held the sword over his head and <lb/>
defied those gentlemen who are opposing him in re<lb break="no"/>ference to this matter. But he was quite mild the <lb/>
other day. When he made his two speeches before, <lb/>
they were just as tame and mild as a sucking dove's <lb/>
speech. But the hon. gentleman was quite bold <lb/>
to-day, for, after making arrangements, by which <lb/>
hon. gentlemen on this side of the House would <lb/>
help him through the difficulty, he gets up in his <lb/>
place and he declares here: "We will stand or <lb/>
fall by this, we are going to make this question"‚Äî <lb/>
well, he did not say a Government question, but <lb/>
he meant that. His speech reminded me very <lb/>
much of an Irishman that came to this country <lb/>
when it was first being settled. One day there <lb/>
came a bear into the house while the Irishman and <lb/>
his wife were there. He ran up stairs and cried <lb/>
out "Biddy, kill the bear." So Biddy killed the <lb/>
bear, and he came down very courageous, and <lb/>
when the neighbors came in he says: "Look what <lb/>
Biddy and I did: we killed the bear." Now, the <lb/>
Irishman had a good deal more‚ÄîI will not say <lb/>
honor, but he had a good deal more generosity; for, <lb/>
although he took credit to himself, he gave Biddy <lb/>
a share of the credit. But the hon. gentleman <lb/>
took all the credit to himself; he did not even <lb/>
give my hon. friends on this side of the House <lb/>
any share of it whatever, and I hope before this <lb/>
debate is through the hon. gentleman will <lb/>
announce, so it may go to the country, that <lb/>
he did not do this thing all alone. I am <lb/>
a great admirer of the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe, and always have been so. I know <lb/>
he is a great lawyer and an astute politician; it is <lb/>
claimed that he is a man of undoubted pluck and <lb/>
determination. The hon. member for Northum<lb break="no"/>berland (Mr. Mitchell) said the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe was full of pluck and determination, <lb/>
and although he had been castigated by almost all <lb/>
the members of the House, he had never yielded. <lb/>
The hon. member has not shown so much pluck in <lb/>
the past as the member for Northumberland <lb/>
imagines. If we refer to the past we find that on <lb/>
one occasion he introduced into this House a Bill <lb/>
to prevent people being injured on railways. He <lb/>
was not successful, and he did not introduce it the <lb/>
next year. Determination is shown by a man <lb/>
keeping introducing the same measure year after <lb/>
year, if it is a good one until he succeeds. Next, <lb/>
the hon. gentleman introduced a Bill for the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of a railway commission. He was sat <lb/>
upon by the Premier, and he finally withdrew it. <lb/>
Then he had some litigation for a gentleman in the <lb/>
matter of patents, and he thought it would be a <lb/>
good thing to regulate the Patent Office. He intro<lb break="no"/>duced a Bill for that purpose, but the late Minister <lb/>
of Railways sat on him, and that was the last <lb/>
of the Bill. I do not know how often the <lb/>
hon. gentleman has been sat upon in this House. <lb/>

<cb/>

It is also said by people outside that the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman endeavored, in his legal profession, to <lb/>
make people believe that he ran the late Minister <lb/>
of Justice, and that he had a great deal of influ<lb break="no"/>ence with him; but since the present Minister <lb/>
came into office his influence has vanished, and <lb/>
that is one of the reasons why he is not now in <lb/>
happy accord with the Government. It has been <lb/>
stated by the Minister of Public Works‚ÄîI have <lb/>
great confidence in the Minister of Public Works, <lb/>
although he sometimes gets a little excited; I have <lb/>
great confidence in his integrity, and I do not <lb/>
believe he would wilfully make an untruthful <lb/>
statement to the House; the hon. gentleman <lb/>
stated that all the French printing for the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories had cost only $400 a year, and <lb/>
he was so magnanimous as to say that if any one <lb/>
objected to the amount, he would put his hand <lb/>
into his pocket and pay it every year. That was <lb/>
a generous proposition from the hon. Minister, and <lb/>
no doubt he is sincere and will do it. Let me re<lb break="no"/>fer, for a moment, to the St. Catharines Milling <lb/>
Company. They obtained, from this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, a license to cut timber in a territory <lb/>
where they had no right, and the result was <lb/>
they had considerable litigation, and the <lb/>
Government stood sponsors to the company <lb/>
for their costs. The hon. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) was selected solicitor for <lb/>
the company, and he received a total sum of <lb/>
$33,500 for legal expenses. The hon. gentleman is <lb/>
afraid that this country will be ruined because of <lb/>
the enormous expenditure going on; but I will <lb/>
give the hon. gentleman this assurance, that at the <lb/>
rate the hon. Minister of Public Works stated as <lb/>
the cost, the French printing in the North-West <lb/>
could be maintained for 84 years for the costs in <lb/>
that suit. The hon. gentleman wants to do some<lb break="no"/>thing as a patriot, and I have no doubt he is <lb/>
sincere in his wish. I was a little impressed, <lb/>
however, with the story, which is going round, <lb/>
that there is collusion between the hon. the First <lb/>
Minister and the hon. gentleman, because the hon. <lb/>
the First Minister never said an unkind word to <lb/>
him, or even had a look of scorn; in fact, he was <lb/>
as pleasant with the hon. gentleman as if they <lb/>
were both sailing in the same boat. It looked <lb/>
very much as if the report was true; still, <lb/>
one may be deceived by the very fact that hon. <lb/>
gentlemen opposite look so pleasantly confident, <lb/>
especially when they have got into a tight place. <lb/>
I have known some of the antecedents of the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe. We had four con<lb break="no"/>tests in North Simcoe, and probably we would <lb/>
have had another, except for the fact that <lb/>
the hon. the First Minister gerrymandered <lb/>
the constituency. I am very sorry he did <lb/>
so, because I would have liked to have beaten the <lb/>
hon. gentleman just once more. In almost every <lb/>
address made to the electors by the hon. gentleman <lb/>
during the time I was an opposing candidate he <lb/>
always strongly advocated the cause of temperance. <lb/>
Although he was a great temperance a vocate, <lb/>
almost the first thing he did on coming into this <lb/>
House was to introduce an intemperate ill, which <lb/>
he had no right to introduce, and which cost the <lb/>
country a quarter of a million of dollars. In order <lb/>
to be able to estimate the value of an hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's promises and pledges you must know the <lb/>
man, and judge what he will do by his past con<lb break="no"/>duct. Some people also say that the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>

<pb n="925" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00925.jpg"/>

man has not been received as kindly in court as <lb/>
formerly. It is also well known that in those four <lb/>
contests large sums were expended, and the hon. <lb/>
gentleman thought he should be reimbursed in <lb/>
some way. He was once president of the Pacific <lb/>
Junction Railway, but he abandoned that position <lb/>
and is president no longer. He received only $3,<lb break="no"/>000 a year salary; but it is stated that three or <lb/>
four gentlemen friends of his divided somewhere <lb/>
in the neighborhood of $700,000 or $800,000 <lb/>
between them. That should satisfy almost any in<lb break="no"/>dividual, particularly one who, like the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, is in favor of economy. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
            has stated that there is a <hi rendition="simple:italic">parti national</hi> in <lb/>
Quebec, led by Mr. Mercier, and he is sup<lb break="no"/>ported by the leader of the Opposition in this <lb/>
House. But what is the hon. gentleman himself <lb/>
            endeavoring to do? He is trying to raise a <hi rendition="simple:italic">parti <lb/>
national</hi> in Ontario. Is that not the true object <lb/>
of the hon. gentleman? We desire a great national <lb/>
party in Canada, but the hon. gentleman is not going <lb/>
to obtain it in that way. We all desire to have a great <lb/>
national party in this country and one great Canadian <lb/>
nation, and I hope the time will come when we <lb/>
will untie the apron strings and go out on our own <lb/>
account, but at present it is best to maintain our <lb/>
present relations. The hon. gentleman is not going <lb/>
to work in the right way. As he wishes to be <lb/>
leader of a great national party, he should not col<lb break="no"/>lect around him a small circle of Protestants of <lb/>
Ontario and a few Conservatives and endeavor to <lb/>
draw them away from his leader. That is not the <lb/>
correct course, and the hon. gentleman should be <lb/>
actuated by higher motives in such matters. He <lb/>
should endeavor to earn a reputation as a great <lb/>
constitutional lawyer and legislator. His name <lb/>
should be handed down to posterity, but I am <lb/>
afraid he is sailing in a boat that will carry him <lb/>
down there degraded. Much has been said about <lb/>
the different creeds in this country, about Pro<lb break="no"/>testants, Orangemen and Roman Catholics. But <lb/>
I say this, that in Quebec the English speaking <lb/>
people are one-tenth of the entire population, and <lb/>
yet they have ten English speaking members in <lb/>
their House. I think that is a very liberal provi<lb break="no"/>sion on the part of the French Canadian people <lb/>
towards the minority. In Ontario, where we have <lb/>
a large Protestant majority, one-sixth of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation are Roman Catholics, and yet there are <lb/>
only six Roman Catholics in the Ontario Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. It appears to me that there is a good deal <lb/>
more liberality among the Roman Catholic French<lb break="no"/>men of Lower Canada than there is among the <lb/>
Protestant English speaking population in Ontario. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:COOK5">Mr. COOK</persName>. That is my view of the matter, and <lb/>
I am glad to know that the hon. leader of the <lb/>
Government endorses what I say, because when I <lb/>
have got such a distinguished backer as he is I <lb/>
need not be afraid of any man who may oppose me <lb/>
in my constituency. If that right hon. gentleman <lb/>
would only support me in Simcoe next election I <lb/>
will guarantee that I will double my majority, but <lb/>
I suppose I can hardly hope for that. I see the <lb/>
right hon. gentleman rubs the palm of his hands as <lb/>
if he intimated something about money. Well, I <lb/>
will tell the right hon. gentleman a little secret. <lb/>
There is a Tory living in East Simcoe who told a <lb/>
certain gentleman that he knew of $20,000 which <lb/>
came to that constituency, and he was pretty <lb/>

<cb/>

certain it came from Ottawa. There was in addi<lb break="no"/>tion $5,000 given by the Dodge lumber firm and <lb/>
$1,500 raised by local subscriptions. so that his <lb/>
friends had $26,500 against me in the last election. <lb/>
The right hon. gentleman knows so well how these <lb/>
things are done that he cannot afford to impute <lb/>
motives to others. Of course we will say openly <lb/>
and fairly that when we meet a man of that sort <lb/>
we do not intend to give him many advantages over <lb/>
us. If he endeavors to fight us with such weapons <lb/>
we are ready to meet him with the same. <lb/></p> 

<p>Some <persName ref="pers:ANON1">hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:COOK5">Mr. COOK</persName>. I don't wish to be understood as <lb/>
using this in the plural, and, therefore, I must not <lb/>
say "we." At all events I trust that there will <lb/>
be sufficient patriotism among the members of <lb/>
this House, to squelch these attempts of the member <lb/>
for North Simcoe for all time to come. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BECH1">Mr. BECHARD</persName>. Mr. Speaker, whilst I strongly <lb/>
object to the Bill which is now before the House, <lb/>
yet, like most of the gentlemen who have already <lb/>
addressed you, I have still stronger objections <lb/>
to its preamble. Although the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), in the second speech he <lb/>
delivered in this debate, has told us that he would <lb/>
assent to have that preamble set aside if it did not <lb/>
suit the House, and in order as he said not to <lb/>
offend the susceptibility of the French mem<lb break="no"/>bers, yet the fact remains that the Bill would <lb/>
be voted, on account of the principle laid down in <lb/>
the preamble, and invoked by the hon. member and <lb/>
propounded in his speeches. It has been already <lb/>
said, and correctly said, by several hon. gentlemen, <lb/>
that if you couple the preamble of that Bill with the <lb/>
speeches the hon. gentleman has delivered in this <lb/>
House, and outside of this House, you are forcibly led <lb/>
to the conclusion that this Bill must be regarded as <lb/>
only the first step in a crusade against the French <lb/>
Canadian race. Any man who reads that preamble, <lb/>
and the speeches of the hon. gentleman in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the Bill, can come to no other conclusion <lb/>
than that the hon. member does not intend to <lb/>
confine his present course to the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. By the enacting clause of this Bill he <lb/>
proposes to suppress the French language in these <lb/>
Territories, but by the spirit he has evinced, and <lb/>
by the speeches he has delivered, he gives notice, <lb/>
as I understand it, that it is his intention to con<lb break="no"/>tinue the same warfare against the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage wherever it is spoken in this Dominion. In <lb/>
his second speech in this House, the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) complains that <lb/>
he has been misunderstood, that his speeches have <lb/>
not been fairly read, and that his intentions have <lb/>
been misinterpreted. The hon. gentleman, however, <lb/>
has repudiated nothing of what he had previously <lb/>
said, and told us that whilst he admitted that <lb/>
the time might come when the French language <lb/>
should be suppressed in the Parliament of Canada, <lb/>
yet he would not interfere with vested rights <lb/>
which are guaranteed to the people of Quebec by <lb/>
the British North America Act. Has the hon. <lb/>
gentleman forgotten so soon the bearing of the <lb/>
speech which he pronounced in introducing this <lb/>
Bill? Has he forgotten the meaning of the <lb/>
speeches he has delivered on this question outside <lb/>
this House, and notably his speech at Stayner, in <lb/>
which he is reported to have said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"That the present generation would have to settle this <lb/>
question by the ballot-box, or, otherwise that the next <lb/>

<p>Did not this language mean that if the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians succeeded during the present generation in pre<lb break="no"/>venting by the ballot-box their language from being <lb/>
suppressed in Canada, the admirers of the hon. <lb/>
gentleman in the next generation, if they fulfil <lb/>
their duties, would have to take up arms to sub<lb break="no"/>due, to drive into the sea, or to exterminate <lb/>
these odious French Canadians? Let the hon. <lb/>
member and his principal follower in the House, <lb/>
the hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), <lb/>
succeed in their present attempt to suppress the <lb/>
French language in the Territories, and I venture <lb/>
to say that before long you will see them, assuming <lb/>
the presumptuous attitude of conquerors inflated <lb/>
by victory, incite an agitation in the country <lb/>
for the suppression of the French language in the <lb/>
Parliament of Canada, and at the same time <lb/>
preparing their arms to carry the war into <lb/>
the Province of Quebec, for the purpose of <lb/>
abolishing the French language in the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of that Province, in its courts of law, in <lb/>
its schools, and wherever it is taught or spoken <lb/>
in Canada. Sir, during last summer, in a speech <lb/>
which I addressed to a number of my constituents, <lb/>
I uttered a few words which I will take the liberty <lb/>
of repeating here as an answer to the threats <lb/>
against the French Canadians, contained in the <lb/>
speeches of the hon. member for North Simcoe. <lb/>
After having given some explanations with regard <lb/>
to the Jesuit question, which had been debated in <lb/>
this House last Session, I referred to the threats ut<lb break="no"/>tered by the hon. member for North Simcoe in his <lb/>
Stayner speech, and also to newspaper articles con<lb break="no"/>taining the most violent, abusive, injurious, of<lb break="no"/>fensive, provoking and threatening language <lb/>
against my French Canadian countrymen; and I <lb/>
told them: My friends, notwithstanding those <lb/>
threats, I strongly believe that we have nothing to <lb/>
fear from that quarter. The enjoyment of our <lb/>
rights and our peculiar institutions is guaranteed <lb/>
to us by the constitution of this country, and by <lb/>
what I consider to be a greater power‚Äîthe <lb/>
good sense and love of liberty and fair play of <lb/>
the vast majority of our English speaking <lb/>
fellow-countrymen. They will never permit the <lb/>
peace of this country to be disturbed and its pros<lb break="no"/>perity jeopardised by any fanatical action. But, <lb/>
I added, after all, we do not know what may <lb/>
happen in the life of a people, and history <lb/>
teaches us that sometimes damagogues have <lb/>
succeeded by appeals to passion and popular pre<lb break="no"/>judice in throwing their country into revolutionary <lb/>
convulsion and causing a great deal of evil. If such <lb/>
should be our misfortune, if this country should be <lb/>
thrown into a civil war, we should be placed in <lb/>
the cruel alternative, either of submitting cowardly <lb/>
to the annihilation of our race, and all the institu<lb break="no"/>tions that are dear to our hearts, or of standing up <lb/>
like men in their defence; we should have to appeal <lb/>
to our courage and to the (protection of the British <lb/>
flag. But if chance shoul turn against us, if the <lb/>
British flag should be found to be powerless to offer <lb/>
us adequate protection, then, my friends, there <lb/>
would be no other alternative offered to us than <lb/>
to turn our eyes towards the stars and stripes, <lb/>
which would, I believe, offer to us full pro<lb break="no"/>tection against the rage of our enemies. Sir, <lb/>
for having uttered these words I was denounced <lb/>
by part of the public press of this country as <lb/>
an annexationist; but I old that there is nothing <lb/>
in the language I used to justify the charge. An <lb/>

<cb/>

annexationist I am not, although I am one of <lb/>
those who believe that this country is not destined <lb/>
to remain forever in the clothes of childhood. Sir, <lb/>
I do not hesitate to say that it would be my pride <lb/>
to see my country taking rank among the nations <lb/>
of the globe. But the annexationists, those who <lb/>
push towards annexation, are to be found among <lb/>
those turbulent men who, being never satisfied with <lb/>
the actual state of the country, would not hesitate, <lb/>
for the satisfaction of a mere prejudice, to throw <lb/>
their country into a civil war, which could end in <lb/>
nothing less than the breaking down of Confede<lb break="no"/>ration and the dismemberment of this country. <lb/>
Now, Sir, the hon. member for North Simcoe finds <lb/>
fault with the French Canadians because they <lb/>
endeavor to perpetuate their language and their <lb/>
literature, while he says they should understand <lb/>
that the best interests of the country require <lb/>
that they should abandon their own language and <lb/>
speak the English language. Sir, does he sup<lb break="no"/>pose that the French Canadians, just to suit his <lb/>
fancy, will become renegades to their language, <lb/>
to their literature and to their peculiar insti<lb break="no"/>tutions? Indeed, Sir, they cultivate their own <lb/>
language, but at the same time they do their <lb/>
best to acquire a knowledge of the English <lb/>
language, knowing, as they do, that any man <lb/>
to-day, who wants to do some business, must <lb/>
know that language; and you have a good evi<lb break="no"/>dence of this fact in this Chamber, where the <lb/>
French representatives speak the English language <lb/>
tolerably well. No young man in the Province of <lb/>
Quebec considers that his education is sufficiently <lb/>
complete until he can speak, read and write the <lb/>
English language. But the hon. member considers <lb/>
that the French language in this country is a <lb/>
danger to the state, and that so long as the French <lb/>
Canadians are allowed to cultivate their language <lb/>
they cannot be assimilated to the Anglo-Saxon <lb/>
element of our community. On this point the hon. <lb/>
gentleman has been well answered by several hon. <lb/>
members who mentioned different countries where <lb/>
two or three official languages exist, and which, <lb/>
notwithstanding that fact, are inhabited by a <lb/>
homogeneous people living together in a perfect <lb/>
political union. But the hon. gentleman <lb/>
seemed to cherish particularly the policy <lb/>
suggested by Lord Durham in his celebrated <lb/>
report on the cause of the troubles in 1837. <lb/>
It is said in that report that the cause of those <lb/>
troubles was not misgovermnent, but a feeling of <lb/>
hostility existing between the two races; and <lb/>
Lord Durham suggested as a remedy that the <lb/>
French language should be suppressed as an offi<lb break="no"/>cial language in Lower Canada. How long did <lb/>
that policy last? The right hon. gentleman at <lb/>
the head of the Government informed the House. <lb/>
the other night that it lasted but during the short <lb/>
period of three or four years, and that it was set <lb/>
aside at the request or the prayer of those who <lb/>
were most interested in the question, the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, under the Union, in which there <lb/>
were as many English as French members. Now, <lb/>
supposing such a. policy were adopted to-day, how <lb/>
long do you think, Sir, it would last? No one <lb/>
could tell, but every one can see the disastrous con<lb break="no"/>sequences which would follow its adoption. Sir, <lb/>
the policy suggested by Lord Durham proved to be <lb/>
an unsound policy, and the wisdom of his advice <lb/>
was as disputable as the accuracy of some of the <lb/>
facts relatedin his report. To say that the cause of <lb/>

<pb n="929" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00929.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">929</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 20, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">930</fw>

the trouble in 1837 was an existing feeling of hos<lb break="no"/>tility between the two races is a misconception of <lb/>
the case. If such had been the cause of the troubles <lb/>
then, would we have seen among the leaders of <lb/>
the popular movement which then took place such <lb/>
good Englishmen as Wilfred Nelson, Robert Nel<lb break="no"/>son, O'Callaghan, D. S. Brown, and others? No; <lb/>
the real cause of the trouble was well stated by the <lb/>
hon. the Minister of Public Works and by my hon. <lb/>
friend the leader of the Opposition. The Gover<lb break="no"/>nor General surrounded by a clique of evil ad<lb break="no"/>visers‚Äîoffice holders‚Äîattempted to dictate to the <lb/>
Legislative Assembly in that Province. He went <lb/>
so far as to spend the public money without the <lb/>
assent of that Assembly, and in that unconstitu<lb break="no"/>tional course he was supported by the then Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council, whose members, on account of their <lb/>
    unpatriotic conduct, were branded by the appella<lb break="no"/>tion, which then became so popular, of "<hi rendition="simple:italic">vieillards <lb/>
malfaisants,</hi>" which may be translated by the <lb/>
term "mischievous old men." The report of Lord <lb/>
Durham, it is well known, was never considered <lb/>
in Lower Canada as an impartial document with <lb/>
regard to the French Canadians. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe has made an assertion from <lb/>
which I entirely dissent. He has said that the <lb/>
French Canadians are not a sympathetic people, <lb/>
that they are exclusive in their affections, that <lb/>
they do not sympathise with their English-<lb break="yes"/>speaking countrymen; and, in support of that <lb/>
proposition, he has quoted, from I do not know <lb/>
what obscure authority, an extract stating that <lb/>
the Irish Catholic and the French Canadian, <lb/>
although they profess the same religious faith‚Äî <lb/>
a circumstance which ought to create a bond <lb/>
of union and of mutual sympathy between them‚Äî <lb/>
are the bitterest enemies? If there was a time <lb/>
when a feeling of hostility existed between these <lb/>
two elements of our people it was when they <lb/>
were first brought face to face, and before they <lb/>
knew each other. But those days have long since <lb/>
gone by, and from the moment that those people be<lb break="no"/>gan to know each other better, and to appreciate each <lb/>
other better, they have lived on terms of the best <lb/>
friendship, and, wherever they are seen living to<lb break="no"/>day in the same settlements, at least in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, their relations are of the most <lb/>
cordial character. It is well known that their sons <lb/>
and daughters frequently intermarry. But, while <lb/>
I am on this point, let me indulge for a moment <lb/>
in reminiscences of the past, by referring to a <lb/>
solemn period of our history, when the French <lb/>
Canadians displayed towards their Irish brethern <lb/>
the feelings of the most devoted sympathy and <lb/>
benevolence. Men of my age, and older than I, <lb/>
in this House, can well remember that during the <lb/>
summer of 1847 we had an Irish immigration into <lb/>
the Province of Quebec. These immigrants were <lb/>
landed on our shores in the most destitute <lb/>
condition, the one-half of them suffering from that <lb/>
very contagious disease, typhoid fever. When <lb/>
they were landed in our harbors, a feeling of <lb/>
Stupefaction overcame the sympathies of our people <lb/>
for amoment. What were they to do? Were they to <lb/>
send back to the ocean that importation of death <lb/>
into their midst? Did not the supreme law of self-<lb break="yes"/>preservation seem to demand that? But suddenly <lb/>
the voice of those men who for nearly nineteen cen<lb break="no"/>turies have been repeating the words of the Gospel <lb/>
and preaching the divine teachings of charity was <lb/>
heard. Those immigrants are our brethren, ex<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

claimed the French Canadian pastors; they must <lb/>
be received and they must be assisted. Im<lb break="no"/>mediately people of all classes rushed to the <lb/>
assistance of the poor destitute immigrants, <lb/>
and many of them were themselves stricken down <lb/>
by the dire contagion. Priests, Sisters of Charity, <lb/>
physicians, the mayor of a great city, and a number <lb/>
of other people fell victims to their devotedness, <lb/>
but the poor immigrants received the assistance <lb/>
which their destitute condition demanded. A <lb/>
large number were preserved to life, and those who <lb/>
died received in their last moments all the con<lb break="no"/>solation that can be given by Christian benevolence. <lb/>
And those numerous children who, by the deaths <lb/>
of their parents, became orphans, what became of <lb/>
them? They were adopted by our citizens, who <lb/>
raised them as the members of their own fami<lb break="no"/>lies. It has been my good fortune to be <lb/>
acquainted with some of them, who, thanks to <lb/>
the education given them by their protectors, <lb/>
occupy to-day distinguished positions in our social <lb/>
life. Ah, the French Canadians are a sympathetic <lb/>
people, endowed with generous hearts and instincts, <lb/>
and magnanimous qualities. I regret the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) does not <lb/>
know them, for if he did know them as they are he <lb/>
would change his present attitude towards them, as <lb/>
he would soon find his own heart kindle with feel<lb break="no"/>ings of the warmest admiration for that noble people. <lb/>
The hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), in <lb/>
the two speeches he has delivered in this House <lb/>
since the beginning of the debate has referred each <lb/>
time to Mr. Mercier, and he seems to look upon <lb/>
Mr. Mercier as the founder in the near future of a <lb/>
French Canadian nation on the shores of the St. <lb/>
Lawrence. In order to justify his apprehensions <lb/>
in this regard he reports a few words which were <lb/>
stated to have fallen from the lips of Mr. Mercier <lb/>
in a speech which he pronounced at a banquet in <lb/>
the city of Quebec on the celebration of St. John's <lb/>
Day, the 24th June last. Mr. Mercier is reported <lb/>
to have appealed on that occasion to his country<lb break="no"/>men, to have endeavored to induce them to give <lb/>
up the old party flags of rouge and bleu and to <lb/>
rally under the tricolor, which would lead this <lb/>
country to the brilliant destiny which it would <lb/>
reach in the future, or some words to that effect. <lb/>
To draw from these words an inference that <lb/>
Mr. Mercier intends that an independent French <lb/>
Canadian nation can be founded in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec is to give to these words a <lb/>
greater significance and a greater importance than <lb/>
they have. No serious man in the Province <lb/>
of Quebec would think of the realisation of such an <lb/>
idea, which he would consider as nothing but <lb/>
Utopian; and Mr. Mercier himself is too intelli<lb break="no"/>gent and too clever a man to have meant in pro<lb break="no"/>nouncing those words that a nation could be es<lb break="no"/>tablished in the Province of Quebec independent <lb/>
of the other Provinces of this Dominion, and inde<lb break="no"/>pendent of England. But we know that all men, <lb/>
on the occasion of the celebration of great <lb/>
festivals, are apt, more or less, in the course of a <lb/>
speech delivered at a dinner in answer to toasts, <lb/>
to give expression to some sentiment with no other <lb/>
purpose than to provoke applause, and I do not be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the words which flowed from the lips of <lb/>
Mr. Mercier on that occasion have any other im<lb break="no"/>portance. The hon. member has spoken of the <lb/>
National party, and, in his second speech, looking <lb/>
at the French members sitting on this side of the <lb/>

<pb n="931" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00931.jpg"/> 

<fw type="num">931</fw> <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">932</fw>

House, whom he called the band of Nationalists, <lb/>
he stated that he did not expect and did not want <lb/>
any sympathy from them. Well, that is a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of mere personal inclination, and surely no <lb/>
man would be guilty of such folly as to expect <lb/>
from his fellow men more sympathy than he feels <lb/>
disposed to grant in return, and thereby inspire. <lb/>
But the hon. member seemed to think that this <lb/>
National party has been formed in opposition to <lb/>
the English speaking population of the Dominion. <lb/>
There is nothing of the kind. It is well <lb/>
known that Mr. Mercier, when in Opposition, led <lb/>
the Liberal party in the Quebec Legislature, and <lb/>
that, a short time before the elections of 1886, he <lb/>
made an alliance with a certain portion of the old <lb/>
Conservatives, who had repudiated their former <lb/>
leaders; but, as these gentlemen would not call <lb/>
themselves Liberals, they took the name of National <lb/>
Conservatives. Since Mr. Mercier has taken pos<lb break="no"/>session of power, as he had one wing of his party <lb/>
composed of Liberals and another wing composed <lb/>
of those who called themselves National Conserva<lb break="no"/>tives, they agreed to call the party in Quebec the <lb/>
National party. But that has no other significance <lb/>
or hearing. The hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy) must not think that the old Liberal <lb/>
party in the Province of Quebec is dead. Our <lb/>
leader, our illustrious leader in this House, still <lb/>
calls himself a Liberal. I see my colleagues sitting <lb/>
around me, representing the Province of Quebec, <lb/>
who still call themselves Liberals. I see my old <lb/>
friend from the county of Vercheres (Mr. Geoffrion), <lb/>
who has been in Parliament for about twenty-five <lb/>
years, who has been a Minister of the Crown, and <lb/>
whostill continues to call himself a Liberal and not <lb/>
a Nationalist. Here is my venerable friend the <lb/>
member for St. Johns (Mr. Bourassa), who has <lb/>
passed thirty-six years in Parliament. What does he <lb/>
call himself? A Liberal. He was born a Liberal, he <lb/>
has lived a Liberal, and, depend upon it, he will die <lb/>
a Liberal. Your humble servant, after twenty-two <lb/>
years passed in this House, still continues, and in<lb break="no"/>tends to continue in the future, to call himself a <lb/>
Liberal. The old Liberal party in the Province of <lb/>
Quebec, as represented in this House, still exists, <lb/>
and you may be sure that it will not disap<lb break="no"/>pear from the sphere of action. Before I sit down <lb/>
I want to refer to a regret expressed by the hon. <lb/>
member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) in his first <lb/>
speech on this question. He said he regretted, or <lb/>
it was to be regretted, that England, after the <lb/>
cession, had adopted so liberal a policy towards <lb/>
the French Canadians; and, if another policy had <lb/>
been adopted, we would not have in this country <lb/>
the evils which he thought were created by the <lb/>
existence of two official languages. On this ques<lb break="no"/>tion he was well answered by my hon. friend from <lb/>
Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), who told him that if a dif<lb break="no"/>ferent policy had been adopted this country would <lb/>
not have long remained a British colony. Sir, the <lb/>
liberal policy of England on that occasion conquered <lb/>
the hearts of the French Canadians, and in her <lb/>
days of trial they stood by her and remained <lb/>
faithful to their allegiance. Less than twenty <lb/>
years afterwards they resisted the seducing ap<lb break="no"/>peals of the American patriots and of General <lb/>
La Fayette to join in the great revolutionary move<lb break="no"/>ment for liberty and independence. In 1812 the <lb/>
same temptation was again held out to them, and <lb/>
again they resisted those allurements; they did more, <lb/>
they gallantly shed their blood on battle-fields for <lb/>

<cb/>

the honor of the British flag, and they clung to Eng<lb break="no"/>land with more than filial affection. Now, Sir, I <lb/>
ask, after these great deeds, what more could be <lb/>
done, what remains to be accomplished by French <lb/>
Canadians, to prove their loyalty, when I find that <lb/>
it is still suspected by such men as my hon. friend <lb/>
from North Norfolk? Mr. Speaker, let me say <lb/>
in conclusion, that, notwithstanding this pass<lb break="no"/>ing storm, I do not despair of the future of my <lb/>
country. I have faith, I have confidence in the <lb/>
good sense, in the practical common sense, of the <lb/>
great majority of my English speaking fellow-coun<lb break="no"/>trymen. I have no doubt that when an opportunity <lb/>
is given they will rally together to defeat the ne<lb break="no"/>farious designs of those who do not hesitate to <lb/>
swing the torch of discord in this country. Sir, <lb/>
since the different Provinces of this country have <lb/>
been brought into a federal union we have accom<lb break="no"/>plished great things, upon which we look with a <lb/>
just feeling of pride. We will continue to work <lb/>
together, English Canadians as well as French <lb/>
Canadians, to promote the prosperity of our <lb/>
country, the welfare of our countrymen, endea<lb break="no"/>voring to deserve, at the same time, by our consi<lb break="no"/>derate action, the moderation of our views, and, <lb/>
if I may say so, the wisdom of our conduct, the <lb/>
blessings and gratitude of future generations. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DEWD1">Mr. DEWDNEY</persName>. I should not have attempted <lb/>
to rise at this late period of the debate did I not <lb/>
feel that, on account of my long experience in the <lb/>
Territories, and occupying, as I did, two of the <lb/>
most responsible positions in those Territories for <lb/>
some years, I might speak with some authority <lb/>
in reference to some portions of the matter which <lb/>
is now before this honorable House. As you are <lb/>
aware, I went to the North-West Territories in <lb/>
1879 as Indian Commissioner. During that year I <lb/>
travelled through the length and breadth of the <lb/>
land, for the purpose of visiting the Indians who <lb/>
were under my special charge. When I arrived in <lb/>
the North-West Territories the Hon. Mr. Laird <lb/>
was then Governor of that country. At that time <lb/>
the North-West Council was composed of the <lb/>
stipendiary magistrates of the Territories, with <lb/>
one or two unofficial members who were appointed <lb/>
by the Governor. The meetings of Council in <lb/>
those days were held in the Government House at <lb/>
Battleford; the proceedings were of a very limited <lb/>
character. The Council sat for a few weeks, <lb/>
passed a few short ordinances, and then ad<lb break="no"/>journed. For two or three years this continued, <lb/>
and year after year, as opportunity offered, the <lb/>
Government had the ordinances printed in French. <lb/>
In 1881, when I became Lieutenant Governor of <lb/>
that Province, the headquarters of the Government <lb/>
were removed to Regina. When I took charge of the <lb/>
administration of affairs the Council which met <lb/>
me was composed of the gentlemen I have just <lb/>
mentioned. Settlers were coming into the country, <lb/>
which was settling up from one end to the other, <lb/>
and although up to that time the population had <lb/>
been principally French, or people of French ex<lb break="no"/>traction, when I took charge the majority was <lb/>
already English, and I was able, almost at once, in <lb/>
accordance with the power which I had under the <lb/>
North-West Territory Act, to form electoral dis<lb break="no"/>tricts and to bring representative members into <lb/>
that Council. Up to 1885 the ordinances passed <lb/>
by the North-West Council had been printed by <lb/>
myself, and also by my predecessor, in French and <lb/>

<pb n="933" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00933.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">933</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 20, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">934</fw>
    
English. But, as you know, the moneys voted <lb/>
for the North-West government were voted in a <lb/>
lump sum, and as the country settled up it was <lb/>
necessary that public works should be constructed, <lb/>
and it was found necessary to use all the available <lb/>
money we could possibly get on the public works. <lb/>
Up to 1885, although the ordinances had been <lb/>
printed in French, there were virtually very few <lb/>
applications made to me or to my officers for copies <lb/>
of the French ordinances. In that or the subsequent <lb/>
year, on account of the demand made upon me for <lb/>
moneys for public works, I neglected to have those <lb/>
ordinances printed in French, but in 1887, when I <lb/>
found a demand was being made for those <lb/>
ordinances, and finding that I had not the <lb/>
money with which to have them printed, I came <lb/>
down to this honorable House and asked for a vote <lb/>
for the purpose of having them printed in French. <lb/>
This House voted the sum of $3,000 for that pur<lb break="no"/>pose. Let me here call the attention of the House <lb/>
to a remark which was made by the hon. member <lb/>
for Victoria (Mr. Barron), where he stated that he <lb/>
was informed by Mr. Cayley, one of the members <lb/>
of the North-West Council, which is now the <lb/>
North-West Assembly, that while in 1883, I think <lb/>
he said, the cost of printing the North-West <lb/>
ordinances was only some $300, in 1887 it cost <lb/>
$1,000 for printing in French and $1,000 for trans<lb break="no"/>lation. Well, Sir, Mr. Cayley was a member of <lb/>
my Council before it became a Legislative As<lb break="no"/>sembly, and he ought to have known that the <lb/>
reason of the large expenditure of 1887 was that <lb/>
the money was voted in this House to print the <lb/>
ordinances which I neglected to have printed in <lb/>
1885 and in 1886. I had in my hands a day or <lb/>
two ago a statement of the cost of printing those <lb/>
ordinances, and it corresponded with the state<lb break="no"/>ment made by the Minister of Public Works that <lb/>
since 1881 the average expense was $400 or $500 a <lb/>
year. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA5">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Could the hon. gentleman <lb/>
give the figures for the different years? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DEWD1">Mr. DEWDNEY</persName>. I have not that statement <lb/>
now with me. If I had it here, I could show the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe that the large <lb/>
expenditure for translation and printing of the <lb/>
French ordinances from 1887 to 1889 was on <lb/>
account of my neglecting to publish them in 1884-<lb break="yes"/>85. Not only did I publish the ordinances of <lb/>
those two years and those of the year in which the <lb/>
sum was voted, but I also thought it advisable to have <lb/>
the Journals of the House, which had never before <lb/>
been published in French, published from the first <lb/>
year of Mr. Laird's appointment as Lieutenant Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor up to the time I left the Territories. I believe <lb/>
they will prove interesting in the future, in the <lb/>
same way as the old Journals of Ontario and Que<lb break="no"/>bec are interesting to me whenever I look over <lb/>
them. So when I left the Territories the whole of <lb/>
the ordinances up to that time were printed in <lb/>
French, and also the Journals of the House. I <lb/>
think I may claim to be able to speak with author<lb break="no"/>ity with respect to the sentiments of the people <lb/>
of that country in respect to this matter. During <lb/>
the ten years I lived in the North-West Territories <lb/>
I never, on one single occasion that I recollect, <lb/>
heard any objection to the printing of the ordi<lb break="no"/>nances in French, except an occasional remark that <lb/>
it would be as well if we spent the money on public <lb/>
works instead of on printing French ordinances, as <lb/>

<cb/>

the demand for those ordinances was very small. <lb/>
These observations were made at the time when <lb/>
farmers coming in from the north and south of the <lb/>
railway were often obliged to unload part of their <lb/>
loads, and go back for the part so left, before they <lb/>
could reach the railway. Every one, however, <lb/>
knows the difficulties experienced in a new country; <lb/>
but those were the only remarks I heard men<lb break="no"/>tioned in regard to the printing of the French <lb/>
ordinances. I have also, since the gentlemen who <lb/>
constitute the present Legislative Assembly were <lb/>
returned, run an election myself. I have also <lb/>
travelled through the country, and as late as last <lb/>
year I travelled through it from one end to the <lb/>
other. I followed in the wake of the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), <lb/>
and I must say that from one end to the <lb/>
other there was no indication of any excite<lb break="no"/>ment on this question. Perhaps the House will <lb/>
permit me to give my opinion with respect to the <lb/>
population in the North-West to-day. One-third <lb/>
of the people in the Territories comprise Ontario <lb/>
farmers and Ontario settlers; the balance is made <lb/>
up of English or old country settlers, French, <lb/>
German and other nationalities. I think very <lb/>
likely among the Ontario settlers there may be <lb/>
some who fought this battle over before in their <lb/>
younger days, and have strong feelings on the <lb/>
subject; but I do not believe that feeling exists to <lb/>
any great extent among that class. The old coun<lb break="no"/>try settlers rank next in number to those from <lb/>
Ontario, and I believe not seventy‚Äîfive per cent. of <lb/>
them ever heard of the British North America Act, <lb/>
or of the Manitoba Act, and the bulk of them do <lb/>
not know of the clause in the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories Act providing that the ordinances and pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings shall be printed in the two languages. <lb/>
But I can understand that interested parties, those <lb/>
who within the last few weeks have taken a great <lb/>
interest in this question and are engaged in getting <lb/>
up the petitions to send down to this House stating <lb/>
their views should go to those ignorant people, ignor<lb break="no"/>ant so far as this matter is concerned, and obtain their <lb/>
signatures to petitions asking that money should <lb/>
not be wasted on the printing of French ordinances, <lb/>
but should be spent on useful work in other direc<lb break="no"/>tions. But, I believe, if I know what British fair <lb/>
play is and how Englishmen feel on such matters, <lb/>
that these same men, if they had heard the speech <lb/>
of my hon. colleague on Tuesday night, woul say: <lb/>
"This is a small matter; let the French have the <lb/>
records printed in their own language." With re<lb break="no"/>gard to the other nationalities, I may say there are <lb/>
a large number of Germans. On my visit last <lb/>
summer to Whitewood I was invited to meet a lot <lb/>
of settlers who had established themselves 16 miles <lb/>
north of that place. Many came out to meet me, <lb/>
and I found in two townships, Nos. 18 and 19 on <lb/>
Ranges 1, 2 and 3, the people were representatives <lb/>
of nine nationalities‚ÄîBohemians, Norwegians, <lb/>
Danes, Slavonians, Polish, Swedes, French and <lb/>
English. My opinion is that when we invite foreign<lb break="no"/>ers to come to our country we should endeavor to <lb/>
allow them, whether English, French, Germans or <lb/>
other nationalities, to have the laws under which <lb/>
they live printed in their own language, especially <lb/>
the school ordinances and laws of that character. I <lb/>
should like to say a word or two in regard <lb/>
to the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy). I can echo the sentiments expressed <lb/>
by the hon. member for Northumberland (Mr. <lb/>

Mitchell) in regard to that hon. gentleman. I <lb/>
believe he has taken up the work which he has <lb/>
now on hand from purely conscientious motives. <lb/>
I believe myself that he has done so on his own <lb/>
responsibility, and I, for one, think, as the hon. <lb/>
member for North Northumberland (Mr. Mitchell) <lb/>
thought, that any man who occupies the position <lb/>
he did when he took this stand is a man of whom <lb/>
his country should be proud. I do not agree with <lb/>
everything that hon. gentleman has said, I do not <lb/>
agree with the Bill he has introduced, but I believe <lb/>
he has taken this course from purely conscientious <lb/>
motives. If that hon, gentleman had the same <lb/>
ground to go over again I believe he would very <lb/>
likely have introduced his Bill without this pre<lb break="no"/>amble, which appears to have been unfortunate, <lb/>
and not in sympathy with the opinions of the <lb/>
majority of the members of this House. I believe <lb/>
also that if he had again to make the speech which <lb/>
he delivered in introducing this Bill he would be <lb/>
more moderate in his tone. But I do not believe <lb/>
that the hon. gentleman, as he stated himself, <lb/>
intended to hurt the feelings of any member of <lb/>
this House. I do think that the hon. gentleman <lb/>
spoke rather intemperately in his first speech, but <lb/>
no one can complain of the manner in which he <lb/>
responded to the venemous attacks made on him <lb/>
during the last five days of this debate. There are <lb/>
one or two remarks in the speech of the hon. <lb/>
member to which I would like to refer. He <lb/>
stated that the Lieutenant Governor of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories in opening the session of the <lb/>
Legislative Assembly the year before last, made <lb/>
a mistake in that he read his speech in French, <lb/>
which had never been done before. If any one can <lb/>
give a reason why that speech was not previously <lb/>
read in French I am in a position to do it. As <lb/>
Lieutenant Governor I opened the Assembly for <lb/>
the seven years previous to that, and I can give <lb/>
him the reason why I did not read the speech in <lb/>
French. Unfortunately I was not able to read the <lb/>
French language sufficiently well to warrant me in <lb/>
doing so. If I had undertaken that task I have no <lb/>
doubt that my audience would not know whether <lb/>
I was speaking in Blackfoot, Cree, or French, and <lb/>
Ithought it better to leave it alone. In my opinion <lb/>
where the Lieutenant Governor made a mistake <lb/>
was, when last year he met his council and did not <lb/>
read his speech in French. The reason given by <lb/>
the member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) for this <lb/>
was that it had been reported that if the Lieutenant <lb/>
Governor attempted to read his speech in French <lb/>
members of the Assembly would have left the build<lb break="no"/>ing. If I had been Lieutenant Governor at that <lb/>
time I would have read that speech in French if I <lb/>
had to read it to my clerk and to empty chairs. <lb/>
It was his duty to do so and a man should never <lb/>
neglect that. I know every one of the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the North-West Assembly personally, and <lb/>
I can hardly believe there could be any foundation <lb/>
for that report. If the Lieutenant Governor had <lb/>
read his speech I do not believe there would <lb/>
have been any excitement, and if any members <lb/>
of the House left their seats for that reason they <lb/>
would not be fit to represent the people who sent <lb/>
them to the Legislature. The hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) also spoke of <lb/>
the Lieutenant Governor getting a translator to <lb/>
translate the ordinances which he states created <lb/>
some dissatisfaction. When I was Lieutenant <lb/>
Governor the clerk of my council was a French <lb/>

<cb/>

lawyer and he was able to do the translating him<lb break="no"/>self, but when the present Government took office <lb/>
this gentleman was transferred to the Indian <lb/>
Department, and the present clerk, not being a <lb/>
very good French scholar, is unable to do the <lb/>
translation. Any gentleman who knows anything <lb/>
of the translation of French in connection with <lb/>
legal work knows that a man must have a legal <lb/>
mind and legal experience before he can make a <lb/>
fair translation of such documents. Therefore the <lb/>
Governor had to take up some man to do the <lb/>
translation for him. The hon. member for West <lb/>
Durham (Mr. Blake) when he addressed the House <lb/>
the other evening referred to the spark which is <lb/>
liable to break out into a great blaze. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman might have gone a little further <lb/>
in his comparaison. If he had lived in a <lb/>
wooden, mossy country as I have, he would <lb/>
have seen that on many occasions when it was <lb/>
thought the fire was out a small spark still re<lb break="no"/>mained working gradually and surely under the <lb/>
surface and when fanned by a slight breeze breaks <lb/>
out again and creates a conflagration greater than <lb/>
the original one. What I want to see done in the <lb/>
present instance is some measure taken by this <lb/>
House which will extinguish the spark forever. I <lb/>
believe that the amendment proposed by my hon. <lb/>
colleague the Minister of Justice will effect that <lb/>
object and will be satisfactory to the people of the <lb/>
North-West. I am quite certain that what the <lb/>
people up there require is peace and prosperity. <lb/>
If they can raise their 25 bushels of wheat, their <lb/>
70 bushels of oats and their 300 or 400 bushels of pota<lb break="no"/>toes to the acre, they will be contented and happy. <lb/>
If this House can settle the question in the manner <lb/>
proposed by my hon. colleague I believe it will be <lb/>
satisfactory to the people of the North-West. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MASS2">Mr. MASSON</persName>. At this late hour in the even<lb break="no"/>ing, and at this late stage of the debate, I would <lb/>
not take up the time of the House in speaking on <lb/>
this subject were it not that I consider it a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of very great importance, and were it not also <lb/>
for the fact that it has taken such a very wide <lb/>
and varied range. I consider it important, as a <lb/>
subject likely to affect the peace and the prosper<lb break="no"/>ity, yea, even the existence of this Dominion. It <lb/>
is true that the Act before the House is a very <lb/>
brief one, but it is also one that has a very wide <lb/>
scope. Especially is this Bill important when we <lb/>
consider it in connection with the preamble by <lb/>
which it is prefaced, and interpret that preamble <lb/>
by the speeches, made not only in this House but <lb/>
in different parts of the country during recess, by <lb/>
the hon. gentleman who has introduced the <lb/>
Bill. He says that the preamble does not mean <lb/>
what some hon. gentlemen say it does‚Äîa de<lb break="no"/>claration that the French language should be <lb/>
obliterated, and that we should have only one <lb/>
language throughout the whole Dominion, <lb/>
in this House, and inall the Provinces of this Domi<lb break="no"/>nion; but if it does not mean that, I would <lb/>
ask, what does it mean? If it does not mean that, <lb/>
is it ambiguous? If it is ambiguous, read it in the <lb/>
light of the speeches made by the hon. gentleman <lb/>
during the recess, and we can find no ambiguity <lb/>
about it. The hon. gentleman in one of his speeches <lb/>
stated in emphatic words that he would not rest <lb/>
until the French language was stamped out. He <lb/>
admitted that he had great work in hand, but <lb/>
he said: "Let us begin with that which seems <lb/>

<pb n="937" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00937.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">937</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 20, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">938</fw>

most possible of accomplishment‚Äîlet us deal with <lb/>
the dual languages in the North-West." With <lb/>
that declaration from the hon. gentleman, it is im<lb break="no"/>possible for any person to put but one interpreta<lb break="no"/>tion on the clause in the preamble regarding unity <lb/>
of language, namely, that it is expedient and his <lb/>
desire that it should be so, not only in the Territories <lb/>
of the North-West, but in the Dominion of Canada <lb/>
and in all the Provinces thereof. We might ask, <lb/>
if that is not the meaning of the preamble, why <lb/>
was it placed there? It has been whispered in the <lb/>
corridors that the hon. gentleman has stated that <lb/>
it was only introduced for the purpose of filling out <lb/>
the Bill and making it a little larger, as it looked <lb/>
too small without it. But I can hardly think that <lb/>
was the hon. gentleman's intention. If he wanted <lb/>
to extend the Bill and make it larger, he had <lb/>
many facts which he could have used in the <lb/>
preamble for the purpose. He could have stated <lb/>
that the North-West Territories Act had passed <lb/>
the House without the clause in question in it. <lb/>
and without any request to place it there; he <lb/>
might have stated that that clause was placed in <lb/>
the Bill by the Senate, and that when the Bill <lb/>
came back from the Senate, the Minister of the <lb/>
Interior, who had charge of the Bill, expressed <lb/>
regret that it was there; he might have quoted <lb/>
    from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> of that time the whole speech of <lb/>
the hon. Minister of the Interior; if he wished <lb/>
still further to swell his preamble, he might have <lb/>
placed in it the resolution of the North-West <lb/>
Council and the petition founded on that resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. These would have been matters of fact, and <lb/>
fair material to put in the preamble. They would <lb/>
have had the effect of strengthening the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's hands and of assisting him in passing his <lb/>
Bill, instead of the effect which the preamble he <lb/>
has placed there is likely to have, namely, that of <lb/>
preventing its passing. The hon. gentleman says <lb/>
he is willing to abandon the preamble, after he has <lb/>
made a speech saying that he would not abandon <lb/>
the cause until he had attained his object. He <lb/>
said he would abandon it, after having made a <lb/>
speech introducing his Bill based entirely on <lb/>
that preamble. It is too late, however, for <lb/>
him now to say that he will abandon it. He <lb/>
says he will abandon it, not now, but after <lb/>
the Bill passes its secon dreading. He wishes <lb/>
the House to put itself in the false position <lb/>
of passing the preamble, which he said would <lb/>
amount to nothing, although I think it is generally <lb/>
admitted that passing the measure is endorsing <lb/>
its principle. The hon. member for North Victoria <lb/>
(Mr. Barron) referred to the expressions used by <lb/>
the hon. Minister of Justice in the debate on the <lb/>
Jesuit Estates Act last Session, in which he con<lb break="no"/>tended the hon. Minister had held an entirely <lb/>
different view with regard to the importance of a <lb/>
preamble. The views of the hon. member for <lb/>
Yorth Simcoe and the hon. member for North <lb/>
Victoria were certainly very different last Session <lb/>
from what they are this Session. They then laid <lb/>
great stress on the preamble, while they make <lb/>
little of it to-day; but it is impossible for those <lb/>
hon. gentlemen to suppose that this House will not <lb/>
take account of the great difference in the two cases. <lb/>
It may be very interesting to place on record <lb/>
the legal argument of the hon. member for North <lb/>
Victoria, that in a decision on the interpretation <lb/>
of a statute, the preamble has no weight or effect; <lb/>
but it is equally true that a preamble is often refer<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

red to in explanation of a statute. But I can see, <lb/>
and I think every hon. gentleman in this House <lb/>
can see, a very great distinction between those two <lb/>
cases. In the one case the Government were asked <lb/>
to disallow a Bill because it had an offensive pre<lb break="no"/>amble, and the answer to that was that the Admin<lb break="no"/>istration, in reviewing the Bill, had to consider its <lb/>
meaning and its consequences, and not statements <lb/>
contained in the preamble. In this case we are asked <lb/>
to enact a Bill containing a preamble, and in enact<lb break="no"/>ing that Bill we are enacting the principles set <lb/>
forth in that preamble. The preamble of that Bill <lb/>
is as much a resolution of this House as the amend<lb break="no"/>ment of the hon. Minister of Justice or any other <lb/>
resolution formally put before us. Therefore, when <lb/>
this House is asked to pass that Bill to a second <lb/>
reading, we are asked to vote for the resolution <lb/>
contained in the preamble. That is an entirely <lb/>
different thing from the Administration dealing <lb/>
with a Bill which had been passed by a Local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. I am not going to follow that part of <lb/>
the discussion any further, because I wish to be <lb/>
brief, and I am willing to admit at the <lb/>
outset what I think is admitted by a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of this House, that it would have been <lb/>
better if the clause in question had not been <lb/>
inserted in the North-West Territories Act; but it <lb/>
was inserted, and a gift, a privilege, a right was <lb/>
given to the people of the North-West Territories <lb/>
by that enactment. Now, a gift once given, I <lb/>
hold, cannot be ruthlessly taken away; a gift once <lb/>
given remains in the donee until he chooses to <lb/>
relinquish it; and, therefore, those people, being <lb/>
granted this privilege, whether rightly or wrongly, <lb/>
wisely or unwisely, should be allowed to retain <lb/>
it until they voluntarily abandon it. Now, it has <lb/>
been said by some that this Parliament, having <lb/>
given the power, has certainly the right to take it <lb/>
away. That can only be done by treating the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment as paternal to the North-West Territories, and <lb/>
in that View I suppose, they would say that a father <lb/>
mighttake from his child the gift he had given him. <lb/>
He might give his child a toy, and then, when he <lb/>
found that child making too much noise with it, <lb/>
he might take it away from him. That right may <lb/>
be granted, but the gift, even such a one as that, <lb/>
is never taken back without a pang; and I do not <lb/>
think it would be wise, even if lawful, for us to <lb/>
take back a privilege of that kind which has been <lb/>
given. There are certain distinctions though <lb/>
which must be drawn. There may be things <lb/>
which should be taken back, and there may be <lb/>
things that we ought properly not to have given. <lb/>
The people in this case have been granted a privi<lb break="no"/>lege, and these people, I submit, should be con<lb break="no"/>sulted before this privilege is taken away. It is <lb/>
said, however, that they have already expressed <lb/>
themselves on this subject. Well, I think the <lb/>
remarks of the hon. member for West Durham <lb/>
(Mr. Blake) are conclusive on that point. I think <lb/>
that every legal mind must agree that his reason<lb break="no"/>ing in that case was perfectly correct, that these <lb/>
members, not having been elected to deal with <lb/>
this subject, are not, as regards it, the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional mouthpiece of the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West. When they were elected there was no <lb/>
such cry before the people, and no such ques<lb break="no"/>tion at issue. They had received no such instruc<lb break="no"/>tion whatever from the people on that subject, <lb/>
and, therefore, it cannot be contended that theirs <lb/>
was a proper representation of the people. But <lb/>

one hon. gentleman says it would be dangerous to <lb/>
refer a question of this kind to the people, that it <lb/>
would be dangerous to go among them and freely <lb/>
discuss whether they should abandon the printing <lb/>
of their Journals and their debates in French; yet, <lb/>
in the same breath, that hon. gentleman has told <lb/>
us he was willing to refer to them the question of <lb/>
separate schools. He holds that it would be quite <lb/>
safe to discuss before the people the question of <lb/>
taking away their separate schools, but that it <lb/>
would be dangerous to go among them and discuss <lb/>
a question as simple as this. It is argued by some <lb/>
that this is a question affecting the rights of minori<lb break="no"/>ties, and that, therefore, this House should deal <lb/>
with it. Well, I think that a very great dis<lb break="no"/>tinction lies as to what are the rights of min<lb break="no"/>orities and what are not. Minorities have rights, <lb/>
it is true, but they must be limited, because if <lb/>
they are to be co-extensive with the majority, <lb/>
then the minorities would in all cases rule. The <lb/>
rights of a minority must be those important <lb/>
rights which belong to civilised people an are re<lb break="no"/>cognised by the laws of nations. They are the rights <lb/>
relating to civil and religious liberties, and the <lb/>
protection of life, liberty and property. These <lb/>
are matters in which the rights of a minority <lb/>
should be protected, and which this Parliament <lb/>
should keep under control. It is in accord with that <lb/>
principle that the amendment moved by the hon. the <lb/>
Minister of Justice proposes that this Parliament <lb/>
should continue to maintain power over the printing <lb/>
of the ordinances and over the courts of the <lb/>
country. But as to the other question of what <lb/>
language the debates should be conducted, the <lb/>
Journals of the House printed in, that is a question <lb/>
of pure expense and convenience which should be <lb/>
left, as the amendment proposes, to the people of <lb/>
the North-West Territories for decision so soon as <lb/>
they shall be heard from. I do not think that <lb/>
either the hon. member for North Simcoe or the <lb/>
hon. member for South Victoria, who are both <lb/>
lawyers, would object to a court of which the <lb/>
judge was either French or acquainted with the <lb/>
French, the jury French, and only acquainted with <lb/>
the French language, or some of them only <lb/>
acquainted with it, and the prisoner and witnesses <lb/>
only acquainted with that tongue, having its pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings conducted in French. It would be highly <lb/>
inconvenient, and, perhaps, effect a miscarriage of <lb/>
justice if they were not. Therefore, I do not <lb/>
believe that any of the hon. gentlemen who support <lb/>
the measure of the hon. member for North Simcoe, <lb/>
looking at the question in that light, would say <lb/>
that there should be no French used in the courts <lb/>
in the North-West. Why, Sir, you might have all <lb/>
the parties from the judge to the prisoner, the <lb/>
jurymen, the witnesses and the prosecutor, <lb/>
acquainted only with French, or a portion of <lb/>
them not conversant with any other language. <lb/>
How could such a court be conducted solely in the <lb/>
English tongue? Could the prisoner in that case <lb/>
be sure that he was getting justice, since he could <lb/>
understand nothing that was being said? Could <lb/>
the evidence be thoroughly sifted and the witnesses <lb/>
thoroughly cross-examined, if the lawyers did <lb/>
not understand the language the witnesses spoke? <lb/>
the hon. member for North Victoria spoke of <lb/>
ordinances and statutes of the North-West Council. <lb/>
I understand there are no statutes, properly so <lb/>
called, in the North-West Territories, and I must <lb/>
suppose he referred to the statutes of Canada. <lb/>

<cb/>

Would any hon. gentleman contend that our statutes, <lb/>
which are circulated among our people for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of educating the people as to what the law is, <lb/>
should be placed in the hands of magistrates and <lb/>
officers throughout the country printed only in the <lb/>
English language, which to many of them is an un<lb break="no"/>known tongue? How could these magistrates, how <lb/>
could the people learn them if published only in a <lb/>
language they did not understand? As to this <lb/>
question of the rights of the minority, I would say <lb/>
that in these matters, such as appertain to a <lb/>
court, where a man's life and property may be <lb/>
brought in question, it is right that this House <lb/>
should retain its protectorate, and in the other <lb/>
matters, such as the internal economy of the council <lb/>
it is only just that the council should deal with them <lb/>
just as soon as the people are consulted in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter. But the hon. member for North Victoria said <lb/>
that this amendment amounted to a put off, that <lb/>
it was a promise to do to-morrow what we would <lb/>
not do to-day, and that when that to-morrow came <lb/>
it would not be carried out, or he insinuated as <lb/>
much by saying we knew what would be done. If <lb/>
I interpret the language of the resolution rightly, <lb/>
it implies nothing of the kind. It says in plain <lb/>
language that this House admits it to be expedient <lb/>
and proper, and not inconsistent with the cove<lb break="no"/>nants, that the Legislative Assembly of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories should receive from the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada ‚Äî not to-morrow, but now ‚Äî the <lb/>
power to regulate, ‚Äî to regulate when? ‚Äî after <lb/>
the next general elections of the North-West As<lb break="no"/>sembly, the proceedings of the Assembly and the <lb/>
manner or recording and publishing such proceed<lb break="no"/>ings. But the declaration is that they should not <lb/>
have that right after the next general elections, <lb/>
but now. I believe the objection taken by the <lb/>
hon. member for North Victoria is perfectly met by <lb/>
the language of the amendment. But the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe claims for his measure that <lb/>
it is one which will promote national greatness. <lb/>
He says that the nation should be greater, and that <lb/>
he does not see how a nation could become great <lb/>
in which there were several official languages. <lb/>
He said that he had not stated that a nation could <lb/>
not be great under those circumstances, but that a <lb/>
a nation would become greater and more united if <lb/>
all the people spoke the one language. It does not <lb/>
follow, and the hon. gentleman admitted to-day <lb/>
that it did not follow, that a nation might not <lb/>
become united and loyal to their constitution and <lb/>
government because they used more than one <lb/>
language, and history does not assist him in setting <lb/>
forth that a nation would become greater if it <lb/>
spoke only one language. We have only to cast a <lb/>
rapid glance back on the nations of the past to <lb/>
find that they attained greatness where they spoke <lb/>
many languages, and that they attained their <lb/>
highest point of greatness while speaking many <lb/>
languages. It never happened that any great <lb/>
nation has lasted long enough to be reduced to <lb/>
one language only. Therefore history virtually <lb/>
rebuts the proposition that a nation may not <lb/>
become greater while speaking more than one <lb/>
language, because those nations of the past be<lb break="no"/>came great while speaking many languages, and <lb/>
it was only when, in some cases, in their <lb/>
greatness, they exerted paternal treatment of <lb/>
the conquered or annexed countries, these very <lb/>
forces became a weakness to the state and <lb/>
caused them to crumble and fall away. We <lb/>

that there were those in the Province of Quebec <lb/>
who had a dream of establishng a French nation<lb break="no"/>ality on the banks of the St. Lawrence, but the <lb/>
hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) in<lb break="no"/>formed the House‚Äîas is well-known‚Äîthat in the <lb/>
Province of Ontario there are those who have a <lb/>
dream of a greater nation, a nation speaking the <lb/>
Anglo‚ÄîSaxon tongue, not confined to the banks of <lb/>
the St. Lawrence or to any one country, but ex<lb break="no"/>tending over the whole world. Such is no doubt <lb/>
the dream of many in the Province of Ontario, and <lb/>
elsewhere, that there may be a nation with a com<lb break="no"/>munity of language extending from pole to pole. <lb/>
Such dreams may be indulged in without doing <lb/>
any particular harm to anybody. They may please <lb/>
the dreamer without hurting his neighbors. Such <lb/>
questions, however, I think are not for us to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss here. Such questions should be left to Him <lb/>
who moves in a mysterious way His wonders to <lb/>
perform, and who, for His own wise purposes, has <lb/>
created different nations and given us different <lb/>
languages and taught us different creeds. In His <lb/>
hands I think we can leave the future which is <lb/>
certainly so far away, but for the present, let us <lb/>
each and all do what we can to maintain the pa<lb break="no"/>triotic sentiment of our people and to establish <lb/>
unity among the different classes of this Dominion, <lb/>
the different races and the different creeds, to es<lb break="no"/>tablish peace, harmony and good fellowship; let us <lb/>
become a nation great, glorious and united‚Äîunited <lb/>
not only by interest but by love; and then, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, as long as the old St. Lawrence rolls his <lb/>
course unto the sea, so long shall Canada remain <lb/>
great, glorious and free. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. DAVIES</persName> (P. E. I.) Had the resolution <lb/>
submitted by the Minister of Justice and intro<lb break="no"/>duced, as I understand, as the expression of <lb/>
the Government's views on this question, pro<lb break="no"/>posed what I considered to be a fair, and just, and <lb/>
final settlement of this question, it would have re<lb break="no"/>ceived my support and it would have received that <lb/>
support in silence; but, inasmuch as that resolution <lb/>
does not, in my opinion, offer to this House a fairly <lb/>
just and final settlement, I feel myself obliged to <lb/>
state in a few words wherein I differ from it, and <lb/>
the course I deem it proper to pursue. We have <lb/>
had a very lengthened debate and I am sure, after <lb/>
five days' debating, it is not to be expected or de<lb break="no"/>sired that any hon. gentleman should make a long <lb/>
speech. We have had the question viewed from <lb/>
an historical aspect, and from I do not know how <lb/>
many other aspects, but to my mind the importance <lb/>
of the question has not been minimised by the <lb/>
manner in which it has been treated on both <lb/>
sides of the House. At first it did not appear <lb/>
to be a matter of such wonderful importance, <lb/>
but it has been magnified by the press out<lb break="no"/>side, and by hon. gentlemen on both sides of the <lb/>
House, until now, no doubt, it has assumed a posi<lb break="no"/>tion of national importance. I must frankly say <lb/>
that the House need not be ashamed of the debate. <lb/>
It has been maintained, on both sides of the House, <lb/>
at a higher standard than any debate I have list<lb break="no"/>ened to for many years in this Parliament. As to <lb/>
the historical aspect of this question, I will make <lb/>
only one remark. We have had learned gentlemen <lb/>
referring us to precedents in Europe in days gone <lb/>
by, and even in the present‚Äîto precedents in <lb/>
Austro-Hungary, in Switzerland, in Italy, in Spain, <lb/>

<cb/>

and in I do not know how many other countries. <lb/>
No doubt there are lessons to be derived from each <lb/>
and all of these countries, but I think it must have <lb/>
struck many hon. members of this House that <lb/>
there is very little application of the case of an old <lb/>
country such as Switzerland, made up of different <lb/>
nationalities, inheriting traditions of centuries‚Äî <lb/>
traditions of hatred, traditions of loyalty, tradi<lb break="no"/>tions of language and traditions of religion‚Äîto a <lb/>
great lone land such as we have here unpeopled, <lb/>
and for which we have to legislate. It seems to me <lb/>
therefore that, although you may deduce certain les<lb break="no"/>sons from the historical references that have been <lb/>
made to these countries, weare starting out as it were <lb/>
on a new plane altogether, and must determine this <lb/>
question which is before us on practical data which <lb/>
we can gather for ourselves from the circumstances <lb/>
and condition of the North-West Territories. We <lb/>
had from the hon. and learned gentleman who sits <lb/>
beside me‚ÄîMr. Mills (Bothwell)‚Äîthe other night <lb/>
a speech replete with information, a speech in which <lb/>
he argued the question in a very calm and logical <lb/>
manner, enforced with a world and a wealth of <lb/>
illustration which was remarkable, a speech which <lb/>
was very concise and lucid, and which, I think, <lb/>
maintained the hon. gentleman in the high posi<lb break="no"/>tion which he has in this House as one of its most <lb/>
profound thinkers and most able debaters. But <lb/>
what was the conclusion which he drew? I think <lb/>
the conclusion was based on common sense, and <lb/>
it was that whether we should or should not have in <lb/>
this country one language or two or three languages <lb/>
was simply a matter of convenience. That was the <lb/>
practical conclusion which he drew, and I think it is <lb/>
a very fair and just conclusion. If that is admitted, <lb/>
the next question is, who is to determine the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of convenience? That is the stage which we <lb/>
have now reached. Is it to be the Parliament of <lb/>
Canada, composed of men from the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, from the Province of Quebec and from Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Columbia, more than half of whom, I venture to <lb/>
say, have never set foot in the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories at all, who know nothing of the wants and <lb/>
desires of the people there, or is it to be the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the North-West themselves? I think any <lb/>
practical man would give an answer to that ques<lb break="no"/>tion in a very short time. The answer which I <lb/>
give to that question is the one which leads me <lb/>
to the conclusion to which I have come, and <lb/>
which I will support with my vote. In the <lb/>
first place, we have before us the Bill of the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), <lb/>
which has been so much discussed. But I will <lb/>
say this frankly and fully, that divorced from <lb/>
its preamble, disassociated from the speeches of <lb/>
its introducer, both in this House and outside <lb/>
the House, disassociated, if you can disassociate <lb/>
it, from the crusade which he is charged with <lb/>
carrying on, that Bill would offer a solution of the <lb/>
question not very unfair. But it has two defects <lb/>
in my mind, and they are fatal defects. One is <lb/>
that no man, in my humble opinion, who has <lb/>
followed the course of events in this country for <lb/>
the past five or six months, who knows the pro<lb break="no"/>mises and the pledges that that hon. gentleman <lb/>
gave to the public, who knows the circumstances <lb/>
under which he gave those promises and pledges, <lb/>
and who witnessed the introduction of that Bill, <lb/>
and heard the speech with which it was introduced <lb/>
‚Äî‚Äîno man, I say, can disassociate the enacting part <lb/>
of that Bill from its preamble or from the inter<lb break="no"/>

<fw type="num">943</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">944</fw> 

pretation of that preamble which was given in the <lb/>
speech with which it was introduced. The Bill <lb/>
and the preamble must stand or fall together; and <lb/>
it is all nonsense for the hon. gentleman to come <lb/>
into this Chamber after five days of debate have <lb/>
taken place, after passions of creed and passions <lb/>
of race have been aroused, not only in this House <lb/>
but through the country, by his Bill and by his <lb/>
speech‚Äîfor him to come into the House now and <lb/>
say: "I find I have made a mistake, and I am will<lb break="no"/>ing to withdraw the preamble if you will allow <lb/>
the Bill to go into the Committee and carry it." <lb/>
I venture to say that style of action will not com<lb break="no"/>mend itself to the common sense of the House. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman attempted to make the House be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the meaning of that preamble had been <lb/>
magnified that the preamble did not mean that <lb/>
which a man of common sense would imply from its <lb/>
language. Well, Sir, I can put but one meaning <lb/>
upon it, and that is the meaning which, if I did not <lb/>
derive it from the Bill, I would certainly derive <lb/>
from the preamble when read in the light of the <lb/>
speech with which the hon. gentleman introduced <lb/>
his Bill. What does the preamble say? <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Whereas it is expedient in the interest of the national <lb/>
unity of the Dominion that there should be commu<lb break="no"/>nity of language among the people of Canada." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>Well, Sir, does the hon. gentleman think this <lb/>
House is a debating club? Are we to put in our <lb/>
Bills more abstract propositions? The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is too old a parliamentarian not to know that <lb/>
when a proposition of that kind is placed in the <lb/>
preamble of a Bill it is placed there for the purpose <lb/>
of taking legislative action upon it, and when he <lb/>
places it there he places it as the key to the enacting <lb/>
part which is to follow; and to say that he asks <lb/>
Parliament to carry a mere abstract proposition <lb/>
on which legislation is not to be based, is merely <lb/>
to turn this House into a debating club. But, Sir, <lb/>
that was not the object of the hon. gentleman. <lb/>
His speech was plain, and although the closing <lb/>
speech which he delivered to this House has been <lb/>
commended so much, those who followed the hon. <lb/>
gentleman clearly could see that he pledged him<lb break="no"/>self that the crusade which he had taken up, <lb/>
which was now beginning, was to take up the rest <lb/>
of his political life. He is now upon the threshold <lb/>
of the work which he is engaged in, and he is not <lb/>
going to stop by repealing section 110 of the <lb/>
Revised Statutes of Canada relating to the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories, but he is going to carry out <lb/>
that principle which he has enunciated in the pre<lb break="no"/>amble of his Bill, and, therefore, those who vote <lb/>
for his Bill to-night, who prefer that solution of <lb/>
the question, cannot divorce the preamble from it, <lb/>
and they cannot vote for the Bill divorced from the <lb/>
preamble and the speech made by the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who introduced it. But, Sir, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man talked as if in this House‚Äîand that language <lb/>
is re-echoed in very many parts of this country to <lb/>
the discredit of those who use it‚Äîhe talks as if, in <lb/>
this House, hon. gentlemen are divided by race <lb/>
and creed distinctions; indeed, one would suppose <lb/>
that in the House of Commons of Canada, to listen <lb/>
to some hon. gentlemen here, and to listen to their <lb/>
organs in the public press, this House is divided by <lb/>
a broad line, French gentlemen on one side trying <lb/>
to carry out their opinions, and the English-<lb break="yes"/>speaking members being on the other endea<lb break="no"/>voring to enforce their opinions. Sir, I believe, in <lb/>
relation to this question of languages, that the <lb/>

<cb/>

social forces, the commercial forces, and the poli<lb break="no"/>tical forces which are at work in this Dominion, <lb/>
are slowly but surely‚Äîand none the less surely <lb/>
because slowly‚Äîworking out to one end, so far as <lb/>
language is concerned, to make the English lan<lb break="no"/>guage in the future, the vehicle of communi<lb break="no"/>cation in Parliament and outside Parliament. <lb/>
It is not by legislative enactments, it is not by <lb/>
preambles declaratory of intentions such as are <lb/>
expressed here, but by the impulse of natural <lb/>
forces, by necessity and convenience, that this <lb/>
great result will be achieved. What did we hear <lb/>
in the House the other day? We heard from the <lb/>
hon. member for Ottawa (Mr. Robillard) a con<lb break="no"/>fession, which was re-echoed from this side of the <lb/>
House, that every French gentleman in the <lb/>
country‚Äîsuch are the forces at work in this com<lb break="no"/>munity‚Äîis convinced that he would not be doing <lb/>
justice to his children if he brought them up in <lb/>
ignorance of the English language and English <lb/>
literature. The fact is, as he told us, that the <lb/>
French boys of the present age are being educated <lb/>
in both languages, so that when they grow <lb/>
up they will be able to take their place, not <lb/>
only in the parliamentary arena, but in the com<lb break="no"/>mercial circles of the great commercial centres. <lb/>
Is there discord between races and creeds in this <lb/>
House? What sight do we behold in this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to-night? We see one of the historical parties <lb/>
of Canada led by whom? Led by a French gentle<lb break="no"/>man who was elected as leader of the great Liberal <lb/>
party‚Äîbecause he was a French Canadian? No; <lb/>
but because his ability and his experience, his tact <lb/>
and his urbanity, fitted him for that high position; <lb/>
and I will venture the assertion that the choice <lb/>
made by that party two or three years ago has been <lb/>
more than justified by the experience we have had <lb/>
of his leadership in the House. Sir, I will venture <lb/>
to say, although he is a French Canadian, that he <lb/>
enjoys the confidence of his followers to as large an <lb/>
extent as his distinguished predecessors did. We <lb/>
have every confidence in him, we know his breadth <lb/>
of view, we know that he is not animated by racial <lb/>
or creed antipathies, but that he desires to build <lb/>
up a nation in this country upon broad and gener<lb break="no"/>ous grounds. Sir, I venture this further remark <lb/>
that, after two or three years' experience of his <lb/>
leadership, he not only enjoys the thorough <lb/>
confidence of those who follow him, but <lb/>
he has earned, and has deservedly earned, <lb/>
the respect of his political opponents. Well, we <lb/>
heard that hon. gentleman charged here the other <lb/>
night by the hon. member who introduced the Bill <lb/>
‚Äîand I know why he charged it, he charged it from <lb/>
the basest of motives‚Äîthat that hon. gentleman <lb/>
was a party to certain treasonable language which <lb/>
was used down on the banks of the St. Lawrence, <lb/>
or language alleged to be treasonable, by the <lb/>
Premier of Quebec; and he charged that the leader <lb/>
of the Liberal party had sanctioned by his presence <lb/>
and by his silence, the use of that language. Sir, <lb/>
that was ignorance on the part of the hon. member, <lb/>
and it was unjust, also, because he knew, he could <lb/>
not help but know, that the hon. gentleman Who leads <lb/>
the Liberal party had not only taken occasion at <lb/>
the very time to rebuke the language, or to dissent <lb/>
from the language, or from some of the extreme <lb/>
expressions which were made use of on that occa<lb break="no"/>sion; but, afterwards,in the great city of Toronto, <lb/>
before an English speaking audience, he had read <lb/>
his disclaimer from the paper which printed it at <lb/>

<pb n="945" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00945.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">945</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 20, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">946</fw>

the time, and had then declared himself as true <lb/>
and as thoroughly a British Canadian as any man in <lb/>
Canada. Sir, I have this further to say, and I <lb/>
hope before this debate is closed that it will be <lb/>
proved conclusively that the language which <lb/>
it is alleged Mr. Mercier used on that occa<lb break="no"/>sion, has been foully and falsely misrepresented. <lb/>
I was shown to-night by an hon. gentleman who <lb/>
sits near me a correct transcript of that language, <lb/>
and I do not think it is right that an hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man holding the high position of Premier of one of <lb/>
the greater Provinces, should be held up to public <lb/>
scorn and contumely for having used language <lb/>
which he never used, and for having preached <lb/>
treason which he never preached, but when as a <lb/>
matter of fact the sentiments he uttered were not <lb/>
stronger than those embodied in the preamble of <lb/>
the resolution which the leader of the Government <lb/>
asks this House to endorse. The language which <lb/>
Mr. Mercier used on that occasion was as follows:‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Whilst protesting our respect and our friendship, too, <lb/>
for the representatives of other races and other creeds, <lb/>
whilst declaring ourselves ever ready to grant to them <lb/>
their rights everywhere and at all times, on all occasions <lb/>
and in everything; whilst offering to divide with them <lb/>
as between brethren the immense territory and the enor<lb break="no"/>mous wealth which Providence has laid before us; whilst <lb/>
willing to live with them in perfect harmony under the <lb/>
shadow of the flag of England and the sceptre of a Queen <lb/>
loved of all, we solemnly declare that never shall we <lb/>
renounce the rights guaranteed to us by treaties, by laws <lb/>
and by the constitution. <lb/></p> 

<p>"Treaties, law and constitution secure to us the right <lb/>
of remaining Catholic and French, and Catholic and <lb/>
French we will remain. <lb/></p> 

<p>"Let us proclaim it ahigh and aloud, so that among our <lb/>
opponents there be no false hopes, so that in our own ranks <lb/>
there be. no weakness; the persecution of the first years <lb/>
of English domination succeeded not in crushing our <lb/>
fathers; no more shall the persecutions, which now <lb/>
threatens, succeed in crushing us, their descendants. <lb/></p> 

<p>"We are now two millions and a half of French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians in America, proud of the past, strong in the present <lb/>
and confident of the future; we scorn and laugh at the <lb/>
threats of our enemies." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>I see nothing in that language to condemn, there <lb/>
is no treason in it; there is nothing about building <lb/>
up a French nationality on the banks of the St. <lb/>
Lawrence. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. RYKERT</persName>. What is the date of the <lb/>
speech? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. DAVIES</persName> (P. E.I.) It is Mr. Mercier's <lb/>
speech, delivered before St. Jean Baptiste Society <lb/>
on 24th of June. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:AMYO1">Mr. AMYOT</persName>. 24th of May, I was there. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCNE1">Mr. MCNEILL</persName>. Where did the hon. gentleman <lb/>
get that report? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. DAVIES</persName> (P. E.I.) I am told it was not an <lb/>
extempore but a carefully written speech, and <lb/>
one which was read from the manuscript. It is a <lb/>
copy from the manuscript I have read, and the <lb/>
hon. gentleman who sits behind me was present on <lb/>
the occasion, and so far as his memory serves those <lb/>
were the words used. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:AMYO1">Mr. AMYOT</persName>. I was there myself, and it was <lb/>
the same speech. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. DAVIES</persName> (P. E. I.) Let me pass from that <lb/>
point. None of the resolutions and amendments <lb/>
proposed commend themselves to my judgment so <lb/>
much as that submitted by the hon. member for <lb/>
West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin). It is short, and <lb/>
while it might perhaps be improved and made <lb/>
a little more definite in some of its phrases, it pro<lb break="no"/>ceeds upon the correct lines. It proposes that <lb/>

<cb/>

this whole question should be relegated to the <lb/>
people of the North-West Territories, that they, at <lb/>
the next general election, should instruct their <lb/>
representatives how they should vote and act, and <lb/>
that the representatives of the people after being <lb/>
instructed by the people at the polls should decide <lb/>
for themselves what languages should be used in <lb/>
the House, in debate, in the votes and proceedings, <lb/>
in the ordinances and in the courts. That resolu<lb break="no"/>tion proceeds upon broad, liberal lines. It com<lb break="no"/>mends itself to my mind, because it shows faith in <lb/>
the people, a desire to leave that which concerns <lb/>
those people, more immediately than our people, <lb/>
to the people of the North-West themselves, to <lb/>
the people who are the best judges. What do the <lb/>
people of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and <lb/>
New Brunswick know of this matter? I have <lb/>
never set my foot in the North-West, and I am <lb/>
not as competent as are gentlemen living there, <lb/>
to judge as to whether one, two, or three lan<lb break="no"/>guages should be used. It is a question which <lb/>
they should determine; to them it should be <lb/>
relegated, and I never found yet, if you put <lb/>
full and ample trust in the people, that <lb/>
the people will fail you. The Liberal party have <lb/>
proclaimed time and again their belief in Provincial <lb/>
rights. But it is said there are no Provincial <lb/>
rights mixed up in this matter because there are no <lb/>
Provinces. That is a mere quibble. The basis <lb/>
underlying Provincial rights is the same whether <lb/>
the people belong to a Territory or belong to a <lb/>
Province. What is that basis? It is, that upon <lb/>
all matters of purely local concern the people more <lb/>
immediately affected should determine how the <lb/>
matters should be decided. It is the same principle <lb/>
either applied to a Province with full political <lb/>
rights or to the North-West Territories with partial <lb/>
political rights; the underlying principle is the <lb/>
same in both cases. It is said that the people have <lb/>
spoken, and that the North-West Council has <lb/>
already told this House what is the opinion of the <lb/>
people of the North-West. But that argument has <lb/>
been sufficiently answered. The North-West repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives were not elected to do more than legis<lb break="no"/>late within the bounds of the constitution under <lb/>
which they were elected; they were not elected to <lb/>
change that constitution or to express to this Par<lb break="no"/>liament the voice of the people with respect <lb/>
to any such change. The question never came <lb/>
before the people at the last election, and if I <lb/>
am correctly informed, not two, three or four, <lb/>
but six or seven representatives, when the question <lb/>
came before them, expressed a desire that the <lb/>
question should be relegated to the people, and <lb/>
that they should receive instructions from their <lb/>
constituents. This Dominion has had enough of <lb/>
forcing a change of constitution on Provinces by <lb/>
the action of the Legislature, irrespective of the <lb/>
people. It was done in Nova Scotia and you have <lb/>
an open sore there to this day. You have had a par<lb break="no"/>tially discontented Province, and why? Simply <lb/>
because the people, when their constitution was <lb/>
proposed to be taken away, had not an opportunity <lb/>
of declaring whether they wished that course to be <lb/>
followed or not. We should not try to repeat that <lb/>
experiment, even on a small scale. I desire to <lb/>
follow on the lines of the Liberal party, laid down <lb/>
here years and years ago; in all local matters to <lb/>
refer the questions to the people more immediately <lb/>
interested. I have never found that solution of <lb/>
the difficulty to fail; it has always proved equal to <lb/>

<pb n="947" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-20_Page_00947.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">947</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">948</fw> 

the occasion. Provinces have been driven almost <lb/>
to revolt; there has been discontent in Ontario <lb/>
and in Quebec; but when you apply the principle <lb/>
of Provincial rights, when you allow the people to <lb/>
deal with their own local affairs as they please, <lb/>
the question is settled always in the way the <lb/>
people desire it to be settled. So it should be <lb/>
in the North-West Territories. They have <lb/>
an equal right to speak with the people of <lb/>
the older Provinces, and I, for one, will not be a <lb/>
party to taking away that right, which, if my own <lb/>
Province was interested, I would expect to have <lb/>
given to it. I believe if we apply the principles of <lb/>
provincial rights we are treading upon safe ground, <lb/>
upon ground we have travelled before, upon a well <lb/>
tried and beaten path which has always led us out <lb/>
of difficulties; but, if you abandon that, and <lb/>
take up some other ground and say that Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment should deal with this subject, whether com<lb break="no"/>petent or not, or whether it possesses the requisite <lb/>
information or not, you are entering a sea of diffi<lb break="no"/>culties, from which I, at least, see no safe haven. <lb/>
The hon. member for West Durham (Mr. Blake), <lb/>
who made an able and brilliant speech the other <lb/>
night, did not deal in many historical arguments, <lb/>
but he gave us two from modern history: the one <lb/>
with respect to the question of the use of the dual <lb/>
languages in Schleswig-Holstein, and the other with <lb/>
respect to their use in Poland, and he asked <lb/>
us to pay great respect to the recommendations <lb/>
of the English statesmen in those two cases. I <lb/>
have no doubt that any recommendation by <lb/>
English statesmen, experienced in matters of this <lb/>
kind, would carry great weight. Upon what <lb/>
lines did they go? Just on the lines that we are <lb/>
asking you shall go now: to leave it to the <lb/>
people to decide how many languages they shall <lb/>
have, or if they shall have but one. That was the <lb/>
proposition which the English Secretary of State <lb/>
made in his despatch with reference to the Schles<lb break="no"/>wig-Holstein question and that was the same <lb/>
proposition which the great powers of Europe made <lb/>
with reference to the settlement of the language <lb/>
question in Poland. Therefore, if these great <lb/>
English precedents are to have any weight, if hon. <lb/>
gentlemen opposite, some of whom I have in my <lb/>
eye now who pay very great respect to the opinions <lb/>
and recommendations of English statesmen, will <lb/>
pay weight to these opinions I have referred to, <lb/>
they will vote for the resolution of the member for <lb/>
West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) and leave this matter <lb/>
to the people, who are best qualified to judge of it <lb/>
themselves. I wish to say a few words with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the amendment of the hon. the Minister of <lb/>
Justice. I am opposed to that amendment, as I <lb/>
stated in my opening remarks, upon the ground <lb/>
that it is a half-and-half measure, for it gives with <lb/>
one hand what it withholds with the other. By it <lb/>
you declare that you have a half belief in the <lb/>
right of the people to decide this question, but <lb/>
that you have not full confidence in them. It <lb/>
seems to me to be a hesitating, half-hearted Tory <lb/>
proposition. You say: "We will give them the <lb/>
power to determine whether their proceedings and <lb/>
speeches shall be in one or two languages, but, oh, <lb/>
we cannot trust the eople to decide as to whether <lb/>
their ordinances shal be published in one or two <lb/>
languages." That is all nonsense. Why withdraw <lb/>
from the people of the Territories the right to de<lb break="no"/>termine whether one, two or three languages shall <lb/>
be used? It may be that the Germans will go to <lb/>

<cb/>

those Territories in sufficient numbers to justify the <lb/>
Legislature of that country in determining that the <lb/>
ordinances shall be published in German. Should <lb/>
any objection be offered? Certainly not. I object <lb/>
to this amendment, because it leaves this question <lb/>
which has given rise to so much trouble, so much <lb/>
heartburning and so much turmoil in the same <lb/>
position as it is now, namely, on the Table of this <lb/>
House. If this amendment of the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice is adopted the question will come up next <lb/>
year. You will have the same debate, and you <lb/>
will have more bitterness imported into it than <lb/>
now. We have had on this occasion the restrain<lb break="no"/>ing influence which comes from the fact that the <lb/>
great leaders occupying the front benches on both <lb/>
sides of the House have united to give us wise <lb/>
counsel, to commend us to be prudent, to be cau<lb break="no"/>tious, to refrain from exciting language, and to re<lb break="no"/>member that underlying this question there are <lb/>
others which may result in the disruption of the <lb/>
whole Dominion. The debate, so far, has been <lb/>
conducted with an abstinence from exciting <lb/>
language which is certainly commendable, but <lb/>
if you keep this question open, what guarantee <lb/>
have you that this commendable abstinence from <lb/>
violent language is going so be repeated next year? <lb/>
The hon. member for North Simcoe will doubtless <lb/>
bring up this question again next year, for he would <lb/>
be inconsistent in his course if he did not do so. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA5">Mr. MCCARTHY</persName>. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. DAVIES</persName> (P.E.I.) The hon. gentleman will <lb/>
move next year that the right which was given to <lb/>
the people of the North-West with reference to <lb/>
their votes and proceedings, shall also be extended <lb/>
to their ordinances, and on what ground could you <lb/>
withhold it? I, for one, can see no logical or just <lb/>
reason for going half way in this matter. If we <lb/>
are going to trust the people let us trust them fully, <lb/>
and let us show them that we have confidence in <lb/>
them. The hon. Premier cited an instance from <lb/>
Ontario nearly one hundred years old, to show that <lb/>
the people of Ontario, United Empire Loyalists <lb/>
as they were, were not unworthy then to be trusted <lb/>
with the disposition of a matter similar to the <lb/>
one now before us. Did these people a hundred <lb/>
years ago act harshly or tyrannically? No. The <lb/>
First Minister showed that they acted in a <lb/>
broad and generous spirit, and that they pub<lb break="no"/>lished their ordinances and their debates in <lb/>
the languages which were understood by the two <lb/>
races of the people. Are their descendants to-day, <lb/>
who have gone to the North-West, less broad or <lb/>
less generous than their forefathers were a hundred <lb/>
years ago? Not at all, Sir. The precedent which <lb/>
the hon. gentleman has cited is directly against <lb/>
this half-hearted resolution, and if it is good for <lb/>
anything it is good to prove that the people of the <lb/>
North-West are as qualified to-day‚Äînay, if we <lb/>
judge from the spread of education; if we can <lb/>
judge from the increase of toleration which has <lb/>
been going on among the people of North America <lb/>
for the last hundred years‚Äîthey are more qualified <lb/>
to deal with this question in a broad, generous and <lb/>
free spirit than were their forefathers. I see <lb/>
nothing but procrastination, delay and danger, in <lb/>
this amendment of the Minister of Justice, and I <lb/>
oppose it upon the ground that I do not believe it <lb/>
will give satisfaction to the people more imme<lb break="no"/>diately interested, or will work effectively or justly <lb/>
if carried into law. <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. LANGELIER</persName> (Montmorency.) (Transla<lb break="no"/>tion). I do not desire to detain the House very <lb/>
long, Mr. Speaker; nor have I the pretention that I <lb/>
have anything very new in the shape of argument to <lb/>
offer upon the important question which concerns <lb/>
us at the present moment. Nevertheless, the <lb/>
speeches delivered by the member for North Simcoe <lb/>
contain assertions so unjust, so destitute of founda<lb break="no"/>tion, that I wish to arraign some of them. What <lb/>
is the object of the Bill of the member for Simcoe? <lb/>
Is it the interest of the public which urges him <lb/>
on? Is it really a sincere desire to consolidate the <lb/>
Canadian nationality in the Dominion? I answer <lb/>
emphatically, no. His sole object is to continue <lb/>
to excite the various races which inhabit this <lb/>
country, the one against the other; his sole end <lb/>
is to enflame religious prejudice, and to build for <lb/>
himself a small political party on the ruins which <lb/>
he shall have made, to the injury of political peace <lb/>
and religious tolerance in Canada. His Bill, I say, <lb/>
is an outrageous provocation to the French of this <lb/>
country. Last year, it was the Catholic sensibility <lb/>
which the member for North Sinicoe wished to <lb/>
wound with the Jesuit question; this time it is <lb/>
the French nationality which he attacks, wounding <lb/>
in this way the two strongest and most sensitive <lb/>
feelings which exist in any nation proud and <lb/>
courageous. For months and months the member <lb/>
for North Simcoe and the press at his command <lb/>
have not ceased to insult and vilify us. Have you <lb/>
seen any agitation in the Province of Quebec? <lb/>
No. Have you seen any tumultuous meetings <lb/>
gathered together in order to protest again these <lb/>
insults? No. Have you seen brought into this <lb/>
House any petitions asking for the rejection of this <lb/>
Bill? None whatever. Why so? It is because, in <lb/>
spite of what they think in certain quarters, we <lb/>
understand constitutional rule. We have remained <lb/>
calm,‚Äîconfiding in the justice of this House; and <lb/>
this justice will be meted out to us. In a few <lb/>
moments this anti-French Bill of the member for <lb/>
North Simcoe will be crushed by the same humiliat<lb break="no"/>ing majority which crushed out his motion against <lb/>
the Jesuits. In face of this display of narrow <lb/>
fanaticism, I ask whether we of French origin have <lb/>
done anything to justify it? I think not. Our <lb/>
history is there, to show on the contrary our spirit <lb/>
of tolerance, our spirit of friendliness. I asked a <lb/>
moment ago: Have we provoked our fellow <lb/>
Citizens of English origin? No. I shall quote <lb/>
to this House an eloquent witness to our spirit of <lb/>
tolerance,‚Äîand this evidence has fallen from the <lb/>
lips of a qualified man, from the lips of an English <lb/>
Conservative who played a no mean part in this <lb/>
country and who died a baronet in England; I <lb/>
mean Sir John Rose. What did this politician <lb/>
say, during the debates on Confederation? I shall <lb/>
allow him to speak for himself: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"It is a very grave and anxious question for us to consider <lb/>
‚Äîespecially the minorities in Lower Canada‚Äîhow far our <lb/>
mutual rights and interests are respected and guarded, <lb/>
the one m the General and the other in the Local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. With reference to this subject, I think that I, <lb/>
and those with whom I have acted‚Äîthe English-speaking <lb/>
members from Lower Canada‚Äîmay in some degree con<lb break="no"/>gratulate ourselves at having brought about a state of <lb/>
feeling between the two races in this section of the <lb/>
rovmce which has produced some good effect. <lb/>
There has been ever since the time of the union, <lb/>
am happy to say‚Äîand every body knows it who <lb/>
as any experience in Lower Canada‚Äîa cordial under<lb break="no"/>standing and friendly feeling between the two nationa<lb break="no"/>lities, which has produced the happiest results. Belong<lb break="no"/>ing to different races and professing a different faith, <lb/>

<cb/>

we live near each other: we do not trench upon the <lb/>
rights of each other; we have not had those party and <lb/>
religious differences which two races, speaking different <lb/>
languages and holding different religious beliefs might be <lb/>
supposed to have had: and it is a matter of sincere grati<lb break="no"/>fication to us, I say, that this state of things has existed <lb/>
and is now found amongst us. But if, instead of this <lb/>
mutual confidence; if, instead of the English-speaking <lb/>
minority placing trust in the French majority in the Local <lb/>
Legislature, and the French minority placing the same <lb/>
trust in the English majority in the General Legislature, <lb/>
no such feeling existed, how could this scheme of Confe<lb break="no"/>deration be made to work successfully? I think that it <lb/>
cannot be denied that there is the utmost confidence on <lb/>
both sides; I feel assured that our confidence in the <lb/>
majority in the Local Government will not be misplaced, <lb/>
and I earnestly trust that the confidence they repose in <lb/>
us in the General Legislature will not be abused. I hope <lb/>
that this mutual yielding of confidence will make us both <lb/>
act in a high-minded and sensitive manner when the <lb/>
rights of either side are called in question‚Äîif ever they <lb/>
should be called in question‚Äîin the respective Legisla<lb break="no"/>tures. This is an era in the history of both races‚Äîthe <lb/>
earnest plighting of each other's faith as they embrace<lb/>
    this scheme. It is remarkable that both should place <lb/>
such entire confidence in one another: and in future <lb/>
ages our posterity on both sides will be able to point <lb/>
with pride to the period when the two races had <lb/>
such reliance, the one on the other, as that each <lb/>
was willing to trust its safety and interest to the <lb/>
honor ofthc other. This mutual confidence has not been <lb/>
brought about by any ephemeral or spasmodic desire for <lb/>
change on the part of either; it is the result of the know<lb break="no"/>ledge each race possesses of the character of the other. <lb/>
It is because we have learned to respect each other's <lb/>
motives and have been made to feel by experience that <lb/>
neither must be aggressive, and that. the interests of the <lb/>
one are safe in the keeping of the other * * * A feel<lb break="no"/>ing of distrust between the French and English races in <lb/>
the community would have rendered even the fair con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the scheme of union impracticable. Would <lb/>
the French have, in that case, been now ready to trust <lb/>
themselves in the General Legislature, or the English in <lb/>
the Local Legislature, of Lower Canada? No; and I pray <lb/>
God that this mutual confidence between the two races <lb/>
which have so high and noble a work to do on this conti<lb break="no"/>nent, who are menaced by a common danger, and actuated <lb/>
by a common interest, may continue for all time to come; <lb/>
I pray that it may not be interrupted or destroyed by any <lb/>
act of either party; and I trust that each may continue to <lb/>
feel assured that if at any time hereafter circumstances <lb/>
should arise, calculated to infringe upon the rights of <lb/>
either, it will be sufficient to say, in order to revent any <lb/>
aggression of this kind: 'We trusted each other when we <lb/>
entered this union; we felt then that our rights would be <lb/>
sacred with you: and our honor and good faith and inte<lb break="no"/>grity are involved in and pledged to the maintenance of <lb/>
them.' I believe this is an era in our history in which <lb/>
in after ages our children may appeal with pride, and <lb/>
that if there should be any intention on either side to <lb/>
aggress upon the other, the recollection that each trusted <lb/>
to the honor of the other will prevent that intention <lb/>
from being carried out. Feeling as I do thus strongly <lb/>
that our French fellow-subjects are placing entire <lb/>
confidence in us, in our honor and our good faith, we <lb/>
the English-speaking population of Lower Canada, ought <lb/>
not to be behind hand in placing confidence in them. I <lb/>
feel that we have no reason as a minority to fear aggres<lb break="no"/>sions on the part of the majority. We feel that in the <lb/>
past we have an earnest of what we may reasonably <lb/>
expect the future relations between the two races to be. <lb/>
But although this feeling of mutual confidence may be <lb/>
strong enough in our breasts at this time, I am glad to <lb/>
see that my hon. friend the Attorney General East, as <lb/>
representing the French majority in Lower Canada, and <lb/>
the Minister of Finance as representing the English-<lb break="yes"/>speaking minority, have each carefully and prudently <lb/>
endeavored to place as fundamental conditions in this <lb/>
basis of union such safeguards and protection as the two<lb/>
    races may respectively rely upon." <lb/></p>

further: <lb/></p>

<p>"We the English Protestant minority of Lower Canada <lb/>
cannot forget that whatever right of separate education <lb/>
we have was accorded to us in the most unrestricted <lb/>
way before the union of the Provinces, when we were in <lb/>
the minority and entirely in the hands of the French <lb/>
population. We cannot forget that in no way was there <lb/>
any attempt to prevent us educating our children in the <lb/>

tribution of State funds for educational purposes was <lb/>
made in such a way as to cause no complaint on the part <lb/>
of the minority. I believe we have always had our fair <lb/>
share of the public grants in so far as the rench element <lb/>
could control them, and not only the liberty, but every <lb/>
facility for the establishment of separate dissentient <lb/>
schools wherever they were deemed desirable. A single <lb/>
person has the right, under the law, of establishing a <lb/>
dissentient school and obtaining a fair share of the edu<lb break="no"/>cational grant, if he can gather together fifteen children <lb/>
who desire instruction in it. Now we cannot forget that <lb/>
in the past this liberality has been shown to us, and that <lb/>
whatever we desired of the French majority in respect to <lb/>
education they were, if it was at all reasonable, willing <lb/>
to concede. We have thus in this, also, the guarantee of <lb/>
the past that nothing will be done in the future unduly to <lb/>
interfere with our rights and interests as regards educa<lb break="no"/>tion, and I believe that everything that we desire will be <lb/>
as freely given by the Local Legislature as it was before <lb/>
the union of the Canadas." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>This is the handsome eulogium of the tolerance <lb/>
of the French Canadians, made by an Englishman <lb/>
who had passed his life in their midst. And to<lb break="no"/>day as a reward for our justice towards the English <lb/>
minority, behold an Englishman, a distinguished <lb/>
member of this House, comes and asks us to deprive <lb/>
of their language the French minority in the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories of the North-West. I appeal on its behalf <lb/>
to the sentiment of justice in this House whose <lb/>
most noble prerogative is the protection of the <lb/>
weak. Now, Mr. Speaker, I wish to answer some <lb/>
of the assertions made by the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) in the last speech he <lb/>
has made in support of the Bill. This hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber looks as if he believed that the Protestants are <lb/>
frightfully maltreated in the Province of Quebec‚Äî <lb/>
that we render their existence very bitter. Let <lb/>
us settle at once this point. There are in our <lb/>
Province 188,309 Protestants and 1,170,718 Roman <lb/>
Catholics according to the census of 1881. The <lb/>
Protestants, therefore, only represent 13 per cent., or <lb/>
one-seventh of the total population of our Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. They are only in the majority in the Coun<lb break="no"/>ties of Compton, Stanstead, Brome, Missisquoi, <lb/>
Huntingdon and Argenteuil. Nevertheless, they <lb/>
have ten representatives. In these six counties the <lb/>
Protestants have only a majority of 2,136 and are <lb/>
in the minority in Sherbrooke, Montreal West, <lb/>
Pontiac and Megantic, so that they would have a <lb/>
right only to six members instead of ten, if they <lb/>
were excluded from representation in those coun<lb break="no"/>ties where they are in the minority. I may also <lb/>
add that, since Confederation, several counties, <lb/>
whose population is wholly Catholic, have elected <lb/>
English Protestant members. I can mention the <lb/>
following names: Mr. Clarence Hamilton was <lb/>
elected in the County of Bonaventure; Mr. W. <lb/>
Price, for Chicoutimi and Saguenay; the Hon. <lb/>
Mr. Joly for Lotbiniere; Mr. Heinming and Mr. <lb/>
Watts, for Drummond and Arthabaska; the Hon. <lb/>
Mr. Church for the County of Ottawa; the Hon. <lb/>
Mr. Wurtele for the County of Yamaska; the <lb/>
Hon. D. A. Ross for the County of Quebec; and <lb/>
Mr. Pozer for Beauce. This shows that the French-<lb break="yes"/>Canadians are not prejudiced in the matter of their <lb/>
representatives. It is the same thing in the <lb/>
Legislative Council, which is composed of 24 <lb/>
members. According to population, the Protes<lb break="no"/>tants, only forming one-seventh of the Province, <lb/>
would only have a right to but three Legislative <lb/>
Councillors out of the twenty-four, but notwith<lb break="no"/>standing, they have five, that is to say, one-fifth. <lb/>
But there is more to say. In the five divisions repre<lb break="no"/>sented by Protestants the majority is Roman <lb/>
Catholic. The Protestants are only as 34 to 100 of the <lb/>

<cb/>

population. In 1878, we had, in the person of Mr. <lb/>
Joly, a Protestant, as First Minister. The Hon. Mr. <lb/>
Joly is a man among the Protestants who occupies <lb/>
the best position in the Province of Quebec. Was <lb/>
there ever complaint made that a Protestant was at <lb/>
the head of affairs in the Province of Quebec? No, <lb/>
Mr. Speaker; but the English Tories endeavored <lb/>
to excite the national prejudices of the French <lb/>
Canadians, by throwing into their teeth the sneer <lb/>
that they had a Protestant at the head of the <lb/>
Government. Now, turning to the school question, <lb/>
let us see in what manner Protestants are treated <lb/>
in the Province of Quebec. I will not give my own <lb/>
opinion, but I am going to quote an opinion which <lb/>
will not be gainsaid by any one. It is that of the <lb/>
Rev. Mr. Rexford, the secretary of the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant section of the Council of Public Instruction <lb/>
in the Province of Quebec. In the course of last <lb/>
summer in the Province of Ontario they carried on <lb/>
an anti-French and an anti‚ÄîCatholic campaign. At <lb/>
this juncture, they represented the Government of <lb/>
the Province of Quebec as a Government which <lb/>
wished to drive out all the Englishmen from the <lb/>
country. The leader of the Government addressed <lb/>
a letter to the Rev. Mr. Rexford, in which he <lb/>
asked him for certain imformation respecting Pro<lb break="no"/>testant public education in the Province of Quebec. <lb/>
Mr. Rexford answered by the following letter dated <lb/>
the 4th of July, 1889:‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p rendition="simple:centre">"DEPARTMENT or PUBLIC EDUCATION. <lb/></p> 

<p rendition="simple:right">"QUEBEC, 4th July, 1889. <lb/></p> 

<p>"To the Honorable the First Minister of the Province of <lb/>
Quebec: <lb/></p> 

<p>"DEAR SIR,‚ÄîI have the honor to acknowledge the <lb/>
receipt of your letter of the 27th June last, containing <lb/>
questions reSpecting the Protestant schools of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, and I take the liberty of submitting the <lb/>
following declarations to serve as answers to these ques<lb break="no"/>tions:‚Äî <lb/></p> 

<p>"First question‚ÄîWhat is the condition of the Protestant <lb/>
se arate schools in the Province of Quebec? <lb/></p> 

<p>"Answer‚ÄîThe Protestant schools of the Province of <lb/>
Quebec are either schools controlled, by the minority of <lb/>
the ratepayers of the municipality in which they are <lb/>
situated, under the control of five school commissmners; <lb/>
or they are dissentient schools belonging to the minority <lb/>
of a municipality, under the control of three school <lb/>
trustees. ere are in the Provmce 916 of these <lb/>
elementary schools, thirty-eight, model schools, and nine<lb break="no"/>teen academies, forming a total of nearly 1,000 schools <lb/>
attended by 34.440 scholars. These schools, in a number <lb/>
of cases, suffer somewhat from the density of the dissen<lb break="no"/>tient element on which their support depends; but they <lb/>
enjoy all the rights and privileges of the schools belong<lb break="no"/>ing to the majority of the inhabitants of the Province as <lb/>
regards school regulations, class books, the course of <lb/>
studies, and the capacity of the teachers; in the last con<lb break="no"/>nection they are perhaps slightly more favored than some <lb/>
of the schools belonging to the majority of the people of <lb/>
the Province. It is a fact that the Protestant Committee, <lb/>
having a smaller number of schools under its control, is <lb/>
in a condition to take, when matters make it necessary, <lb/>
measures to improve the condition of the Protestant <lb/>
schools, before similar measures can be adopted with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the Roman Catholic schools of the Province." <lb/></p> 

<p>"Second question‚ÄîPlease give me an abbreviated state<lb break="no"/>ment of the law bearing on this subject, and upon the <lb/>
rights given to the Protestants to support separate schools <lb/>
in our Province. ¬† <lb/></p> 

<p>"Answer‚ÄîFor school purposes, the Province is divided <lb/>
into sections. called school municipalities. The schools of <lb/>
these municipalities are under the direction of five commis<lb break="no"/>sioners elected by the ratepayers. If the majority of the <lb/>
inhabitants of the municipality are Protestant, the <lb/>
schools of the municipality are conducted comformably to <lb/>
the regulations issued by the Protestant Committee, re<lb break="no"/>specting the course of study class-books, teachers, &amp;c. <lb/>
When the Protestants form the minority in the munici<lb break="no"/>pality and they are not satisfied with the government of <lb/>
the schools, they have the right to record their dissent, <lb/>
and to notify the school commissioners that they <lb/>
are either in whole or in art dissentients. They <lb/>
then elect three trustees, evoted to the govern<lb break="no"/>

<fw type="num">953</fw> <fw type="dateline">[February 20, 1890]</fw> <fw type="num">954

</fw>ment of their dissentient schools. These dissentient <lb/>
schools enjoy all the rights and privileges of the <lb/>
schools of the majority of the inhabitants of the munici<lb break="no"/>pality save in this one point, that the dissentient trus<lb break="no"/>tees cannot levy school taxes upon duly incorporated <lb/>
companies. This power belongs to the school commis<lb break="no"/>sioners of each municipality, who are bound to place in <lb/>
the hands of the trustees a portion of the taxes levied on <lb/>
the companies legally constituted as corporations, in pro<lb break="no"/>portion to the number of scholars attending their re<lb break="no"/>spective schools. In other respects, the dissentient <lb/>
trustees have the same powers as the school commission<lb break="no"/>ers in all that respects the schools placed under their <lb/>
control. If the dissentients of a municipality are too <lb/>
weak in numbers to support a school they can unite with <lb/>
a neighboring municipality of their own religious belief, <lb/>
with the object of supporting these schools. Every head <lb/>
of a family residing in a municipality not provided with a <lb/>
dissentient school, may (1) if he belongs to the minority, ¬† <lb/>
(2) if he has children of an age to attend school and (3) if <lb/>
he lives within three miles of a school of his own religious <lb/>
faith situated in another municipality, pay his taxes <lb/>
towards the support of this school, and send his children <lb/>
there. ¬† <lb/></p> 

<p>"Any person belonging to the religious minority may, at <lb/>
any time whatsoever, become a dissentient by giving the <lb/>
prescribed notices, but he is subject to the payment oi <lb/>
the ordinary taxes imposed by the school commissioners <lb/>
for the current year and having reference to the exist<lb break="no"/>ing debts of the school corporation. In every case, on <lb/>
the formation of a new municipality, if the notice of the <lb/>
dissentients is given within the month followmg the erec<lb break="no"/>tion of the municipality, the dissentients are not subject <lb/>
to the taxes imposed by the school commissioners. <lb/></p> 

<p>"When, in the municipality, the minority is a dis,<lb break="no"/>sentient one it has a right to a portion of the property of <lb/>
the school corporation from which it is dissentient. This <lb/>
    portion is determined <hi rendition="simple:italic">pro rata</hi> according to the value <lb/>
of the taxable property represented by the dissentients. <lb/>
The Protestant Schools, dissentient or under the con<lb break="no"/>trol of school commissioners, are placed under the super<lb break="no"/>intendence of the Protestant Committee of the Council of <lb/>
Public Instruction, at the present time composed of ten <lb/>
members appointed by the Government, of five members <lb/>
appointed by the committee, and of one member elected <lb/>
by the Provincial Association of Protestant School <lb/>
Teachers. This committee has the power of making <lb/>
regulations respecting Protestant schools, normal schools, <lb/>
boards of examiners, school inspectors, class-books, as <lb/>
well as all matters respecting the organisation, the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and the discipline of Protestant schools, and the <lb/>
classification of schools and teachers. The McGill normal <lb/>
school educates, under the control of regulations made <lb/>
by this committee, the teachers for the non-Catholic por<lb break="no"/>tion of the Province. <lb/></p> 

<p>"The central board of Protestant examiners, acting in <lb/>
accordance with the regulations of the committee, has <lb/>
alone the power of issuing certificates to act as teacher in <lb/>
the Protestant schools. Five regular inspectors and three <lb/>
special inspectors, appointed on a recommendation of the <lb/>
Protestant committee, perform the duty of inspection as <lb/>
regards the Protestant schools of the Province. <lb/></p> 

<p>"Third question.‚ÄîPlease tell me the number of Pro<lb break="no"/>testant separate schools that there are in this Province <lb/>
and the sum of money which they receive from the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment? <lb/></p> 

    <p>"Answer:‚Äî1st. There are about one thousand separate <lb/>
Protestant schools in the Province; 2nd. The subsidy <lb/>
granted by the Government for elementary instruction is <lb/>
$160,000. ¬† This sum is distributed among the school muni<lb break="no"/>cipalities of the Province, in proportion to their total popu<lb break="no"/>lation, as ascertained at the last census. In each muni<lb break="no"/>cipality where there are dissentient schools in charge of <lb/>
trustees the portion of the grant coming to the munici<lb break="no"/>pality is divided between the school commissioners and <lb/>
dissentient trustees in proportion to the number of children <lb/>
attending their respective schools. As this grant is, in <lb/>
the first place, divided according to the total population, <lb/>
and then, where there exist dissentient schools, on account <lb/>
of the variable assistance given to the school, it is impos<lb break="no"/>sible to state the exact amount of the grant received by <lb/>

approximately these schools receive in proportion to the <lb/>

<p>Well, you see with what liberality the Protestant <lb/>
minority is treated in the Province of Quebec. It <lb/>
is of little consequence whether it be English or <lb/>
Protestant, it is treated with the liberality and <lb/>
justice which are due to minorities. There is <lb/>
another question which we know agitates the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe. It is the question res<lb break="no"/>pecting the Jesuit Estates. This question has come <lb/>
again to be threshed out before this House. Com<lb break="no"/>plaint is made of the famous preamble of the Bill <lb/>
respecting which so much noise was made last year. <lb/>
I shall not quote, in reply to what has been said, <lb/>
any other authority than that of a Protestant who <lb/>
occupies one of the highest positions in our Province, <lb/>
and who is looked upon with the greatest respect <lb/>
by the Protestants of the Province of Quebec. I <lb/>
mean the Hon. Mr. Joly. This is what he said on <lb/>
this matter in a letter addressed to the Montreal <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Witness</hi> on the 7th of January last: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Jesuit Estates Act has become the signal for a <lb/>
strong agitation throughout the Dominion. Men who for <lb/>
so many years lived together in confidence and friendship, <lb/>
in spite of the differences of origin and creed, have now <lb/>
become suspicious the one of the other and are gradually <lb/>
separating more and more. * * Every effort ought to be <lb/>
brought to bear in order to preserve this time-honored <lb/>
sentiment of confidence and mutual tolerance, which has <lb/>
allowed us, Canadians as we are, English and French, <lb/>
Roman Catholics and Protestants, to live happily and in <lb/>
peace, side by side, in days when there is but little peace <lb/>
in the world. Such efforts deserve to be supported by all <lb/>
men endued with good will. * * If I had been a member of <lb/>
the Legislature at the time, and the name of the Pope and <lb/>
his consent might have been omitted, I would have <lb/>
insisted in placing them in the Bill before allowing it to <lb/>
be adopted. <lb/></p> 

<p>"* * * At first sight, a great portion of the preamble of <lb/>
the Bill appears to be out of place and subject to objec<lb break="no"/>tions or superfluous: but after re-examination the atten<lb break="no"/>tive reader, especially if he is possessed of some legal <lb/>
knowledge, will be struck with the display of minute <lb/>
precautions which have been taken to obtain on behalf <lb/>
of the Province, a final and non-appealable judgment." <lb/></p>

<p>This is how, Mr. Speaker, a Protestant holding <lb/>
the position which Mr. Joly does, appreciates the <lb/>
preamble of the Bill respecting the Jesuit Estates, <lb/>
which has been so severely criticised in this House. <lb/>
Another assertion on the part of the hon. member <lb/>
which has astonished me, is that which he has <lb/>
    made when alleging that <hi rendition="simple:italic">La V√©rit√©</hi> is the organ of <lb/>
the Quebec Government. He appears to me to be <lb/>
a close reader of this journal, because he constantly <lb/>
quotes it in his speeches. Probably because he <lb/>
takes delight in it and reads it on Sunday in order <lb/>
to keep holy the Sabbath day. I protest, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, against the statement of the hon. member. <lb/>
One must be a complete stranger to what is going <lb/>
on in the Province of Quebec to make such an <lb/>
    assertion. <hi rendition="simple:italic">La V√©rit√©</hi> is not the organ of any poli<lb break="no"/>tical party; not more the organ of the Conservative <lb/>
party; not more the organ of the hon. Ministers <lb/>
who are sitting on the Treasury benches, than the <lb/>
organ of the Quebec Government. And, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, I do not desire any other proof of this <lb/>
than an article in this journal published on the <lb/>
    26th October, 1889. This is what <hi rendition="simple:italic">La V√©rit√©</hi> said: <lb/></p>

it will be so long as we have the control of it, a journal <lb/>
absolutely independent of party politics." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>We see by this article how very unjust was the <lb/>
statement of the hon. member in wishing to excite <lb/>
prejudices in the Province of Quebec, by making it <lb/>
believed that this newspaper reflected the opinion <lb/>
of the great majority of a population of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, and that it reflected above all, <lb/>
the opinion of the Government of Quebec. And, <lb/>
    finally, <hi rendition="simple:italic">La Minerve</hi> addressing itself to <hi rendition="simple:italic">La V√©rit√©</hi> <lb/>
asked it several questions with regard to the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Quebec. And what did Mr. Tardivel <lb/>
answer in his journal? He said that he accepted <lb/>
Mr. Mercier as the lesser evil. He paid us the <lb/>
compliment of saying that we were worth more <lb/>
than our adversaries,‚Äîwhich is, by the way, but <lb/>
a poor compliment. I can cite, Mr. Speaker, a <lb/>
more recent example of the liberality of Mr. <lb/>
Mercier towards the Protestant minority of the <lb/>
Province of Quebec, No further back than fifteen <lb/>
days, a representative in the Legislature of Quebec, <lb/>
Mr. Hall, presented a Bill on the subject of uni<lb break="no"/>versity degrees. This Bill could only have passed <lb/>
the Assembly and the Council through the grace <lb/>
and influence of the head of the Executive of <lb/>
Quebec. I shall quote touching the estimation in <lb/>
which the Hon. Mr. Mercier is held; a newspaper <lb/>
which I am convinced the hon. member for North <lb/>
    Simcoe should read as attentively as <hi rendition="simple:italic">La V√©rit√©</hi>, <lb/>
and whose statements he cannot doubt. This is <lb/>
    what the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mail</hi> said three or four days ago: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
    <p>"The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mail</hi> is not often able to commend Mr. Mercier's <lb/>
political acts, but it would be domg him an injustice if it <lb/>
failed to congratulate him upon the course which he has <lb/>
taken with regard to Mr. Hall's B. A. Bill, which has now <lb/>
passed both Houses of the Quebec Legislature. He made <lb/>
a vigorous speech in support of it in the Assembly, and <lb/>
exercised his great powers in the Council in order to se<lb break="no"/>cure its passage there. He deserves credit, therefore, for <lb/>
thus assisting in the removal of one of the disabilities <lb/>
under which the Protestant minority in Quebec has long <lb/>
been laboring. * * It is not difficult understand the <lb/>
intense satisfaction with which the friends of Protestant <lb/>
education in Quebec regard the removal of a disability <lb/>
which has weighed heavdy upon them for many years. " <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>I am now going to cite, with regard to this Bill, <lb/>
    what <hi rendition="simple:italic">La V√©rit√©</hi>, so often quoted by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber from North Simcoe, has said. These are the <lb/>
reproaches which that newspaper cast upon the <lb/>
leader of the Government in connection with the <lb/>
adoption of this measure, of date the 8th instant: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"And at the time of the third reading had it not been for <lb/>
the scandalous intervention of the First Minister in favor <lb/>
of the Bill, the majority of the members would have re<lb break="no"/>jected this exceptional legislation. We say scandalous <lb/>
intervention. <lb/></p> 

<p>"In fact, contrary to all parliamentary usage, Mr. Mer<lb break="no"/>cier quitted his seat, while the members were entering the <lb/>
House in order to vote, and ran about the hall of meeting, <lb/>
openly bringing to bear the weight of his influence as <lb/>
leader of the party, upon certain Liberals well known on <lb/>
accountof their hostility to the Bill. This was an unseemly <lb/>
act which the Speaker of the House did not prevent, as <lb/>
he might have done and ought to have done." <lb/></p>
        </quote>
        <p>
This is the manner in which the newspaper, <lb/>
which the hon. member of North Simcoe says <lb/>
represents the opinions of the Government of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, treats the leader of this Government. I trust <lb/>
that in the future the hon. member will give him<lb break="no"/>self the trouble to read other newspapers in the <lb/>
Province of Quebec, in order the better to inform <lb/>
himself about what is passing there. For along <lb/>
time past this hon. member, and those other <lb/>
members of his own kidney, have taken a. consi<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

derable interest in our affairs. The proper mode <lb/>
of making himself well informed in all that res<lb break="no"/>pects us would be to read trustworthy journals, like <lb/>
            the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Electeur</hi> for example, which is perfectly up to <lb/>
            the mark in the affairs of the Province, and <hi rendition="simple:italic">La <lb/>
Justice</hi>, in whose columns my hon. friend the <lb/>
member for Bellechasse (Mr. Amyot) often writes. <lb/>
He would obtain through these newspapers all <lb/>
the information possible respecting our affairs. <lb/>
Another of our crimes, Mr. Speaker, is the case <lb/>
of Miss Maybee. It would seem that, eminently <lb/>
respectable as this young woman is, she has made <lb/>
herself latterly much talked about. It has been <lb/>
sought to make it believed that the objections <lb/>
against the appointment of Miss Maybee, to the <lb/>
post office at Quebec, were owing to the fact that <lb/>
she came from the Province of Ontario and that <lb/>
she was a Protestant. I say that this is entirely <lb/>
false. In this connection I will quote what has <lb/>
been said by a Conservative newspaper in Quebec, <lb/>
            the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ev√®nement</hi>. This is how this journal looks <lb/>
upon this appointment: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"As the business of this lady will be merely to work a <lb/>
small caligraphic machine, in the post office, we do not <lb/>
see why they go so far to look for an employ√© when they <lb/>
could easily have found one in our own city. It is not to <lb/>
our knowledge, and not to the knowledge of any one, that <lb/>
in any public office in the Province of Ontario did they <lb/>
dream of bringing from Quebec or Montreal a French <lb/>
Canadian woman to fill any employment whatsoever. Are <lb/>
we bound to be more generous, more complaisant than our <lb/>
neighbors. especially when we possess already persons <lb/>
who are fitted to do the work required in the present <lb/>
case?" <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>Well, I must say this to the hon. member: The <lb/>
gallantry of Frenchmen is proverbial; and cer<lb break="no"/>tainly there is nobody among us who would not <lb/>
have been delighted to keep within our walls this <lb/>
Miss Maybee, who, by the way, they say is very <lb/>
pretty, as are, moreover, all English ladies. If my <lb/>
hon. friend, the member for North Simcoe, would <lb/>
visit our Province he would discover that the <lb/>
English and the French Canadians live on the best <lb/>
possible terms; he would see that in many cases <lb/>
Englishmen marry French Canadian women and <lb/>
that French Canadian men marry English women. <lb/>
If one may judge by the fruit of their affections, it <lb/>
is certain that they make good matches, for it does <lb/>
not appear that, either on the one side or the other, <lb/>
they are disposed to break the bonds of union. In <lb/>
order to conceal somewhat the sentiment which <lb/>
overrules him‚Äîand this sentiment is nothing else <lb/>
but fanaticism‚Äîthe member for North Simcoe <lb/>
tells us that it is necessary that the nation should <lb/>
speak but one language, if it wishes to become <lb/>
homogeneous. He has quoted, to this effect, several <lb/>
extracts from newspapers in Ontario and elsewhere. <lb/>
I will quote for him a work which, I think, possesses <lb/>
fully as much authority as these newspapers. This <lb/>
is what on this point the great dictionary, of <lb/>
Larousse says at the word "nationality": <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"NATIONALITY: And in the first place what is a <lb/>
nationality? What is it which gives it its character? <lb/>
What is it that makes a nation? Is it the community of <lb/>
origin and race? By no means for there is no people <lb/>
which has not been more or less mixed during the course <lb/>
of ages with foreign elements, and there is no race which <lb/>
is not sub-divided into several nationalities. Is it unity <lb/>
of language? Community of language is one of the great<lb break="no"/>est characteristics of a nation; but it is not alone suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to stamp it, because a nation perfectly united and <lb/>
homogeneous may include populations speaking different <lb/>
languages. Can it be said, for example, that Brittany, <lb/>
Provence and Alsace at the present time separated from <lb/>
us, do not belong to the French nationality, cause they <lb/>
Speak in those countries languages which are not those of <lb/>

Touraine and the Isle de France? If this point of view is <lb/>
taken it must be affirmed that Alsace ought not to be <lb/>
French but German." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>But the hon. member will perhaps say: You quote <lb/>
in this connection French authorities, but in my <lb/>
eyes these authorities have hardly any value. <lb/>
Well, I will quote for him other authorities, which <lb/>
have much more weight than the newspapers which <lb/>
he has read to this House. I will read to him the <lb/>
words of a Governor who has left behind him a <lb/>
very great popularity among us, and who has gone <lb/>
to gather in the Indies, and whereever the English <lb/>
Crown may send him, new laurels. I refer to Lord <lb/>
Dufferin. This is what he said about the French <lb/>
Canadians: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"At this moment the French Canadian race, to which <lb/>
you belong, is engaged in a generous rivalry with your <lb/>
fellow-subjects of English origin,the end of which is to <lb/>
see which of the two will contribute most to the moral, <lb/>
material, and political advancement, as well as to the pros<lb break="no"/>perity of the country. There is not one student, man of <lb/>
business or of science, politician, or writer, of either origin, <lb/>
who does not feel himself inspired by this noble emula<lb break="no"/>tion. The issue of this conflict depends on the success of <lb/>
your efforts, on the efficiency of your discipline and of <lb/>
you education upon the character of the moral, and <lb/>
intellectual atmosphere which you create in this region." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>These words were spoken in reply to any address, <lb/>
which was presented to him by Laval University <lb/>
in Quebec. On another occasion the same noble <lb/>
Lord expressed himself as follows:‚Äî <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I think that Canada should esteem itself happy in <lb/>
owing its prosperity to the mixture of several races. <lb/>
The action and the reaction of several national idiosyn<lb break="no"/>crasies, the one upon the other, give to our society a <lb/>
freshness, a coloring, an elasticity, a vigor, which without <lb/>
them would be wanting to it. The statesman who would <lb/>
seek to obliterate these distinctive characteristics would <lb/>
be truly badly advised. <lb/></p> 

<p>"Whatever it may be elsewhere, the French race in <lb/>
Canada has learned to appreciate the advantages of mo<lb break="no"/>deration, this golden rule of societies, and the necessity of <lb/>
arriving at practical results by sacrificing the demands of <lb/>
a too inexorable logic, and by settling grave difficulties <lb/>
by generous compromises." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>There is something more yet. If we go further <lb/>
back still in the political history of our country, <lb/>
we find that those who made the Constitution, <lb/>
which governs us since we have been under British <lb/>
rule, have always taken scrupulous care not to wound <lb/>
the prejudices, or the national or religious suscepti<lb break="no"/>bilities of the various peoples who inhabit Canada. <lb/>
I have taken the pains to read the debates which <lb/>
took place in England when they gave us the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution of 1774. Immediately after this Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion was given us, a Constitution by which they took <lb/>
    away the trial by jury and the writ of <hi rendition="simple:italic">habeas corpus</hi>; <lb/>
a petition was siged at Quebec, addressed to Her <lb/>
Majesty, asking for the restitution to the citizens <lb/>
of Canada, of the trial by jury and the writ of <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">habeas corpus</hi>. Very interesting debates took <lb/>
place in the English House of Commons, at this <lb/>
period, and we find in the Parliamentary History, in <lb/>
volume 18, what follows. It is Sir Robert Smith, a <lb/>
member of the House of Commons, who is <lb/>
speaking: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Whoever reflects upon the excellencies of the British <lb/>
laws, whoever considers them in theory, or sees the daily <lb/>
advantages of them in practice, whoever justly admires <lb/>
them for their peculiar lenity, moderation, equity, and <lb/>
impartiality, would wish to see them extended over the <lb/>
whole face of the British Empire; but if there are local <lb/>
and circumstantial reasons, arising from the national <lb/>
character of the people, their language, customs, usages, <lb/>
institutions, and I will even add their prejudices, which <lb/>
in this case ought to be consulted, and not only consulted <lb/>
but, in some measure, indulged; but if there are reasons <lb/>
arising from these various Circumstances, that make it <lb/>
impossible for the English laws to be adopted in their <lb/>

<cb/>

original purity, I will venture to affirm, that a legislator is <lb/>
not only justified but that it is an essential part of his duty, <lb/>
so to alter and modify these laws as may best adapt them to <lb/>
the peculiar genius and temper of the people, so as to <lb/>
become the best rule of civl conduct possible, and the <lb/>
best calculated to promote their general happiness. It <lb/>
was ever the maxim of the greatest legislators of anti<lb break="no"/>quity, to consult the manners and dispositions of the <lb/>
people, and the degrees of improvement they had then <lb/>
received, and to frame such a system of laws as was best <lb/>
suited to their then immediate situation." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>Such were, at this epoch, the precautions taken <lb/>
in order not to wound the religious sentiments and <lb/>
the national sentiments of the various races which <lb/>
then peopled Canada. When the English Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment itself gives such an example of conciliation <lb/>
and moderation, I think that it is in very bad part <lb/>
for the hon. member for North Simcoe to wish to<lb break="no"/>day to bring to an end the old traditional British <lb/>
fair play, and to oppress the minority, as he desires <lb/>
to do by this Bill. I may say also that it was not <lb/>
because the English population was fairly large <lb/>
that so much care was taken of Canada at this time; <lb/>
nor was it because she was very influential I am <lb/>
going to quote what was said then before a com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the House which, before passing the Act <lb/>
to amend the Quebec Bill, summoned before it <lb/>
General Murray and General Carleton, and heard <lb/>
them respecting Canadian affairs. This committee <lb/>
sat on the 2nd June, 1774. A question was put to <lb/>
General Carleton and this is how he answered: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Protestants in Canada are under 400, about 360; <lb/>
but the French inhabitants who are all Catholics amount <lb/>
to 150,000. <lb/></p> 

<p>"Lord NORTH. Are those 360 men of substance? <lb/></p> 

<p>"Gen. CARLETON. Much the greatest art of them <lb/>
are not. There are some that have purchase seigniories, <lb/>
some in trade and some reduced soldiers; but the major<lb break="no"/>ity are men of small substances." <lb/></p> 

<p>"Mr. JENKINSON. Is there much intercourse or com<lb break="no"/>munication between those 360 and the rest of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince?" <lb/></p> 

<p>"Gen. CARLETON. Very little. <lb/></p> 

<p>"Lord NORTH. Are these people, upon the whole, <lb/>
proper and eligible for an Assembly to be chosen from <lb/>
them? <lb/></p> 

<p>"Gen. CARLETON. I should apprehend, by no means." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, as we see when those pre<lb break="no"/>cautions were taken, about which I spoke a few <lb/>
moments ago, it was not merely in order to pro<lb break="no"/>tect the English minority, because Gen. Carleton <lb/>
answers that the English population which dwelt <lb/>
in Canada at that period was far from being in<lb break="no"/>fluential and important. But if at that time there <lb/>
were men of elevated views, practical men, who <lb/>
asked that the people of the Province of Quebec <lb/>
might be placed on a footing of equality with the <lb/>
other British subjects; there were also at that <lb/>
time, men of narrow minds, men wishing to excite <lb/>
prejudices, as there exist such at the present day. <lb/>
I discovered while making the researches, which I <lb/>
have given to the House, a remarkable incident <lb/>
which I must relate. There happened to live, at <lb/>
the time in question, a certain Richard Whitworth, <lb/>
who was probably one of the political ancestors of <lb/>
the hon. member for North Simcoe, if one may <lb/>
judge from his remarks. The House of Commons <lb/>
had returned from the House of Lords, where they <lb/>
had attended to hear the sanction of the Bills. <lb/>
These are the words, which I again borrow from <lb/>
the history of England: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"SIR,‚ÄîI have often wished that some member would <lb/>

the royal assent, sir, be given in the language of truth. <lb/>
    We have sir, even in our proceedings, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Die Martis</hi>, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Die <lb/>

of the King's assent being given in French, is the remains <lb/>
of Norman slavery; a disgrace to the British Parliament, <lb/>

either an address or Bill be forwarded to obtain the royal <lb/>
assent for the future, to be given in good honest English. <lb/>
I am fully satisfied it would make the people much <choice><sic>hap<lb break="no"/>ier</sic><corr>happier</corr></choice>. (The House was in a continual laugh.) <lb/></p> 

<p>"The speaker replied very gravely that, as the matter <lb/>

This occasioned a second flow ofgood humor. The House, <lb/>
however, was adjourned immediately." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that the Bill of the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe is going to meet <lb/>
with the same fate as the proposition made by this <lb/>
Mr. Whitworth in the House of Commons of Eng<lb break="no"/>land. It was in 1774, that this destroyer of French <lb/>
made his speech in the English House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. In the speech delivered by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Simcoe, when introducing the meas<lb break="no"/>ure now under consideration, he quoted a portion <lb/>
of Lord Durham's report on the affairs of Canada; <lb/>
he has only quoted that portion which applied to <lb/>
Lower Canada. He spoke of the troubles and <lb/>
difficulties which existed in Quebec in 1837 and in <lb/>
1838. We know that at this period the people of <lb/>
the Province fought in order to obtain those liber<lb break="no"/>ties of which we are so proud to-day. Several of <lb/>
them ascended the scaffold; others were exiled, <lb/>
and the constitutional liberties acquired with the <lb/>
price of the blood of our ancestors, are to-day <lb/>
shared in by the English who live in Canada. <lb/>
After listening to the speech of the hon. member, <lb/>
one would be led to believe that difficulties existed <lb/>
only in Lower Canada. Nevertheless, We find in <lb/>
Lord Durham's report that difficulties existed also <lb/>
in Upper Canada. This is what he says: <lb/></p>

<p>"The Irish Roman Catholics complain loudly and with <lb/>
reason about the existence of Orangeism in this Colony. <lb/>
They are justly indignant that, in a Province, which their <lb/>
loyalty and their bravery has effectually aided in preser<lb break="no"/>ving , their feelings are outraged by the processions and <lb/>
the banners of this association. The leaders probably <lb/>
hope to make use of this sort of standing conspiracy, of <lb/>
this illegal organisation in order to win for them political <lb/>
power: it is an Irish‚ÄîTory institution, having rather a <lb/>
political complexion than a religious one. The organisa<lb break="no"/>tion of this body allows its leaders to exercise a powerful <lb/>
influence on the populace: And it is stated that at the <lb/>
last elections the cries carried several seats by means of <lb/>
the violent acts committed by the rabble thus placed at <lb/>
their disposal. But it must not be a matter of surprise, if <lb/>
the existence of such an institution, wounding one class <lb/>
by its scornful hostility to its religion, and another class <lb/>
by its violent opposrtion to its policy, should excite among <lb/>
the two classes a profound indignation, and should <lb/>
seriously contribute to the want of confidence with which <lb/>
the Government is regarded. " <lb/></p>

<p>It is seen, therefore, Mr. Speaker, that if the hon. <lb/>
member had desired to be impartial he would have <lb/>
quoted that portion of the report which concerns <lb/>
Upper Canada. But no, he has taken good care <lb/>
not to do that; he has limited himself to quoting <lb/>
what may be stated to the discredit of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec. He has designedly omitted the <lb/>
other side of the question, because a man possessmg <lb/>
his vast knowledge could not but be aware of all <lb/>
that is contained in Lord Durham's report, but he <lb/>
has only read the passages which might be of use <lb/>
to him in the battle which he is now carrying on <lb/>
in Ontario. But, Mr. Speaker, Lord Durham is <lb/>
not the only person who mentioned these difficulties, <lb/>
Lord Metcalfe himself in letters which he sent to <lb/>

<cb/>

England, while he was living in Canada, found <lb/>
occasion to relate the manner in which this political <lb/>
contest was carried on. This is what he said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The strife of parties is much keener in Upper Canada <lb/>
than in Lower, because in the latter the French party is <lb/>
so overwhelming, that no popular movement in favor of <lb/>
their enemies could be incited; but, in Upper Canada, <lb/>
the strength of the Conservative and the Reform parties <lb/>
being more evenly balanced the contest is more lively and <lb/>
occasionally, gives an opportunity for disorders. It is <lb/>
under conditions such as these, that the Orange lodges do <lb/>
much michief. Organised at first, I think , as poli<lb break="no"/>tical associations, rather than as religious combi<lb break="no"/>nations, they nevertheless tend to excite religious <lb/>
dissensions. If an unscrupulous Conservative desires <lb/>
to carry an election or to get the mastery in <lb/>
a public meeting, he gathers a party of Orangemen or <lb/>
he collects a party of Orangemen, or Irish Protestants, <lb/>
armed with clubs, Orangemen being always on the Con<lb break="no"/>servative side, although many Conservatives are not <lb/>
Orangemen. Lately a cross was planted here to point out <lb/>
the place where a Roman Catholic church was shortly to <lb/>
be erected; during the night the cross was cut down, and <lb/>
there was substituted for it a placard declaring that no <lb/>
Roman Catholic church should ever be built there." <lb/></p>

<p>Well, if we admit that we are not absolutely <lb/>
perfect in the Province of Quebec, people will <lb/>
acknowledge that they are not altogether angels <lb/>
who live in the Province of Ontario. Respecting <lb/>
the right of minorities, I desire to quote, to this <lb/>
House, the words uttered by the Hon. Mr. Mercier <lb/>
in a speech which he delivered in Montreal on the <lb/>
6th of November last; and in which he has traced <lb/>
with a master hand, like a great politician as he is, <lb/>
the rights of minorities: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Some people with evil intent have desired to profit by <lb/>
the settlement of the question, respecting the Jesuit <lb/>
Estates, to excite prejudices against the majority in this <lb/>
Province, by accusing them of being unjust towards the <lb/>
Protestant minority; and it is alleged very falsely that <lb/>
this minority was ill-treated, and that it had not the <lb/>
complete exercise of its rights. The rights of a minority <lb/>
may be looked upon from four pomts of view: 1. From <lb/>
the religious point of view; 2. From the civil point of <lb/>
view; 3. From the educational point of view; 4. From <lb/>
the political point of view. Surely it will not be alleged <lb/>
that the Protestant minority does not exercise, and does <lb/>
not claim with success, all its rights in our Province, <lb/>
from the religious, political, and civil points of view. <lb/>
Nobody will dare to say that Roman Catholics prevent <lb/>
Protestants from practising their religion in as free a <lb/>
manner as they practise it themselves. There are Pro<lb break="no"/>testant churches everywhere, even in centres which I <lb/>
might call exclusively Roman Catholic; and we have it <lb/>
yet to learn of the smallest insult having been offered to <lb/>
Protestant congregations, when they judge fit to assemble <lb/>
together. As to political and civil rights, they are recorded <lb/>
in our codes and our constitution; and it has never entered <lb/>
the mind of anyone to say that the Protestants had any <lb/>
reason to complain, in this respect. As to the rights <lb/>
respecting education, it is but right to state exactly what <lb/>
they are, in order to make to disappear any ambiguity <lb/>
which might exist in this respect. But, before doing this, <lb/>
let us state plainly that the law declares the two languages <lb/>
‚ÄîFrench and English‚Äîto be official: that in practice all <lb/>
our public documents are printed in these two lan<lb break="no"/>guages: that in the Legislature both are spoken; and <lb/>
very often we French Canadians answer in English the <lb/>
speeches made in English by our colleagues of another <lb/>
origin; and that we take special pains to render to them, <lb/>
in this connection, all possible assistance, in order to <lb/>
remove any pretext for complaint. The same thing is <lb/>
done in our courts of justice, where, very often, French <lb/>
Canadian advocates plead in English, out of courtesy to <lb/>
their brethren of foreign origin; and, although we are not <lb/>
bound to do so, each time when in our public departments <lb/>
we have to write to a person speaking the English language, <lb/>
we do it in his own tongue. This is an invariable rule, <lb/>
which I believe has no exception, or at least if there are <lb/>
exceptions they are so rare that it would not be reasonable <lb/>
to take any notice of them. <lb/></p> 

<p>"As to the education question, I do not think that <lb/>
there is a minority better treated, in this respect, than <lb/>
that of the Province of Quebec; and, as I do not desire to <lb/>
have my own evidence accepted, I have taken care to <lb/>
summon that of the Rev. Mr. Rexford, the Protestant <lb/>
Secretary of the Council of Public Instruction. Let <lb/>

them know, once for all, that the Protestant minority <lb/>
is well treated in this Provmce; it is treated generously, <lb/>
liberally, and there is no country in the world in which <lb/>
the majority has less of religious and national prejudice <lb/>
than in the Province of Quebec. The letter of the Rev. <lb/>
Mr. Rexford makes us acquainted with the situa<lb break="no"/>tion: let us hope that it will produce salutary effect in <lb/>
the other Provinces where they seem dispose to forget <lb/>
the rules of justice by threatening the minority with the <lb/>
loss of those rights w ich they possess here. * * * In con<lb break="no"/>clusion, let me beg of you numerous as you are, not to <lb/>
forget that we have forme the national party with your <lb/>
consent, with your support, with the consent and support <lb/>
of all Liberals in the Province of Quebec; that this party <lb/>
is the outcome of an honorable alliance and has enabled <lb/>
me to form the present Government which in its inception <lb/>
was called national, has remained national since, an will <lb/>
remain national so long as I am at its head. <lb/></p> 

<p>"That is to say, we have broken from old party lines, <lb/>
we have given up certain traditions, looked upon as dan<lb break="no"/>gerous, and certain ideas condemned by respected autho<lb break="no"/>rities, in order to publish a new programme, sufficiently <lb/>
liberal to assure the public prosperlty, but also suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently conservative not to disturb good citizens. This <lb/>
programme will be respected, this, Government will be <lb/>
maintained, and this party will live under these condi<lb break="no"/>tions. and not otherwise. I reckon upon having all honest <lb/>
people on my side to enable me to keep this promise and <lb/>
to make this decision respected." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
        
<p>These are the terms in which the Hon. Mr. <lb/>
Mercier established the principles on which the <lb/>
national party in the Province of Quebec is based. <lb/>
These are the few remarks which I desired to make. <lb/>
I have endeavored to make them with all possible <lb/>
moderation, and I trust that I have not wounded <lb/>
any feeling which deserves respect. Before con-<lb break="yes"/>eluding, let me be permitted to thank the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish members in this House for having taken up <lb/>
the defence of this beautiful French language, <lb/>
which we all love so much. One of them, the hon. <lb/>
member for West Durham (Mr. Blake), has deliv<lb break="no"/>ered, in this connection, an admirable speech. At <lb/>
the risk of loosing his own personal popularity he <lb/>
has not been afraid to lift up his voice in maintain<lb break="no"/>ing the defence of the French minority in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories, and in proclaiming at the same <lb/>
time the imprescriptible rights of the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage. We have in this courageous proceeding a <lb/>
new proof of his grand character, which enables <lb/>
him to rise above all narrow prejudices in order to <lb/>
render to every one what is due to him, without <lb/>
regard to consequences. Besides such noble con<lb break="no"/>duct is not without precedent; we always will <lb/>
remember that it was his illustrious father who, in <lb/>
the old Parliament, raised his voice and asked <lb/>
for an indemnity in favor of the victims of <lb/>
the troubles in 1837 and 1838. For this rea<lb break="no"/>son, the names of both are written in inef<lb break="no"/>faceable characters on the ever grateful hearts of <lb/>
the citizens of the Province of Quebec. The aboli<lb break="no"/>tion of the French language is asked for. Why? Is <lb/>
it because it was the first to awaken the echoes of <lb/>
the virgin forests of this country? Is it because <lb/>
French discoverers opened up to civilisation these <lb/>
vast Territories at the present time peopled by the <lb/>
English? Is it because French missionaries went <lb/>
and poured out their blood, in order to teach the <lb/>
Indians, who dwelt in these places, the first rudi<lb break="no"/>ments of Christianity and civilisation? The county <lb/>
represented by the member for North Simcoe is <lb/>
situate on the shores of the same great lake which <lb/>
formerly heard the moans of the French martyrs, <lb/>
whom the Indians put to death with most horrible <lb/>
tortures. These were cries of Frenchmen, and at <lb/>
this time there were not there any Englishmen to <lb/>
protest against the use of the French language. <lb/>
These unfortunate Jesuits, who in this way shed <lb/>

<cb/>

their generous blood, were far from suspecting <lb/>
that later on a member representing a county <lb/>
bearing the name of this great Lake would rise in <lb/>
this House to insult the French language They <lb/>
were far from dreaming that this soil which they <lb/>
had watered with their blood would yield so bitter <lb/>
a harvest; they little thought that their great <lb/>
work would be in this way so quickly sent into <lb/>
oblivion by those very people, who, this very day, <lb/>
reap the fruit of their labors, as well as of their heroic <lb/>
courage. If the member for North Simcoe wishes <lb/>
to abolish the French language let him commence <lb/>
by tearing off from the coat of arms of the En<lb break="no"/>glish monarchy these extremely French words: <lb/>
"Dieu et mon droit,"‚Äî"Honi soit qui mal y <lb/>
pense." These extremely French mottoes blaze <lb/>
above the heads of the judges on their bench. <lb/>
What does the member for North Simcoe mean by <lb/>
not having asked for the disappearance of the <lb/>
remainder of this barbarous old custom? How <lb/>
does it happen that he has not yet protested <lb/>
against the use of the French language in sanc<lb break="no"/>tioning the Bills in this country, as well as in <lb/>
England? You can never abolish the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage; for if, unfortunately, there are to be found <lb/>
men who desire its abolition, there are also men <lb/>
with honest hearts who know how to respect <lb/>
stipulations made in the past, and to place them<lb break="no"/>selves above prejudices of race and religion, to <lb/>
whom is visible nothing but holy and immutable <lb/>
justice. Evil be to those who come forward in <lb/>
this way to light up the fire of discord and to <lb/>
appeal to the most dangerous prejudices. History <lb/>
will hold them severely accountable for their want <lb/>
of wisdom and patriotism. One of our poets, <lb/>
Fr√©chette, who has won so much honor for the <lb/>
French language in Canada, has, in some admirable <lb/>
verses, given advice which I recommend to the <lb/>
serious consideration of the member for North <lb/>
Simcoe: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"He whose glance governs the universe, in His wisdom <lb/>

<!--<p>HOUSE OF COMMONS. <lb/></p> 

<p>FRIDAY, 21st February, 1890. <lb/></p> 

<p>The SPEAKER took the Chair at Three o'clock. <lb/></p> 

<p>PRAYERS. <lb/></p> 

<p>FIRST READING. <lb/></p> 

<p>Bill (No. 95) respecting Agricultural Fertilisers <lb/>
(from the Senate)‚Äî(Sir John A. Macdonald.) <lb/></p> 

<p>THE FRENCH LANGUAGE IN THE NORTH-<lb break="maybe"/>WEST. <lb/></p> 

<p>House resumed adjourned debate on the pro<lb break="no"/>posed motion of Mr. McCarthy for second reading <lb/>
of Bill (No. 10) to further amend the Revised <lb/>
Statutes of Canada, chapter 50, respecting the <lb/>
North-West Territories; the motion of Mr. Davin <lb/>
in amendment thereto, and the motion of Sir <lb/>
John Thompson in amendment to the amendment. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. AMYOT. Owing to the fact that this <lb/>
House consented, on my motion last night, to ad<lb break="no"/>journ the debate, and owing also to the fact that a <lb/>
great many members desire to leave to-night, I <lb/>
will shorten my remarks as much as possible. <lb/>
Before entering into the merits of the amendment, <lb/>
which we have to discuss and upon which we are <lb/>
called upon to vote, I will say a few words in <lb/>
answer to the speech of the hon. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). That hon. gentleman per<lb break="no"/>sists in saying that the treaties never insured to the <lb/>
French Canadians, or to those speaking the French <lb/>
language in this country, the use of that language. <lb/>
He has repeatedly said that the language is the <lb/>
essence of a people's existence, so it must be the <lb/>
first privilege of a people. I will call the attention <lb/>
of the hon. gentleman to the Articles of Capitula<lb break="no"/>tion of Quebec, dated 18th September, 1759, where <lb/>
we find the following as having been demanded <lb/>
and granted:-‚Äî <lb/></p> 

<p>"That the inhabitants shall be preserved in the posses<lb break="no"/>sion of their houses, goods, effects and privileges‚Äî" <lb/></p> 

<p>The word "privileges" is there. What privilege <lb/>
is greater than the language of the people? <lb/></p> 

<p>‚Äî" granted upon their laying down their arms." <lb/></p> 

<p>They laid down their arms, to take them up again <lb/>
for the defence of the British flag. They knew <lb/>
only one language then, but, with their old gun <lb/>
and their old French language, they succeeded in <lb/>
the better preservation and due distribution of the <lb/>
keeping this country in the possession of the <lb/>
British Crown. Now, if the hon. gentleman looks <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. LAURIER. <lb/>

<cb/>

at the capitulation of Montreal, signed in French <lb/>
and English, he will find that it is stipulated that <lb/></p> 

<p>The French Canadians shall continue, as subjects <lb/>
oi the King, to be governed according to the custom of <lb/>
Paris, and the laws and usages established for this <lb/>
country." <lb/></p> 

<p>If that does not include in the first place the lan<lb break="no"/>guage, I do not know what it includes. Then I <lb/>
will refer the hon. gentleman to the Treaty of <lb/>
Paris, which was written only in French. It was <lb/>
signed on the 10th February, 1763. I have had the <lb/>
first article translated, because we do not find it in <lb/>
English. This is what it says: <lb/></p> 

<p>"There will be an universal, and perpetual, Christian-<lb break="yes"/>like peace, as well over land as over sea, and a smcere <lb/>
and immovable friendship will be established between <lb/>
their Britannic Majesties * * * and between theirheirs <lb/>
and Successors, Kingdoms, States, provinces, countries, <lb/>
subjects and vassals of whatsoever kind and condition they <lb/>
may be, making no exception for rank or fortune; so that <lb/>
the High Contracting parties will bestow the very greatest <lb/>
attention upon the maintenance between themselves and <lb/>
said States and subjects of this friendship and intercourse, <lb/>
without permitting from henceforth, on one side or the <lb/>
other, the commission of any acts of hostility, either by <lb/>
land or sea, on any pretext whatever; and they will care<lb break="no"/>fully avoid all that which might tend to impair for the <lb/>
future the union so happily established: endeavoring, on <lb/>
the contrary, to secure for each other in turn on all occa<lb break="no"/>sions, all which may contribute to their mutual glory, in<lb break="no"/>terests and advantages. * * * There will be a general <lb/>
forgetfulness of all that may have been done or com<lb break="no"/>mitted before or since the beginning of the war now put <lb/>
an end to." <lb/></p> 

<p>You must not lose sight of the events of that time. <lb/>
There had been a fight; both armies had behaved <lb/>
most gloriously; we had about 12,000 men against <lb/>
60,000 on the other side, and sometimes the fortune <lb/>
was for us and sometimes against us. The last <lb/>
battle, which was fought on the field of St. Foye, <lb/>
was in favor of our arms. But then the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor de Vaudreuil, one of the most miserable crea<lb break="no"/>tures that ever came to this country, gave us up. <lb/>
After that our troops went to Montreal; our brave <lb/>
generals were discouraged at seeing such cowardice <lb/>
and such treason on the part of the Governor. But <lb/>
the Governor went up to Montreal and there <lb/>
again capitulated. Then our troops went back <lb/>
to France, and afterwards there was signed in <lb/>
France, a treaty between England, France and <lb/>
Portugal, which was a treaty of peace. The <lb/>
different countries that had been the subject of <lb/>
dispute were divided between these kingdoms, <lb/>
and it was a cession of peace and nothing else. <lb/>
That is the reason why, the other day, when the <lb/>
hon. gentleman spoke of the conquest, I said it <lb/>
was a cession, and not a conquest. I will now <lb/>
draw the special attention of the hon. member to <lb/>
chapter 18 of 14 George III, 1774, which is "An <lb/>
Act to make more efi'ectual provisions for the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the Province of Quebec in North <lb/>
America." The preamble says: <lb/></p> 

<p>"Whereas His Majesty, by His Royal proclamation <lb/>
hearing date 7th October in the third year of his reign, <lb/>
thought fit to declare the provisions which had been made <lb/>
in respect to certain countries, territories and isles in <lb/>
America, ceded to His Majesty by the Definitive Treaty <lb/>
of Peace concluded on the 10th of February, 1773." <lb/></p> 

<p>I will not take up the time of the House in read<lb break="no"/>ing the Act; but I will quote, for the satisfaction <lb/>
of the hon. member for North Simcoe, sections 4 <lb/>
and 8 of that statute. In those times the use of <lb/>
the French language was looked upon as so im<lb break="no"/>portant that in 1790 an ordinance was passed " for <lb/>
the better preservation and due distribution of the <lb/></p>-->
