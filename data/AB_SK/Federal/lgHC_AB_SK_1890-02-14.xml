     635                               [COMMONS]                                         636 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     the applause and the practice they had been accustomed 
     <lb/>
     to receive, transferred to others who had been so for<lb break="no"/>tunate as to be born on the north side of the Mordyke. The 
     <lb/>
     loss of these persons was not merely that of an honorable 
     <lb/>
     livelihood  it is necessary to penetrate our own minds 
     <lb/>
     with a sense of those high feelings of pride and ambition 
     <lb/>
     which animate men who have reached the head of their 
     <lb/>
     profession, in order to appreciate the extent of that 
     <lb/>
     injustice which this foolish and tyrannical ordinance 
     <lb/>
     inflicted." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, the hon. gentleman proposes a half century 
     <lb/>
     later to try the same experiment in a British colony. 
     <lb/>
     I do not believe, if his experiment could be carried 
     <lb/>
     out, that it would be a whit more successful than 
     <lb/>
     the experiment of the Dutch King in the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom of the Netherlands. I may say that the 
     <lb/>
     revocation of 1848 made a great change in the 
     <lb/>
     treatment of nationalities. They then came to the 
     <lb/>
     front. States were based on dynastic and class 
     <lb/>
     interests and paid no regard to race in fixing terri<lb break="no"/>torial boundaries. But since 1848, no attempt 
     <lb/>
     has been made to mould different races into 
     <lb/>
     one except in Austria, and she fell into line 
     <lb/>
     after disasters of Sadowa. About thirteen years 
     <lb/>
     ago this clause of the Bill which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman proposes to repeal, was introduced for 
     <lb/>
     the first time. The opinion I then expressed, I 
     <lb/>
     think, is an opinion that ought to have some force 
     <lb/>
     to-day. Of course, it is only a question of time 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the matter, because it is one about 
     <lb/>
     which the people of the North-West Territories must 
     <lb/>
     legislate when they become a Province. The pre<lb break="no"/>sent assembly of the North-West is not a constitu<lb break="no"/>ent assembly, it is simply a legislative assembly. 
     <lb/>
     It has no power to alter the constitution under 
     <lb/>
     which it carries on the limited amount of legisla<lb break="no"/>tion that it may at present accomplish. But I 
     <lb/>
     could not help observing that the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Muskoka (Mr. O'Brien), instead of referring to the 
     <lb/>
     members from that territory in this House to ascer<lb break="no"/>tain the opinion of the country upon this subject, 
     <lb/>
     refers to the opinion of a Legislative Assembly in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West Territories who have no power to 
     <lb/>
     deal with the question at all. Now I think that 
     <lb/>
     in many of these things the people must be 
     <lb/>
     assumed to be qualified to exercise the powers of 
     <lb/>
     self-government. They may go astray. I do not 
     <lb/>
     always approve what has been done in this House. 
     <lb/>
     I do not often agree with the policy of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the Treasury benches, but I do not on 
     <lb/>
     that account deny the right of the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country to self-government. My own opinion is 
     <lb/>
     that if we regar this question as a matter of con<lb break="no"/>venience, there ought to be no great difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     dealing with it. We are seeking to settle that coun<lb break="no"/>try, we are seeking to secure immigration into that 
     <lb/>
     country. Hon. gentlemen on the Treasury benches 
     <lb/>
     occasionally issue pamphlets printed in Scandina<lb break="no"/>vian, in German, in French, for circulation upon 
     <lb/>
     the continent of Europe to invite people to settle 
     <lb/>
     there. The hon. member for Muskoka and the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Simcoe vote an appropriation for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of bearing the expense of printing, 
     <lb/>
     translating and publishing these pamphlets. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to know whether those hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     say that you have a right to publish a pamphlet 
     <lb/>
     in Scandinavian and send it to the other side 
     <lb/>
     of the Atlantic for those people to read to 
     <lb/>
     induce them to come here, but that you have no 
     <lb/>
     right whatever to give them anything Scandinavian 
     <lb/>
     to read after they arrive in this country. Now, let 
     <lb/>
     me suppose that to-day there are 20,000 Norweg<lb break="no"/>ians coming out and forming a settlement in the 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. MILLS (Bothwell).

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     North-West Territories. You have provided muni<lb break="no"/>cipal institutions there. They elect a council. If 
     <lb/>
     they do, they must select some of their own people, 
     <lb/>
     or they must go outside and invite somebody to 
     <lb/>
     come in and represent them. How are they going 
     <lb/>
     to carry on their business when they do not know 
     <lb/>
     a word of English  Are they going to meet and 
     <lb/>
     keep quiet, or are they going to speak privately to 
     <lb/>
     some one who understands English and have their 
     <lb/>
     words translated into English, and published when 
     <lb/>
     none of them understand a word of it  It is per<lb break="no"/>fectly obvious that if you have a diffused popula<lb break="no"/>tion, if you have English and others mingled to<lb break="no"/>gether, that the one readily absorbs the other. You 
     <lb/>
     may provide that there shall not be a continuous 
     <lb/>
     settlement of people of any nationality other than 
     <lb/>
     those who speak English, if you think that is the 
     <lb/>
     proper course to adopt. If there is a French popula<lb break="no"/>tion in the North-West diffused through the English 
     <lb/>
     speaking population, and they are in the minority, 
     <lb/>
     it is impossible but that they will learn to under<lb break="no"/>stand each other. If you have several thousand 
     <lb/>
     peoplefrom the Province of Quebec speaking French 
     <lb/>
     and knowing nothing else, forming distinct colonies 
     <lb/>
     or settlements, it would be a matter of conven<lb break="no"/>ience to translate your public documents, and 
     <lb/>
     for your public proceedings in that locality to 
     <lb/>
     be conducted in French, and I do not believe that 
     <lb/>
     you delay the general use of the English language 
     <lb/>
     by one hour by adopting that policy. I do not see 
     <lb/>
     how you can, for it is the private and unofficial use 
     <lb/>
     that determines the general use of the language. 
     <lb/>
     Now, the hon. gentleman knows that he has not 
     <lb/>
     taken even the first step towards the unity of the 
     <lb/>
     population of the North-West from a linguistic 
     <lb/>
     point of view, by simply providing for the official 
     <lb/>
     use of the English. The hon. gentleman, if he 
     <lb/>
     does anything, must go further, and he must pro<lb break="no"/>hibit the introduction of French books, and the 
     <lb/>
     circulation of French newspapers, the use in the 
     <lb/>
     schools public and private, he must prohibit the 
     <lb/>
     use in the pulpit, he must prohibit the use every<lb break="no"/>where, of the French language, or his interference 
     <lb/>
     is an ineffective and an impertinent interference. 
     <lb/>
     If the hon. gentleman is not prepared for that, then 
     <lb/>
     he had better leave the laws of society— those 
     <lb/>
     forces of which I have spoken—which, after all 
     <lb/>
     govern these things, to operate freely in the way in 
     <lb/>
     which they operate most effectively. In my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     the question of the use of a language, or of more than 
     <lb/>
     one language, in a territory, depends entirely upon 
     <lb/>
     whether you have a mixed population or whether 
     <lb/>
     you have settlements separate and distinct from 
     <lb/>
     each other, and it seems to me that you have in the 
     <lb/>
     North-West Territories, no expression of opinion 
     <lb/>
     upon that question which would warrant legislation 
     <lb/>
     such as the hon. member for North Simcoe pro<lb break="no"/>poses. I think the question should be determined 
     <lb/>
     on the lines and according to the principles which 
     <lb/>
     I have mentioned. Now, Sir, I may say this  The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has delivered several speeches on 
     <lb/>
     this subject outside the House, and one in it. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that his labors have produced conflict of 
     <lb/>
     race, and I may go further and say, conflict of 
     <lb/>
     religion as well.  It is possible that a section of 
     <lb/>
     the population sympathises with the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     in the object with which he has set out  it is 
     <lb/>
     possible to break up the union, to repel immigra<lb break="no"/>tion, to delay settement. It is possible to make 
     <lb/>
     here geographical parties and so prevent the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country from acting in political unison  
     <lb/>

     regulate the domestic use, the use in business, the 
     <lb/>
     use on the public platform, the use in the pulpit, 
     <lb/>
     the use in the press of the language, it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that he has not taken the first step to carry out 
     <lb/>
     that policy which he marked out in his speech and 
     <lb/>
     in the preamble to the Bill he submitted to this

     can ask for an explanation, but he must not go

     to call the attention of the Minister to that fact.

     The notice of motion asked for the number of

     the answer in the return is not complete. As 
     <lb/>
     there seems to be a desire in the House to not 
     <lb/>
     allow me to fully go into this matter, I will take 
     <lb/>
     another course, and I will see the reason why the 
     <lb/>
     return has not been given as asked for.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP2">Mr. TUPPER</persName>. I do not think there is any oc<lb break="no"/>casion for the hon. gentleman to take any other 
     <lb/>
     course at all. There is no disinclination on the 
     <lb/>
     part of myself to withhold the information he now 
     <lb/>
     asks, for I have not looked lately at the motion 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the information that was desired, 
     <lb/>
     but my recollection of the matter, both in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the discussion and conversation with the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman, was that his motion was confined 
     <lb/>
     entirely to the information I brought down. That 
     <lb/>
     is to say, the names of the persons fined, and those 
     <lb/>
     who had paid, and those who had not paid the 
     <lb/>
     fines. It is a very easy thing to give the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman the information he now seeks, and 
     <lb/>
     a supplementary return, if necessary, will be 
     <lb/>
     brought down.

     House resumed adjourned debate on the pro<lb break="no"/>posed motion of Mr. McCarthy for second read<lb break="no"/>ing of the Bill (No. 10) to further amend 
     <lb/>
     the Revised Statutes of Canada, chapter fifty, 
     <lb/>
     respecting the North-West Territories; the mo<lb break="no"/>tion of Mr. Davin in amendment thereto, and 
     <lb/>
     the motion of Mr. Beausoleil in amendment to the 
     <lb/>
     amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. Mr. Speaker: I realise, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     that the question under discussion is one likely to 
     <lb/>
     provoke angry feelings and race prejudices, and I 
     <lb/>
     shall endeavor to make the remarks that I have to 
     <lb/>
     make to—day in a conciliatory spirit. I shall of 
     <lb/>
     course feel bound to state my convictions, but I 
     <lb/>
     shall endeavor to do so courteously, and without, 
     <lb/>
     at all events, giving needless offence. I shall not 
     <lb/>
     agree with many of my fellow members of the 
     <lb/>
     House—with the majority of them probably—but, 
     <lb/>
     I shall ask of them that toleration that I accord 
     <lb/>
     to them in the discussion of this matter. It is, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, a disquietening question, and necessarily so. 
     <lb/>
     It is to be regretted that it is disquieting, but it 
     <lb/>
     cannot be helped. We might purchase quiet by 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     the avoidance of the question entirely. We might 
     <lb/>
     purchase quiet by allowing matters to go on in the 
     <lb/>
     course they have been going without any protest 
     <lb/>
     or without any attempt on the part of those who 
     <lb/>
     believe that danger is ahead to avert that danger. 
     <lb/>
     I do not consider, Sir, that that course is necessary 
     <lb/>
     or advisable. We are certainly capable of dis<lb break="no"/>cussing this question in this high court of the 
     <lb/>
     nation, in a spirit of fairness stating our con<lb break="no"/>victions; and after having heard the arguments 
     <lb/>
     that are to be presented on both sides, the House 
     <lb/>
     will decide the question as the majority of its 
     <lb/>
     members deem proper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The speakers who have addressed the House on 
     <lb/>
     this subject in the earlier part of this debate have, 
     <lb/>
     as a rule, taken the ground that a community of 
     <lb/>
     language in a country is not essential; many of 
     <lb/>
     them, indeed, I infer from their remarks, entertain 
     <lb/>
     the opinion that it is not even desirable. We have 
     <lb/>
     had the example of states in ancient times, cited 
     <lb/>
     here in a sense which would lead one to suppose 
     <lb/>
     that the speakers thought the example of those 
     <lb/>
     states worthy to be copied by us. We have had 
     <lb/>
     allusion made by the hon. member for Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Davin) to the fact that of the federal unions 
     <lb/>
     now existing in the world two of them do not 
     <lb/>
     possess community of language; and I think, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     if we regard the history, the present position and 
     <lb/>
     the progress of those three federal unions, we shall 
     <lb/>
     find a very striking argument in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     doctrine I have advanced, that a community of 
     <lb/>
     language is desirable; for certainly neither the 
     <lb/>
     federal union of the cantons of Switzerland, 
     <lb/>
     nor that of the Provinces of Canada, bears 
     <lb/>
     any comparison with the federal union of 
     <lb/>
     the United States in point of development, 
     <lb/>
     population and power. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia treated us the other night to an ex<lb break="no"/>ceedingly witty speech; I do not know that I can 
     <lb/>
     say that the spirit of the speech was quite in 
     <lb/>
     keeping with the magnitude and importance of 
     <lb/>
     the question he had under discussion. In the 
     <lb/>
     course of his speech he said that if you wished to 
     <lb/>
     make the French language permanent, you had 
     <lb/>
     but to attempt to restrict it. I do not know that 
     <lb/>
     the experience of the world would bear that 
     <lb/>
     assertion out. I do not know that the French 
     <lb/>
     language has been made permanent in the 
     <lb/>
     United States. Louisiana soon after was admitted 
     <lb/>
     into the American Union, the French language 
     <lb/>
     was not sanctioned as an official language; 
     <lb/>
     and the result of that prohibition or restric<lb break="no"/>tion, if the hon. member prefers the latter 
     <lb/>
     term, has not been to make the language per<lb break="no"/>manent, but, on the contrary, to thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     diffuse and assimilate with the American element 
     <lb/>
     the French population near the mouth of the 
     <lb/>
     Mississippi; and I do not believe that any fair 
     <lb/>
     or proper attempt to secure the dominance of 
     <lb/>
     the English tongue in this country will have the 
     <lb/>
     result of making the French language predominant 
     <lb/>
     or increasing its use in the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My hon. friend from North York (Mr. Mulock) 
     <lb/>
     gave us a very nice essay on ancient history. He 
     <lb/>
     went back to the days of Queen Esther, and told 
     <lb/>
     us how King Ahasuerus sent his letters in 127 
     <lb/>
     different languages to 127 different provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Well, Sir, if the hon. gentleman had gone a little 
     <lb/>
     further back, which he might very properly have 
     <lb/>
     done, to the time of the Tower of Babel, he would 
     <lb/>
     have found a time when one language was in use; 
     <lb/>

     in the 11th chapter of the Book of Genesis, he

            <p>Evidently the Almighty recognised the power of a 
     <lb/>community of language, and frustrated the 
     <lb/>attempts that were being made by the people of 
     <lb/>that day: he scattered them over the face of the 
     <lb/>earth, and brought in more than a dual language 
     <lb/>among the peoples of the world. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North York tells us that Greece had a com<lb break="no"/>munity of language, and yet that out of that 
     <lb/>community rival states with their animosities and 
     <lb/>bickerings arose, and there was no such thing as 
     <lb/>a national feeling in Greece. The great trouble 
     <lb/>with Greece was that it wanted commercial union, 
     <lb/>and the day of commercial union had not yet 
     <lb/>come. If the Greeks had adopted that policy, the 
     <lb/>bickerings and animosities which existed among 
     <lb/>those states speaking the same language would 
     <lb/>gradually have disappeared In Rome, the hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman tells us, there were the Greek, the Latin, 
     <lb/>and numerous other tongues; they had no commun<lb break="no"/>ity of language in that great empire. Necessarily 
     <lb/>they had not. The Roman Empire was composed 
     <lb/>of conquered states; it had spread from the city on 
     <lb/>the Tiber, until it had covered nearly the whole of 
     <lb/>the known world; but does the hon. gentleman pro<lb break="no"/>pose to tell us that the debates of the Roman senate, 
     <lb/>the Roman code, or the Roman statutes, were re<lb break="no"/>produced in all the languages spoken in that great 
     <lb/>empire? I think not. I think there was nothing 
     <lb/>in the Roman Empire corresponding to the condi<lb break="no"/>tion of things we have in Canada to-day. Latin 
     <lb/>was used in the proceedings of the Senate and was 
     <lb/>I venture to assert, the official language of the 
     <lb/>Roman Empire. Then the hon. gentleman came 
     <lb/>down to the days of modern history, and he gave 
     <lb/>us a long list of the nations having more than one 
     <lb/>language. He tells us that Spain, Italy, Sweden, 
               <lb/>the Netherlands, Russia, Austria, Turkey— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:MULO1">Mr. MULOCK</persName>. No; I said nothing of Turkey. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. Well, we will drop Turkey. 
     <lb/>
     Does the hon. gentleman propose to hold those 
     <lb/>
     nations up for us to copy? Shall we copy the in<lb break="no"/>stitutions of Spain, Russia or Austria? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:MULO1">Mr. MULOCK</persName>. And Great Britain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. We will come to Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain in a moment. Does the hon gentleman tell 
     <lb/>
     us that all the languages used in those countries 
     <lb/>
     were the official languages of their diets and 
     <lb/>
     assemblies, and that the laws were published in all 
     <lb/>
     those languages? I think not; and if they were, 
     <lb/>
     we do not want a model from them. Then, I come 
     <lb/>
     to England, as the hon. gentleman proposes. He 
     <lb/>
     tells us that in Great Britain we have not only 
     <lb/>
     English, but the Gaelic, the Welsh, the Irish, and 
     <lb/>
     the French in the Channel Islands. Well, are the 
     <lb/>
     debates in the Chamber at Westminster conducted 
     <lb/>
     in Gaelic, Irish, Welsh and French? Are the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions put from the Chair of the House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     in all those languages? Are those official languages? 
     <lb/>
     By no means. English is the official language. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman tells us that the decrees of the 
     <lb/>
     English Parliament are read, I think he said from 
     <lb/>
     a high hill on the Isle of Man in the Manx language. 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     Well, if he wishes us to adopt that plan, there could 
     <lb/>
     be no objection I imagine, and we should then have 
     <lb/>
     all the decrees of this House read from the 
     <lb/>
     highest peak in the North-West, in French, in 
     <lb/>
     Icelandic, in Cree, in all the hundred and twenty-<lb break="yes"/>seven languages, more or less, that are spoken in that 
     <lb/>
     territory; we need not quarrel with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen in regard to that. The hon. gentlemen
     <lb/>
     tells us that there is no need of resorting to repres<lb break="no"/>sion. Well, Sir, we do not propose to resort to 
     <lb/>
     repression; he is begging the question; we do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to interfere with any rights that exist in 
     <lb/>
     Canada by virtue of the provisions of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act—not one of them; but we do 
     <lb/>
     not want to extend certain features of our 
     <lb/>
     institutions to virgin soil; we do not want to ex<lb break="no"/>tend the confusion that necessarily exists from the 
     <lb/>
     use of two languages. While we do not want to 
     <lb/>
     interfere with a single vested right, which exists in 
     <lb/>
     this Confederation, by virtue of the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1867, we deny that these are vested rights 
     <lb/>
     in the North-West Territories, a territory which 
     <lb/>
     has been acquired since Confederation, and we are 
     <lb/>
     not bound to have implanted in that soil the 
     <lb/>
     condition of things which we do not propose to 
     <lb/>
     interfere with, but the existence of which we 
     <lb/>
     lament in the older portions of the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We next heard from our friend whose riding is 
     <lb/>
     Rouville (Mr. Gigault), a gentleman to whom I 
     <lb/>
     always listen with the greatest pleasure, a gentle<lb break="no"/>man who is a logical speaker, and who represents 
     <lb/>
     his views temperately and forcibly. He accused 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) 
     <lb/>
     with being governed by American rather than 
     <lb/>
     by British precedent and example. No doubt 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman from Simcoe thought that 
     <lb/>
     American example might be as good to follow as 
     <lb/>
     the examples of some of the Continental States of 
     <lb/>
     Europe; and I do not know but that we might in 
     <lb/>
     many cases, with profit to ourselves, have paid 
     <lb/>
     more attention than we have to American example. 
     <lb/>
     For instance, if we had taken pains to examine 
     <lb/>
     American precedents with regard to the Franchise 
     <lb/>
     law; if we had seized ourselves of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the American Constitutional Convention of 1787, 
     <lb/>
     after full consideration of the question, had decid<lb break="no"/>ed to have no national franchise but State fran<lb break="no"/>chises, and that this decision was carried into effect 
     <lb/>
     and had been in operation for a hundred years 
     <lb/>
     with the greatest success and to the greatest 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction of the people, we might have 
     <lb/>
     avoided the legislative bungle which is now 
     <lb/>
               upon our Statute-book — the Dominion Fran<lb break="no"/>chise Act—and have satisfied the public more 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly than we have succeeded in doing. We 
     <lb/>
     might, if we had copied American example more 
     <lb/>
     closely, have taken the position earlier in the day 
     <lb/>
     on Provincial rights which has since been taken; 
     <lb/>
     and I do not know that the fact of being influenced 
     <lb/>
     to any extent by American example should be cast 
     <lb/>
     as a slur upon any public man in this House in dis<lb break="no"/>cussing any public question. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     then will perhaps pardon me if, in dealing with 
     <lb/>
     this question of community of language, refer 
     <lb/>
     him to American example bearing directly upon 
     <lb/>
     this question—the example to which I referred in<lb break="no"/>cidentally a few moments ago of the treatment of 
     <lb/>
     the language question in the vast territory of 
     <lb/>
     Louisiana, which was acquired by the American 
     <lb/>
     Government in 1803. Here was an old French 
     <lb/>
     colony with a large French population, containing 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="655" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00655.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">655</fw>
            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">656</fw>
           
     no Anglo-Saxon element of any consequence. It 
     <lb/>
     was necessary for the Government of the United 
     <lb/>
     States to give to the French citizens of Louisiana 
     <lb/>
     institutions and laws, and they made it a funda<lb break="no"/>mental principle to be carried into effect at the earli<lb break="no"/>est practicable moment, that the English language 
     <lb/>
     should be used through the territory as an official 
     <lb/>
     language, that the Legislature of Louisiana in its 
     <lb/>
     records of proceedings should use that tongue, and 
     <lb/>
     that the laws of Louisiana should be published in 
     <lb/>
     that tongue. Upon that basis the State of Louisiana 
     <lb/>
     was organised as speedily as possible, and upon 
     <lb/>
     that basis the French citizens of Louisiana became 
     <lb/>
     American citizens; and in course of time they have 
     <lb/>
     become so throughly assimilated that they are to<lb break="no"/>day American citizens in every sense of the word. 
     <lb/>
     Many eminent men come from this French element 
     <lb/>
     in Louisiana, such as General Beauregard, Pierre 
     <lb/>
     Soule, and scores of others, who figure in Ame<lb break="no"/>rican history and have acquired prominence in 
     <lb/>
     American politics and literature. Any one going 
     <lb/>
     through New Orleans, as I did a short time ago, 
     <lb/>
     will see that there is one quarter of the city 
     <lb/>
     called the French quarter and another the En<lb break="no"/>glish quarter. The old quarter which was occu<lb break="no"/>pied by the French is still called the French 
     <lb/>
     quarter, but you hear the English language 
     <lb/>
     everywhere, and you cannot discover any marked 
     <lb/>
     indication that you are among a people of foreign 
     <lb/>
     descent, so thoroughly Americanised have they 
     <lb/>
     become. That has been done in Louisiana, and 
     <lb/>
     the condition of things which exists there to-day 
     <lb/>
     is more desirable, certainly, to the American people 
     <lb/>
     than if they had a Quebec planted at the mouth 
     <lb/>
     of the Mississippi, just as we have one planted at 
     <lb/>
     the mouth of the St. Lawrence. Suppose the French 
     <lb/>
     language were extended over that vast territory 
     <lb/>
     comprising Louisiana and that great land west of 
     <lb/>
     the Mississippi, now comprising ten states and two 
     <lb/>
     territories, would that be a desirable state of things? 
     <lb/>
     Was not the wisdom of the American people 
     <lb/>
     shown in deciding that the French language should 
     <lb/>
     not be an official language either in the State of 
     <lb/>
     Louisiana as it exists at present or in any part of 
     <lb/>
     that vast territory west of the Mississippi extend<lb break="no"/>ing from the Gulf of Mexico to the British line? 
     <lb/>
     Was not wisdom shown in excluding the French 
     <lb/>
     as an official language from that vast territory? 
     <lb/>
     Beyond question it was; and American example 
     <lb/>
     in that respect is an example we would do wisely 
     <lb/>
     to follow in dealing with the same question here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are other instances besides the one I have 
     <lb/>
     alluded to in the history of America. There is the 
     <lb/>
     example of the treatment of the Spaniards in Flo<lb break="no"/>rida when that country was acquired by the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans. The use of the vernacular language of the 
     <lb/>
     people was denied to them as an official language; 
     <lb/>
     the laws were not published in that language; the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings of the courts were not held in that 
     <lb/>
     language, but it was imperative that English should 
     <lb/>
     be used; and the consequence was that the Spanish 
     <lb/>
     population of Florida became speedily thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     assimilated with the Saxon population of the rest 
     <lb/>
     of the United States. We have another example. 
     <lb/>
     The United States, as a result of the war with 
     <lb/>
     Mexico, became possessed of the territory of Cali<lb break="no"/>fornia, which had a considerable Spanish popula<lb break="no"/>tion. Again the United States denied to that popu<lb break="no"/>lation the use of the Spanish tongue, as an official 
     <lb/>
     one, and made English the official language of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature and the Courts. As a consequence 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     these people have been swallowed up by that 
     <lb/>
     great assimilating maelstrom, and now, in a second 
     <lb/>
     generation, you can scarcely detect a trace of the 
     <lb/>
     Spanish nationality in the population of California. 
     <lb/>
     The Spanish element have become thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     assimilated with the American element, and 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly Americanised, and that has been 
     <lb/>
     accomplished by virtue of this rule, which the 
     <lb/>
     American Government invariably enforces when 
     <lb/>
     incorporating foreign elements into its body politic. 
     <lb/>
     We have another case—that of Texas. Texas was 
     <lb/>
     conquered and wrested from Mexico by a move<lb break="no"/>ment of adventurers from the South and South-<lb break="yes"/>West, and an independent nationality was erected 
     <lb/>
     there after a fierce struggle, characterised by such 
     <lb/>
     events as that of San Antonio, where the Alamo, de<lb break="no"/>fended by one hundred and ninety-two men, was 
     <lb/>
     captured by 7,000 Mexican troops after 1,600 of 
     <lb/>
     the assaulting force were killed, and not a soul left 
     <lb/>
     in the garrison. The bravery of the garrison is 
     <lb/>
     commemorated by the inscription on the monument 
     <lb/>
     in the square of San Antonio: "Thermopylae 
     <lb/>
     sent its messengers of defeat; the Alamo sent 
     <lb/>
     none." The courageous spirit of these defenders re<lb break="no"/>sulted in wresting Texas from the control of Mexico, 
     <lb/>
     and they made English the official language; and 
     <lb/>
     Texas is to-day one of the most prosperous and 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly American of all the American States, 
     <lb/>
     and you can scarcly find a trace of the existence of 
     <lb/>
     a foreign element in the population of that country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then my hon. friend instances the case of Cape 
     <lb/>
     Colony, and points to the fact that the Dutch 
     <lb/>
     language is an official language in that colony. 
     <lb/>
     Well, the circumstances of Cape Colony are quite 
     <lb/>
     similar to our own. The Dutch were the original 
     <lb/>
     settlers of the country. It was conquered by 
     <lb/>
     England, and it was wise probably to give to the 
     <lb/>
     Holland element of Cape Colony the use of their 
     <lb/>
     language. But Cape Colony is extending its 
     <lb/>
     bounds; English influence has crossed the Kahalari 
     <lb/>
     Desert to the north, and, following Livingston's 
     <lb/>
     pathway in his early explorations, has reached the 
     <lb/>
     Zambesi. England has taken possession of Lake 
     <lb/>
     Nyassa, a lake larger than Lake Erie, has shut out 
     <lb/>
     Portugal from that region, is pushing her posses<lb break="no"/>sions on further north to Lake Bangweola, and has 
     <lb/>
     already acquired avast empire in South Africa, with 
     <lb/>
     immense possibilities and resources, an empire that 
     <lb/>
     may be the home of scores of millions of people in 
     <lb/>
     the future—a salubrious, fertile region containing 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of thousands of square miles. Does 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend suppose the Dutch tongue will 
     <lb/>
     be extended to that region and become the 
     <lb/>
     official language in the new Provinces to be erected 
     <lb/>
     in that vast country, the basin of the Zambesi? I 
     <lb/>
     am sure such will not be the case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then the hon. gentleman alleged that my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from North Simcoe said in his speech that 
     <lb/>
     the French shall not read French literature. I do 
     <lb/>
     not understand the hon. gentleman to have said 
     <lb/>
     any such thing. I do not understand that he 
     <lb/>
     proposes to debar Frenchmen from the use of their 
     <lb/>
     literature or their tongue wherever they live. 
     <lb/>
     The Bill under the consideration of the House 
     <lb/>
     merely provides for the discontinuance of the 
     <lb/>
     French language as an official language in the 
     <lb/>
     North-West Territories. It says nothing about 
     <lb/>
     the right of the French people to read their 
     <lb/>
     language, or use it as they do to-day. It says 
     <lb/>
     nothing about the right of a Frenchman to use his 
     <lb/>
     language in this House, or throughout this Dom<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="657" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00657.jpg"/>

     inion. Wherever his rights exist under the Con<lb break="no"/>stitutional Act, he can preserve and cherish his 
     <lb/>
     language; he may refuse to allow his children to 
     <lb/>
     learn any other language if he chooses to do so. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman objects, also, to the preamble 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill. I think last year, my hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice, in the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     Jesuits' Estates Bill, said that the preamble had 
     <lb/>
     very little to do with the Bill, that the character 
     <lb/>
     of the measure was best shown by the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of the Bill itself. However, I see nothing objection<lb break="no"/>able in this preamble, which reads as follows:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>   
     "Whereas it is expedient in the interest of the 
     <lb/>
     national comity of the Dominion that there should be 
     <lb/>
     a community of language amongst the people of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and that the enactment in the North-West Territories 
     <lb/>
     Act allowing the use of the French should be expunged 
     <lb/>
     therefrom: Therefore Her Majesty, &amp;c." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   </quote>
            <p>
     That simply asserts that, in the interests of this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, it would be well if we could have a com<lb break="no"/>munity of language. I believe that statement, and I 
     <lb/>
     will support the Bill upon that assertion. The Bill 
     <lb/>
     itself asserts that the French language should not 
     <lb/>
     be used in the North-West as an official language. 
     <lb/>
     I believe that, and I shall vote that it shall not be 
     <lb/>
     used there. Those who think otherwise can vote 
     <lb/>
     the other way. Each of us is entitled to his own 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and probably each may entertain their 
     <lb/>
     opinion honestly. Then, the hon. gentleman says 
     <lb/>
     that the French Canadians want only fair play and 
     <lb/>
     justice. I should be ashamed to take the position 
     <lb/>
     that I intended to deny fair play and justice to the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians; on the contrary, they should 
     <lb/>
     have the fullest justice and the utmost limit of 
     <lb/>
     fair play; but this is an English colony, we live 
     <lb/>
     under British laws and institutions, and there is a 
     <lb/>
     vast country in the North-West where all the in<lb break="no"/>stitutions are plastic and unformed, and, because 
     <lb/>
     there are a few hundred or a few thousand 
     <lb/>
     children of French traders and French half-<lb break="yes"/>breeds in that territory, it is not necessary for 
     <lb/>
     the future welfare of this country that the 
     <lb/>
     dual language should be preserved there as official, 
     <lb/>
     with all the evils which we believe would flow 
     <lb/>
     from it to the general interests of the country. 
     <lb/>
     The North-West is likely to become the seat of 
     <lb/>
     power in this Dominion; it is likely to have the 
     <lb/>
     great majority of the people of this Dominion; it 
     <lb/>
     it is likely to become the most productive part of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, and therefore it is of the utmost 
     <lb/>
     importance, at this time, that this change should 
     <lb/>
     be made, when it can be done without any great 
     <lb/>
     trouble. When that country is young and in a 
     <lb/>
     formative state, we should put it on the right 
     <lb/>
     track. The North-West ought not to be saddled with 
     <lb/>
     such a provision as the use of two official languages. 
     <lb/>
     I believe, in the interests of this country, that it 
     <lb/>
     should not be, and I shall so vote. My sense of 
     <lb/>
     duty impels me to do so. Then the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     says, that Parliament is the proper place in which 
     <lb/>
     to deal with this. I thoroughly agree with him 
     <lb/>
     in that. The North-West Territories, have not yet 
     <lb/>
     Provincial institutions. This clause 110 emanated 
     <lb/>
     from us. With this Parliament rests the exclu<lb break="no"/>sive jurisdiction up to this moment, and, if this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament has taken a step which is not in the 
     <lb/>
     interest of the country, or has done any wrong, let 
     <lb/>
     us undo that wrong and retrace the step. I shall 
     <lb/>
     vote to retrace the step and undo the wrong. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman will vote that this provision shall 
     <lb/>
     not be repealed. He has a perfect right to do so, 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     and so have all his fellow-countrymen, but I shall 
     <lb/>
     vote that it be repealed, because I think it is not in 
     <lb/>
     the interest of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then we come to our friend from Algoma (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Dawson), who tells us there were French in the 
     <lb/>
     North-West before there were English. So there 
     <lb/>
     were, and so there were in Ontario, and they had 
     <lb/>
     stations in Detroit before there were any English 
     <lb/>
     there at all, and they had other stations in Michigan, 
     <lb/>
     Illinois and Wisconsin, and yet the French lang<lb break="no"/>uage has not been retained in those places. The 
     <lb/>
     English have acquired rights there by possession or 
     <lb/>
     purchase, and I believe that we may follow their 
     <lb/>
     example in the case of the Canadian North-West. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I come next to the speech of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Public Works. I am bound to 
     <lb/>
     say that I considered that speech last night a 
     <lb/>
     bitter one. The hon. gentleman possesses tact 
     <lb/>
     and diplomatic ability, but last night he did not 
     <lb/>
     succeed in concealing the bitterness of his feel<lb break="no"/>ing on this topic, a feeling amounting almost to a 
     <lb/>
     sense of hatred of those who were opposed to him. 
     <lb/>
               He paraded before the House— as, of course, he had 
     <lb/>
               a right to do so— his devotion to his Church and 
     <lb/>
     his loyalty to French Canadian institutions. He is 
     <lb/>
     undoubtedly loyal to them. Referring to the French 
     <lb/>
     settlers of the North-West, he asked "when have 
     <lb/>
     these men spoken treason?" I have not accused 
     <lb/>
     them of speaking treason but it is not long since 
     <lb/>
     they were in rebellion; and whether they were 
     <lb/>
     more in fault for that than my hon. friend and 
     <lb/>
     his colleagues, I am not now to say; but as to 
     <lb/>
     their loyalty to this country and its institutions, 
     <lb/>
     I doubt if they are entitled to any degree of 
     <lb/>
     consideration on that score. As to this question 
     <lb/>
     of loyalty and of the use of treasonable expressions, 
     <lb/>
     I must be permitted, I think, to refer to some 
     <lb/>
     of the circumstances which are indicative of the 
     <lb/>
     feeling amongst our French fellow-citizens, and 
     <lb/>
     I do this with a feeling of reluctance I did 
     <lb/>
     not propose to do so; and, perhaps, it is not 
     <lb/>
     necessary to do so; but, I think, the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Public Works challenged this reference by the 
     <lb/>
     allusion which he made in the course of his speech 
     <lb/>
     last night. In the city of Quebec, not many 
     <lb/>
     months ago, there was a great public demon<lb break="no"/>stration on the occasion of the unveiling of a 
     <lb/>
     couple of statues, and speeches were then made 
     <lb/>
     by French Canadians of eminence, who may be 
     <lb/>
     supposed to give utterance to the feeling in French 
     <lb/>
     Canada, which, I think, possess a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     significance. I think there may be some here 
     <lb/>
     now who were present on that occasion. I have 
     <lb/>
     understood that the Tri-color was there displayed 
     <lb/>
     abundantly, and that the Union Jack was not so 
     <lb/>
     abundantly displayed; that the outward appear<lb break="no"/>ances would not impress any one with the idea 
     <lb/>
     that it was a British Province. I find that I have 
     <lb/>
     here a couple of extracts from the speech of the 
     <lb/>
     Premier of that Province, in the course of which 
     <lb/>
     he said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     "He was ready to declare that the Government of

     would be the means of uniting the French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     people for the triumph of their sacred cause. (Great ap<lb break="no"/>plause.) For the sake of their nationality, for the sake of 
     <lb/>
     their religion, they must be united. Religion and nation<lb break="no"/>ality formed a harmonious union in their midst. The

     <lb/>and I think the language was not called for. There 
     <lb/>was nothing in the events connected with the agi<lb break="no"/>tation in the House last Session, and the agitation 
     <lb/>that followed that affair in the country, that called 
     <lb/>for any such manifestation of feeling in French 
     <lb/>Canada. A portion of the people of this country took 
     <lb/>the view that a law had been passed that ought to 
     <lb/>have been disallowed; they took the view that the 
     <lb/>prerogative of the Crown had been insulted and 
     <lb/>infringed upon; they took the view that sectarian 
     <lb/>grants had been made and that money devoted to 
     <lb/>a special purpose had been unconstitutionally di<lb break="no"/>verted from that purpose and used for another. 
     <lb/>There was amply room for differences of opinion 
     <lb/>on this point; but it was not a subject that war<lb break="no"/>ranted the exhibition of the kind of feeling that 
     <lb/>is evinced by the extracts I read a moment ago. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:GIRO3">Mr. GIROUARD</persName>. Will the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     tell me the name of the paper from which he has 
     <lb/>
     been quoting?   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. The name of the paper is 
     <lb/>
               the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mail</hi> It is the only paper, so far as 
     <lb/>
     I am aware, throughout Ontario, that had a re<lb break="no"/>porter there to report the proceedings, or from 
     <lb/>
     which we can obtain any information with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the matter whatever. Now, the hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Public Works, in his speech last night, dwelling 
     <lb/>
     upon the matter of the loyalty of the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, reminded us that it was owing to that spirit 
     <lb/>
     of loyalty that French Canada did not embark in 
     <lb/>
     the revolution with the thirteen colonies and be<lb break="no"/>come a part of the American Confederation. Well, 
     <lb/>
     I have great doubts, Sir, whether it was loyalty 
     <lb/>
     to British institutions, or whether it was the fear 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     on the part of the French Catholic Church that 
     <lb/>
     union with these thirteen Puritan colonies would 
     <lb/>
     be detrimental to her interests as a church; and 
     <lb/>
     I have very serious doubts whether it was unmixed 
     <lb/>
     loyalty that actuated the people of that Province 
     <lb/>
     in the choice they made in regard to that matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAP4">Mr. CHAPLEAU</persName>. Keep those doubts to your<lb break="no"/>self. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I have my doubts, and I 
     <lb/>
     have a perfect liberty to express them here to-day, 
     <lb/>
     and I think it is susceptible of demonstration that 
     <lb/>
     the choice in relation to that matter arose from the 
     <lb/>
     fear, on the part of that church, that acting in 
     <lb/>
     consonance with the thirteen colonies, would not 
     <lb/>
     redound to her interests in Canada. Of course, 
     <lb/>
     this is an opinion, and I suppose I have the liberty 
     <lb/>
     of expressing my opinions here with regard to this 
     <lb/>
     matter if I do it temperately and courteously, and 
     <lb/>
     I trust I have not exceeded the limits of courtesy 
     <lb/>
     in the way in which I have made the state<lb break="no"/>ment. Then the hon. gentleman asks: Is your 
     <lb/>
     birth better than ours, is your blood better than 
     <lb/>
     ours? Well, Sir, who had claimed that our birth 
     <lb/>
     or our blood was better than that of our French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian fellow-citizens? It is not a question as 
     <lb/>
     to which is the leading race, as to which has the 
     <lb/>
     best lineage, as to which has the best blood. We do 
     <lb/>
     not say to our French Canadian friends that we 
     <lb/>
     are better in any respect than they are, but in the 
     <lb/>
     position we take we are actuated by a desire 
     <lb/>
     to serve the interests of this whole country, and 
     <lb/>
     that with five millions of people in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, the true interests of each one are the true 
     <lb/>
     interests of all; and if in our opinion a 
     <lb/>
     special line of policy is likely to be more conduc<lb break="no"/>ive to the interests of Canada than another, we 
     <lb/>
     have a perfect right to advocate that line of policy; 
     <lb/>
     and the hon. gentleman had no right to make the 
     <lb/>
     taunt that he did, and to strive to raise, as he did 
     <lb/>
     strive to raise, in his speech, feelings of animosity 
     <lb/>
     and bitterness. Then he went on to say that per<lb break="no"/>secution and fanaticism would not stand. Well, 
     <lb/>
     that is true, at least I believe and hope it is true. I 
     <lb/>
     do not believe that persecution or fanaticism ever 
     <lb/>
     benefited a cause yet, and I hope that the time 
     <lb/>
     will come when evangelists can hold religious 
     <lb/>
     services in the city of Hull without interruption, 
     <lb/>
     and when the Salvation Army can parade the 
     <lb/>
     streets of Quebec with the same facility and ease 
     <lb/>
     that they can the streets of Ottawa. I hope that 
     <lb/>
     persecution and fanaticism in that respect will not 
     <lb/>
     stand in the Province of Quebec; and if the time 
     <lb/>
     should ever come when some French Luther 
     <lb/>
     wants to nail ninety-five theses, more or less, to 
     <lb/>
     the door of any church in Canada, attacking 
     <lb/>
     tithes, fabrique assessments, canon law, and 
     <lb/>
     medieval institutions of any kind—I hope the 
     <lb/>
     time will come when any person, whether a 
     <lb/>
     clergyman or otherwise, will be at liberty to nail 
     <lb/>
     his placard to the door of the church and maintain 
     <lb/>
     that position, with free speech, and every right 
     <lb/>
     that pertains to free speech in Canada. Now, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     with regard to toleration, all that we want in this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, all that we ask in this Equal Rights 
     <lb/>
     movement, is equal rights in religion, the right to 
     <lb/>
     worship God, the right to proclaim our belief, the 
     <lb/>
     right to carry on the usages of our religion in any 
     <lb/>
     part of this Dominion without molestation. That 
     <lb/>
     is all we claim. We have no desire to abridge the 
     <lb/>
     rights possessed by any man in this Dominion, 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="661" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00661.jpg"/>
           
     <fw type="num">661</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 14, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">662</fw> 
     
            
           
     whatever may be his faith, and we only protest 
     <lb/>
     when a desire to abridge our rights is manifested 
     <lb/>
     by some other man against us. We have taken a 
     <lb/>
     position, of course, against sectarian grants; we 
     <lb/>
     take a position against union between Church and 
     <lb/>
     State, and any undue favors shown by the State to 
     <lb/>
     one church at the expense of another. If this is 
     <lb/>
     not sound ground, then I am much mistaken; if 
     <lb/>
     the position that we have taken on this matter is 
     <lb/>
     not unassailable, then I am laboring under a 
     <lb/>
     grievous error. I suppose, Mr. Speaker,—although 
     <lb/>
     the charge is not made directly against me; 
     <lb/>
     it was against my hon. friend from North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe, and is likely to be made against me—I 
     <lb/>
     suppose that I shall be accused of fanaticism. 
     <lb/>
     Well, Sir, there may be some ground for it. My 
     <lb/>
     maternal ancestors were some of them Covenanters 
     <lb/>
     and were subjected to bitter persecution by the 
     <lb/>
     bloody Claverhouse. I can remember, as a boy, 
     <lb/>
     my own father being mobbed in the State of 
     <lb/>
     New York, because he was an abolitionist. And 
     <lb/>
     I rather fancy that fanaticism is constitutional 
     <lb/>
     with me; it may be, I will not deny it. But if 
     <lb/>
     it is fanaticism to stand up for what I believe 
     <lb/>
     to be in the best interests of this Dominion, if 
     <lb/>
     it is fanaticism to attempt to stem the tide that 
     <lb/>
     sets very strongly against me in this matter, to 
     <lb/>
     venture to take a position which alienates friends 
     <lb/>
     and embitters the hostility of foes, then I am 
     <lb/>
     a fanatic. But I stand up to-day to assert my 
     <lb/>
     belief that the use of the French language in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West as a dual language is un<lb break="no"/>necessary, that the use of the French language as 
     <lb/>
     an official language in the North-West should 
     <lb/>
     be prohibited, that it may easily be done, 
     <lb/>
     that no shock or agitation will result from 
     <lb/>
     doing it, and that it will be an act of supreme folly, 
     <lb/>
     when the matter is brought to our attention, to 
     <lb/>
     refuse to do it. The hon. gentleman said there 
     <lb/>
     are 1,500,000 French in Canada, and they are not 
     <lb/>
     to be driven from this country. Who asks to 
     <lb/>
     drive them from Canada? Who proposes to drive 
     <lb/>
     them from it? Who proposes to deprive them of 
     <lb/>
     any rights they possess to-day? They are wel<lb break="no"/>come in Canada. We are glad to have them as 
     <lb/>
     citizens of this country, and we welcome them 
     <lb/>
     to share everthing with us, and in any action we 
     <lb/>
     take to have in View the interests of the French as 
     <lb/>
     well as the Saxon inhabitants of this country. 
     <lb/>
     Then the hon. gentleman makes the plea of in<lb break="no"/>herent rights to the use of the language in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, because there are a few thousand French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, more or less, in this country. The 
     <lb/>
     argument would apply to every portion of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion where French Canadians are found. If 
     <lb/>
     there is an inherent right to the use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language wherever there are French Canadians, 
     <lb/>
     that right will apply to Ontario, New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island; and if 
     <lb/>
     that argument is sound, you must not only retain 
     <lb/>
     the use of the dual language in the North-West, 
     <lb/>
     but also extend its use over the entire Dom<lb break="no"/>inion. Then the hon. gentleman tells us: 
     <lb/>
     "Oh, well, the expense is small, it is 
     <lb/>
     an exceedingly little thing to make such a row 
     <lb/>
     about." He said the cost up to this time 
     <lb/>
     had only been $400 a year, and he added, "I 
     <lb/>
     will pay that amount out of my own pocket rather 
     <lb/>
     than have any trouble." Sir, it is not a matter of 
     <lb/>
     expense; that oes not enter into the calculation. 
     <lb/>
     It is a matter of the future well-being of the North—<lb break="yes"/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     West; it is a matter involving the whole welfare of 
     <lb/>
     the future inhabitants of that great country, which 
     <lb/>
     may in fifty years have millions of inhabitants, 
     <lb/>
     instead of a few thousands; it is a question of 
     <lb/>
     laying the foundation on which the institutions of 
     <lb/>
     that country will rest, the moulding of the plastic 
     <lb/>
     elements which are to form the bed-rock of the 
     <lb/>
     future. It is not a question of a paltry few hun<lb break="no"/>dred dollars, which may have been spent hitherto 
     <lb/>
     in the cost of maintaining this system of a dual 
     <lb/>
     language in this country. Then the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man told us, and he did so in a manner which 
     <lb/>
     amounted almost to a menace, that the French are 
     <lb/>
     united, the French in this House are united, they 
     <lb/>
     will stand by their rights, they will vote as one 
     <lb/>
     man, for there is no politics in this question. Well, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman felt, perhaps, as he has often 
     <lb/>
     felt before when he has had the entire French 
     <lb/>
     element at his back, that he was master of the 
     <lb/>
     situation—very likely he felt so. That is one of 
     <lb/>
     the troubles which exists in political matters, and 
     <lb/>
     a combination of that kind on race lines has often 
     <lb/>
     controlled most important legislation here. I can<lb break="no"/>not retort upon the hon. gentleman by telling him 
     <lb/>
     that the English are united, because they are not. 
     <lb/>
     They do not unite readily upon a matter of this 
     <lb/>
     kind. There are differences of opinion; they can<lb break="no"/>not be readily united for the purpose of maintaining 
     <lb/>
     race privileges and interests. There is too much 
     <lb/>
     magnanimity among them; they feel it would be 
     <lb/>
     an act of tyranny to unite on this matter, as the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman claims the French of the country 
     <lb/>
     have done. But if that feeling is to govern the 
     <lb/>
     conduct of the French members of this House, if 
     <lb/>
     they are to unite together on race lines, in the 
     <lb/>
     manner which the hon. gentleman told us they 
     <lb/>
     have done on this occasion, the natural result may 
     <lb/>
     possibly be that it will lead to a union of the same 
     <lb/>
     kind of the other element; and this is certainly to 
     <lb/>
     be deprecated. Then he said: Why not treat 
     <lb/>
     the French as brothers and friends. Well, surely, 
     <lb/>
     why not? We have nothing, we seek nothing 
     <lb/>
     that we will not share with the French equally. 
     <lb/>
     What are our aspirations? Look at our annex<lb break="no"/>ations. We have acquired the North-West, we 
     <lb/>
     have acquired British Columbia, we have 
     <lb/>
     acquired Prince Edward Island, and we wish 
     <lb/>
     as soon as we can to acquire Newfoundland. We 
     <lb/>
     are determined to possess one-half of this con<lb break="no"/>tinent. We have built a. system of canals, not for 
     <lb/>
     our present wants only, but to meet the require<lb break="no"/>ments of the future, and we have perfected a water<lb break="no"/>way from the ocean to the heart of the Continent. 
     <lb/>
     We have burdened ourselves with an enormous 
     <lb/>
     debt for the purpose of building a railway from 
     <lb/>
     ocean to ocean. We are making vast grants and 
     <lb/>
     subsidies for the purpose of extending the railway 
     <lb/>
     system of the Dominion. We are carefully and 
     <lb/>
     laboriously perfecting a code of laws which we 
     <lb/>
     believe have no equal in Christendom. We have 
     <lb/>
     in thisDominion one of the grandest educational 
     <lb/>
     system that existsinthe world. We have liberty; 
     <lb/>
     we aim to become a great nation. These are our 
     <lb/>
     aspirations, and there is not one of those blessings, 
     <lb/>
     privileges, immunities, that we do not propose to 
     <lb/>
     share equally and fully with every citizen of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion whether Saxon or French. Yes, we are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to treat them as brothers, and we simply 
     <lb/>
     ask from them the same feeling and treatment 
     <lb/>
     towards us as we are freely prepared to extend to 
     <lb/>
     them. They are our brothers. We feel that to 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="663" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00663.jpg"/>
         
     <fw type="num">663</fw> <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">664</fw>
     
     be the case. The latchstring we have always 
     <lb/>
     hanging out and the warmest welcome is always 
     <lb/>
     ready. We do not wish to have animosities, 
     <lb/>
     bickerings and prejudices existing; but we want 
     <lb/>
     to make this an English nation, we wish to have 
     <lb/>
     English institutions from ocean to ocean, we wish 
     <lb/>
     the North-West with its future 30 or 40 million to 
     <lb/>
     be a Saxon North-West. We are honest in this 
     <lb/>
     wish, and we desire that every individual in this 
     <lb/>
     country should share the blessing that would be 
     <lb/>
     secured by this consummation. If we could only 
     <lb/>
     have on the part of the Minister of Public Works 
     <lb/>
     that degree of self-denial which would enable him 
     <lb/>
     to make British citizenship something more than 
     <lb/>
     a second or a third-rate consideration, if he could 
     <lb/>
     only make it prominent and superior to his devotion 
     <lb/>
     to French institutions, it would be a great thing 
     <lb/>
     for him, a fine thing for his race and a fine thing 
     <lb/>
     for this Dominion, and the same may be said of 
     <lb/>
     all who entertain the opinions he entertains. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I come next to the hon. member for Drummond 
     <lb/>
     and Arthabaska (Mr. Lavergne). I am bound 
     <lb/>
     to say that the spirit and the attitude of the 
     <lb/>
     French members of this House upon this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and upon all questions for that matter, 
     <lb/>
     is above all praise. I say this truly; I say this 
     <lb/>
     fully. They have shown—there may be an excep<lb break="no"/>tion or two, for there is an exception to every 
     <lb/>
     rule—forbearance and a desire to treat this ques<lb break="no"/>tion fairly they have not evinced bitterness, they 
     <lb/>
     have not evinced bigotry, they have not evinced 
     <lb/>
     prejudice in an undue degree, and this is especially 
     <lb/>
     true with respect to the French Canadian Liberals 
     <lb/>
     of this House. The hon. gentleman to whose 
     <lb/>
     remarks I am referring, spoke last night in defence 
     <lb/>
     of Canadian rights, the rights that are guaranteed 
     <lb/>
     the French race under the constitution. I can 
     <lb/>
     agree with him. There is not a right guaranteed 
     <lb/>
     to the race under the constitution which I wish to 
     <lb/>
     see impaired  there is not a right the integrity of 
     <lb/>
     which I wish to see impaired in the slightest 
     <lb/>
     degree. This is not a question of the preservation 
     <lb/>
     of rights existing  it is a question as to the forma<lb break="no"/>tion of new institutions and a polity that will be 
     <lb/>
     adopted with respect to the vast unoccupied terri<lb break="no"/>tories of this Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then we come to the remarks of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Bothwell (Mr. Mills). The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     treated us to a very learned dissertation, to a speech 
     <lb/>
     which, of its character, is perhaps the finest I ever 
     <lb/>
     listened to in this House. It was a most admirable 
     <lb/>
     contribution, and it was listened to, beyond doubt, 
     <lb/>
     with the greatest degree of pleasure by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     members of the House. I am afraid, however, it 
     <lb/>
     will be above the comprehension of the average 
     <lb/>
     elector and may not be read with effect by the 
     <lb/>
     millions in the country. I was struck with one point 
     <lb/>
     in the hon. gentleman's speech which I thought 
     <lb/>
     evinced a want of tact. He said that three millions 
     <lb/>
     people could not swallow two millions, that it was 
     <lb/>
     not a cod that swallowed Jonah but a whale. Now, 
     <lb/>
     the comparison of the French race in this country to 
     <lb/>
     Jonah was, I think, on the part of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, somewhat unkind. We are not proposing to 
     <lb/>
     swallow this Jonah  we do not expect to undertake 
     <lb/>
     any such impossible task as to swallow two millions 
     <lb/>
     people—not by any means, but we do expect to get 
     <lb/>
     the institutions of the North-West fixed up in a 
     <lb/>
     right shape and we have no doubt in the world 
     <lb/>
     that we will succeed in that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

           
            <cb/>
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:LAND3">Mr. LANDRY</persName>. You don't want to swallow it, 
     <lb/>
     but you want to throw it overboard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. No, nor that either. We 
     <lb/>
     expect to allow our French Canadian friends to 
     <lb/>
     enjoy whatever privileges they ever have enjoyed, 
     <lb/>
     and we do not question their right to enjoy one of 
     <lb/>
     these privileges. If we can secure the gradual 
     <lb/>
     assimilation of the races, if we can secure gradual 
     <lb/>
     homogeneity, we will be glad, and if we cannot we 
     <lb/>
     will be sorry. The question of the two languages 
     <lb/>
     in the North-West is the question we have in hand 
     <lb/>
     to-day. We propose if possible to have that North-<lb break="yes"/>West an English country. I have not time this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon to attempt to follow the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) in the various positions 
     <lb/>
     he has taken. However, he gave us an account 
     <lb/>
     of the attempt in the Netherlands to have commu<lb break="no"/>nity of language there, and said it was a failure. 
     <lb/>
     Well, we are not making that attempt in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and it is not a parallel case, nor has it any bearing 
     <lb/>
     on the matter under discussion. We do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to make any attempt to force the English 
     <lb/>
     language upon the Canadians of Quebec, and there<lb break="no"/>fore the comparison was far-fetched and entirely 
     <lb/>
     inapplicable. We merely propose that in a new 
     <lb/>
     country, where there are comparatively no inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants at all, that the English language shall be 
     <lb/>
     used as the official language in place of two 
     <lb/>
     languages. That is all there is about the question, 
     <lb/>
     from our standpoint. The hon. gentleman also 
     <lb/>
     said—and I cannot see what bearing it has 
     <lb/>
     on the case at all—that we had better com<lb break="no"/>mence with the aborigines by prohibiting the 
     <lb/>
     translation of books into their languages 
     <lb/>
     and by prohibiting the missionaries from 
     <lb/>
     learning their languages or from preaching the 
     <lb/>
     Gospel to them in their native tongue. It may be 
     <lb/>
     that this had a bearing on the case, but I cannot 
     <lb/>
     see it. There is no proposal to make the aboriginal 
     <lb/>
     languages in the North—West official languages, nor 
     <lb/>
     is such a thing dreamed of  there is no proposal to 
     <lb/>
     prohibit a man of the Cree or Sioux or Blackfeet 
     <lb/>
     tribes speaking in his native tongue, nor no proposal 
     <lb/>
     to prohibit the translation of the Bible into those 
     <lb/>
     tongues. Why the hon. gentleman should have 
     <lb/>
     brought up that argument I am unable to see. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I am sorry for that.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I am sorry  my obtuseness

     is to be lamented.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. Everybody else in the House

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I have no doubt my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's perception is very keen.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I saw it clearly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I repeat, Sir, that I cannot 
     <lb/>
     see what this matter may have to do with the 
     <lb/>
     question before us, because there is no proposal to 
     <lb/>
     make the Cree or any other Indian language 
     <lb/>
     official. The proposal before the House is to make 
     <lb/>
     the English language official, but it does not pro<lb break="no"/>hibit any man from reading, speaking or trans<lb break="no"/>acting business in any other language in the 
     <lb/>
     world, the Chinese or otherwise. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Davin) whose keen vision enables him to see 
     <lb/>
     a black rod in the dark may also enable him to see 
     <lb/>
     the hearing this has on the subject. The hon. <choice><sic>mem<lb break="no"/>mer</sic><corr>member</corr></choice> for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) proceeded to say that 
     <lb/>
     as there were several thousand French Canadians 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="665" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00665.jpg"/>

     in the North-West Territories it was necessary 
     <lb/>
     and more convenient to have the two languages  
     <lb/>
     in fact he went so far as to say that because 
     <lb/>
     there were a few thousand French in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West it was a matter of absolute necessity to have 
     <lb/>
     the two languages. I wonder how they get along 
     <lb/>
     in Massachusetts without two official languages, 
     <lb/>
     where there are 75,000 French Canadians, or in New 
     <lb/>
     Hampshire where there are said to be about 40,000? 
     <lb/>
     It seems they get along quite conveniently with the 
     <lb/>
     English language there, and it seems that the French 
     <lb/>
     go there out of choice, and keep on going there and 
     <lb/>
     staying there, without feeling any hardship placed 
     <lb/>
     on them for the lack of their own language in these 
     <lb/>
     States. If the French can go to Massachusetts, 
     <lb/>
     Maine, Vermont and other New England States, why 
     <lb/>
     the same class of people cannot go to the North-West 
     <lb/>
     if there is no French language there, is more than 
     <lb/>
     I can understand. We are told further that we 
     <lb/>
     have no specific information or expressed request 
     <lb/>
     from the North-West for this change. We have 
     <lb/>
     all the information we want. We are dealing with 
     <lb/>
     this question on the basis of our own duty towards 
     <lb/>
     the North-West. We took it upon ourselves some 
     <lb/>
     years ago—it was done by the Senate—to insert a 
     <lb/>
     clause with reference to the use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language in the North-West, and when that Bill 
     <lb/>
     came back from the Senate to the House, the mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Government responsible for the Bill, the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior at that time, assumed the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility for that clause in not insisting that it 
     <lb/>
     should be expunged from the Bill. No doubt this 
     <lb/>
     clause did not attract the attention it ought to have 
     <lb/>
     done then, and I do not suppose that the hon. the 
     <lb/>
     ex-Minister of Interior gave the matter any 
     <lb/>
     particular consideration. He was somewhat 
     <lb/>
     annoyed at the insertion of the clause, but as it 
     <lb/>
     was late in the Session he permitted it to pass. We 
     <lb/>
     have this matter now brought before the House, 
     <lb/>
     and we begin to realise that it is a question of 
     <lb/>
     some importance. The question is, shall we undo 
     <lb/>
     a certain piece of mischief that we did unwittingly 
     <lb/>
     a few years ago  I do not care what the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Will think of this matter. I do not care a 
     <lb/>
     farthing whether we have specific information or 
     <lb/>
     expressed requests, or not  the question for me is, 
     <lb/>
     is it a provision that this House of Commons, as 
     <lb/>
     the original source of authority charged with the 
     <lb/>
     management of the affairs of the North-West, 
     <lb/>
     is entitled to insert in that Bill, in the interest of 
     <lb/>
     the North-West and of the country at large  If it 
     <lb/>
     is, let it stand there. If it is not, I maintain that, 
     <lb/>
     without any reference to expressed requests, or 
     <lb/>
     Without consulting the wishes of the North-West, 
     <lb/>
     it is the duty of this Parliament to remove it. 
     <lb/>
     Then, the hon. gentleman says, let the people of the 
     <lb/>
     North-West legislate upon this when they become a 
     <lb/>
     Province. I say so, too, and I say further: let them 
     <lb/>
     be placed in a perfectly untrammelled position to 
     <lb/>
     do with the question as they think proper. 
     <lb/>
     And when the North-West in due time 
     <lb/>
               obtains Provincial Government, let them pro<lb break="no"/>ceed <hi rendition="simple:italic">de novo</hi> and determine whether they are 
     <lb/>
     to have French an official language or not. We 
     <lb/>
     will thus wash our hands of the question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is perhaps all I have time to say this after<lb break="no"/>noon in reference to the position taken by the 
     <lb/>
     learned and hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills). 
     <lb/>
     Sir, the discussion on this question has taken a wide 
     <lb/>
     range. It has covered the whole of the colonial his<lb break="no"/>tory of the country, and I will ask the indulgence 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     of the House for a few moments while I refer to 
     <lb/>
     some of the more interesting features with regard to 
     <lb/>
     this struggle which is taking place on this continent 
     <lb/>
     for supremacy between the French and the English 
     <lb/>
     races. We have had colonial establishments in 
     <lb/>
     America for three hundred years. Three of 
     <lb/>
     the nations of Europe laid their plans for the 
     <lb/>
     foundations of empire here—Spain, France and 
     <lb/>
     England. Spain colonised Mexico and South 
     <lb/>
     America, but all her colonial possessions 
     <lb/>
     have dropped from her grasp except Cuba and 
     <lb/>
     some insignificant possessions in the West Indies. 
     <lb/>
     France colonised Canada, and the history of French 
     <lb/>
     enterprise, French courage, French genius, and 
     <lb/>
     French daring in connection with the exploration 
     <lb/>
     of the vast interior regions of America reads like 
     <lb/>
     a romance. We have in the careers of La Salle, 
     <lb/>
     Joliette, Marquette, Hennepin, Tonty, and Du<lb break="no"/>quesne, a story of adventure which, I repeat, reads 
     <lb/>
     more like a romance than the veritable records of 
     <lb/>
     history. I have often thought, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     when crossing over the prairies of Illinois, how 
     <lb/>
     magnificent was the conception of La Salle as to 
     <lb/>
     the foundation of an empire in that region; I 
     <lb/>
     have thought of his discovery of Illinois, of his 
     <lb/>
     voyage down the Mississippi to its mouth, of his 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the vast resources of that great 
     <lb/>
     country, of the enterprise which led to the plant<lb break="no"/>ing of military posts at Detroit, Mackinaw, and 
     <lb/>
     other favorable points in the west and north-west. 
     <lb/>
     The French of that day were singularly adven<lb break="no"/>turous. The young Frenchmen preferred leaving 
     <lb/>
     his home on the St. Lawrence and going to the 
     <lb/>
     wilds of the west, taking a dusky bride of 
     <lb/>
     the forest rather than one of the marriageable 
     <lb/>
     daughters of his own people. In this spirit the 
     <lb/>
     French penetrated the far interior of the con<lb break="no"/>tinent, and surrounded the thirteen colonies with 
     <lb/>
     a cordon of posts, and, in their magnificent 
     <lb/>
     conception, took possession of some of the finest 
     <lb/>
     portions of this continent. On the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     we had the thirteen colonies planted by the 
     <lb/>
     English, a more slow-going, methodical people, 
     <lb/>
     without that dash and spirit of adventure which 
     <lb/>
     characterised the French; but these Englishmen 
     <lb/>
     sat down and began the founding of states, the 
     <lb/>
     building up of institutions and the formation of 
     <lb/>
     constitutions and the result of their labor in due 
     <lb/>
     time was embodied in the American Republic, 
     <lb/>
     with such men as Washington, Franklin, Alex<lb break="no"/>ander Hamilton, and other great fathers of the 
     <lb/>
     American Confederacy, standing sponsors of the 
     <lb/>
     work. But before this consummation had reached 
     <lb/>
     a close, the possessions of France in the north had 
     <lb/>
     passed away from her. In 1759, on the Plains of 
     <lb/>
     Abraham, the French power gave place to the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish flag, and that event was one having a more 
     <lb/>
     important bearing on the destiny of this contin<lb break="no"/>ent than any other event in the history of America. 
     <lb/>
     That event led unquestionably to the American 
     <lb/>
     Revolution. But for the conquest of Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     thirteen colonies would not have thought of revolt<lb break="no"/>ing at the time they did. The capitulation of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     in 1759, and the French cession of Canada in 1762, 
     <lb/>
     were followed by the ceding of Louisiana to the 
     <lb/>
     United States in 1803. The great Napoleon, con<lb break="no"/>vinced that he would be unable to hold that posses<lb break="no"/>sion or toprevent it falling into the hands of England, 
     <lb/>
     ceded it to the United States for the sum of $13,000,<lb break="no"/>000, and with this cession the last vestige of French 
     <lb/>
     possession and French power in America passed
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="667" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00667.jpg"/>

     away. Now the Anglo-Saxon was placed in the as<lb break="no"/>cendancy  it was the decree of fate that this should 
     <lb/>
     be the case and what does he proceed to do? Why 
     <lb/>
     he sets to work to carry into effect with all possible 
     <lb/>
     haste his purposes. He intends that this whole con<lb break="no"/>tinent shall have freedom and free institutions  he 
     <lb/>
     intends that it shall have religious tolerance; he 
     <lb/>
     intends that the history of the race on this continent 
     <lb/>
     shall be marked by the most wonderful material 
     <lb/>
     development of this or any other age  he intends to 
     <lb/>
     build up a great power on this continent  and he has 
     <lb/>
     done it. Already the second power in the world 
     <lb/>
     is the Republic to the south of us  the greatest of 
     <lb/>
     Britain's colonies is the one in which we live and 
     <lb/>
     the power of these two countries is increasing 
     <lb/>
     in a ratio which almost dazzles the imagination. 
     <lb/>
     The Anglo-Saxon may be somewhat aggressive, but 
     <lb/>
     his purpose is nevertheless a beneficent one, and 
     <lb/>
               he intends—it is his fixed determination—that 
     <lb/>
     assimilation and homogeneity shall be the charac<lb break="no"/>teristics of every part of the land over which he 
     <lb/>
     bears sway. That is his fixed intention, and 
     <lb/>
     whether he can accomplish it or not, I am unable 
     <lb/>
     to say  but that he expects to occupy this contin<lb break="no"/>ent, from the Arctic Ocean to the Isthmus of Pan<lb break="no"/>ama, there is no doubt. My hon. friend asks, what 
     <lb/>
     he will do with Mexico  He will do with Mexico just 
     <lb/>
     what he did with the French in Louisiana and the 
     <lb/>
     Spaniards in California. He will say to them  
     <lb/>
    Here are the institutions and the rights of citi<lb break="no"/>zens—take them  you are welcome to them  
     <lb/>become American citizens, and there is no right 
     <lb/>belonging to an American citizen that will be 
     <lb/>denied you; and he will assimilate them all. He 
     <lb/>will not take them in all at once, as the whale 
     <lb/>swallowed Jonah, but he will take them little by 
     <lb/>little, and will ultimately assimilate the whole 
     <lb/>mass. In the working out of this problem, he will 
     <lb/>find our French friends, genial, tractable, indus<lb break="no"/>trious, naturally law-abiding. I cannot tell how 
     <lb/>potent will be the influences that will be brought 
     <lb/>to bear on them, or how rapid the assimilation 
     <lb/>will be; but I do not believe that the position of 
     <lb/>isolation which the French race occupy now they 
     <lb/>will see fit to occupy forever. On the contrary, I 
     <lb/>believe they will ultimately see it to their interest 
     <lb/>to join this great tide, to share this great pros<lb break="no"/>perity, to become a portion of this Anglo-Saxon 
     <lb/>race which occupies this continent—to submit, in 
     <lb/>fact, to the decree of fate. They may not do it in 
     <lb/>this or in the next generation, and we must leave 
     <lb/>natural causes and forces to work their natural 
     <lb/>fruit we cannot bring about the change by violent 
     <lb/>measures we cannot do it either by this measure 
     <lb/>or by any subsequent one we may introduce. It 
     <lb/>is a matter in regard to which our French friends 
     <lb/>must be left to exercise their free choice. So long 
     <lb/>as they wish to remain as they are, they must be 
     <lb/>free to do so. In the evolution of affairs, when 
     <lb/>they see that some change will be beneficial to 
     <lb/>them, it is for them to choose it or not  they will 
     <lb/>act according to their own wishes, and be governed 
     <lb/>by their own free choice, be the result what 
     <lb/>it may. That the French race in Canada is 
     <lb/>capable of reaching the highest stage of intel<lb break="no"/>ligence and development goes without saying. 
     <lb/>That they will play an important part in the 
     <lb/>history of this continent is certain, but they 
     <lb/>never will fulfil the destiny which ought to 
     <lb/>be theirs while they remain in a position of isola<lb break="no"/>tion, without community of interest or community 
     <lb/>
           
    

            
            <cb/>
            
     of feeling with the kindred races upon this 
     <lb/>
     continent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I repeat what I have said several times, 
     <lb/>
     as I wish to make this point clear, that we 
     <lb/>
     have no intention to meddle with vested rights. 
     <lb/>
     It would not be prudent to do so. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     says, the use of the French as an official language 
     <lb/>
     in the North-West is a vested right. I say it is not. 
     <lb/>
     It is not guaranteed by the Act of British North 
     <lb/>
     America, but it is a right which exists by means 
     <lb/>
     of the surreptitious interpolation of a clause in the 
     <lb/>
     statute. That matter we are considering now, and 
     <lb/>
     it is competent for us to repeal that statute. 
     <lb/>
     We are not dealing with the constitution of this 
     <lb/>
     country at all. It is not necessary to conceal 
     <lb/>
     what the sympathies of the English-speaking 
     <lb/>
     people of this country are. While we do not pro<lb break="no"/>pose to meddle with vested rights or to make 
     <lb/>
     ourselves officious or offensive in any sense to our 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian citizens, we do not deny 
     <lb/>
     that we consider medievalism a little behind 
     <lb/>
     the age. We do not deny that we would 
     <lb/>
     like to see the French race rid themselves 
     <lb/>
     of it, not, as in France, in the flames and smoke of 
     <lb/>
     revolution, but by peaceful legislation. We do not 
     <lb/>
     deny that we would like to see them rid of their 
     <lb/>
     system of tithes, fabrique assessments and the 
     <lb/>
     other antiquated abuses under which they labor, 
     <lb/>
     but while they have our sympathy and while 
     <lb/>
     we bid them God-speed in any effort they may 
     <lb/>
     make to unburden themselves of this system, 
     <lb/>
     we do not propose to initiate any movement to 
     <lb/>
     that end. I shall feel sorry if the spirit of back<lb break="no"/>wardness continues, and shall feel glad that some<lb break="no"/>thing else should take its place. I feel free to 
     <lb/>
     make this statement, because it is my conviction 
     <lb/>
     that the condition of things in Quebec can be im<lb break="no"/>proved, and that the true Liberal, the true Re.<lb break="no"/>former, will grapple with that condition of things. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question may be asked: Why not take the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of the hon. member for Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Davin)? It may be said the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territories are sure to remove the dual language, 
     <lb/>
     and that the result I aim at will then be reached 
     <lb/>
     any way. Why not, then, take the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Assiniboia, and shift from 
     <lb/>
     our own shoulders the responsibility of dealing 
     <lb/>
     directly with this question? Well, I answer that 
     <lb/>
     I prefer, as the more manly and honest course, 
     <lb/>
     that we should undo the thing we have done. It 
     <lb/>
     is my belief that it is incumbent upon this House 
     <lb/>
     either to affirm that the principle embodied in the 
     <lb/>
     110th clause is right or that it is wrong. We do 
     <lb/>
     not want to shift the responsibility to other shoul<lb break="no"/>ders. If the inhabitants of the North-West want 
     <lb/>
     the dual language, they can have it after they get 
     <lb/>
     this power. It will be competent for them then to 
     <lb/>
     adopt it, but let us leave them perfectly untram<lb break="no"/>melled in this matter. Let us declare whether it is 
     <lb/>
     our opinion that the 110th clause of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Act is a proper or an improper clause. Let 
     <lb/>
     those who believe it is a proper clause, vote for its 
     <lb/>
     retention, and let those who believe it is not, vote 
     <lb/>
     for its repeal. I am free to say that I would not 
     <lb/>
     vote to grant a dual language to the North-West 
     <lb/>
     under any circumstances. I do not believe it is 
     <lb/>
     our business to do so. I repeat if they want it 
     <lb/>
     they can have it when they have Provincial insti 
     <lb/>
     tutions; but it is not our business to saddle it 
     <lb/>
     upon them. We have no business to make any 
     <lb/>
     enactment of that kind.

     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. We did saddle it, and we

     should unsaddle it. The hon. member for Cardwell 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. White) says that he believes in Provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights in this matter. Well, there is something 
     <lb/>
     rather curious in connection with the backdown of 
     <lb/>
     the Government upon this question of Provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights. It rather provokes my surprise. I can 
     <lb/>
     remember when the Rivers and Streams Bill was 
     <lb/>
     disallowed again and again; I can remember when 
     <lb/>
     the railway legislation of Manitoba was disallowed, 
     <lb/>
     and when the Government asserted—and they 
     <lb/>
     told the truth—that they had unquestionably 
     <lb/>
     an unlimited power in the matter of disallowance. 
     <lb/>
     There can be no question, it is a matter in the 
     <lb/>
     discretion of the Government, which is responsible 
     <lb/>
     only to the people for the proper exercise of that 
     <lb/>
     power, and yet the Government have become the 
     <lb/>
     advocate of Provincial rights. They have had a 
     <lb/>
     new revelation on this matter; they have had a 
     <lb/>
     new light as to their duty  they do not feel war<lb break="no"/>ranted now in meddling with Provincial rights at 
     <lb/>
     all since the Jesuit Estates' Bill; and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Cardwell has no doubt whatever that 
     <lb/>
     in this difficulty Provincial rights should govern. 
     <lb/>
     I think the position of the Government is scarcely 
     <lb/>
     a creditable one; its abandonment of their 
     <lb/>
     position with regard to their right to exercise the 
     <lb/>
     veto power in the case of Provincial legislation 
     <lb/>
     does not reflect credit on them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. We cannot veto 
     <lb/>this clause.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. No, but we can repeal it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. That would not 
     <lb/>
     be the exercise of the veto power.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. But I am making some re<lb break="no"/>marks on the position taken by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Cardwell (Mr. White), who believes this ques<lb break="no"/>tion should be referred to the Provincial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the North-West Territories, when 
     <lb/>
     organised, for the settlement of this question, 
     <lb/>
     because it is a matter pertinent to Provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, and I say it is a matter which pertains to 
     <lb/>
     us. The authority emanates from us, the clause 
     <lb/>
     was adopted by us, the clause should be rescinded 
     <lb/>
     when invested with Provincial authority and powers 
     <lb/>
     by us, and then the Provinces of the North-West 
     <lb/>
     will be placed in the position to exercise Provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, and say whether they will have this thing 
     <lb/>
     or not. Reference was made by some speaker, in 
     <lb/>
     the early part of the debate, to the petitions sent 
     <lb/>
     in by the North-West Council, and the insinuation 
     <lb/>
     was made that the hon. member for North Simcoe 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. McCarthy) had bought the Council. I do not 
     <lb/>
     remember who made this charge. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Simcoe has the funds 
     <lb/>
     to buy that Council, and I would not deem it a 
     <lb/>
     very creditable thing on the part of any hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber to cast that imputation upon him. Another 
     <lb/>
     assertion made was that his  speech has captured it. 
     <lb/>
     That is an assertion more flattering to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman than the other, and I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     his  speech had very much weight and influence in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West  but the fact is the public is alive 
     <lb/>
     to the importance of this question, and that the 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of the North-West and Manitoba are 
     <lb/>
     against the retention of this dual language. That 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     was shown by the repudiation of the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage in Manitoba the other day by a vote of<lb/>twenty-seven to six; and by a larger proportion 
     <lb/>
     than twenty-seven to six, the people of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     and the North-West will sweep this language away 
     <lb/>
     whenever they are given this opportunity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. Leave it to 
     <lb/>
     them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. Certainly we will. We will 
     <lb/>
     sweep it away here, and leave it to them to deal 
     <lb/>
     with it there. We may adopt the politician's ex<lb break="no"/>pedient of shifting the responsibility from our 
     <lb/>
     shoulders and dodging out of this thing, but I do 
     <lb/>
     not think that would be very honorable or credit<lb break="no"/>able to this House. I appreciate fully the feelings 
     <lb/>
     of hon. members who will vote for the retention of 
     <lb/>
     the dual language clause. I appreciate the feeling 
     <lb/>
     of the French members of this House who believe 
     <lb/>
     in the extension of their language over the North-<lb break="yes"/>West. They act according to their convictions, 
     <lb/>
     and I shall respect their action if they vote accord<lb break="no"/>ingly  but I cannot agree with them, and will 
     <lb/>
     therefore vote the other way. I hope that the 
     <lb/>
     French members will forgive, if they deem it 
     <lb/>
     necessary to forgive, that feeling which they can<lb break="no"/>not endorse, but which English-speaking members 
     <lb/>
     of this House entertain—a feeling of pride in the 
     <lb/>
     history of the British Empire  that feeling which 
     <lb/>
     causes them to take pleasure in contemplating the 
     <lb/>
     result of the battle upon the Plains of Abraham  
     <lb/>
     that feeling which leads them to rejoice in the 
     <lb/>
     results of the Battles of the Nile and Trafalgar, and 
     <lb/>
     in the results of the Battle of Waterloo  that feel<lb break="no"/>ing which makes them view with pride the progress 
     <lb/>
     of the British Empire, and inspire in them the belief 
     <lb/>
     that British institutions are the best calculated to 
     <lb/>
     conduce to the prosperity and welfare of mankind. 
     <lb/>
     I hope, Sir, they will forgive our purpose, our 
     <lb/>
     avowed purpose, to make this a Saxon state. The 
     <lb/>
     avowed purpose of the Anglo-Saxon is to make the 
     <lb/>
     Anglo-Saxon race the greatest race on the earth, 
     <lb/>
     and the hope of the Anglo-Saxon is that the day 
     <lb/>
     will come, and come before many decades have 
     <lb/>
     elapsed, when the English language will be the 
     <lb/>
     common means of intercommunication between all 
     <lb/>
     the races of the world, and the English race will 
     <lb/>
     be the dominant race of the world, so that the 
     <lb/>
     Anglo-Saxon will fulfil the destiny which God has 
     <lb/>
     evidently designed he shall fulfil in this world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Mr. BLAKE</persName>. Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to 
     <lb/>
     trouble you with very many observations in regard 
     <lb/>
     to the speech we have just listened to, or, indeed, 
     <lb/>
     to address you at any great length at all. I may 
     <lb/>
     say at once, that if any one of the propositions now 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair had been thoroughly and entire<lb break="no"/>ly satisfactory to my mind, as to the mode in 
     <lb/>
     which this question should be dealt with, I should 
     <lb/>
     have contented myself with giving a silent vote. 
     <lb/>
     It does not happen that either of those propositions 
     <lb/>
     commends itself entirely to my mind, and I shall 
     <lb/>
     briefly state why that is so, and how, in my poor 
     <lb/>
     judgment, this matter should be disposed of. 
     <lb/>
     Referring to what the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) has said, his distinguished 
     <lb/>
     position for a great many years in this Parliament 
     <lb/>
     has led—I do not say at all unjustifiably—to 
     <lb/>
     his not infrequently, when announcing his own 
     <lb/>
     views on public questions, speaking in the plural. 
     <lb/>
     Not infrequently has he followed in the past the 
     <lb/>
     course which he pursued to-day, of speaking both 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="671" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00671.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">672</fw>
           
     positively and affirmatively, and positively and 
     <lb/>
     negatively, in regard to the views and assertions, 
     <lb/>
     and policies and aspirations of others with whom 
     <lb/>
     he was for the time acting  but I am wholly unable 
     <lb/>
     to accept the declaration which the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     has made to-day in the plural at all. I accept it 
     <lb/>
     as far as he is himself concerned. As far as he 
     <lb/>
     himself professes that these are his views, his 
     <lb/>
     intentions, his opinions and his aspirations, I 
     <lb/>
     accept his statement fully and unfeignedly. But, 
     <lb/>
     when the hon. gentleman spoke of "we," of what 
     <lb/>
     "we" were intending, what "we" were propos<lb break="no"/>ing, what "we" were aiming at, and what "we" 
     <lb/>
     were not aiming at, and what "we" were not in<lb break="no"/>tending  when he spoke of what he English speak<lb break="no"/>ing people of this country intended and insisted 
     <lb/>
     upon, and so forth, then I say the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     took up a position which, in face of what has been 
     <lb/>
     going on in this country for some months past, in 
     <lb/>
     face of the declarations of the hon. member who is 
     <lb/>
     primarily responsible for this agitation—the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy)—in face 
     <lb/>
     of the language of this Bill itself, in face of all these 
     <lb/>
     things with which we have to deal, I cannot 
     <lb/>
     accept. If I could accept it, the question would 
     <lb/>
     receive an easy and rapid solution from me. I do 
     <lb/>
     not intend to enter into a criticism of the criticisms 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentleman from North Norfolk (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Charlton). One or two words will suffice for that. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman said, but I hope and think he 
     <lb/>
     must have misread his history, that the decrees of 
     <lb/>
     ancient Rome, were published in all those portions 
     <lb/>
     of the world over which she had authority, only in 
     <lb/>
     the tongue of Rome herself. I think history shows 
     <lb/>
     us that nothing so inhuman and barbarous as that 
     <lb/>
     was done, even in what may be called inhuman and 
     <lb/>
     barbarous times. Turning to a more modern ex<lb break="no"/>ample, which he justifiably quotes, an example 
     <lb/>
     which is to be regarded by us with the highest 
     <lb/>
     attention, interestand respect, he refers to the neigh<lb break="no"/>boring Republic, to what has been aimed at and ac<lb break="no"/>complished in that great community, in whose well-<lb break="yes"/>being the whole modern world has so deep an inter<lb break="no"/>est, of whose constitution the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     opposite has not seldom spoken in terms of deserved 
     <lb/>
     admiration as to the great work which was achieved 
     <lb/>
     by the men who framed that constitution. Speak<lb break="no"/>ing of that example, the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Norfolk was unfortunate enough to quote, as an 
     <lb/>
     instance of a state where the French language had 
     <lb/>
     been stamped out and the great principle which he 
     <lb/>
     proclaimed, had been realised in the very initiation 
     <lb/>
     of its connection with the nation of which it forms 
     <lb/>
     a part, the State of Louisiana. Why, Sir, is not 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman aware that, by the original 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the State of Louisiana, the French 
     <lb/>
     as well as the English language was permitted to 
     <lb/>
     be used in the debates of that State, and that that 
     <lb/>
     continued until the State of Louisiana by a subse<lb break="no"/>quent determination of its own, under circum<lb break="no"/>stances when the question had ceased to be a griev<lb break="no"/>ance, determined—as I believe, though I have no 
     <lb/>
     information upon this point—that it should be 
     <lb/>
     blotted out. The fact, however, is this, as stated 
     <lb/>
     in a book of authority, the "Cyclopaedia of Poli<lb break="no"/>tical Science:" 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">            <p>
     "The diversity of interests of the French and Am<lb break="no"/>erican citizens, however, formed the more usual dividing

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Mr. BLAKE</persName>. I was not discussing whether 
     <lb/>
     the use ofthe French language was complete in all 
     <lb/>
     the technical details. What in the world has the 
     <lb/>
     publication of the statutes or the proceedings in the 
     <lb/>
     French language to do with the matter? What is 
     <lb/>
     involved in that except a paltry $500 a year for 
     <lb/>
     the printing of certain things in the two languages  
     <lb/>
     What is the harm if the people who have to obey 
     <lb/>
     the laws are enabled to read them printed in the 
     <lb/>
     language which they understand? That is a 
     <lb/>
     small question  the great question is included in 
     <lb/>
     the power of freely debating in the Legislature in 
     <lb/>
     the tongues of the peoples of whom the State is 
     <lb/>
     composed. All I care to know in regard to that 
     <lb/>
     is that the constitution gave the people of French 
     <lb/>
     origin the right to speak in their mother tongue 
     <lb/>
     in their own State Legislature. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has said that this question is a very narrow <lb/>one, and, as he puts it, it is a comparatively 
     <lb/>
     narrow one. He has spoken of the impropriety of 
     <lb/>
     what he calls dodging responsibility. He has told 
     <lb/>
     us of the want of manliness that would be involved 
     <lb/>
     in our placing upon other shoulders the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility which we ought to take ourselves, and I con<lb break="no"/>fess that I have considerable sympathy with that 
     <lb/>
     view. As far as our present information goes, the 
     <lb/>
     general principle upon which this question should 
     <lb/>
     be dealt with, and I am quite prepared now to state 
     <lb/>
     the time when I think it should be dealt with; but I 
     <lb/>
     thought a large part of the hon. gentleman's speech 
     <lb/>
     was but a poor commentary on the declaration as to 
     <lb/>
     dodging responsibility which he made and to which 
     <lb/>
     I have just referred, when he iterated and reiterated 
     <lb/>
     the statement that "we" have no intention of inter<lb break="no"/>fering with vested rights, that "we" have no inten<lb break="no"/>tion of interfering with the rights of any minority 
     <lb/>
     which are secured under the British North America. 
     <lb/>
     Act, that "we" have no desire to touch any privilege 
     <lb/>
     properly reserved, that "we" do not intend to 
     <lb/>
     touch it, and that "we" are not touching it now. It   
     <lb/>
     appeared to me that these statements were evasive 
     <lb/>
     of responsibllity, were not merely inconsistent. 
     <lb/>
               with the Bill which the hon. gentleman is sup<lb break="no"/>porting—including the preamble—but were 
     <lb/>
     fatally inconsistent with the attitude of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), and 
     <lb/>
     with the general character of the agitation of which 
     <lb/>
     this Bill is merely the first fruits. A little later, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman declared that "we," the Anglo-<lb break="yes"/>Saxons of this continent—once again taking the 
     <lb/>
     plural pronoun, which the hon. gentleman used first. 
     <lb/>
     when speaking of those with whom he was acting, 
     <lb/>
     then when speaking of the English-speaking people   
     <lb/>
     of this country, and finally when speaking of the. 
     <lb/>
     Anglo-Saxon race from the Pole to the Isthmus 
     <lb/>
     —he declared their stern determination, by what 
     <lb/>
     means might be open to them, to make this country 
     <lb/>
     from the North Pole to the Isthmus an Anglo-Saxon 
     <lb/>
     community, and to create a homogeneity of race. 
     <lb/>
     Well, it is only a question of means and methods, 
     <lb/>
     times and circumstances, opportunities and oc<lb break="no"/>casions, by which this result is to be achieved  
     <lb/>
     and the hon. gentleman will find, as I shall pro<lb break="no"/>ceed to point out presently, that his leader does 
     <lb/>
     not propose to relegate the consideration of this 
     <lb/>
     question to other generations, to those natural and 
     <lb/>

     gradual and insensible operations which furnish 
     <lb/>
     the only possible solution of such great questions 
     <lb/>
     as he has imported into the debate; but that 
     <lb/>
     it is other and more rapid, direct and stringent 
     <lb/>
     —I will say more violent methods, that are 
     <lb/>
     really proposed to us in this regard. Now, Sir, as 
     <lb/>
     I have said, there are underlying questions here, 
     <lb/>
     much broader questions than the simple questions 
     <lb/>
     dealt with by the enacting clause. And these under<lb break="no"/>lying questions are historically old, no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     but they are old with reference to our own policy 
     <lb/>
     too; they were raised before the last general 
     <lb/>
     election, they were raised by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Simcoe himself in large part, they were 
     <lb/>
     raised by a newspaper which was, at that time, 
     <lb/>
     the most powerful supporter in the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario of hon. gentlemen opposite, and they have 
     <lb/>
     since been persisted in, and have since been en<lb break="no"/>larged. This group of questions are fundamental 
     <lb/>
     questions. They embrace topics of creed as 
     <lb/>
     well as of race, and the Jesuit affair to which the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member referred, was not the cause, was not 
     <lb/>
     the origin. It was obviously, it has since been 
     <lb/>
     confessed to have been, a mere incident, a mere 
     <lb/>
     occasion, taken advantage of as a fit and opportune 
     <lb/>
     occasion to bring up one phase, and in various 
     <lb/>
     aspects, more than one phase, of this group; a good 
     <lb/>
     occasion to bring all up in a manner which would 
     <lb/>
     attract the favorable consideration of those to whom 
     <lb/>
     they who brought them up sought to address them<lb break="no"/>selves. Now, Sir, I intend to refrain, as far as 
     <lb/>
     possible, from discussing this question in any party 
     <lb/>
     aspect whatever. It needs to be discussed in its 
     <lb/>
     party aspect, it must receive such a discussion at 
     <lb/>
     some time, but I do not think this time is the fitting 
     <lb/>
     time. I say I hope as far as possible to avoid any 
     <lb/>
     question of party in the course of this discussion. 
     <lb/>
     I am as anxious as the hon. gentleman is anxious, 
     <lb/>
     to say nothing, so far as truth will allow, except 
     <lb/>
     conciliatory words, and to deal with this matter in a 
     <lb/>
     manner becoming a public man; in such a way that, 
     <lb/>
     if my feeble words have any effect at all, they may 
     <lb/>
     tend to prevent the calamitous results of which 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman this afternoon was complaining, 
     <lb/>
     though he, and those who act with him, from the 
     <lb/>
     best motives, I have no doubt, havebeen the prime 
     <lb/>
     cause of the realisation of these results to the 
     <lb/>
     extent to which they have been up to this time 
     <lb/>
     realized. I say, Sir, that if you could deal simply 
     <lb/>
     with the enacting clause in this Bill it would be 
     <lb/>
     a matter of minor consequence; if you could dis<lb break="no"/>sociate that clause from its preamble, from its 
     <lb/>
     surroundings, from its past and from its future. 
     <lb/>
     But you cannot dissociate it, either from its pre 
     <lb/>
     amble or from its surroundings or from its past, 
     <lb/>
     and still less from its future. These difficulties are 
     <lb/>
     in part indicated by the preamble which, as you 
     <lb/>
     must expound it upon any fair principle of exposi<lb break="no"/>tion, I maintain declares for action and principles 
     <lb/>
     of action which all good Canadians must disavow 
     <lb/>
     instead of assenting to. It is a far-reaching princi<lb break="no"/>ple. It goes—and the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>Simcoe, whose legislative and professional ability 
     <lb/>we know—intended that it should go, wrote it in 
     <lb/>order that it should go, far beyond the intent 
     <lb/>of the enacting clause; and those who agree to 
     <lb/>that preamble, who give to it to-day their voices 
     <lb/>and their votes, must set their minds and their 
     <lb/>political forces to the accomplishment of the ends 
     <lb/>which we find there embedded. Doubtless our 
     <lb/>constitutional act may be amended, doubtless the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     well-understood wishes of the Canadian people can 
     <lb/>
     accomplish the amendment of the constitution. 
     <lb/>
     The machinery may be cumbrous, and it may be 
     <lb/>
     that occasionally, as has happened in the past, upon 
     <lb/>
     inadequate representations, changes of no great 
     <lb/>
     consequence, but changes still, may be made  and 
     <lb/>
     it may be again that very strong representations 
     <lb/>
     may, for a time at least, be ineffectual in producing 
     <lb/>
     amendment. But in relation to any question the 
     <lb/>
     well understood wishes of the Canadian people, in 
     <lb/>
     time and place, after due consideration, thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     ascertained and forcibly presented must produce 
     <lb/>
     an amendment of the constitution; and into the 
     <lb/>
     agitations which are necessary in order to execute 
     <lb/>
     this preamble, as indicated by the hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     own speech, we should be, it is intended that we 
     <lb/>
     should be, plunged if we agree to it. Now, what 
     <lb/>
     does it say? The hon. member for North Norfolk 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Charlton), thought that it was a very inno<lb break="no"/>cent thing. There was not much in it. He laid a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of stress upon the preamble of some 
     <lb/>
     other Bill which was passed in some other Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and he thought that preamble was good 
     <lb/>
     cause for disallowance here. But now he says that 
     <lb/>
     the preamble of this Bill, which is given as the 
     <lb/>
     basis of our decision, the cause itself upon which 
     <lb/>
     we are called upon to vote, is of very little conse<lb break="no"/>quence. It is true, it is the reason for the enact<lb break="no"/>ment, it is the moving cause which is given to us, 
     <lb/>
     but it is not of much consequence, and is not of 
     <lb/>
     much harm. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I beg the hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     pardon. I cited the words of the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice, not my own words. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Mr. BLAKE</persName>. Oh, well, I know. I do not care 
     <lb/>
     much for that mere throwing of verbal bombshells 
     <lb/>
     from one side to the another. We have got to do 
     <lb/>
     with the reason of the Bill. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     cited words which I thought he adopted. He agrees 
     <lb/>
     with me now that the preamble is of consequence, 
     <lb/>
     and that by it we understand what the Bill means. 
     <lb/>
     He says that he is prepared to agree with the pre<lb break="no"/>amble, and to vote for it. The preamble says

   </quote>
            <p>
     And it proceeds to enact. Here, then, is the mean<lb break="no"/>ing in this preamble, of that community of lang<lb break="no"/>uage, which it is expedient should prevail among 
     <lb/>
     the whole people of Canada. The second para<lb break="no"/>graph of the preamble tells us that the community 
     <lb/>
     of language which is declared to be expedient 
     <lb/>
     amongst the Whole people of Canada, is that com<lb break="no"/>munity and harmony which prevails, according to 
     <lb/>
     the well known fable, between the lion and the 
     <lb/>
     lamb  the English is to swallow up the French 
     <lb/>
     and the French is to die, that the English may live 
     <lb/>
     and flourish upon it. That is the community which 
     <lb/>
     is to exist, the community of language which is 
     <lb/>
     expedient; the enactment allowing the use of French 
     <lb/>
     is to be expunged; therefore, it is the English 
     <lb/>
     language alone that is to be used. Now, Sir, when 
     <lb/>
     I read this preamble I confess myself to have been 
     <lb/>
     a little puzzled by the word "comity," whose 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. I think it is a mistake. I 
     <lb/>
     think in truth the word was "unity." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Mr. BLAKE</persName>. Well, I am very glad to hear it, 
     <lb/>
     because I was about to say that I did not perceive 
     <lb/>
     that the word "comity" had any reasonable 
     <lb/>
     application to this matter at all. We know what 
     <lb/>
     the meaning of that word is, and if ever an im<lb break="no"/>proper word could be chosen for the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's Bill, it certainly was the word "comity." 
     <lb/>
     But he now tells us, as I presumed, that what he in<lb break="no"/>tended by the phrase, was unity, and, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     it is in the interests of the national unity of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, that this result is to take place. 
     <lb/>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, in order to the advancement of 
     <lb/>
     our national unity, we must agree, if we adopt 
     <lb/>
     this preamble, that it is expedient, that we should 
     <lb/>
     take all possible steps which are open to us to pro<lb break="no"/>cure by legal and constitutional means the disallow<lb break="no"/>ance of the use of the French language where now 
     <lb/>
     it is allowed. That is clear, that is plain, that is 
     <lb/>
     obvious, that is logical. Was ever such a lame 
     <lb/>
     and impotent conclusion deduced from such impor<lb break="no"/>tant premises, if this question is to cease with 
     <lb/>
     this little enacting clause with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     North-West Territories  If that which it is expe<lb break="no"/>dient for the unity of the Canadian Dominion to 
     <lb/>
     abrogate is to be suffered to go on in this chamber, 
     <lb/>
     is to be suffered to go on in Canada, is to be suffered 
     <lb/>
     to go on in the important Province of Quebec, while 
     <lb/>
     our national unity is to be preserved, forsooth, 
     <lb/>
     by dealing with a few thousands who now inhabit 
     <lb/>
     the North-West Territories? No. These gentle<lb break="no"/>men represent a very grave condition of affairs. 
     <lb/>
     That is not their intention. We all know it is 
     <lb/>
     not the intention; it has been admitted not to be 
     <lb/>
     the intention at all; we cannot stop here; that 
     <lb/>
     would indeed be much cry and little wool. Nor 
     <lb/>
     does the hon. gentleman so pretend. In the speech 
     <lb/>
     with which he moved the first reading of this Bill 
     <lb/>
     he entered into a number of considerations which 
     <lb/>
     would have been but remotely relevant to the 
     <lb/>
     simple clause of the Bill itself. True he pointed out 
     <lb/>
     plainly enough, what was perfeclty obvious, that he 
     <lb/>
     was not at the moment proposing to do more than 
     <lb/>
     deal with the North-West Territories question. 
     <lb/>
     But, so far from making that further announcement, 
     <lb/>
     which he could not have honestly made, but which 
     <lb/>
     was made by the hon. member for North Norfolk 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Charlton) to-day, he said simply this. After 
     <lb/>
     speaking of the past and the present, he said: 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">            <p>
     "I have endeavored at all events to make good my

     the point where it is likely to cause further differences,

     It is a perfectly correct statement that this is all the 
     <lb/>
     legislation proposed by this clause  but the proposi<lb break="no"/>tion to which we are asked to assent, as the ground 
     <lb/>
     work of the legislation proposed, obliges us to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed by all lawful ways and means to secure, in the

     where certainly the contrary principle now prevails, 
     <lb/>
     is potent and effectual for good or for evil according

     to the diversities of opinions on this subject, potent 
     <lb/>
     and effectual to an infinitely greater extent than 
     <lb/>
     its application can be either now or for 50 years to

     come in the North-West Territories of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     But I say we are not confined to the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's preamble nor to his speech here. We find in

     called the Equal Rights Association statements 
     <lb/>
     which deal with this question, and which deal 
     <lb/>
     with it in a manner showing that he at all events 
     <lb/>
     does not shrink from the application of the motto 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills), 
     <lb/>
     cited last night, the motto "Thorough." The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), said we 
     <lb/>
     are not talking of interfering or proposing to inter<lb break="no"/>fere with the use of the French language, with read<lb break="no"/>ing, writing or speaking it. Nothing of that 
     <lb/>
     kind, he said, is talked or thought of  it is simply 
     <lb/>
     this question of using it in the North-West Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and, as the hon. gentleman repeated, this 
     <lb/>
     dreadful grievance of the statutes and ordinances 
     <lb/>
     being printed in the French language. But that 
     <lb/>
     is not the view of the hon. member for Simcoe. 
     <lb/>
     I find these statements in a speech delivered by him 
     <lb/>
     as late as 12th December last, within a few yards 
     <lb/>
     of this building. He said that Lord Durham had 
     <lb/>
     held first, and above all things, that the French 
     <lb/>
     language must be stamped out. And the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman gave his own personal opinion that 
     <lb/>
     Without a shadow of doubt Lord Durham was right. 
     <lb/>
     It is not, therefore, a question of an occasional 
     <lb/>
     French speech in Parliament which bores the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) and the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), or 
     <lb/>
     of their being troubled by the fact that copies of 
     <lb/>
     the Debates and of the statutes are printed in 
     <lb/>
     French, in a tongue with which they are not as 
     <lb/>
     familiar as with their mother tongue; but the 
     <lb/>
     language must be stamped out, says the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     proceeded: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     "Is there a shadow of doubt that between these two 
     <lb/>
     races, of all races in the world, if they are ever to be 
     <lb/>
     united, it must be by obliteration of one of these lan<lb break="no"/>guages and by the teaching in one of these tongues."

            </quote>
            <p>I should judge, I hope I am not mistaken, that the 
     <lb/>hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), 
     <lb/>does not mean that the English language should 
     <lb/>be obliterated; if so, it must be the French language. 
     <lb/>Then, the hon. member for North Simcoe drew 
     <lb/>upon his experience as a parliamentarian, and de<lb break="no"/>clared he had observed that more French was now 
     <lb/>spoken in the House than formerly, an observa<lb break="no"/>tion, I must confess, entirely at variance with my 
     <lb/>experience, which is somewhat longer in this 
     <lb/>House than that of the hon. gentlemen. I quite 
     <lb/>admit that the course which the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>and others have pursued, will very naturally lead 
     <lb/>to a larger quantity of French speaking in this 
     <lb/>House than has prevailed hitherto, but I do say 
     <lb/>there is nothing more marked, than the change 
     <lb/>which has taken place since I first entered Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, with respect to this question of French 
     <lb/>speaking. Then, the hon. member for North Simcoe 
     <lb/>proceeded to point out that our constitution is 
     <lb/>amendable in regard to the use of the French 
     <lb/>language in Quebec and in Canada, and he gave the 
     <lb/>precedents which showed the truth of that state<lb break="no"/>ment, that the constitution is amendable. And

     what did he go on to say! He went on to say that 
     <lb/>
     the precedents in that sense are very useful and 
     <lb/>
     may be acted on in the year 1890 or '91 in this con<lb break="no"/>nection. What! Are we going to relegate this 
     <lb/>
     matter to some distant age to be disposed of finally 
     <lb/>
     by the action of the French Canadians  when the 
     <lb/>
     leader (Mr. McCarthy) tells us that in 1890 or '91 
     <lb/>
     the precedents which prove the possibility of alter<lb break="no"/>ing the British North America Act, so as to ob<lb break="no"/>literate the use of the French language are useful 
     <lb/>
     and may become available forthwith? Then the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman stated that we ought not to remain 
     <lb/>
     in this position forever, and there should be suffi<lb break="no"/>cient patriotism in the Dominion to produce the 
     <lb/>
     change foreshadowed. Nor was his speech confined 
     <lb/>
     to the question of language, it touched creed as well; 
     <lb/>
     for I find him asking the people whom he was 
     <lb/>
     addressing, and through them the people of the 
     <lb/>
     whole Dominion, to give him power to eliminate 
     <lb/>
     those parts of the constitution which were inimical 
     <lb/>
     to the public weal  and he followed that state<lb break="no"/>ment by the question—indicating the parts of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution which he regarded as inimical to 
     <lb/>
     the public weal, and which he proposed that the 
     <lb/>
     people of the country should give him power to 
     <lb/>
     eliminate—

     McCarthy) would not adopt the line which the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) 
     <lb/>
     has adopted. I expected that, while he would 
     <lb/>
     perhaps leave rather in the background those 
     <lb/>
     other questions, he would say nothing which was 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent with his preceding utterances, nothing 
     <lb/>
     which would be likely to limit the effect of the 
     <lb/>
     preamble to which he asked the assent of the House  
     <lb/>
     nothing which would interfere with or check the 
     <lb/>
     triumphant march of his friends in pursuit of the 
     <lb/>
     great purpose which had been before developed, and 
     <lb/>
     which was further and fully developed in advance 
     <lb/>
     of the meeting of Parliament by the speech to 
     <lb/>
     which I have referred. This Bill, then, is only 
     <lb/>
     the opening of the campaign; and it lays down in 
     <lb/>
     itself, so far as the question of language is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, which is all it deals with, lines quite broad 
     <lb/>
     enough for the contemplated movement; and, I 
     <lb/>
     repeat, that its past and its present and its surroun<lb break="no"/>dings are all important elements; they indicate its 
     <lb/>
     future; and they entirely overshadow the little 
     <lb/>
     enacting clause. For those who, like the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, have spoken in that sense in this House, who 
     <lb/>
     believe that these things are essentially in the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the Dominion of Canada, there is, and I am 
     <lb/>
     not in the slightest degree complaining of it, there 
     <lb/>
     is for them but one course to pursue, the course of 
     <lb/>
     agitation. It is their right, nay more, it is their 
     <lb/>
     bounden duty, if their conscientious convictions 
     <lb/>
     be, and I am far from saying they are not so, that 
     <lb/>
     the condition of things in this whole Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     is such that its future prosperity and progress 
     <lb/>
     will be served and advanced by such an agitation 
     <lb/>
     as is necessary for the attainment of such results 
     <lb/>
     as are indicated, to enter upon and pursue that 
     <lb/>
     path of agitation. We may as we settle what 
     <lb/>
     it is that we are called upon to meet; what that 
     <lb/>
     condition of things is with which it is proposed 
     <lb/>
     
            
            <cb/>
            
     that we should deal. I say that that honesty 
     <lb/>
     of conviction which I freely accord to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), 
     <lb/>
     (and which I am bound to accord to him as 
     <lb/>
     to any public man), involves, as a necessary conse<lb break="no"/>quence, that he should prosecute the agitation up<lb break="no"/>on the lines he laid down on the 12th of December 
     <lb/>
     last and at other times, as the line of policy essen<lb break="no"/>tial to this Dominion. If it were otherwise, I can 
     <lb/>
     conceive no language strong enough for the denuncia<lb break="no"/>tion of his conduct in the utterance of these senti<lb break="no"/>ments. Now, Sir, for those of us who believe—I 
     <lb/>
     speak for myself only—but for myself and for any 
     <lb/>
     other person who happens to believe that in our 
     <lb/>
     existing conditions the objects aimed at are, 
     <lb/>
     by the means proposed, absolutely impossible 
     <lb/>
     of attainment  for those who believe that the agita<lb break="no"/>tion does, as to the Province of Quebec, not merely 
     <lb/>
     not present any element whatever of success, but 
     <lb/>
     destroys the least prospect of reform from that 
     <lb/>
     source from which alone the reforms which these 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen desire can be looked for, namely, 
     <lb/>
     from within, from the spontaneous action of the 
     <lb/>
     people themselves? for those who believe that 
     <lb/>
     it not merely does not improve, but that it 
     <lb/>
     tends to imperil the conditions of certain minori<lb break="no"/>ties of race and certain minorities in creed in 
     <lb/>
     different parts of the Dominion  that it excuses, if 
     <lb/>
     it does not absolutely justify, the combinations of 
     <lb/>
     populations on lines of race and creed which the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman so earnestly deprecated this after<lb break="no"/>noon  for those who believe that it tends to pro<lb break="no"/>duce and to intensify the greatest political evils 
     <lb/>
     which it is possible to conceive for Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     that it imperils the best hopes which remain to 
     <lb/>
     Canada; for me, Sir, who believe all these things, 
     <lb/>
     and for any others who may believe with me, there 
     <lb/>
     remains only the course of firm and uncompromis<lb break="no"/>ing opposition from the start, to the course of the 
     <lb/>
               hon. gentleman. "<hi rendition="simple:italic">Obsta principiis.</hi>" I decline to 
     <lb/>
     permit the thin end of the wedge to be inserted  
     <lb/>
     not with the guile which I might not unjustly 
     <lb/>
     attribute to the remarks of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Norfolk, nor yet with the hammer of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe, who has told us plainly 
     <lb/>
     the strokes he intends to give to that wedge and 
     <lb/>
     the vigor with which be intends with it to rift 
     <lb/>
     and cleave this Dominion. Now, Sir, I profess to 
     <lb/>
     be, and I hope I am a Reformer. I have never 
     <lb/>
     concealed my opinion; I have always at those 
     <lb/>
     times and places, and under those circumstances 
     <lb/>
     in which I thought I might do good by it, an<lb break="no"/>nounced the opinion that there are many things to 
     <lb/>
     be reformed in the different Provinces of this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, and many things to be reformed in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion as a whole. There are many things 
     <lb/>
     I should desire to see reformed in the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec as well as in other Provinces. But I know 
     <lb/>
     full well,—such little knowledge of history as I 
     <lb/>
     have acquired, such knowledge of human nature as 
     <lb/>
     fifty-six years have given me, have taught me that 
     <lb/>
     impertinent interference; still more that threats 
     <lb/>
     of coercive interference, and agitations to withdraw 
     <lb/>
     acquired and provincial rights are the very surest 
     <lb/>
     means to destroy the slightest vestige of hope of 
     <lb/>
     reform. They give to the resisting party incal<lb break="no"/>culable advantages. They enlist the sentiment of 
     <lb/>
     nationality, the sentiment of provincial autonomy, 
     <lb/>
     the feeling of outraged dignity and of insulted 
     <lb/>
     authority in opposition to the intruders. And 
     <lb/>
     under cover of these defences, resistance is easy and 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="679" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00679.jpg"/>

     its success is certain; while where the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     occurs aggressive action is but too likely to ensue. 
     <lb/>
     That is the condition of things, Sir, which I believe 
     <lb/>
     will be accomplished by the efforts that are now 
     <lb/>
     being made. I regard the prospect of reforms 
     <lb/>
     which I myself should desire to see accomplished 
     <lb/>
     in the Province of Quebec, as removed—I will 
     <lb/>
     not say to an incalculable but to a very long 
     <lb/>
     distance—by this agitation even so far as it has 
     <lb/>
     gone. I regard that prospect as absolutely 
     <lb/>
     vanished, should this agitation receive the sup<lb break="no"/>port and countenance to any considerable extent 
     <lb/>
     of this House and of the people of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     at large. No, Sir, the fullest and the frankest 
     <lb/>
     recognition of the provincial and covenanted rights  
     <lb/>
     the evidence which we shall give within the domain 
     <lb/>
     of our power in the various Provinces of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     of a generous and liberal consideration for those 
     <lb/>
     minorities which are under our control; combined 
     <lb/>
     with a sympathetic interest in the welfare of our 
     <lb/>
     neighbors give titles—just titles—to friendly sugges<lb break="no"/>tions to helpful advice, to legitimate influence. 
     <lb/>
     Nor have I despaired in the past; nor when this 
     <lb/>
     cloud passes away shall I despair in the future for 
     <lb/>
     the recognition of those titles. At any rate I am 
     <lb/>
     on the side of those who shall stand by those 
     <lb/>
     minorities who are, as I have pointed out, threat<lb break="no"/>ened and proposed to be coerced (by constitutional 
     <lb/>
     means I admit, but it is not the less threat and 
     <lb/>
     coercion, however constitutionally you may do it) 
     <lb/>
     by the policy the hon. member for North Simcoe 
     <lb/>
     has foreshadowed. I am on their side; and I 
     <lb/>
     believe that any other attitude is impotent for 
     <lb/>
     good, and powerful for evil to the state.

     <persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Mr. BLAKE</persName>. Mr. Speaker, we have heard some<lb break="no"/>thing to-day—of what I fear we shall hear more of 
     <lb/>
     in Canada for some time—of a union of race and a 
     <lb/>
     union of creed. This question is not unfamiliar to 
     <lb/>
     my ears. In days long one by I found myself, as 
     <lb/>
     my predecessor in the leadership of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party found himself, as my successor in that 
     <lb/>
     leadership, I dare say, may find himself, confronted 
     <lb/>
     with attempts to unite and consolidate in the ranks 
     <lb/>
     of one party those of one nationality, and to con<lb break="no"/>solidate in the ranks of one party those of one creed. 
     <lb/>
     This question is not new in Canada. Those 
     <lb/>
     attempts I met by no private bargain or 
     <lb/>
     intrigue; I met them by frank statements in 
     <lb/>
     this House and on public platforms of my 
     <lb/>
     views on the questions of race and creed, and of 
     <lb/>
     the rights and interests of minorities; I met them 
     <lb/>
     by on effort to convince those most particularly 
     <lb/>
     concerned that there were no real grounds for 
     <lb/>
     those attempts—attempts which I deprecated then, 
     <lb/>
     as I deprecate them now, as public calamities— 
     <lb/>
     and by the assurance that my fellow countrymen of 
     <lb/>
     all creeds and all races might differ and agree, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to their opinions on political topics, with abso<lb break="no"/>lute confidence as to the safety of the rights 
     <lb/>
     peculiar to themselves on questions of race and creed. 
     <lb/>
     That assurance, I believe I could well give  that 
     <lb/>
     assurance I hope this debate will enable us in 
     <lb/>
     Canada still to give  but largely on the issues of this 
     <lb/>
     debate does the question of that assurance turn. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     at all times and in all countries minorities are inclined 
     <lb/>
     to be susceptible, jealous, apprehensive, exacting— 
     <lb/>
     such is the condition of human nature. Those 
     <lb/>
     who are in minorities feel it; and those who happen 
     <lb/>
     to be in majorities, though they may complain of 
     <lb/>
     it, ought to understand it too. Minorities are 
     <lb/>
     apt to believe that they must unite in order to 
     <lb/>
     protect themselves against aggression; and such 
     <lb/>
     union amongst themselves, and such consequent 
     <lb/>
     isolation from their fellow-countrymen, is, wherever 
     <lb/>
     it occurs, and just in proportion to the extent of its 
     <lb/>
     occurrence, a serious danger to the state. But this is 
     <lb/>
     oftentimes excusable, and sometimes even justifiable  
     <lb/>
     and in the face of such attacks as those to which I 
     <lb/>
     referred this afternoon, I am not able in any strong 
     <lb/>
     language to condemn, although I do not intend to 
     <lb/>
     applaud, and although I still most earnestly depre<lb break="no"/>cate, any such attempt at union. I am speaking 
     <lb/>
     this day mainly in the hope to avert, if by any 
     <lb/>
     feeble effort of mine I can avert, the continued ex<lb break="no"/>istence of those apprehensions which might be a 
     <lb/>
     justification, or at any rate an excuse, for 
     <lb/>
     such union. Sir, in times of gloom and depression 
     <lb/>
     as to the future of my country—perhaps I am 
     <lb/>
     not an optimist, perhaps I have taken and may 
     <lb/>
     take now in many aspects a view too gloomy as 
     <lb/>
     to the condition and prospects of Canada, but in 
     <lb/>
     times in which I have felt gloom and depression 
     <lb/>
     as to the prospects and future of my country, as 
     <lb/>
     to its progress in several of the respects which are 
     <lb/>
     essential to the making of a nation, I have had in 
     <lb/>
     these latter years the consolation of believing that, 
     <lb/>
     in whatever other respects we might be stationary, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, even, I am ashamed to say, retrograde, 
     <lb/>
     in the respect at any rate of tolerance and 
     <lb/>
     regard to the rights and privileges and suscepti<lb break="no"/>bilities of minorities, we were moving on— 
     <lb/>
     slowly, steadily moving on— to a higher plane. 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="681" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00681.jpg"/>

     And that consolation was, to my mind, a very great 
     <lb/>
     one. But although I did so believe, as I shall still 
     <lb/>
     venture to entertain that hope, I knew well that 
     <lb/>
     all this time there were great masses of prejudice 
     <lb/>
     and suspicion, of ancient hates and misconceptions, 
     <lb/>
     and bitter memories of former conflicts, lying 
     <lb/>
     ready to the hand of the incendiary, easy to 
     <lb/>
     be kindled, difficult to be extinguished; and 
     <lb/>
     that the proportions of the conflagration which 
     <lb/>
     they might excite were impossible to be calcu<lb break="no"/>lated in advance. Sir, we have but just heard 
     <lb/>
     of an event we must all deeply deplore. The 
     <lb/>
     great institution, the crown and glory, I may 
     <lb/>
     be permitted to say, of the educational insti<lb break="no"/>tutions of our country, is at this moment in 
     <lb/>
     flames; and we know not how small a spark 
     <lb/>
     may have kindled the great fire which is con<lb break="no"/>suming that ornament to the whole community of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, the University of Toronto. That orna<lb break="no"/>ment, a great material ornament, and a still greater 
     <lb/>
     exhibition of the triumphs of the principles of 
     <lb/>
     toleration and of our advance in higher education, 
     <lb/>
     a university where we have gathered together the 
     <lb/>
     youth of all denominations, Protestant and Catholic, 
     <lb/>
     under the sanction even of the Catholic Church— 
     <lb/>
     a State institution on non-sectarian principles, 
     <lb/>
     where all were gathered together as fellow-subjects 
     <lb/>
     to acquire the highest training that the land afforded 
     <lb/>
     is now, so far as its material fabric goes, a ruin 
     <lb/>
     tottering to the ground. But great through the 
     <lb/>
    calamity, the material fabric may be replaced. Just 
     <lb/>as by that great calamity we may observe how 
     <lb/>small a spark may kindle a great fire, so let us take 
     <lb/>warning in this larger sphere, in the still greater 
     <lb/>matter upon which we are now engaged; and let 
     <lb/>those who are seeking to set the heather afire upon 
     <lb/>this question be careful before they proceed to 
     <lb/>precipitate a moral ruin which may be irreparable. 
     <lb/>Let them remember that it is utterly impossible to 
     <lb/>calculate the results of the issues and the passions 
     <lb/>they are raising. Sir, I knew not merely that there 
     <lb/>were questions of prejudice and of misconception, 
     <lb/>of passion and of bigotry, of ancient hate and 
     <lb/>ancient difficulties; but I knew more. I am not of 
     <lb/>those who take the optimistic view that in all 
     <lb/>respects our path is easier and smoother because of 
     <lb/>our peculiar conditions in Canada; I am not of 
     <lb/>those who believe that our path is made plainer and 
     <lb/>straighter by the circumstances of different nation<lb break="no"/>alities and of different creeds. I have recognised 
     <lb/>the fact that our situation, such as it is, presents 
     <lb/>problems of very considerable difficulty—perhaps 
     <lb/>problems of very considerable danger—and that 
     <lb/>we might have, if Providence had so ordered our 
     <lb/>lot that we were a homogeneous people, all of one race, 
     <lb/>one tongue, and one creed, an easier path, a plainer 
     <lb/>road in which to travel. I have recognised those 
     <lb/>difficulties with which we may have to grapple 
     <lb/>some day; though I hope, if we are to succeed, at 
     <lb/>some other time and in some different spirit and on 
     <lb/>some other lines than are proposed to-day. I knew 
     <lb/>that those real difficulties added great force and 
     <lb/>strength to the baser elements which form the 
     <lb/>greater part, after all, of the troubles with which 
     <lb/>we were and are encompassed  I knew the risk and 
     <lb/>the loss which was to be encountered in the Province 
     <lb/>which I may call an English and Protestant Pro<lb break="no"/>vince—the province of Ontario—by acting for those 
     <lb/>whom we served on the path on which we were then 
     <lb/>travelling  and we encountered it deliberately at 
     <lb/>that time. Nor shall we, I hope shrink from it to-<lb break="yes"/>
           
            <cb/>
           day. The right will triumph in the end. There is an 
     <lb/>
     old proverb in the language which my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
               would prescribe  "<hi rendition="simple:italic">Tout casse, tout lasse, tout 
     <lb/>
     passe;</hi>" and even this storm, this agitation, though 
     <lb/>
     its proportions may be as great as my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend expects and perhaps justly expects, will 
     <lb/>
     pass away; With serious consequences may be to 
     <lb/>
     those who are engaged in the contest, but it 
     <lb/>
     will pass away in the end; and what is right and 
     <lb/>
     true will in the end prevail, though some of us 
     <lb/>
     may fall in the struggle. On what conditions, 
     <lb/>
     circumstanced as we are, can we live and thrive 
     <lb/>
     and grow in Canada? Certainly not on the lines 
     <lb/>
     which are being laid down by those engaged in 
     <lb/>
     this agitation. I would ask them to put them<lb break="no"/>selves in the French Canadian's place. You may 
     <lb/>
     selfishly wish that he had agreed to be suppressed  
     <lb/>
     you may have a profound conviction of the incom<lb break="no"/>parable superiority of your tongue, your laws, 
     <lb/>
     your creed  you may earnestly desire for all men 
     <lb/>
     the inestimable boons of British birth, of English 
     <lb/>
     speech, of Protestant religion. But still, after all, 
     <lb/>
     cannot you put yourself in his place? And can you 
     <lb/>
     not, must you not, admire the courage, the fidelity, 
     <lb/>
     and the determination with which, at great odds, 
     <lb/>
     he fought in all fields—in the legislature, before the 
     <lb/>
     people, and in even sterner fields than these—for 
     <lb/>
     what to him was as dear as what you call your 
     <lb/>
     birthright is to you? Fought, aye, and conquered 
     <lb/>
     too! Cannot you recognise that his was after all a 
     <lb/>
     victory for humanity? And that if, as the case is, it 
     <lb/>
     has imposed greater difficulties and more arduous 
     <lb/>
     efforts and toils on those who are engaged in making 
     <lb/>
     a nation of Canada, it yet, by that very circums<lb break="no"/>tance, gave the chance for more exalted triumphs, 
     <lb/>
     gave an opening for the exhibition of still higher 
     <lb/>
     and deeper and broader feelings of justice and 
     <lb/>
     liberality and tolerance than are permitted to a 
     <lb/>
     wholly homogeneous people? Can you not at least 
     <lb/>
     see—if that much you cannot see—-that he has in fact 
     <lb/>
     conquered? Do you seriously hope to prevail to<lb break="no"/>day in a conflict in which, under infinitely greater 
     <lb/>
     disadvantages, he obtained the victory long ago? 
     <lb/>
     Surely if it were a conquest in which he was in the 
     <lb/>
     wrong, you have the right to struggle still  but his 
     <lb/>
     victory after all was for equal rights—rights equal 
     <lb/>
     with your own. That is all he asked  that is all he 
     <lb/>
     got. But you say  No; his language must be 
     <lb/>
     obliterated; it is inimical to the Constitution that 
     <lb/>
     it should continue; you must teach him your 
     <lb/>
     tongue; he must forget his own; he must not have 
     <lb/>
     what he regards——and, from his point of view, 
     <lb/>
     rightly regards—as equal rights with you, the 
     <lb/>
     Anglo-Saxon, of whom the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) spoke so proudly this after<lb break="no"/>noon as destined by fate to swallow him up. Sir, I 
     <lb/>
     regard this larger question to which I have referred, 
     <lb/>
     and it is the meal question we have to consider, as 
     <lb/>
     a settled question  and even were my views as to 
     <lb/>
     the settlement different from what they are, I 
     <lb/>
     would not consent, as a public man, to an attempt 
     <lb/>
     to reopen a controversy, long since closed, on 
     <lb/>
     grounds which do not give to my eye the least pros<lb break="no"/>pect of success, but which ensure ultimate defeat to 
     <lb/>
     the assailants, and meanwhile limitless disaster to 
     <lb/>
     the state. I say: No; a thousand times, no! Whether 
     <lb/>
     you differ or agree as to what might have been best 
     <lb/>
     for the country, in the situation of the country as it 
     <lb/>
     stands, I say: No, a thousand times, no; to the least 
     <lb/>
     effort or proposal to reopen that settled contro<lb break="no"/>versy  and I maintain that it is the duty of those 
     <lb/>

     who truly regard the progress and the prosperity 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, who hope to see it advance in its path 
     <lb/>
     towards nationality, to defend the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     minorities in this regard, as by law and by conven<lb break="no"/>tion and by national settlement established. I 
     <lb/>
     intend for my part to defend them just as warmly 
     <lb/>
     as if I were one of themselves; and I should regard 
     <lb/>
     myself as dishonored and disgraced if I were now 
     <lb/>
     to yield to the forces which press me to any other 
     <lb/>
     course. It is not difficult to drive most of us, 
     <lb/>
    perhaps—it is certainly not difficult to drive the 
     <lb/>humble individual who addresses you from his 
     <lb/>place in this Parliament; but I hope it is impossible 
     <lb/>to drive me, as long as I occupy that place, from 
     <lb/>the path of duty and of honor, which I believe 
     <lb/>to be the path which I have chalked out in the 
     <lb/>words I have now spoken. To this Bill, under 
     <lb/>these circumstances, I should record an unhesi<lb break="no"/>tating negative, if that were the question pre<lb break="no"/>sented immediately to the House. I do not 
     <lb/>desire to enlarge upon the lessons of history, 
     <lb/>of which we have heard much in this debate  
     <lb/>but I wish to call your attention to two very recent 
     <lb/>formal, and to my mind, solemn expressions of opi<lb break="no"/>nion, expressions of British opinion, of the opinions 
     <lb/>of the English Government upon questions closely 
     <lb/>allied to this. You remember the long and compli<lb break="no"/>cated and difficult controversy with reference to 
     <lb/>Schleswig-Holstein. In 1860, the English Govern<lb break="no"/>ment proposed to Denmark to allow Schleswig, 
     <lb/>one of the duchies, independently to decide upon 
     <lb/>the language to be used where the Danish people 
     <lb/>prevailed, where the Germans prevailed, and where 
     <lb/>the races were mixed. That was the character of 
     <lb/>the dispatch, that the community itself should 
     <lb/>decide, and that regard should be had to the 
     <lb/>various languages of the populations, thus giving 
     <lb/>a plain indication at that comparatively recent 
     <lb/>date, of the view of the British Government, 
     <lb/>under the Secretariat for foreign affairs of Lord 
     <lb/>John Russell, in regard to that question. 
     <lb/>in 1862 and 1863, unhappy, broken-down, disin<lb break="no"/>tegrated and enslaved Poland, regarded by the 
     <lb/>great powers as no longer possessing the capa<lb break="no"/>cities for an independent state, but as a people 
     <lb/>under the thrall of Russia, had broken out 
     <lb/>once again into insurrection, under the pressure 
     <lb/>of some fresh severities of its Russian masters  
     <lb/>and three of the great powers of Europe agreed 
     <lb/>together to, remonstrate with Russia as to its 
     <lb/>course towards the Poles—I can hardly say 
     <lb/>towards Poland, but towards the Poles. Who 
     <lb/>were they  Great Britain, France and Austria. 
     <lb/>They remonstrated with Russia. Russia asked 
     <lb/>them to formulate the points upon which they sug<lb break="no"/>gested her lines of policy towards Poland should 
     <lb/>proceed. Those three powers formulated, by 
     <lb/>conjoint action, six points, and one of the six 
     <lb/>points on which they recommended to Russia 
     <lb/>action towards Poland, circumstanced as Poland 
     <lb/>was, and so late as the year 1863, was the use of 
     <lb/>the Polish language in the public offices and in the 
     <lb/>law courts. That was the advice given by Great 
     <lb/>Britain, France and Austria to Russia, interfering 
     <lb/>with its course towards its own subjects, who had 
     <lb/>been handed over to it by a proceeding which no 
     <lb/>one can read without condemning, but handed over 
     <lb/>and having become, so to speak, its property long 
     <lb/>before. And, at that late date, the recommend<lb break="no"/>ation was that the step taken should be reversed, 
     <lb/>that the abrogation of the right to use their own 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     language should be withdrawn, and that the Poles 
     <lb/>
     should have the right to use their own language 
     <lb/>
     in the courts and the public offices. I do not 
     <lb/>
     deny, as I have already said, our difficulties in 
     <lb/>
     this country. I repeat that those difficulties are 
     <lb/>
     serious; and I hope that those of us who now act 
     <lb/>
     on the lines which I have been suggesting will be 
     <lb/>
    recognised as having earned in proper time and 
     <lb/>proper place, the right to be listened to with favor<lb break="no"/>able ears in case we do tender proper advice as to 
     <lb/>what we believe, in the true interests of minorities, 
     <lb/>and in the true interest of Canada, should be done 
     <lb/>in regard to these difficult and delicate questions. 
     <lb/>I hope also that our attitude may not be mistaken 
     <lb/>by either friend or foe, either by those we serve or 
     <lb/>those we oppose, by the minorities in whose cause we 
     <lb/>are prepared to stand up or by the majoritiese whom 
     <lb/>many of us represent, as being that of an un<lb break="no"/>worthy truckling to either race or creed. I should 
     <lb/>like to ask what have the majority of the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of Ontario constituencies to gain by adopting 
     <lb/>the course which I have chalked out for myself  
     <lb/>Let others speak for themselves. I know that the 
     <lb/>only gain I can have for myself is risk and loss. No<lb break="no"/>thing but that. We shall then claim our right to 
     <lb/>speak firmly and frankly on all fit occasions and on 
     <lb/>all burning questions, and we shall ask the consider<lb break="no"/>ation which we are now granting. Having said so 
     <lb/>much, I ask how should this Bill, brought forward 
     <lb/>in the frame which it has assumed, with the pream<lb break="no"/>ble by which it is prefaced, with the speech in which 
     <lb/>it was introduced, with the speeches by which out 
     <lb/>of doors it was heralded, having regard to the 
     <lb/>movement of which I have said it is the first fruits— 
     <lb/>how should this Bill be met? I am prepared to meet 
     <lb/>such a Bill, so introduced, so framed, so prefaced, 
     <lb/>with an uncompromising negative. But it has 
     <lb/>seemed to be the temper of the House to meet it 
     <lb/>with some substantive declaration. I shall not 
     <lb/>object to that; but for myself I am not fully satis<lb break="no"/>fied with either of the declarations which have 
     <lb/>been proposed. I am of opinion that, if we do 
     <lb/>formulate a declaration, it should contain a dis<lb break="no"/>tinct and unequivocal repudiation of the principle 
     <lb/>of the preamble of this Bill, and should vindicate 
     <lb/>the ground on which we stand, as to the question 
     <lb/>raised by the enacting clause. In these respects 
     <lb/>and also because I am not prepared for myself to 
     <lb/>affirm all the language contained in the second 
     <lb/>amendment,— for example the statement that the 
     <lb/>enactment would put in doubt the stability of our 
     <lb/>institutions—I think that amendment is not 
     <lb/>wholly applicable to the situation; nor do I think 
     <lb/>the first amendment is what we require either. I 
     <lb/>think there is apart from the suggestions of policy, no 
     <lb/>present grievance of any account. The money ques<lb break="no"/>tion is absolutely nothing. The amount is trifling, 
     <lb/>and this Parliament pays it  and the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>who proposes the Bill (Mr. McCarthy) has cheerfully 
     <lb/>voted for and supported the payment of hundreds 
     <lb/>of thousands of dollars—I might say millions—of 
     <lb/>expenditure much less defensible than the $400 or 
     <lb/>$500 a year which are expended to convey to the 
     <lb/>French people of the North-West, few as they may 
     <lb/>be, a knowledge of the ordinances of the country 
     <lb/>in which they live. Now, Sir, what is the condi<lb break="no"/>tion of our country with respect to the North-West? 
     <lb/>We have spent many scores of millions mainly 
     <lb/>in connection with the North-West. Our crying 
     <lb/>need there to-day is, and will for a long time be, 
     <lb/>settlement, the influx of hardy and frugal cultiva<lb break="no"/>

     bled to-day partly to meet that demand. Her farms 
     <lb/>
     have fallen in price; and that fall, very notably in 
     <lb/>
     the eastern section of the Province, is partly due to 
     <lb/>
     the altered conditions of supply and demand, partly 
     <lb/>
     also due, no doubt, to unfavorable seasons, partly 
     <lb/>
     due to low prices, due to a combination of circums<lb break="no"/>tances, in which however, the North-West is a large 
     <lb/>
     factor. I say that fall would have been very much 
     <lb/>
     more marked than it is to-day, if it had not been for 
     <lb/>
     that influx of French Canadian settlers into the east, 
     <lb/>
     which this agitation seems almost designed to pre<lb break="no"/>vent, which certainly is regarded as no unmixed 
     <lb/>
     blessing by those who are engaged in the agitation, 
     <lb/>
     so far as the Province of Ontario is concerned. For 
     <lb/>
     my own part, I take ground altogether different 
     <lb/>
     from those gentlemen on that subject; I heartily 
     <lb/>
     welcome our French fellow-countrymen who prefer 
     <lb/>
     Ontario to the States. I hope they will continue 
     <lb/>
     to prefer it; I hope that they will come in, just as 
     <lb/>
     many of them as have come in, and buy our farms 
     <lb/>
     from those who want to sell them, and who will 
     <lb/>
     not complain, however much other people may 
     <lb/>
     create grievances in another Province, if they get a 
     <lb/>
     better price than they otherwise might by reason 
     <lb/>
     of altered conditions in the law of supply and 
     <lb/>
     demand. I say that while Ontario is being bled at 
     <lb/>
     this moment and in this way, the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec is being bled too, not so much by migration 
     <lb/>
     to the North-West  but she is being bled mainly to 
     <lb/>
     the entire loss of Canada, and to the profit of the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring Republic. I think the most important 
     <lb/>
     object to which we can practically address our<lb break="no"/>selves, is the diversion of that emigration to the 
     <lb/>
     States to migration to the North-West Territories. 
     <lb/>
     I do not hope myself for any substantial measure of 
     <lb/>
     success whatever from projects of repatriation. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the French Canadian whom you let go to 
     <lb/>
     the States, and who settles there, you have practi<lb break="no"/>cally lost forever. There may be cases of return, but, 
     <lb/>
     speaking in the large, such, I regret to say, is my 
     <lb/>
     belief of the result. Nor can I say that I entertain 
     <lb/>
     any very high or sanguine hopes, judging by ex<lb break="no"/>perience, of Quebec migration on a large scale 
     <lb/>
     to the North-West. But still there is in that 
     <lb/>
     respect a hope, there ought to be a hope. 
     <lb/>
     If it is the case that we are unable to persuade 
     <lb/>
     our own people from the Province of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     agriculturists, to move to those fertile plains of 
     <lb/>
     which my hon. friend from North Norfolk gave such 
     <lb/>
     a glowing description, if it is the case that we are 
     <lb/>
     unable to persuade them to move there, and that 
     <lb/>
     they still prefer the Eastern or the Western States 
     <lb/>
     to Canada, then how can we hope for any great im<lb break="no"/>migration from abroad? I say that we ought to 
     <lb/>
     address ourselves to that problem to which I have 
     <lb/>
     referred, in an earnest, an active, an energetic 
     <lb/>
     manner. But I conceive that the temper and 
     <lb/>
     spirit displayed in this Parliament and displayed 
     <lb/>
     in the North-West itself in this matter, may be very 
     <lb/>
     important factors as to the success of any such effort. 
     <lb/>
     I decline to abandon the hope of considerable immi<lb break="no"/>gration. I believe that if the people of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories will consider of the matter, if 
     <lb/>
     those few thousands of souls who are scattered, 
     <lb/>
     specks hardly discernible, through that vast terri<lb break="no"/>tory, will but realise the fact that industrious, 
     <lb/>
     hardy, frugal, economical, cultivators of the soil 
     <lb/>
     are leaving old Canada, not for new Canada, but 
     <lb/>
     for the States, they will hold out their arms, they 
     <lb/>
     will welcome warmly those whom we might induce 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     to go out there. Are you going to induce them to 
     <lb/>
     do so by such proposals as this? I am for trying out 
     <lb/>
     the experiment; I am for continuing every induce<lb break="no"/>ment, the sentimental inducement if you please, 
     <lb/>
     as well as other inducements, until that experiment 
     <lb/>
     is fully and fairly tried out. In face of this agita<lb break="no"/>tion to which I have, all through what I have 
     <lb/>
     said, alluded, as the main and important, the 
     <lb/>
     overshadowing feature of this discussion, I should 
     <lb/>
     regard the immediate adoption of a proposal to 
     <lb/>
     expunge such little use of the French tongue as is 
     <lb/>
     now provided for, as fatal to whatever prospect 
     <lb/>
     there may be of an increasing or of a continuing 
     <lb/>
     French migration to the North-West. I say that 
     <lb/>
     the future will indicate to us the solution of this 
     <lb/>
     question, and that it should be reserved until the 
     <lb/>
     future speaks and gives us that indication. I 
     <lb/>
     agree with something that has been said by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Norfolk as to the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-West. They are, so far as their 
     <lb/>
     rights, their constitutional rights are concerned, 
     <lb/>
     in a transition condition. They have not asked, 
     <lb/>
     they feel themselves that they are not yet in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to claim the full measure of provincial rights. 
     <lb/>
     It would be entirely premature so to deal with these 
     <lb/>
     enormous areas of fertile territory in the present 
     <lb/>
     conditions of settlement and of occupation, and to 
     <lb/>
     turn them into Provinces. All sides are agreed on 
     <lb/>
     that. The people of the locality, but also the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada, are deeply interested in the 
     <lb/>
     policy to be pursued in the North-West. Canada 
     <lb/>
     has, in truth, if you consider the enormous areas 
     <lb/>
     that she has to settle, the enormous expenditure she 
     <lb/>
     has made and is making—she has, in truth, the main 
     <lb/>
     interest, an interest far surpassing that of the few 
     <lb/>
     people who are now there. But fortunately for old 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and fortunately for those people, it is a 
     <lb/>
     common interest. There is not the slightest diver<lb break="no"/>gence of <choice><sic>inte est</sic><corr>interest</corr></choice>. There may be differences of opinion 
     <lb/>
     as to what are the best means of advancing that 
     <lb/>
     interest, but the interests are one and the same; the 
     <lb/>
     prosperity of the North-West is the one interest of 
     <lb/>
     both; and the proper step to take in order to advance 
     <lb/>
     that prosperity is the question submitted to both  
     <lb/>
     and upon that question the Parliament of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     in the present condition of the North-West and of 
     <lb/>
     the people of that country, must speak; I will not 
     <lb/>
     say with a despotic voice, I will not at all say with a 
     <lb/>
     voice regardless of the opinion of the Territories, 
     <lb/>
     but still at this moment, having the responsibility, 
     <lb/>
     with a decisive and potential voice. Now, under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances, I say, we should meet the 
     <lb/>
     question when it comes. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has suggested that we have heard the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the North-West. I should have great, though 
     <lb/>
     not absolutely decisive regard to that expression 
     <lb/>
     deliberately and constitutionally reached, but I deny 
     <lb/>
     that we have yet heard it. The North-West Assem<lb break="no"/>bly had no commission or authority from this Par<lb break="no"/>liament, its creators, to deal with this question at 
     <lb/>
      all  and the electors to that assembly had not be<lb break="no"/>fore them, when the assembly was elected, any 
     <lb/>proposition upon this subject. So, neither was 
     <lb/>there an authority in the body, nor was there a 
     <lb/>mandate from the constituency. It may be, it is 
     <lb/>quite possible, that even upon a full and calm consi<lb break="no"/>deration, after the interval of time which is to elapse 
     <lb/>between now and the next appeal to the people, it 
     <lb/>may be that there may be a very strong expression 
     <lb/>of opinion there, as to what is for their interests;  
     <lb/>but in the meantime it is not to be entirely forgotten 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="687" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00687.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">688</fw>
          
     that the condition is only this, that the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada votes out of Canadian resources a trifling 
     <lb/>
     sum annually for the payment of the printing in 
     <lb/>
     the two languages of their ordinances; and that 
     <lb/>
     if they choose to elect a Frenchman to the as<lb break="no"/>sembly, that Frenchman has what, I am afraid, 
     <lb/>
     would be a very barren privilege, the right 
     <lb/>
     of expressing his sentiments in that assembly, in 
     <lb/>
     what, to the majority of them, I am afraid, would 
     <lb/>
     be something like an unknown tongue. There is 
     <lb/>
     the condition of things. No particular grievance, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, now exists, and the condition upon which 
     <lb/>
     you are to deal with the question is to be settled, 
     <lb/>
     as I have said, in the future. If, when you have 
     <lb/>
     tried the experiment, if when you have used all 
     <lb/>
     fair exertions, if when you have given all fair 
     <lb/>
     inducements, you still find that country is, even 
     <lb/>
     to the extent to which it now is proportionately, an 
     <lb/>
     English country, why the question will settle 
     <lb/>
     itself. If, what I would rejoice to see in the face 
     <lb/>
     of all that has been said in my Province and else<lb break="no"/>where, there should be a large immigration of 
     <lb/>
     Frenchmen to the North-West, and that settle<lb break="no"/>ment should be mixed, the condition might be 
     <lb/>
     practically the same. If that settlement were, what 
     <lb/>
     I would not prefer myself, isolated, it might create 
     <lb/>
     a condition of things demanding different treat<lb break="no"/>ment. Let us deal with it when the condition 
     <lb/>
     arises and as the condition exists; and when we 
     <lb/>
     do deal with it, let us deal with it, not associated 
     <lb/>
     with the efforts which have been made, the ap<lb break="no"/>prehensions which have been raised, the hostili<lb break="no"/>ties which have been excited by the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     of which this Bill is the first outcome, but entirely 
     <lb/>
     dissociated from all these, having meantime finally 
     <lb/>
     and altogether settled, as far as the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament of Canada can settle, the other questions, 
     <lb/>
     the greater questions, the more important ques<lb break="no"/>tions in regard to which this Bill seems to be but a 
     <lb/>
     sort of pilot balloon. Sir, I have endeavored to set 
     <lb/>
     forth in the draft of an amendment such a form of 
     <lb/>
     words as, without at all being wedded to that 
     <lb/>
     precise form, seems to me to indicate the most 
     <lb/>
    appropriate solution of this question, and, if the 
     <lb/>opportunity is offered to me in the course of this dis<lb break="no"/>cussion, by any process, I shall take leave to submit 
     <lb/>that proposition to the chamber; and in order that 
     <lb/>hon. members may know what the proposition 
     <lb/>which I at all events would very respectfully submit

     hon. gentleman has disapproved very strongly of 
     <lb/>
     the use of the plural pronoun, I will venture to 
     <lb/>
     make use of it in addressing him for a moment and 
     <lb/>
     in saying that we on this side of the House are 
     <lb/>
     delighted to see the hon. gentleman in his place 
     <lb/>
     once more and able so vigorously to take part in the 
     <lb/>
     discussions in this chamber. I will not for one 
     <lb/>
     moment dream of attempting to follow the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman through the brilliant periods of the 
     <lb/>
     carefully prepared oration which he has delivered 
     <lb/>
     to this House. I would not dream of doing so 
     <lb/>
     in any case, besides I would leave the matter 
     <lb/>
     naturally to the hon. gentleman beside me (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy). But, Sir, I will say that while the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman was addressing us and while 
     <lb/>
     I admired those glowing periods in which he 
     <lb/>
     advocated a broad-minded and liberal policy 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, I could not help asking myself if 
     <lb/>
     it was possible the hon. gentleman was not aware 
     <lb/>
     that his own conduct was largely responsible for 
     <lb/>
     the agitation and for the fear in the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario which had given rise to this agitation 
     <lb/>
     which he condems. I could not help asking myself 
     <lb/>
     whether the hon. gentleman was not aware that the 
     <lb/>
     course which he had pursued in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     Riel agitation had warned the people of Ontario of 
     <lb/>
     the danger in which they stood and had led them to 
     <lb/>
     believe, rightly or wrongly, that the power of 
     <lb/>
     French Canada was so great that even Edward 
     <lb/>
     Blake had succumbed to its influence, had gone back 
     <lb/>
     on all the record of his past life, had forgotten his 
     <lb/>
     pledge, yet warm from his lips that he would not 
     <lb/>
     attempt to build up a political party on the scaffold 
     <lb/>
     of Regina, had forgotten the blood of his own fel<lb break="no"/>low-countrymen on the plains of the North-West, 
     <lb/>
     and had joined hands with the Parti National. That 
     <lb/>
     party which without his support would have 
     <lb/>
     withered and died almost in the hour in which it 
     <lb/>
     was born, that party which is responsible to-day for 
     <lb/>
     all the trouble that is upon us at this moment. I 
     <lb/>
     could not help also asking myself if the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who had addressed us in such eloquent terms 
     <lb/>
     had also forgotten, or was it possible that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who told us that this preamble of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill was the all-important part of the Bill, was the 
     <lb/>
     same gentleman who voted last Parliament that 
     <lb/>
     the preamble of a Bill had nothing whatever to do 
     <lb/>
     with it, or was it due to his approval of that pre<lb break="no"/>amble that he so voted. I do not wish to press 
     <lb/>
     this matter further, but I will say that these 
     <lb/>
     considerations presented themselves to my mind.

     further, but I was going to turn to another matter.

     I hope I have not in any way annoyed hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite. I think I have the right to express

     we have not even the right of free discussion I do

     much struck during the course of this debate with 
     <lb/>
     one or two of its features. One of them is that 
     <lb/>
     there seems to be a very strong reluctance, I do 
     <lb/>
     not say on the part of the hon. gentleman who has 
     <lb/>
     just addressed the House, but on the part of most of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentlemen who have opposed this Bill, to 
     <lb/>
     meet this issue squarely, and to say whether or not 
     <lb/>
     they desired to maintain a dual language in the 
     <lb/>
     North-West Territories, in the teeth of the 
     <lb/>
     almost unanimous wish of the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the people there. Another feature of this debate 
     <lb/>
     which has struck me is this, that hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     or some of those who have spoken at least, desire 
     <lb/>
     not so much to discuss this Bill as it is, or to discuss 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the Bill, or whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     dual language should be maintained officially in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West, but rather to discuss some other 
     <lb/>
     question as to whether our French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     friends are to have the right to speak their own 
     <lb/>
     language at all in the North-West and through<lb break="no"/>out the length and breadth of this Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     There is another feature of this debate which has 
     <lb/>
     impressed me a good deal, and that is, that there is 
     <lb/>
     a tendency, in some quarters, to impute narrow-<lb break="yes"/>mindedness and a want of liberality to those who 
     <lb/>
     think that to impose the dual language by statutory 
     <lb/>
     enactment upon the people of those vast regions, 
     <lb/>
     which we call the North-West, would not be to the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of Canada. The speech of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Bothwell (Mr. Mills) struck me as somewhat 
     <lb/>
     of an illustration of the first two of these features 
     <lb/>
     of this debate. The hon. gentleman, if he will allow 
     <lb/>
     me to say so, made us a most able and a most 
     <lb/>
     interesting address; but I listened to that speech 
     <lb/>
     for considerably over an hour without being able 
     <lb/>
     to discover whether the hon. gentleman was or 
     <lb/>
     was not in favor of continuing the dual language 
     <lb/>
     officially in the North-West. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     certainly pitched into my hon. friend beside me (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy) most unmercifully, as did several other 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, and unless my hon. friend from Simcoe 
     <lb/>
     has the hide of a rhinoceros, or half a dozen of 
     <lb/>
     them, he must, by this time, one would 
     <lb/>
     think, be pretty sore. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Bothwell told us that if one language only was 
     <lb/>
     to be the language of Canada, that could not be 
     <lb/>
     the English language, but that it must be a sort of 
     <lb/>
     hybrid between the English and the French. I 
     <lb/>
     thought when he made that statement that he was 
     <lb/>
     not complimentary to my friend, the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Public Works, who had just been addressing us in 
     <lb/>
     very forcible English indeed. I thought he had 
     <lb/>
     not been complimentary to my hon. friend, the 
     <lb/>
     leader of his own party, whose charming 
     <lb/>
     En lish will, I venture to say, live in the literature 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. The hon. gentleman naturally over<lb break="no"/>looks these facts, because they are facts. He has 
     <lb/>
     also overlooked the fact that although High<lb break="no"/>landers of Scotland speak the English language 
     <lb/>
     they speak pure English  he overlooked the fact 
     <lb/>
     that although almost all the rising generation 
     <lb/>
     of Wales speak English, they do not speak a 
     <lb/>
     hybrid between Welsh and English. He also over<lb break="no"/>looked the fact that although the people in the 
     <lb/>
     counties of Ireland, where there has been an 
     <lb/>
     admixture of race, speak English, that that 
     <lb/>
     English is not a mixture of Erse and English, but 
     <lb/>
     is pure English. The hon. gentleman overlooked 
     <lb/>
     these facts; but I do not suppose we need be much 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     surprised at that, for we all know that when my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend gets on what I may call a burst of pure 
     <lb/>
     theoretical, political, philosophy, such ordinary 
     <lb/>
     common place things as mere matters of notorious 
     <lb/>
     fact are altogether beneath his notice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). The hon. gentleman is 
     <lb/>
    depending on his imagination now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCNE1">Mr. MCNEILL</persName>. The hon. gentleman is simply 
     <lb/>
     stating facts which my hon. friend from Bothwell 
     <lb/>
     never can appreciate. I may say further that I 
     <lb/>
     thought the hon. gentleman paid rather a left-<lb break="yes"/>handed compliment to our French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     friends, when out of all the characters portrayed by 
     <lb/>
     Shakespeare he selected as the mouth-piece of the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians on this occasion the rapacious, 
     <lb/>
     the extortionate, and the relentless Shylock. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend gave us a very interesting discourse 
     <lb/>
     upon the law of forces. He handled the subject 
     <lb/>
     admirably, and he told us that if a number of forces 
     <lb/>
     were acting upon a given body at a given time, 
     <lb/>
     that body would be impelled in the direction of 
     <lb/>
     the resultant of these forces. I see my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     nods his head and agrees to that statement. He 
     <lb/>
     told us that that law applied to mental as well as 
     <lb/>
     to physical force, and he was happy enough to illus<lb break="no"/>trate the fact himself, because he showed us that 
     <lb/>
     the forces then acting on his own mind impelled 
     <lb/>
     him to make a perfect circle round the subject 
     <lb/>
     under discussion and carefully to avoid touching it 
     <lb/>
     at all. In reference to the third feature of this 
     <lb/>
     discussion, namely, the tendency to impute illiber<lb break="no"/>ality to those who think that the dual official 
     <lb/>
     language should not be maintained in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. For my own part, I wish to state 
     <lb/>
     that I shall express my conscientious convictions 
     <lb/>
     on this question regardless of any such imputations. 
     <lb/>
     While in many things I do not agree with my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend beside me (Mr. McCarthy) yet I agree with 
     <lb/>
     the proposition he lays down, when he says that a 
     <lb/>
     country inhabited by one homogeneous people, 
     <lb/>
     speaking one language, is stronger and more stable 
     <lb/>
     than the same country would be if it were inhabit<lb break="no"/>ed by an equal population composed of the original 
     <lb/>
     races which together went to make up that homo<lb break="no"/>geneous people  each one of them speaking its 
     <lb/>
     own separate language, maintaining its own laws 
     <lb/>
     and customs and preserving its own individuality. 
     <lb/>
     I venture to say that there are few people who will 
     <lb/>
     controvert that assertion. Let us take the Austrian 
     <lb/>
     Empire for example. What is the notorious cause 
     <lb/>
     of the weakness of the Austrian Empire? It is 
     <lb/>
     the fact that there is no distinctive nationality in 
     <lb/>
     Austria; it is the fact that Austria consists of a 
     <lb/>
     conglomeration, or rather I should say of a bundle 
     <lb/>
     of distinct peoples, each of them preserving their 
     <lb/>
     own nationality, their own manners and customs  
     <lb/>
     and as Professor Freeman says held together only by 
     <lb/>
     the fact that certain marriages, and wars, and 
     <lb/>
     treaties, and so forth, have given them a common 
     <lb/>
     sovereign. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have been astonished to hear the example of 
     <lb/>
     Austria held up as one which could be placed in 
     <lb/>
     opposition to the view of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Simcoe. What does M. Louis Leger say in 
     <lb/>
     his late work with regard to Austria, a work of 
     <lb/>
     which Prof. Freeman, in his preface, expresses the 
     <lb/>
     highest admiration? He says:

     Sir, it is notorious, as I say, that those words re<lb break="no"/>present the sentiment of the Highlanders of Scot<lb break="no"/>land, as maintained for very many generations, 
     <lb/>
     and that it is only within comparatively recent 
     <lb/>
     days that that unfortunate feeling of distrust and 
     <lb/>
     dislike between these races has died away  
     <lb/>
     and I venture to say that anyone who knows the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances of that country is prepared to 
     <lb/>
     endorse what I say when I assert that nothing 
     <lb/>
     has more contributed to that better and 
     <lb/>
     happier condition of things which now exists 
     <lb/>
     than the more general use of the English 
     <lb/>
     language in the Highlands of Scotland. Take 
     <lb/>
     the case of France. Will anyone say that if 
     <lb/>
     France today were not inhabited by the great and 
     <lb/>
     homogeneous people that she has, but were in<lb break="no"/>habited by the Celts and Gallo-Romans, Iberians, 
     <lb/>
     Franks and Norsemen—each preserving their own 
     <lb/>
     institutions, usages and individuality, and speak<lb break="no"/>ing their own language, she could be the great and 
     <lb/>
     powerful and stable nation she is to-day? And so 
     <lb/>
     I believe that here in Canada, if our races were 
     <lb/>
     amalgamated, we should be stronger than we are 
     <lb/>
     at the present moment. We all know that our 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian friends have many qualities 
     <lb/>
     characteristic of their race, great and good quali<lb break="no"/>ties, which are not characteristic of the race to 
     <lb/>
     which we belong  and I think we may say, on the 
     <lb/>
     other hand, that we have good qualities character<lb break="no"/>istic of our race which are not so highly developed 
     <lb/>
     
           
            <cb/>
          
     in theirs; and I think we may fairly conclude that 
     <lb/>
     if there were a blending of the races, that blend<lb break="no"/>ing would be beneficial to both  but in any case it 
     <lb/>
     cannot be doubted that it would add to the 
     <lb/>
     solidarity of the Dominion. Then, I think, there 
     <lb/>
     can be no question of the correctness of the assertion 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friend, that this perpetuation of different 
     <lb/>
     languages has a tendency to keep races apart and 
     <lb/>
     to preserve and maintain race distinctions; and 
     <lb/>
               the other proposition, the reverse of that—though 
     <lb/>
     I cannot go so far as some of the quotations which 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend read taken by themselves would 
     <lb/>
     seem to go—appears to me to be perfectly cor<lb break="no"/>rect also, that the use of one language is a 
     <lb/>
     wonderful solvent of race distinctions. It further 
     <lb/>
     seems to me to be self-evident, that the enforcing 
     <lb/>
     by statutory enactment, so far as statutory enact<lb break="no"/>ment can enforce it, the use of distinct languages 
     <lb/>
     has a tendency to perpetuate a plurality of lan<lb break="no"/>guages, and to prevent the advance throughout the 
     <lb/>
     population of any one of those languages which has 
     <lb/>
     a natural tendency to become dominant. Now, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     all these propositions I believe to be true and unas<lb break="no"/>sailable; but I hope no hon. gentleman in this 
     <lb/>
     House, whether he be amongst my French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian friends or amongst my English-speaking 
     <lb/>
     friends, will for one moment suppose that because 
     <lb/>
     I hold these propositions to be true, I also believe 
     <lb/>
     that the dual language should not have been per<lb break="no"/>mitted in Canada. I entertain no such opinion, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker. In dealing practically with this 
     <lb/>
     question, we have not to consider principles in the 
     <lb/>
     abstract, but facts as they are. A well known 
     <lb/>
     writer, speaking of the great Edmund Burke, said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     And I venture to think that it would be well if 
     <lb/>
     that rooted conviction of the greatest political 
     <lb/>
     thinker Britain ever produced, was also the rooted 
     <lb/>
     conviction of some of our theoretical political 
     <lb/>
     philosophers of the nineteenth century. It no 
     <lb/>
     more follows that because we think it would be 
     <lb/>
     to the advantage of Canada that we should have 
     <lb/>
     one homogeneous race here, that because we think 
     <lb/>
     that our races would more speedily become homo<lb break="no"/>geneous if one language only were used, we would 
     <lb/>
     be justified in attempting, even if we had the 
     <lb/>
    power, to stamp out one of these lang<lb break="no"/>uages, than it follows that one of these 
     <lb/>races would be justified in exterminating 
     <lb/>the other. I would ask if there is any man in this 
     <lb/>Chamber who would say that when Canada passed 
     <lb/>under the aegis of liberty-loving England, the use 
     <lb/>of their mother tongue should have been denied to 
     <lb/>the gallant defenders of their soil. Is there any 
     <lb/>man who will say that on the day when Montcalm 
     <lb/>fell on the Plains of Abraham there should have 
     <lb/>passed away forever from his compatriots the 
     <lb/>right to the freest and fullest use of that tongue 
     <lb/>which they had learned at their mother's knee, 
     <lb/>which is interwoven with the very threads of 
     <lb/>life, which is inseparably connected with every 
     <lb/>joy and sorrow, with every emotion, with every 
     <lb/>thought, from infancy to the grave  I venture to 
     <lb/>say that no one will say so, and I venture to say 
     <lb/>that any such treatment of the vanquished would 
     <lb/>have been un-English and unjust, would have 
     <lb/>been tyrannical and cruel. I will go further and

     <lb/>
     their own language in their courts of law and in 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Assembly of their Province. In 
     <lb/>
     treating of this matter, we must not be so much 
     <lb/>
     impressed by considerations of abstract principles 
     <lb/>
     as by facts as they exist and by the lessons of 
     <lb/>
     history, and while it would have been well for 
     <lb/>
     England if the Celts of the west had amalgamated 
     <lb/>
     with the rest of the population as the Celts in 
     <lb/>
     Cornwall and Devonshire did, and while it would 
     <lb/>
     have been well for Scotland if the Celts in the 
     <lb/>
     North had amalgamated with the Saxons in the 
     <lb/>
     plains as the Celts in England have done, still 
     <lb/>
     we must remember that notwithstanding the fact 
     <lb/>
     that they did not amalgamate and have not 
     <lb/>
     amalgamated up to this day, England has grown 
     <lb/>
     to be great and prosperous as no country of a 
     <lb/>
     like area has ever grown before; and Queen 
     <lb/>
     Victoria today has not throughout her broad 
     <lb/>
     Empire more devoted and loyal subjects than are 
     <lb/>
     to be found in Wales. And while it is true that 
     <lb/>
     it would have added to the strength of Scotland 
     <lb/>
     if the Celts of the Highlands had joined hand in 
     <lb/>
     hand with their brethern on the plains, yet, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding the fact that they did not do so,   
     <lb/>
     Scotland for many a long century preserved her 
     <lb/>
     independence and held her own; and when at 
     <lb/>
     length the kingdoms were merged into one, that 
     <lb/>
     result came about, not as a consideration of 
     <lb/>
     abstract principles alone would have led us to 
     <lb/>
     believe it would have come about, by the conquest 
     <lb/>
     of the weaker country by the stronger, but it came 
     <lb/>
     about by the fact that the far weaker country 
     <lb/>
     gave a king to her great and powerful southern 
     <lb/>
     neighbor from her own royal House of Stuart  
     <lb/>
     and to-day when any British general wishes to get 
     <lb/>
     a body of picked men for any service of special diffi<lb break="no"/>culty and danger, these very plaided warriors of 
     <lb/>
     the North, who were so often led by men like 
     <lb/>
     the typical Rhoderick Dhu against the Saxon, are 
     <lb/>
     amongst the most highly prized of all those most 
     <lb/>
     famous regiments whose splendid deeds of valor, 
     <lb/>
     and prowess, have shed a lustre on the British arms. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, I say, that although we have two races 
     <lb/>
     living side by side here in Canada, I for one am 
     <lb/>
     not doubtful of the result. Let no man fear for the 
     <lb/>
     future of Canada. Mighty and glorious that future 
     <lb/>
     must be, notwithstanding that there may be per<lb break="no"/>haps a poor pitiful handful of traitors within, and 
     <lb/>
     that there are certainly swarms of jealous rivals 
     <lb/>
     without. For my part I wish we had no race dis<lb break="no"/>tinctions, I wish we were all one united homo<lb break="no"/>geneous people, I wish the terms French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     and British Canadian were only to be found in the 
     <lb/>
     pages of history, and that from the North to the 
     <lb/>
     South and from ocean to ocean, the simple word 
     <lb/>
     Canadian were the one and only term that could 
     <lb/>
     appropriately be applied to the citizen of this 
     <lb/>
     broad Dominion. But, Sir, such a result as that, 
     <lb/>
     if it is to be brought about at all, can only come 
     <lb/>
     about by the flux of time and by the cultiva<lb break="no"/>tion of feelings of mutual respect, mutual forbear<lb break="no"/>ance, and mutual good-will. I wish to say this, 
     <lb/>
     however, that the forbearance must not be all 
     <lb/>
     on one side. We must remember that part of the 
     <lb/>
     trouble is this, that in the Province of Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     and, I believe, in other parts of Canada to-day, the 
     <lb/>
     impression is that the forbearance has been pretty 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     much all on one side. For my part I will say here 
     <lb/>
     in my place in Parliament what I said to my own 
     <lb/>
     constituents on the 12th July last, that the man 
     <lb/>
     who would for party purposes or for paltry per<lb break="no"/>sonal motives endeavor to sow the seeds of dissen<lb break="no"/>sion between our French Canadian friends and the 
     <lb/>
     British-speaking people of Canada is unworthy to 
     <lb/>
     represent any constituency in this Dominion, and 
     <lb/>
     that he might more properly, in the well known 
     <lb/>
               words of the poet Hood:—<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p rendition="simple:centre">"Sit for hell and represent the devil."

     Sir, we have our race distinctions, and it is our 
     <lb/>
     duty to make the best of them. Unfortunately the 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary movement which was inaugurated 
     <lb/>
     some time ago in the Province of Quebec, and which 
     <lb/>
     was promoted so largely by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     West Ontario (Mr. Edgar), and which culminated in 
     <lb/>
               the formation of a party whose <hi rendition="simple:italic">raison d'étre</hi> is only 
     <lb/>
     that it is the French as against the English party, 
     <lb/>
     has rendered the making the best of our race 
     <lb/>
     distinctions very much more difficult than it 
     <lb/>
     otherwise would have been. That is a propo<lb break="no"/>sition which perhaps may be taken exception 
     <lb/>
     to. But when the people of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario see the Premier of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ostentatiously put himself at the head of 
     <lb/>
     this anti-British party in the Province of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
               they, I think, naturally come to the conclusion— 
     <lb/>
     whether it is right or not is another question— 
     <lb/>
     that this anti-British party represents the senti<lb break="no"/>ments of the people of the Province of Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     that the sentiment of the people of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec is hostile to British interests. I do not 
     <lb/>
     myself believe that that is a fair view of the 
     <lb/>
     situation, because we know—those of us who are 
     <lb/>
     in this House know—or many of us believe—I may 
     <lb/>
     say we know that the Parti National does not re<lb break="no"/>present united Quebec at all events. We know 
     <lb/>
     that our French Canadian friends sitting on this 
     <lb/>
               side of this House are opposed to the Parti Na<lb break="no"/>tional, and I believe—my hon. friend will contra<lb break="no"/>dict me if I am wrong—that the organ of the party 
     <lb/>
               of which he is the distinguished leader, <hi rendition="simple:italic">La Patrie</hi>, 
     <lb/>
     denounces the Parti National. If, then, we have 
     <lb/>
     our friends on this side opposed to the Parti Na<lb break="no"/>tional and those hon. gentlemen opposite who repre<lb break="no"/>sent the great Liberal Party of the Province, also 
     <lb/>
     opposed to it, I think the sentiment of the Province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec cannot fairly be taken to be hostile to 
     <lb/>
     British interests, but the existence of that Parti Na<lb break="no"/>tional produces that impression in Ontario. I was 
     <lb/>
     very much pleased to hear the hon. member for Belle<lb break="no"/>chasse (Mr. Amyot), who occupies such a promi<lb break="no"/>nent position in that party—if I may be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     allude in passing to a previous debate—aver from 
     <lb/>
     his place in this House in the most solemn terms, 
     <lb/>
     in the most distinct and emphatic terms, that he 
     <lb/>
     and those acting with him were not actuated by any 
     <lb/>
               anti-British feeling whatever; that he and his com<lb break="no"/>patriots recognised to the fullest extent the benefi<lb break="no"/>cencethat was—the word he used—the beneficence 
     <lb/>
     of British rule in Canada. And I was glad to hear him 
     <lb/>
     aver that, without any reservation, they admitted 
     <lb/>
     that they were treated with fair play, with justice 
     <lb/>
     and with generosity. I was delighted when I 
     <lb/>
     heard the hon. member make that speech, and I 
     <lb/>
     was so moved by it that I was almost inclined to 
     <lb/>
     cross the floor of the House and renew to him my 
     <lb/>
     supplication that he would allow his name to be 
     <lb/>
     enrolled as a member of the Imperial Federation 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="695" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-14_Page_00695.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">696</fw>
          
     League  but I thought I would wait till the con<lb break="no"/>clusion of the debate, when I was satisfied, from 
     <lb/>
     what my hon. friend said, that I would capture the 
     <lb/>
               whole Parti National <hi rendition="simple:italic">en bloc</hi>. But I warn my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend the leader of the Government, 
     <lb/>
     who is not here at present, but I warn him through 
     <lb/>
     the members of the Cabinet who are here, that when 
     <lb/>
     that day arrives and I get the silver-tongued 
     <lb/>
     member for Quebec East (Mr. Laurier) to become 
     <lb/>
     a member of the Federation League, my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend will have to keep a sharp eye on me lest I 
     <lb/>
     fall a victim to the magic of my hon. friend oppo<lb break="no"/>site. As I have said we must try to make the 
     <lb/>
     best of our race differences. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     said he had the fullest confidence in British fair 
     <lb/>
     play, British justice and British generosity, and I 
     <lb/>
     say he and his compatriots may have the fullest 
     <lb/>
     confidence in British fair play, justice and generos<lb break="no"/>ity. The British people in Canada and in the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country are as ready to mete out fair play, 
     <lb/>
     justice and generosity to-day as they have been in 
     <lb/>
     the past, and they will be in the future as they are 
     <lb/>
     to-day. That is my conviction. Because for my 
     <lb/>
     part, I will never believe that our French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     friends can be prevailed upon either by agitator 
     <lb/>
     or demagogue so far to do violence to the generous 
     <lb/>
     and chivalrous impulses which are so characteristic 
     <lb/>
     of their race, as to endeavor to convert those pri<lb break="no"/>vileges which have been so lavishly conferred 
     <lb/>
     upon them iato a weapon to wound the hand that 
     <lb/>
     bestowed the boon. Therefore, I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     that any attempt will ever be made to interfere 
     <lb/>
     with those privileges. It is right that they 
     <lb/>
     should look with jealousy at any attempt to 
     <lb/>
     interfere with the constitutional privileges which 
     <lb/>
     have been conferred upon them, but, for my part— 
     <lb/>
     it may be my blindness—I cannot see how the 
     <lb/>
     proposal which is now before us will interfere with 
     <lb/>
     them. I am not speaking of the preamble of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, I am speaking of the Bill itself. I take the 
     <lb/>
     position which was taken by the 188 last session, 
     <lb/>
     and I assume that the preamble is not an essential 
     <lb/>
     part of the Bill. I say the question with which we 
     <lb/>
     are now face to face is not one of interfering with 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional privileges of our French Cana<lb break="no"/>dian friends. It is rather a question whether we 
     <lb/>
     should continue to interfere with the natural pri<lb break="no"/>vileges of the British people in the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territories, who have, by the voice of their Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Assembly, asked us to relieve them of a 
     <lb/>
     burden which this House has imposed upon them. 
     <lb/>
     When they had no Legislative Assembly, this 
     <lb/>
     House, with the strong hand and in the exercise of 
     <lb/>
     its right, no doubt, if not of its wisdom, decreed 
     <lb/>
     that there should be dual language in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. At that time we had at least 
     <lb/>
     this excuse for what we did, that we had no 
     <lb/>
     authoritative information that what we did would 
     <lb/>
     be distasteful to the majority of the people 
     <lb/>
     there. Now we have the fact that the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Assembly, which we felt bound to call 
     <lb/>
     into existence, has, by a practically unanim<lb break="no"/>ous vote, asked us to relieve them of the 
     <lb/>
     burden which we cast upon them. They say that 
     <lb/>
     they regard this as a burden, they say that they 
     <lb/>
     do not require dual language in the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territories, they say that they regard it as burden<lb break="no"/>some and vexatious, and they ask us to remove 
     <lb/>
     the incubus which we have cast upon them. I do 
     <lb/>
     not see for my part how we can refuse to accede to 
     <lb/>
     their request. It is perfectly useless, to my mind, to 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
            
     place against the almost unanimous vote of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Assembly of the North-West petitions 
     <lb/>
     such as have been presented to this House, more 
     <lb/>
     especially when we know that the opinion expressed 
     <lb/>
     by the Legislative Assembly is endorsed by every 
     <lb/>
     organ of public opinion in the North-West. Per<lb break="no"/>haps my hon. friend (Mr. Davin), who edits the 
     <lb/>
               Regina <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi>, and who, I see, is not in his place, 
     <lb/>
     has not endorsed it. Well, I listened to my hon. 
     <lb/>
               friend reading a long article from the Regina <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> 
     <lb/>
               the other day, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> did not venture 
     <lb/>
     to controvert in any way the statement that 
     <lb/>
     this was the opinion of the people there. It is quite 
     <lb/>
     true that if there were a large French population in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West Territories, the precedents which 
     <lb/>
     have been adduced by the hon. member for West 
     <lb/>
     Durham, might have some force. What were 
     <lb/>
     they? One was that it had been recommended by 
     <lb/>
     the British Parliament that the people of certain 
     <lb/>
     countries in Europe should be left to decide for 
     <lb/>
     themselves whether they should have a dual 
     <lb/>
     language, or a plurality of languages, or what 
     <lb/>
     language they should have as their official language. 
     <lb/>
     Well, the people of the North-West have told us 
     <lb/>
     their wishes  and if he does not give effect to their 
     <lb/>
     expressed opinion upon this subject, he is going back 
     <lb/>
     upon this precedent which he has brought before 
     <lb/>
     the House. And what was the other? It was 
     <lb/>
     with reference to Poland, and the question was 
     <lb/>
     whether the Poles should be allowed fuller use 
     <lb/>
     of their own language in their own country. 
     <lb/>
     What in the world has that got to do with this 
     <lb/>
     question? If the North-West was a French settle<lb break="no"/>ment, if there was an overwhelming majority of 
     <lb/>
     our French Canadian friends in the North-West, 
     <lb/>
     these two precedents which have been brought 
     <lb/>
     forward by the hon. gentleman would have some 
     <lb/>
     bearing. But I venture to say—and I hope that 
     <lb/>
     he will not think me impertinent in saying so; I 
     <lb/>
     suppose, insignificant as I am, I have a right to my 
     <lb/>
     opinion on the question--but in my opinion, at least, 
     <lb/>
     his precedents have no bearing upon the question at 
     <lb/>
     all, but are rather an argument infavor of the conten<lb break="no"/>tion that the people of the North-West ought to de<lb break="no"/>cide this question, and that the opinion of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the North-West ought to be taken as conclusive 
     <lb/>
     on this question. Now, if there were a large number 
     <lb/>
     of our French Canadian friends in that country, even 
     <lb/>
     though they were not in a majority, I think it 
     <lb/>
     might be reasonable that we shoud stay our hands. 
     <lb/>
     But I want to ask, is there not some limit to this?  
     <lb/>
     Suppose there was only one French Canadian in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West, and a hundred thousand British 
     <lb/>
     people; should we be called upon to establish a 
     <lb/>
     dual language in the North-West Territories, or to 
     <lb/>
     maintain it there? Well, then, it is a question of 
     <lb/>
     degree. The question is, whether there is such a 
     <lb/>
     population of our French Canadian friends there as 
     <lb/>
     to require the use of this official dual language, such 
     <lb/>
     a population as would make it worth our while to 
     <lb/>
     go right in the teeth of the almost unanimously ex<lb break="no"/>pressed wish of the representatives of the people. It is 
     <lb/>
     strange Liberal doctrine, at all events, I think. Now, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, if the people of the North-West were seeking 
     <lb/>
     to inflict any hardship upon our French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     friends the case would be different. But they are 
     <lb/>
     not asking anything of the kind. They are simply 
     <lb/>
     asking us not to impose upon them this dual 
     <lb/>
     official language, and when we remember that 
     <lb/>
     every single member of that Legislative Assem<lb break="no"/>bly is an English-speaking person, and that the 
     <lb/>

     French language is to him a foreign tongue, it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that the request is a very reasonable 
     <lb/>
     one. Mr. Speaker, I would be most unwilling 
     <lb/>
     in any way to do violence to the sentiments of my 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian friends; I would be as unwilling 
     <lb/>
     to do so as I am sure they would be unwilling to 
     <lb/>
     do violence to my sentiments. I would even be 
     <lb/>
     willing to go some length in deference to their pre<lb break="no"/>judices, as I believe they would be willing to go 
     <lb/>
     some length to meet my prejudices. But though 
     <lb/>
     I am prepared to go a long way for peace and 
     <lb/>
     friendship, even for the attainment of such objects 
     <lb/>
     as these, I am not prepared to go as far as to betray 
     <lb/>
     the people of my own flesh and blood; I am not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to go so far as to say that I will ignore 
     <lb/>
     the voice of the Legislature which we ourselves 
     <lb/>
     have felt it our duty to establish there. I would 
     <lb/>
     consider that I was doing them a gross injustice, 
     <lb/>
     and I shall endeavor, for my part, to mete out to 
     <lb/>
     them the same measure of justice that I would 
     <lb/>
     hope to have meted out to myself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SUTH1">Mr. SUTHERLAND</persName>. I do not think I would 
     <lb/>
     have attempted to address the House upon this 
     <lb/>
     question, had it not been for the remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member who has just taken his seat (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McNeill). I think it was a very inopportune time 
     <lb/>
     for the hon. member to make the attack he did on 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from West Durham (Mr. Blake), 
     <lb/>
     just after the able, patriotic and broad-minded 
     <lb/>
     speech that he had made, showing that he was 
     <lb/>
     able to rise above party and express in a patriotic 
     <lb/>
     manner the views he held. I regret that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman should have taken this opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     make such a wild charge against the character 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friend from West Durham, although he 
     <lb/>
     requires no defence at my hand, either in this 
     <lb/>
     House or in the country. Sir, the position that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend took upon the Reil question only 
     <lb/>
     entitled him, I think, to still greater credit before 
     <lb/>
     this House and the people of Canada. To my mind 
     <lb/>
     he had everything to lose from a political point 
     <lb/>
     of view, and nothing to gain, from the position he 
     <lb/>
     took on that question  and although I did not vote 
     <lb/>
     with him, although he was my leader, whom I 
     <lb/>
     respected and admired then as I do at the present 
     <lb/>
     time, I exercised my humble judgment according 
     <lb/>
     to the best of my ability, nor did that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man ever complain of the position that I took at 
     <lb/>
     that time. I think, Sir, that it is to be regretted 
     <lb/>
     that this question has come before the House at 
     <lb/>
     all, considering the course the discussion has 
     <lb/>
     taken. The discussion has taken a wide range, 
     <lb/>
     and many matters have been referred to that are 
     <lb/>
     likely to raise bad feeling throughout the country, 
     <lb/>
     not only between people of different nationalities, 
     <lb/>
     but between those professing different religious 
     <lb/>
     creeds  and this has been attributed to the speeches 
     <lb/>
     made by my hon. friend from North Simcoe (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy) on other occasions outside of the House, 
     <lb/>
     as well as to the remarks he made on the introduction 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill. I must also say, Mr. Speaker, that I 
     <lb/>
     think that the heated and passionate address of the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Public Works last night is very much 
     <lb/>
     to be regretted. I do not think that hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     was at all justified in making the remarks he did 
     <lb/>
     on this particular question. Had the hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     any ground for the attack he made upon the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Province of Ontario that they were intolerant 
     <lb/>
     towards their fellow-countrymen in Quebec, and 
     <lb/>
     the French-speaking people of this country? The 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     hon. gentleman must have forgotten that at the 
     <lb/>
     present time in this House the most ultra-British 
     <lb/>
     and ultra-Protestant representatives in the cham<lb break="no"/>ber have chosen for their leader a French-speaking 
     <lb/>
    Catholic who, by his conduct in this House, and 
     <lb/>by his great ability, has endeared himself not only 
     <lb/>to the members on this side, who are proud of him 
     <lb/>as their leader, but I may say to every member on 
     <lb/>the other side of the House as well  a gentleman 
     <lb/>whose patriotism is well known, who has on several 
     <lb/>occasions taken a broad-minded and liberal view of 
     <lb/>questions, in opposition to what we know to be 
     <lb/>the sentiments, easily aroused, of his race in the 
     <lb/>Province of Quebec, which he represents here. 
     <lb/>That being the case, I think it is to be regretted 
     <lb/>that the Minister of Public Works should have 
     <lb/>made the passionate appeal he did and have 
     <lb/>attacked the people of Ontario, and have appealed 
     <lb/>to his French Canadian friends irrespective of 
     <lb/>party to stand by him on the present occasion. In 
     <lb/>my humble opinion he did not consider that the 
     <lb/>constitutional rights of the people of Quebec were 
     <lb/>being attacked at the present time, or that there 
     <lb/>was any danger whatever to him or to his party or 
     <lb/>his nationality or the creed of the people whom he 
     <lb/>represents. It is only fair, after the attack made 
     <lb/>by the hon. member who has taken his seat, 
     <lb/>giving as his reason why this agitation has been 
     <lb/>carried on throughout Ontario, that I should thus 
     <lb/>express my opinion. In my humble judgment, I 
     <lb/>may say to my French Canadian friends on 
     <lb/>both sides of the House, that I do not think 
     <lb/>there is any particular danger to their constitu<lb break="no"/>tional rights or their civil or religious liberties. 
     <lb/>If I were to express my true feelings on this mat<lb break="no"/>ter I would say that, judging by the articles in the 
     <lb/>press which support the Dominion Government, 
     <lb/>judging by the resolutions passed at party meetings 
     <lb/>throughout Ontario, there is no particular fault 
     <lb/>found with the action of this House or with this 
     <lb/>Government, for the newspapers and the party 
     <lb/>with whom the hon. Minister works in harmony 
     <lb/>do not find fault with the leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and hold him and his colleagues responsible 
     <lb/>for this agitation, but all the blame is cast upon 
     <lb/>Mr. Mowat and the Ontario Government. Does 
     <lb/>not the Minister of Public Works know that the 
     <lb/>only charge brought forward in Ontario against 
     <lb/>the Government of that Province and the only 
     <lb/>charge brought by the Conservative party, with 
     <lb/>whom he works so well, is that Mr. Mowat is 
     <lb/>allowing French to be taught in the public schools 
     <lb/>in some parts of Ontario, and that he has been 
     <lb/>truckling to the Catholic Church  These are the 
     <lb/>charges made, and I am sure when the elections take 
     <lb/>place a few months hence that will be the last we 
     <lb/>will hear about this, which appears to be at present 
     <lb/>a very important and serious question, so far 
     <lb/>as many of the Conservatives in Ontario are con<lb break="no"/>cerned. No doubt my hon. friend, the Minister 
     <lb/>of Public Works will find time, instead of offer<lb break="no"/>ing, as he told us, prayers on sacred ground 
     <lb/>in Quebec for the souls of his forefathers, to 
     <lb/>send missionaries to stir up the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians to vote against the Mowat Government, 
     <lb/>as he has done in the past. I am informed that only 
     <lb/>a few months ago he sent one of his missionaries 
     <lb/>to assist a in bye-election and to endeavor to stir up 
     <lb/>the feelings of the French and Irish Catholics against 
     <lb/>that Government. I have as much right, and a 
     <lb/>great deal more right, to offer this as a cause of the 
     <lb/>

     agitation in Ontario, as had the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who last addressed the House to lay an unjustifi<lb break="no"/>able charge against the hon. gentleman for West 
     <lb/>
     Durham (Mr. Blake). If those charges had not 
     <lb/>
     been made I would not have addressed the House 
     <lb/>
     on this question. Although I admire very much, and 
     <lb/>
     I am sure every member of this House and every 
     <lb/>
     true Canadian must admire the broad and patriotic 
     <lb/>
     speech of the member for West Durham, of whom I 
     <lb/>
     am a great admirer and follower, I cannot agree with 
     <lb/>
     him on the main question before the House at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. I believe, and it is my honest judgment, 
     <lb/>
     although I may be wrong, that, as in the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territory there are so few French-speaking people, 
     <lb/>
     and still fewer, if the information I have received 
     <lb/>
     is correct, who read French, it would be better not 
     <lb/>
     to have a dual language in that country at the 
     <lb/>
     present time.  While I differ from the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, I am sure he will give me credit for 
     <lb/>
     honesty of judgment in dealing with this subject. 
     <lb/>
     While not committing myself to vote for the Bill 
     <lb/>
     before the House I candidly express my view on 
     <lb/>
     this question and I believe also the view of my 
     <lb/>
     constituents. I may say to the Minister of Public 
     <lb/>
     Works, who has just entered the Chamber, that 
     <lb/>
     I do not think he was justified in making 
     <lb/>
     the attack he did upon us. It is not within my 
     <lb/>
     recollection that in the Province of Ontario any 
     <lb/>
     Catholic or any number of Catholics have been 
     <lb/>
     treated with intolerance or their worship interfered 
     <lb/>
     with in any respect whatever, with the one or two 
     <lb/>
     exceptions which are so frequently referred to, and 
     <lb/>
     in those cases there was no interference with wor<lb break="no"/>ship. It is true that in Toronto, where feeling 
     <lb/>
     runs high, when there were large demonstrations 
     <lb/>
     on one, two or three occasions, rows have been 
     <lb/>
     stirred up and little conflicts have taken place  
     <lb/>
     but at no place, and certainly not in the riding 
     <lb/>
     which I represent, where there is a very large Pro<lb break="no"/>testant majority, have the hon. gentleman's co<lb break="no"/>religionists failed to enjoy the greatest possible 
     <lb/>
     liberty to worship God in any way they pleased, 
     <lb/>
     and in my riding they have been assisted, as every 
     <lb/>
     Catholic throughout that section will bear witness, 
     <lb/>
     very materially by their Protestant neighbors. I 
     <lb/>
     repeat that the insinuations made in the speech of 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Public Works were very unjustifi<lb break="no"/>able, and his appeal to his fellow Canadians, irres<lb break="no"/>pective of party, to stand by him on this occasion, 
     <lb/>
     was simply an attempt to pull wool over their 
     <lb/>
     eyes, for he knew that if there was any agitation 
     <lb/>
     in Ontario, if there was any intolerance in regard 
     <lb/>
     to this question, it was owing to the action of his 
     <lb/>
     own political friends for whom he had not a word 
     <lb/>
     of condemnation, although, they are the party which 
     <lb/>
     is opposing the action of the Liberal Government 
     <lb/>
     in allowing French to be taught in the schools, and 
     <lb/>
     indeed the hon. gentleman seemed to be perfectly 
     <lb/>
     satisfied to receive the support of those who were 
     <lb/>
     carrying on this agitation in Ontario.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">MR. DAVIES</persName> (P.E.I.) Before these items pass, 
     <lb/>
     I would call the attention of the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance and of the House, to what I consider has 
     <lb/>
     been a gross misuse of the vote of this House 
     <lb/>
     in this connection last year. In the Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General's Report for 1888-1889 I find that this 
     <lb/>
     House, after consideration and consultation, 
     <lb/>
     voted a sum of $5,338 for the stationery of the 
     <lb/>
               Senate. That amounted to about the same <hi rendition="simple:italic">per 
     <lb/>
     capita</hi> as was voted for our stationery here. I 
     <lb/>
     find, however, that these gentlemen of the Senate, 
     <lb/>
     instead of spending the sum we voted, spent 
     <lb/>
     $12,412.88. This is a matter which requires a 
     <lb/>
     good deal of explanation. It is perfectly useless 
     <lb/>
     for us to attempt to limit the expenditure, if we 
     <lb/>
     vote four or five thousand dollars for a particular 
     <lb/>
     department or branch of the Legislature, and they 
     <lb/>
     spend ten or twelve thousand dollars. When I 
     <lb/>
     take up the details of that expenditure I find that 
     <lb/>
     they are not such as would commend them to our 
     <lb/>
     serious judgment. Among the items I find 99 
     <lb/>
     thermometers, from which I would suppose that each 
     <lb/>
     gentleman in the Senate requires a thermometer to 
     <lb/>
     test the temperature of the chamber for himself.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. DAVIES</persName> (P. E. I.) No  it would not even 
     <lb/>
     keep him warm. Then I find among the items 
     <lb/>
     several barometers, 12 tourists' cases at $127 (I 
     <lb/>
     suppose some of them intended to make a journey 
     <lb/>
     in the summer), 22 writing cases, stationery 
     <lb/>
     cabinets, writing desks, deed boxes, despatch boxes, 
     <lb/>
     pocket diaries, letter cases, and a lot of other things 
     <lb/>
     which at first sight do not appear to be at all 
     <lb/>
     necessary. The principle which I wish to call 
     <lb/>
     attention to is the disregard aid to the control 
     <lb/>
     which this Chamber should exercise on the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of public money. When we vote 
     <lb/>
     $5,800 and they spend $12,000 it is a flagrant dis<lb break="no"/>regard of the wishes of this Chamber, which is 
     <lb/>
     supposed to control the expenditure of the public 
     <lb/>
     money. I think the Minister should give some 
     <lb/>
     explanation of this extraordinary expenditure 
     <lb/>
     above the vote.
