            <p><persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Taking into the view all the<lb/>circumstances, I believe this item is second<lb/>in importance to no other that can be found<lb/>in the estimates this year. The main part<lb/>of the item which relates to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories is equivalent to the cash<lb/>subsidies paid to the various provinces<lb/>under the federal constitution. For a con<lb break="no"/>siderable time past the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories have been looking forward<lb/>to the formation of that country into pro<lb break="no"/>vince or provinces. I took the occasion during<lb/>my first session in this House last year to<lb/>call the attention of parliament at some<lb/>length to some phases of that matter. I<lb/>did not deem it necessary then to argue<lb/>that the time had arrived for grant<lb break="no"/>ing full provincial powers to the people<lb/>of the North-west Territories, because some<lb/>time previous we had a statement from<lb/>a member of the government to the effect<lb/>that it was their intention in the near future<lb/>to take up that matter and deal with it.<lb/>I have to express my regret that a decision<lb/>has been arrived at by the government<lb/>not to deal with that question this year.<lb/>I would not go so far as to say that the<lb/>people of the North-west Territories un<lb break="no"/>animously regret the decision of the govern<lb break="no"/>

     ment ; there may be a considerable number 
     <lb/>
     who hold the view that it is yet too early 
     <lb/>
     in their circumstances to grant full pro<lb break="no"/>vincial powers. But I believe I express 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of a very large majority of the 
     <lb/>
     people when I say that the conditions have 
     <lb/>
     now reached a stage when it would be ad<lb break="no"/>vantageous to those people as well as to 
     <lb/>
     the entire Dominion, to have this question 
     <lb/>
     settled without further loss of time. Some 
     <lb/>
     hon. members may be aware of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that within the past two weeks the ques<lb break="no"/>tion has been debated in the local legis<lb break="no"/>lature at Regina, and by a vote of 23 to 7, 
     <lb/>
     I think, in a House of 31 members, it was 
     <lb/>
     decided that it was a matter of regret that 
     <lb/>
     this question had not been taken up and 
     <lb/>
     an endeavour made to settle it this present 
     <lb/>
     year. Perhaps, as the House is now in 
     <lb/>
     Committee of Supply, it may not be a 
     <lb/>
     proper occasion for me to discuss the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial establishment question at length, and 
     <lb/>
     there may be another opportunity of doing 
     <lb/>
     so before the close of the session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But I want to point out that until pro<lb break="no"/>vincial powers are granted to the people 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories, the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility devolves upon this parliament of pro<lb break="no"/>viding for the services which come within 
     <lb/>
     the purview of the North-west Assembly. 
     <lb/>
     Those services are much the same as the 
     <lb/>
     services performed by the various pro<lb break="no"/>vincial governments, with a few minor 
     <lb/>
     exceptions. The services for which the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Assembly is responsible are 
     <lb/>
     the same as those of which the provincial 
     <lb/>
     governments have charge. We know that 
     <lb/>
     the various provincial governments have 
     <lb/>
     definite and final arrangements with the 
     <lb/>
     federal power as to the amount of money 
     <lb/>
     they shall receive from the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     exchequer yearly, and they are themselves 
     <lb/>
     responsible for performing certain duties. 
     <lb/>
     But with regard to the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories at the present time, that responsi<lb break="no"/>bility devolves upon this parliament, and 
     <lb/>
     especially upon the Department of the In<lb break="no"/>terior. In reality the business of governing 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories is but a branch 
     <lb/>
     of the department in the charge of the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior. The services which the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Assembly performs in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories are just as important and 
     <lb/>
     possibly more so than any of the services 
     <lb/>
     that are performed by this federal parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. The subjects of education and local 
     <lb/>
     public works are possibly just as important 
     <lb/>
     to the people up there as any of the sub<lb break="no"/>jects with which this parliament has to 
     <lb/>
     deal. As I said, the subjects of legislation 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories are very 
     <lb/>
     similar to those dealt with by the various 
     <lb/>
     local legislatures of the provinces. I will 
     <lb/>
     mention a few of them. Public Works, for 
     <lb/>
    instance, for the management of which 
     <lb/>there is a special department as in the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. The Department of Public Works 
     <lb/>in the Territories has to deal with the con<lb break="no"/>struction of roads and bridges, with the 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
      
      
     building of dams, and with the matter of 
     <lb/>
     drainage in certain parts of that large 
     <lb/>
     country. They have to operate ferries 
     <lb/>
     where it has not been possible yet to make 
     <lb/>
     bridges. They have to undertake a cer<lb break="no"/>tain other duty that is not required in any of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, that of making fire-guards. 
     <lb/>
     During last year the local Department 
     <lb/>
     of Public Works in the territories con<lb break="no"/>structed somewhere in the neighbourhood 
     <lb/>
     of 2,000 miles of fire guards. The adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of irrigation legislation too, comes 
     <lb/>
     under that department. This is the depart<lb break="no"/>ment which supervises and to some extent, 
     <lb/>
     administers the affairs of a large number 
     <lb/>
     of local improvement districts. These local 
     <lb/>
     improvement districts take the place of the 
     <lb/>
     municipalities which are to be found in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and the other provinces. It has 
     <lb/>
     been thought wise in that country, where 
     <lb/>
     the population is yet sparse, and until the 
     <lb/>
     population becomes more dense, to have a 
     <lb/>
     simpler form of municipal organization 
     <lb/>
     than in Ontario or the older provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     a scheme for the establishment of local 
     <lb/>
     improvement districts was some years ago 
     <lb/>
     worked out and put in force—a very simple 
     <lb/>
     scheme suited to the conditions of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and the plan is administered, to a con<lb break="no"/>siderable extent, and is altogether super<lb break="no"/>vised by the local Department of Public 
     <lb/>
    Works. There are, in some parts of the 
     <lb/>country, where the population is very 
     <lb/>spare, what are called large local im<lb break="no"/>provement districts, and the administration 
     <lb/>of these is entirely attended to by the De<lb break="no"/>partment of Public Works. The depart<lb break="no"/>ment too, supervises and inspects the coal 
     <lb/>mines of the territories. It has a branch 
     <lb/>too, for the inspection of steam boilers. A 
     <lb/>very important part of its duties is in re<lb break="no"/>gard to testing for water. In some parts 
     <lb/>of that immense country settlers have found 
     <lb/>difficulty in securing water, and it has been 
     <lb/>deemed advisable to undertake a plan, and 
     <lb/>very good service has been rendered by the 
     <lb/>plan which the government undertakes, to 
     <lb/>provide well borers, drills, and angers, and 
     <lb/>to test in various localities for water. I do 
     <lb/>not need to say to this committee that these 
     <lb/>duties are very important to the people of 
     <lb/>that country, and when we look at 
     <lb/>the amount of the vote which has, in pre<lb break="no"/>vious years, been given to the legislature 
     <lb/>to enable it to carry on these duties, when 
     <lb/>we look at the amount of the vote which 
     <lb/>it is proposed this year to grant to the legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and when we take into considera<lb break="no"/>tion the very large extent of country and 
     <lb/>the very great importance of these duties, 
     <lb/>some few of which I have enumerated. I 
     <lb/>think the committee can reach no other 
     <lb/>conclusion than this, at all events, that not 
     <lb/>too much money has been voted and is pro<lb break="no"/>posed to be voted to the legislative assem<lb break="no"/>bly to carry out such duties. The total 
     <lb/>amount in the item before us is $357,979. 
     <lb/>There are works which are needed 
     <lb/>in that country in the way of bridges— 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <pb n="3067" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1902-04-18_Page_03067.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3067</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3068</fw>
          
          
     single bridges—which if the legislature at<lb break="no"/>tempted to carry out and which would be 
     <lb/>
     of very great benefit to the people, would 
     <lb/>
     take nearly all the sum of $357,000. There 
     <lb/>
     are places in that country where works are 
     <lb/>
     needed and which would be a benefit to 
     <lb/>
     the people, and such works would take the 
     <lb/>
     entire vote which it is proposed to grant 
     <lb/>
     to the legislature, namely, $357,000. I need 
     <lb/>
     only refer to the matter of public works, 
     <lb/>
     a matter of very great importance, a mat<lb break="no"/>ter which requires a very great expenditure 
     <lb/>
     in a country of the immense extent of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, some parts of which 
     <lb/>
     are of a broken character and having very 
     <lb/>
     large rivers. The subject of education is one 
     <lb/>
     of no less importance. In a country like 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories, where a very 
     <lb/>
     large immigration is coming in and where 
     <lb/>
     a very large immigration and an increasing 
     <lb/>
     population are expected, the subject of edu<lb break="no"/>cation is, to the people there and to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada, one of the very highest 
     <lb/>
     importance. As illustrating the need of an 
     <lb/>
     increase in the vote by this House for the 
     <lb/>
     purposes of the legislative assembly, I will 
     <lb/>
     quote some figures to show the way in which 
     <lb/>
     the school districts have been increasing 
     <lb/>
     in number. At the end of 1896 there were 
     <lb/>
     436 public school districts. These had been 
     <lb/>
     organized since 1884, when the public 
     <lb/>
     school system was inaugurated. At the end 
     <lb/>
     of 1897 there were 459 school districts, be<lb break="no"/>ing an increase of 21 districts in that year. 
     <lb/>
     At the end of 1898 there were 480, there 
     <lb/>
     being an increase of 23. At the end of 1899 
     <lb/>
     the number had risen to 524, there being an 
     <lb/>
     increase of 44. At the end of 1900 there 
     <lb/>
     were 576, an increase of 52. At the end 
     <lb/>
     of 1901 the number of school districts which 
     <lb/>
     had been organized was 684, showing an 
     <lb/>
     increase during the last year of 108 dis<lb break="no"/>tricts. The expenditure of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories upon education in 1901 was $204,<lb break="no"/>000, being something more than half of the 
     <lb/>
     total grant made by this parliament for all 
     <lb/>
     the purposes of local government in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories. I neglected to men<lb break="no"/>tion, in regard to the subject of public 
     <lb/>
     works, that the expenditure made last year 
     <lb/>
     was in the neighbourhood of $250,000, so 
     <lb/>
     that it will be seen that the expenditure on 
     <lb/>
     education and public works, on these two 
     <lb/>
     subjects, more than took up the whole of 
     <lb/>
     the yearly grant made by parliament last 
     <lb/>
     year for all purposes of local government in 
     <lb/>
     the territories. The local authorities find 
     <lb/>
     that these necessary subjects are practically 
     <lb/>
     all that they are able to undertake. Of 
     <lb/>
     course, there are necessarily some other ex<lb break="no"/>penditures, for instance, the expenses of 
     <lb/>
    the meeting of the legislature, and there 
     <lb/>are other incidental items which are neces<lb break="no"/>sary and which cannot be avoided. Last 
     <lb/>year, in addition to these items of public 
     <lb/>works and education, which took up a very 
     <lb/>large amount of the total appropriation, 
     <lb/>there was an amount of $80,000 for the 
     <lb/>yearly expenses of the local civil service 
     <lb/>and the meeting of the legislature a vote 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <cb/>
       
       
     of $8,000 for the administration of local 
     <lb/>
    ordinances and civil justice, which comes 
     <lb/>under the purview of the legislature, and 
     <lb/>a vote of $20,000 to meet the expenses 
     <lb/>of the Department of Agriculture, which is 
     <lb/>performing some very important and neces<lb break="no"/>sary work. The Department of Agriculture 
     <lb/>administers amongst other things what 
     <lb/>is known as the Brands ordinance. In 
     <lb/>the ranching country the brand upon the 
     <lb/>animal is the chief evidence of ownership, 
     <lb/>and it is important that the legislation 
     <lb/>in regard to brands shall be carefully 
     <lb/>administered. During last year, I believe 
     <lb/>there were no less than 10,000 new brands 
     <lb/>issued by the Department of Agriculture. 
     <lb/>There was a vote of $15,000 for .the pur<lb break="no"/>poses of grants to hospitals and the main<lb break="no"/>tenance of public health, and there was 
     <lb/>a miscellaneous vote of $5,000, making 
     <lb/>a total, outside the subjects of public works 
     <lb/>and education, of $128,000. I do not think 
     <lb/>it would be profitable for me, or for any 
     <lb/>hon. member of this House to make com<lb break="no"/>parisons between the expenditures in one 
     <lb/>part of the country and in another, or be<lb break="no"/>tween one,province and another, or between 
     <lb/>the North-west Territories and any of the 
     <lb/>provinces. Such comparisons might be made, 
     <lb/>and I may say that I think I could make them 
     <lb/>at the present time, and possibly convince 
     <lb/>the House by such comparisons that a very 
     <lb/>large increase might properly be made in 
     <lb/>the grant for the purpose of government 
     <lb/>in the North-west Territories, but I do not 
     <lb/>think it would be proper for me, or for any 
     <lb/>other member, to endeavour to make such 
     <lb/>comparisons. We from the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, at all events, are not sectionalists, 
     <lb/>we believe in nationalism, we believe in 
     <lb/>coming into the House and advocating only 
     <lb/>that which will be for the general benefit 
     <lb/>of Canada. I hope the day will never come 
     <lb/>when I will be found here advocating any<lb break="no"/>thing which I have not proved to myself, at 
     <lb/>least, and which I have not some rea<lb break="no"/>sonable ground for believing I can con<lb break="no"/>vince the House is for the general bene<lb break="no"/>fit of Canada. While I am not going 
     <lb/>to endeavour to make any comparisons 
     <lb/>between the expenditures in one part of the 
     <lb/>country and in another, I am going to say, 
     <lb/>and I think this principle has been largely 
     <lb/>followed, that wherever any service seems 
     <lb/>to be advisable and necessary this House 
     <lb/>should endeavour to provide adequately for 
     <lb/>that service. I believe that is the proper 
     <lb/>principle, and I believe that if that principle 
     <lb/>be applied in this case, parliament will at 
     <lb/>the present session grant a very large in<lb break="no"/>crease in the vote for the purpose of gov<lb break="no"/>erning locally the North-west Territories. 
     <lb/>Just to show what is the position of the local 
     <lb/>authority up there at the present time, I 
     <lb/>Will quote a few brief figures. In the year 
     <lb/>1899 the grant made by parliament for gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in the North-west Territories was 
     <lb/>$283,000, but the total amount expended 
     <lb/>that year by the local authorities was $414,<lb break="no"/>000. There is, of course, a small local re<lb break="no"/>
 
 
            <pb n="3069" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1902-04-18_Page_03069.jpg"/>

     venue which is year by year increasing to 
     <lb/>
     some extent. For four or five years it has 
     <lb/>
     amounted annually to $30,000 or $40,000, 
     <lb/>
     and it is expected that this year and from 
     <lb/>
     this on the local revenue will not be less 
     <lb/>
     than perhaps $80,000 or $90,000, which is 
     <lb/>
     largely derived from a small direct tax 
     <lb/>
     which has been placed upon land. But 
     <lb/>
      while the total expenditure in 1899 amounted 
     <lb/>
     to $414,000, and the total grant from this 
     <lb/>
     parliament was only $283,000, the explana<lb break="no"/>tion is that in that year the Yukon was 
     <lb/>
     still to a certain extent within the admin<lb break="no"/>istration of the local authorities of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories, and from the 
     <lb/>
     Yukon a revenue of about $160,000 was 
     <lb/>
     obtained. That local revenue enabled the 
     <lb/>
     North-west government with fair adequacy 
     <lb/>
     to meet the wants of the country for 
     <lb/>
     that year. In the year 1900 the grant 
     <lb/>
     from this parliament was increased to $424,<lb break="no"/>000, and with the local revenue the North<lb break="no"/>west government had $465,000 at their dis<lb break="no"/>posal. For the year 1901 the estimates 
     <lb/>
     which the North-west government present<lb break="no"/>ed to Ottawa amounted to $600,000. That 
     <lb/>
     amount, on a close calculation by the North<lb break="no"/>west government was deemed to be neces<lb break="no"/>sary to cover the actual needs of local gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The grant which they received 
     <lb/>
     from parliament for that year was only 
     <lb/>
     $357,000, the same amount as we find in 
     <lb/>
     the present estimates. The local authori<lb break="no"/>ties of the North-west Territories represent<lb break="no"/>ed to the powers at Ottawa that the needs 
     <lb/>
     of that country for the year 1901 demanded 
     <lb/>
     $600,000, and they received only $357,000. 
     <lb/>
     What was done last year by the local au<lb break="no"/>thority to cover the evident deficiency was 
     <lb/>
     this : The appropriation by this par<lb break="no"/>liament is for the fiscal year from the 30th 
     <lb/>
     of June to the 30th of June following, but 
     <lb/>
     the financial year in the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories is the calendar year from the 3lst 
     <lb/>
     December to 31st December following. The 
     <lb/>
     vote made by this parliament last year was 
     <lb/>
     intended to cover the period until June 
     <lb/>
     30th, 1902, but the local government found 
     <lb/>
     that unless they took the whole vote that 
     <lb/>
     was made here last year and expended it 
     <lb/>
     within their calendar year of 1901, they 
     <lb/>
     could not commence to properly meet the 
     <lb/>
     needs of the people of that country, the 
     <lb/>
     cost of education and the cost of necessary 
     <lb/>
     public works. The position in which the 
     <lb/>
     North-west government finds itself to-day 
     <lb/>
     is, that an ordinary vote does not put them 
     <lb/>
     in the same position as they were in last 
     <lb/>
     year, because last year they were compelled 
     <lb/>
     to anticipate the money that should ordin<lb break="no"/>arily have gone to them in the first half of 
     <lb/>
     this present calendar year. Suppose we vote 
     <lb/>
     $357,000 for this present year, the conse<lb break="no"/>quence is that the North-west authorities 
     <lb/>
     will only be able to expend within 1902 one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     half of it, or a little over $175,000. Now, if 
     <lb/>
     their needs this year amount approximately 
     <lb/>
     to $600,000. it will not take this committee 
     <lb/>
     long to comprehend that if a very largely 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
        
        
     increased appropriation is not made at the 
     <lb/>
     present time, the people in the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories who depend on the local govern<lb break="no"/>ment for their needs in the way of public 
     <lb/>
     works and education and local purposes gen<lb break="no"/>erally, are going to be left in a very diffi<lb break="no"/>cult position, and it will simply be impos<lb break="no"/>sible for the local government to meet these 
     <lb/>
     needs in any proper and adequate manner. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We had a discussion in the House yester<lb break="no"/>day upon the subject of immigration. It 
     <lb/>
     is unnecessary for me to say that at the 
     <lb/>
     present time the population in the whole 
     <lb/>
     of western Canada is increasing very 
     <lb/>
     largely. From a national point of view that 
     <lb/>
     is very encouraging, but from the point of 
     <lb/>
     view of the local government it is not an 
     <lb/>
     unmixed blessing to see hundreds of people 
     <lb/>
     literally pouring into that country daily, 
     <lb/>
     because every new settler means an addi<lb break="no"/>tional tax upon the  local governing 
     <lb/>
     authority. It means that increased expendi<lb break="no"/>ture will have to be made upon the con<lb break="no"/>struction of roads and bridges, because the 
     <lb/>
     greater the number of people in that coun<lb break="no"/>try the greater the area settled, and it was 
     <lb/>
     found in practice last year that many of the 
     <lb/>
     new comers went upon areas which had 
     <lb/>
     not been before that time settled, and thus 
     <lb/>
     rendered necessary the construction of new 
     <lb/>
     roads and the building of culverts and 
     <lb/>
     bridges by the local authorities. Conse<lb break="no"/>quently, the local government of the North<lb break="no"/>west cannot look upon this influx of im<lb break="no"/>migration as an unmixed blessing from their 
     <lb/>
     point of view ; while from the larger point 
     <lb/>
     of view it is indeed a very encouraging cir<lb break="no"/>cumstance that immigrants are coming into 
     <lb/>
     Canada to-day in larger numbers than they 
     <lb/>
     ever came in any previous time. In fact 
     <lb/>
     every newspaper one takes hold of from the 
     <lb/>
     western part of the country is half filled 
     <lb/>
     with accounts of new settlers coming in with 
     <lb/>
     large quantities of settlers' effects, bringing 
     <lb/>
     added riches to the country. I had a note 
     <lb/>
     a couple of days ago from a gentleman at 
     <lb/>
     North Portal, who stated that in the pre<lb break="no"/>vious week no less than 186 cars of settlers' 
     <lb/>
     eifects had been passed through that port 
     <lb/>
     from the United States into western Can<lb break="no"/>ada. I had another letter this evening from 
     <lb/>
     a gentleman in Regina which is simply an 
     <lb/>
     illustration of what is occurring generally in 
     <lb/>
     that country. He writes me :

            <p>As I say, nearly every letter one receives 
     <lb/>from the North-west Territories and nearly 
     <lb/>every paper that comes to hand, is filled 
     <lb/>with intelligence about hundreds of new<lb break="no"/>comers who are arriving daily in that coun<lb break="no"/>try. The Winnipeg 'Free Press,' which 
     <lb/>came to hand to-night, states that on Wed<lb break="no"/>nesday of this week no less than 1,000 set<lb break="no"/>tlers arrived in Winnipeg, and a very con<lb break="no"/>siderable proportion of all the settlers who 
     <lb/>arrive at Winnipeg go to some point in the 
     <lb/>North-west Territories. This is a very en<lb break="no"/>couraging feature of the times, and I thor<lb break="no"/>oughly agree with what was said by my 
     <lb/>hon. friend the Minister of the Interior last 
     <lb/>night, that we appear to be at the dawn of 
     <lb/>a new day. The present prospect is more 
     <lb/>encouraging than it has been at any time 
     <lb/>at least in my lifetime, and I think the 
     <lb/>committee will agree that it would be too 
     <lb/>bad if any check were given to the ten<lb break="no"/>dency of the people towards that country, 
     <lb/>by parsimony on the part of this House in 
     <lb/>dealing with the local needs of the people. 
     <lb/>As has often been said, any effort that may 
     <lb/>be put forth by this government to promote 
     <lb/>immigration must be secondary in effect to 
     <lb/>the work which will be done by satisfied 
     <lb/>settlers in the country, who, as is often said, 
     <lb/>are the best immigration agents. For my 
     <lb/>part, I think one of the most important 
     <lb/>duties coming within the purview of the 
     <lb/>Department of the Interior with regard to 
     <lb/>immigration is to see that the local needs, 
     <lb/>in the way of public works, education, and 
     <lb/>other things, are properly and adequately 
     <lb/>met. For these reasons, for my part—and 
     <lb/>I believe I speak for every member from 
     <lb/>the North-west Territories, and I believe as 
     <lb/>well that our friends from British Columbia 
     <lb/>and Manitoba will support us unanimously 
     <lb/>in this—I think the House should very 
     <lb/>largely increase the grant to the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the North-west Territories.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV4">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I wish to support what 
     <lb/>
     has been said by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Western Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) with regard 
     <lb/>
     to this vote for the government in the 
     <lb/>
      
      
   
          
            <cb/>
           
           
     North-west Territories. It was with some 
     <lb/>
     considerable surprise that I saw in the esti<lb break="no"/>mates that the amount to be voted for this 
     <lb/>
     purpose for the coming year was no larger 
     <lb/>
     than the vote for the present year. 1 am 
     <lb/>
     at a loss to understand upon what basis of 
     <lb/>
     calculation this sum was arrived at. If 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary or desirable to meet the re<lb break="no"/>quirements of the public service in any part 
     <lb/>
     of the country, account must be taken of the 
     <lb/>
     increase of those requirements. Now, this 
     <lb/>
     whole country is ringing with a knowledge 
     <lb/>
     of the increase of population and therefore 
     <lb/>
     increase of requirements in the North-west, 
     <lb/>
     and that knowledge has produced no result 
     <lb/>
     in the way of meeting the requirements 
     <lb/>
     which necessarily arise. It may be said 
     <lb/>
     that the amount required for the purposes 
     <lb/>
     of the government of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories is an uncertain amount. So it is. 
     <lb/>
     It is an amount which depends from time 
     <lb/>
     to time upon the requirements as they arise. 
     <lb/>
     With the increase of population, those re<lb break="no"/>quirements have increased from year to 
     <lb/>
     year. By reason of climatic conditions dur<lb break="no"/>ing the past year, those needs have been 
     <lb/>
     tremendously emphasized. By reason of 
     <lb/>
     heavy rains, bridges have been washed out 
     <lb/>
     by the dozen, and a very large part of the 
     <lb/>
     revenues of the territorial government which 
     <lb/>
     should have gone to extend the facilities of 
     <lb/>
     travel throughout new settlements in the 
     <lb/>
     country, has been used up in replacing the 
     <lb/>
     damage done by the floods in older settle<lb break="no"/>ments. It may not be altogether plain to 
     <lb/>
     membersof the House why an increase of 
     <lb/>
     population means an increase of require<lb break="no"/>ments. The reason is that the territories 
     <lb/>
     have immense areas, compared to popula<lb break="no"/>tion. They are not at all on the same 
     <lb/>
     footing as the province of Manitoba, where 
     <lb/>
     the population is contained in less than 
     <lb/>
     one-third of the total area of the province, 
     <lb/>
     and the total area of Manitoba is not over 
     <lb/>
     one-fourth of the area over which settle<lb break="no"/>ment is scattered in the North-west. An 
     <lb/>
     increase of settlement in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba means simply a thickening up of 
     <lb/>
     the population. and does not require the 
     <lb/>
     opening of new roads or the establishment 
     <lb/>
     of new school districts, and does not increase 
     <lb/>
     materially the expenses of government; 
     <lb/>
     while an increase of population in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories means that people have 
     <lb/>
     spread out into new country, necessitating 
     <lb/>
     new roads and new schools and an increase 
     <lb/>
     in every way and materially of expenses of 
     <lb/>
     government. It is of course under our 
     <lb/>
     present condition a matter of arrangement 
     <lb/>
     or consideration of this parliament what 
     <lb/>
     shall be done from year to year to meet 
     <lb/>
     financial conditions. That is not the fault 
     <lb/>
     of the people or the government of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories. The government of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories has approached 
     <lb/>
     this government repeatedly during past 
     <lb/>
     years, and most formally during the past 
     <lb/>
     year, asking for a definite financial arrange<lb break="no"/>ment based on the terms of confederation, 
     <lb/>
     as applied to the different provinces of the 
     <lb/>

       Dominion. They are not here from time to<lb/>time clamouring for unknown and unheard 
     <lb/>of amounts. They are asking simply that 
     <lb/>the government or parliament either meet 
     <lb/>the requirements of the case, as they arise 
     <lb/>from time to time, or else put the territories 
     <lb/>in the same financial position as the various 
     <lb/>provinces of the Dominion, so that they may 
     <lb/>enjoy as a right what they now must ask 
     <lb/>as a favour. I submit that the position 
     <lb/>is this: This parliament and government 
     <lb/>are required either to meet the conditions 
     <lb/>that exist by an adequate vote, or else to 
     <lb/>put the territories in the position of the 
     <lb/>various provinces of the Dominion as re<lb break="no"/>gards financial arrangements. Either one 
     <lb/>thing or the other, and the responsibility is 
     <lb/>upon the House and the government in the 
     <lb/>matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As to the amount that is demanded and 
     <lb/>
     the comparisons that may be made with 
     <lb/>
     regard to that amount, the vote for carrying 
     <lb/>
     on the government of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, which stands in the same position as 
     <lb/>
     a subsidy voted to one of the provinces— 
     <lb/>
     out of which provision must be made for 
     <lb/>
     the construction of public works of all 
     <lb/>
     classes throughout the Territories, chiefly 
     <lb/>
     roads and bridges, the requirements of edu<lb break="no"/>cation, and the administration of all the 
     <lb/>
     departments of government—amounts to only 
     <lb/>
     $268,000. That is the total amount provided 
     <lb/>
     for all the expenses of government of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, which are, in the existing cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, necessarily higher proportion<lb break="no"/>ately than in any other portion of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. And it is to cost the country $445,<lb break="no"/>000 in the coming year for the expenses 
     <lb/>
     to be incurred in endeavouring to bring 
     <lb/>
     people into the North-west. I claim, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, that these two expenditures are 
     <lb/>
     not proportionate. I claim that if $445,000 
     <lb/>
     be a reasonable expenditure to bring people 
     <lb/>
     into the country, $358,000 is not a reason<lb break="no"/>able sum with which to provide for all the 
     <lb/>
     needs of local government, both for the peo<lb break="no"/>ple who are in the country now, and those 
     <lb/>
     who are to come in as the result of this 
     <lb/>
     expenditure on immigration work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I need not add to what my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) has said 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the effect that an inadequate 
     <lb/>
     provision for the needs of education, the 
     <lb/>
     opening of roads and the general matters 
     <lb/>
     of local government, must necessarily have 
     <lb/>
     on immigration into that country. The class 
     <lb/>
     of people who are going there in largest 
     <lb/>
     numbers are those whose first demand is 
     <lb/>
     for the facilities of schools and markets. 
     <lb/>
     They are an enterprising and an energetic 
     <lb/>
     people. who have built up the great coun<lb break="no"/>try to the south of us, and who come over 
     <lb/>
     the line to build up a great country on our 
     <lb/>
     side. They will not be satisfied, unless they 
     <lb/>
     can have facilities for the education of 
     <lb/>
     their children and the ordinary advantages 
     <lb/>
     of civilization in due measure, as the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances permit. And now when those 
     <lb/>
     people are coming in large numbers, at<lb break="no"/>tracted by the desirability of our country, 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
          
          
     it would be the worst policy that ever was 
     <lb/>
     entered upon. to stint the means whereby 
     <lb/>
     they may be rendered satisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     country. Do not forget that we had a rush 
     <lb/>
     of immigrants to the North-west many 
     <lb/>
     years ago, and at that time people seemed 
     <lb/>
     to think that the rush could not be stopped, 
     <lb/>
     but it was stopped and it remained stopped 
     <lb/>
     for nearly twenty years. There is a rush 
     <lb/>
     on again, and I counsel members of this 
     <lb/>
     House to take such measures that it shall 
     <lb/>
     not be stopped until that country has been 
     <lb/>
     satisfactorily developed. Every one knows 
     <lb/>
     that the best immigration agent is the con<lb break="no"/>tented settler. Therefore, our best policy 
     <lb/>
     is to provide adequate means to give in<lb break="no"/>tending settlers those advantages of civili<lb break="no"/>zation, which they will demand, and which 
     <lb/>
     they consider of the very highest import<lb break="no"/>ance. It is because these people look for 
     <lb/>
     these advantages of civilization and prize 
     <lb/>
     them so highly that they are valuable set<lb break="no"/>tlers. It is because they want schools and 
     <lb/>
     roads and good government that they are 
     <lb/>
     good settlers. People who would not make 
     <lb/>
     those demands, to whom it makes no differ<lb break="no"/>ence whether or not there are schools or 
     <lb/>
     roads or good local government, are not 
     <lb/>
     the kind of people we want at all. They 
     <lb/>
     are dear at any price, and it is the best 
     <lb/>
     thing that ever happened this country that 
     <lb/>
     the people who are coming in and filling it 
     <lb/>
     up now are imbued with those civilizing 
     <lb/>
     tendencies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hope that the present government will 
     <lb/>
     see that the public services of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories are not starved at this cri<lb break="no"/>tical stage in our history. I hope they will 
     <lb/>
     provide for those services according to the 
     <lb/>
     requirements, or else place the territories 
     <lb/>
     upon a provincial footing, so that there shall 
     <lb/>
     be no question about our rights in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter.

     <persName ref="pers:DOUG2">Mr. DOUGLAS</persName>. I only wish to make a 
     <lb/>
     few remarks in addition to what has al<lb break="no"/>ready been said on this question. I would 
     <lb/>
     like to emphasize, if possible, in the mind 
     <lb/>
     of the committee, the statements that have 
     <lb/>
     been made by my hon. friend from West 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) and my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Alberta (Mr. Oliver). This question 
     <lb/>
     of an increased subsidy is a very important 
     <lb/>
     one in the estimation of he people gener<lb break="no"/>ally. We should have eir an increased 
     <lb/>
     subsidy or provincial autonomy. As far as 
     <lb/>
     I have given the matter attention, I think 
     <lb/>
     it would be much better for the country, 
     <lb/>
     in its existing circumstances, to receive an 
     <lb/>
     increased subsidy at present rather than 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy. I know that there is 
     <lb/>
     a tendency amongst many members of this 
     <lb/>
     House to say that we, the people in the 
     <lb/>
     west, are always clamouring for special ad<lb break="no"/>vantages. They point to the early settlers 
     <lb/>
     of the older provinces in the east and tell 
     <lb/>
     us that we are looking to be spoonfed and 
     <lb/>
     ought to have the courage, endurance 
     <lb/>
     and hardihood of the early settler in On<lb break="no"/>tario and elsewhere. Let me say that the

     people in the North-west, especially those 
     <lb/>
     who went in twenty years ago, have passed 
     <lb/>
     through experiences of hardship and en<lb break="no"/>durance, which show that they really pos<lb break="no"/>sess, in a large measure, those qualities of 
     <lb/>
     resistance, and patience, and have indicated 
     <lb/>
     by their persistent effort that they believe 
     <lb/>
     in the country and are willing to endure 
     <lb/>
     privation in order to make it prosperous. I 
     <lb/>
     do not think that the early settlers of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and the North-west are, in any sense, 
     <lb/>
     behind those of the eastern provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     can speak from experience, having lived in 
     <lb/>
     that country from 1883 to date. I know 
     <lb/>
     something about the hardships of the people 
     <lb/>
     in the early days of that country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In reference to public works, it is quite 
     <lb/>
     evident that the sum at the disposal of the 
     <lb/>
     government of the North-west Territories is 
     <lb/>
     wholly inadequate. I can speak with 
     <lb/>
     special knowledge of that part of the 
     <lb/>
     country that I represent, the eastern part 
     <lb/>
     of Assiniboia. Take, for instance, the dis<lb break="no"/>trict lying north and south of the Qu'Appelle 
     <lb/>
     river. It is true, we have some steel 
     <lb/>
     bridges that are a credit to the territorial 
     <lb/>
     government that erected them. But even 
     <lb/>
     they are of little use in the spring season. 
     <lb/>
     I venture to say that to-day the great ma<lb break="no"/>jority of the people living on the north side 
     <lb/>
     of the river are not able to cross the valley 
     <lb/>
     or approach the bridges to reach the market 
     <lb/>
     with a load of grain. That is a hardship.  
     <lb/>
     They have grain on their hands that they 
     <lb/>
     are anxious to get rid of and to settle their 
     <lb/>
     liabilities. But this they cannot do because 
     <lb/>
     the approaches to these bridges are in a 
     <lb/>
     state that altogether forbids their reaching 
     <lb/>
     the markets. Perhaps they will not be 
     <lb/>
     able to reach the markets till the end of 
     <lb/>
     May or the beginning of June. We have 
     <lb/>
     a local organization for the improvement 
     <lb/>
     of the roads, and this has been a step in 
     <lb/>
     the right direction. I think the system is 
     <lb/>
     even superior in point of organization to the 
     <lb/>
     municipal arrangements of the older pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. The local improvement districts of  
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories are doing good 
     <lb/>
     work and proving that the scheme will be 
     <lb/>
     a great success. Up to the last three or 
     <lb/>
     four years it has been largely in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of the settlers to help themselves in making 
     <lb/>
     roads to reach their markets, to call upon 
     <lb/>
     their neighbour, and they collect a num<lb break="no"/>ber of individuals who voluntarily gave their 
     <lb/>
     work to make the road. But the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has organized the local improvement 
     <lb/>
     districts which entails a direct tax upon 
     <lb/>
     each quarter section for the improvement 
     <lb/>
     of the roads. And that certainly, as I have 
     <lb/>
     said, is a step in the right direction. But 
     <lb/>
     I have always felt that the sum that was 
     <lb/>
     given for the government of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories was entirely inadequate. It is 
     <lb/>
     quite true that we have a claim upon the 
     <lb/>
     treasury of this Dominion, in common with 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces to a certain amount per 
     <lb/>
     head according to population. But it seems 
     <lb/>
     to me, in view of the rapid growth of im<lb break="no"/>migration and of the population of that 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <cb/>
          
          
     country that the future ought to be dis<lb break="no"/>counted by the present government and a 
     <lb/>
     very liberal allowance made for the in<lb break="no"/>crease, to enable the territorial government 
     <lb/>
     to make the provisions which the circum<lb break="no"/>stances at present demand. The fact that 
     <lb/>
     we are spending more upon immigration 
     <lb/>
     than upon the government of that country 
     <lb/>
     is one argument for the increase of indem<lb break="no"/>nity. There is another fact that I would 
     <lb/>
     like to point out to the committee. It may 
     <lb/>
     not be popular, perhaps, for me to call at<lb break="no"/>tention to it. We would not say that this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion is paying too much for the wards 
     <lb/>
     of the country and for our Indian popula<lb break="no"/>tion. I would not for a moment insinuate 
     <lb/>
     that the government is paying too much for 
     <lb/>
     the Indian youth of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. But it is a fact—I am not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to give the exact figures on the in<lb break="no"/>stant, but what I say can be verified— 
     <lb/>
     that we are spending more upon the Indian 
     <lb/>
     industrial schools of the North-west than 
     <lb/>
     for the whole government of those terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Now, I would like to emphasize 
     <lb/>
     what has already been said that under ex<lb break="no"/>isting circumstances something might to be 
     <lb/>
     done and a very liberal addition ought to 
     <lb/>
     be made to the subsidy of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories, and that at the present session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCREARY</persName>. I desire to say a very 
     <lb/>
     few words on this subject, first, because 
     <lb/>
     this affects the prairie country, and I would 
     <lb/>
     like to endorse the sentiments of my col<lb break="no"/>leagues, and, second, because this is one of 
     <lb/>
     the most important questions that is to 
     <lb/>
     come before this House in the near future— 
     <lb/>
     the subsidy of the territories, or provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy therefor. I have been reading 
     <lb/>
     what has taken place in the House in Regina 
     <lb/>
     with regard to territorial autonomy and I 
     <lb/>
     must say that I was struck with the force 
     <lb/>
     of the arguments. But my own impression 
     <lb/>
     is that, at the present time, there are good 
     <lb/>
     arguments why provincial autonomy should 
     <lb/>
     not to be given to the territories. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that within the next three or four years, 
     <lb/>
     if immigration should continue as at pre<lb break="no"/>sent, the population of the territories will 
     <lb/>
     have so increased and so tended to certain 
     <lb/>
     portions of the territories that probably the 
     <lb/>
     local jealousies that now exist as to whether 
     <lb/>
     there should be one or two or three pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and where the capitals shall be, 
     <lb/>
     will have disappeared. I sometimes think 
     <lb/>
     also that they have not considered the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure that would devolve upon them if 
     <lb/>
     they had to govern themselves. Take, for 
     <lb/>
     instance, the mounted police. I am not 
     <lb/>
     sure, but I suppose the number of police 
     <lb/>
     in the territories must reach from five hun<lb break="no"/>dred to a thousand. If the duty of policing 
     <lb/>
     the country devolved upon the local govern<lb break="no"/>ment, what a large percentage of the sub<lb break="no"/>sidy got from this government it would 
     <lb/>
     take. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe the older provinces of Canada 
     <lb/>
     have not looked upon this matter in the pro<lb break="no"/>per light. Some hon. gentleman here said— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="3077" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1902-04-18_Page_03077.jpg"/>

            <p>
     I think it was the hon. member for Alberta 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Oliver)—that it is one thing to bring 
     <lb/>
     immigrants to the country and another to 
     <lb/>
     keep them here. I was one of the unfor<lb break="no"/>tunates who left this eastern part of Can<lb break="no"/>ada twenty-two years ago last month. I 
     <lb/>
     arrived in Winnipeg some time in March, 
     <lb/>
     got my ox and cart and started across the 
     <lb/>
     prairies with others. I shall never forget 
     <lb/>
     as long as I live some of the hardships 1 
     <lb/>
     saw the settlers undergo. We met violent 
     <lb/>
     storms at Portage la Prairie, and further 
     <lb/>
     west where Brandon now is, and also about 
     <lb/>
     the locality of Rapid City. There were no 
     <lb/>
     towns there then. I have seen strong men 
     <lb/>
     shed tears when they saw their wives and 
     <lb/>
     children in water three or four feet deep 
     <lb/>
     trying to cross the creeks and ravines where 
     <lb/>
     there were no bridges. A large number of 
     <lb/>
     people left the country as soon as they 
     <lb/>
     could get out of it. I believe 85 per cent 
     <lb/>
     of those who came from the British islands 
     <lb/>
     in 1882 and 1883 left that country before 
     <lb/>
     1885. In the first place, they could not get 
     <lb/>
     to a market or to a railway centre. They 
     <lb/>
     saw no sign of civilization. They had no 
     <lb/>
     company and they got lonely. There were 
     <lb/>
     no post offices, they could not get a letter or 
     <lb/>
     send one without going fifty or sixty miles. 
     <lb/>
     They had no schools, and their children 
     <lb/>
     were growing up in ignorance around them. 
     <lb/>
     That same condition exists in the territories 
     <lb/>
     and it will have the same effect if this 
     <lb/>
     government do not wake up to the facts. 
     <lb/>
     I know a family; I could give their names— 
     <lb/>
     I will give their names. Mr. Richard Lyons 
     <lb/>
     and his family, who settled in Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     thirty-five miles from Swan River, in 1898. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Lyons had eleven of a family and came 
     <lb/>
     from the north of Ireland. Although we 
     <lb/>
     have provincial government there, he re<lb break="no"/>mained there for fifteen months before he 
     <lb/>
     had a school or post office nearer than Swan 
     <lb/>
     River thirty-five miles away. He wrote 
     <lb/>
     me letters, and in one of them he said: I 
     <lb/>
     will leave this country in three months, un<lb break="no"/>less I can get a school or post office. I 
     <lb/>
     wrote to the superintendent of immigration 
     <lb/>
     and finally succeeded in meeting his wishes. 
     <lb/>
     That is one example of the kind of thing 
     <lb/>
     that may happen in the territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, when you think of 
     <lb/>
     $357,000, with, I think $40,000 the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman said of local revenue, say $400,<lb break="no"/>000 altogether, to supply all the munici<lb break="no"/>pal and other services required in that vast 
     <lb/>
     territory, I think any man who has had 
     <lb/>
     experience in municipal matters must 
     <lb/>
     wonder how it has been done. Most of 
     <lb/>
     you who live in cities and towns in Ontario 
     <lb/>
     probably know the condition here in Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     as I know the condition in the city of 
     <lb/>
     Winnipeg. The revenue of the city of 
     <lb/>
     Winnipeg is some $635,000, of which $135,<lb break="no"/>000 is paid yearly for schools. The revenue 
     <lb/>
     of the city of Winnipeg, a town of 50,000 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants, is nearly double the sum with 
     <lb/>
     which they have to govern that whole terri<lb break="no"/>tory 500 miles by 400 miles. I ask if that 
     <lb/>
   
     is fair. I say it is great credit to the 
     <lb/>
   
            <cb/>
          
          
     Hon. Mr. Haultain and his colleagues that 
     <lb/>
     they have been able to administer the affairs 
     <lb/>
     of that government as economically as they 
     <lb/>
     have done during the last ten years. I do 
     <lb/>
     not believe there is a province in Canada 
     <lb/>
     where the same amount of money has 
     <lb/>
     yielded so much benefit to the people as 
     <lb/>
     has the money spent by the territorial 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. gentlemen from the east may think 
     <lb/>
     this is pecularily a western question. Now 
     <lb/>
     it is not, it is more an eastern matter. A 
     <lb/>
     great many gentlemen on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the House live in cities and towns which 
     <lb/>
     are manufacturing centres. For instance, 
     <lb/>
     we have three members from Toronto, none 
     <lb/>
     of them here to-night. I would ask those 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen in the city of Toronto who under<lb break="no"/>stand the Massey-Harris people, what a 
     <lb/>
     good settler is worth to the Massey-Harris 
     <lb/>
     people every year. I ask them what every new 
     <lb/>
     family who goes into the territories is worth 
     <lb/>
     to the manufacturers of eastern Canada. 
     <lb/>
     They are worth nothing to western Can<lb break="no"/>ada in that way, we have no manufac<lb break="no"/>turers, we have no implements, no cloth, 
     <lb/>
     woollens nor cottons, no fruits—everything 
     <lb/>
     these people have to buy must come from 
     <lb/>
     the east. Every settler you put there in<lb break="no"/>creases the wages of your artisans, increases 
     <lb/>
     the population of your cities and towns in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario. It does not help as half as much 
     <lb/>
     as it helps you people here, and I think 
     <lb/>
     it is your duty to wake up to the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the more settlers you get in there the larger 
     <lb/>
     your towns will grow, and the higher the 
     <lb/>
     value of your lands will become in older Can<lb break="no"/>ada. I say this is a matter of gigantic im<lb break="no"/>portance. I believe that in the supple<lb break="no"/>mentary estimates to be brought down this 
     <lb/>
     session a very large sum of money should 
     <lb/>
     be granted in aid of the people of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Bear in mind also that while the 
     <lb/>
     population that is going in there now very 
     <lb/>
     largely comes from the United States, 
     <lb/>
     Europe and Great Britain, a considerable 
     <lb/>
     percentage, in fact I should imagine 30 or 40 
     <lb/>
     per cent, are your own brothers, and sisters, 
     <lb/>
     and sons from the eastern provinces. Are 
     <lb/>
     you going to allow them to endure the hard<lb break="no"/>ships that your forefathers had to endure 
     <lb/>
     here in the Ottawa district, and other dis<lb break="no"/>tricts of eastern Canada ? I say times have 
     <lb/>
     changed, and those people should have 
     <lb/>
     enough money to support their schools, to 
     <lb/>
     build their bridges, and to make the neces<lb break="no"/>sary improvements to keep pace with the 
     <lb/>
     advancing population. I may remark to the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General, as I remarked the other 
     <lb/>
     day to his deputy, that he should not ex<lb break="no"/>pect to get, in a new country like that, 
     <lb/>
     sufficient revenue to run the post offices. 
     <lb/>
     In Ontario where your farmers are settled 
     <lb/>
     on 50 to 100 acres of land, it is quite easy 
     <lb/>
     to have a post office where there is no 
     <lb/>
     settler further than three miles from the 
     <lb/>
     post ofiice; but out there where the settler 
     <lb/>
     has got to occupy 320 acre: of land to make 
     <lb/>
     it pay, you cannot expect, at least for some 
     <lb/>

     time, that the post offices are going to pay.<lb/>You have got to charge up any deficiency in<lb/>your postal department to some other appro<lb break="no"/>priation. You can charge it to immigration if<lb/>you like. But I say post offices ought to be<lb/>given to the people out there without any<lb/>regard to whether there is sufficient revenue<lb/>to make them pay. I think that in the sub<lb break="no"/>sidies to be brought down at a subsequent<lb/>period of the session, there should be a sum<lb/>of at least $200,000 or $250,000 to supplement<lb/>the grants already made to provide for run<lb break="no"/>ning the territories.<lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. Hon. gentlemen from the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories have referred to 
     <lb/>
     this matter as being of interest to eastern 
     <lb/>
     members, and I take the liberty of discuss<lb break="no"/>ing it from that point of view. I listened 
     <lb/>
     with a great deal of attention to the re<lb break="no"/>marks of the hon. member for Assini<lb break="no"/>boia (Mr. Scott), and of the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who has just taken his seat (Mr. McCreary), 
     <lb/>
     who represents a Manitoba constituency. 
     <lb/>
     The point these gentlemen from the terri<lb break="no"/>tories made was that a provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment should be granted to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     territories. The hon. member for Selkirk 
     <lb/>
     says it should not be given to the territories 
     <lb/>
     owing to the friction that exists there at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCREARY</persName>. I did not say that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I took down his words,  
     <lb/>
     and I think that is what he said. Now,  
     <lb/>
     I would like to ask my hon. friend, and 
     <lb/>
     the minister too, if there is friction now,  
     <lb/>
     and we all know there is more or less, how  
     <lb/>
     is it going to be avoided if you create the 
     <lb/>
     territory into a province ? Doubtless these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen have perused the report of nego<lb break="no"/>tiations that have taken place between the 
     <lb/>
     authorities of the North-west Territories and 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government ; they know full 
     <lb/>
     well that for some years past a strong agi<lb break="no"/>tation has taken place there with a view 
     <lb/>
     of forming those territories into a province. 
     <lb/>
     Why ? Because the people find that the 
     <lb/>
     immigrants coming in there in large num<lb break="no"/>bers have changed the conditions, and en<lb break="no"/>tail additional expense on the government 
     <lb/>
     of the territories, and that the amount at 
     <lb/>
     present given by the Dominion government 
     <lb/>
     is insufficient. Therefore they are agitating 
     <lb/>
     for a provincial government so that they 
     <lb/>
     may be put on the same footing as other 
     <lb/>
     provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I think the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     said in his letter to the Hon. Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     that the population in the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories was too sparse, that was one of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons why the government of Canada re<lb break="no"/>fused to organize the territories into a pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The next reason given was that the 
     <lb/>
     increased population going into those terri<lb break="no"/>tories was changing the conditions, and that 
     <lb/>
     the government of Canada did not think it 
     <lb/>
     wise at present to organize a province, as 
     <lb/>
     it might soon be necessary to have more 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
        
        
     provinces than one. The Minister of the<lb/>Interior, in his letter of the 21st of March,<lb/>1901, admitted that this question was of<lb/>the utmost importance to the people of<lb/>the North-west Territories. I think he sug<lb break="no"/>gested that the authorities of the territories<lb/>should meet the federal executive with a<lb/>view of arriving at some conclusion on the<lb/>matter. I think these are three of the<lb/>points in that letter sent by the Hon. Mr.<lb/>Sifton stating why the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment did not grant their prayer. Now,<lb/>we are in Committee of the Whole here<lb/>and my hon. friends from the North-west<lb/>are in a position to speak more than once 
     <lb/>
     on this question. Let me ask them, do 
     <lb/>
     they differ with the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior in his conclusion, and if they do, 
     <lb/>
     will they say so ? They must know some  
     <lb/>
     thing of the facts in the document brought 
     <lb/>
     down in the North-west Assembly the other 
     <lb/>
     day. Do they consider that the territory 
     <lb/>
     there mentioned should comprise one pro<lb break="no"/>vince or more ? If they think it should 
     <lb/>
     comprise more than one province I think it 
     <lb/>
     is their duty to say so in this House. The 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada should not be kept in the 
     <lb/>
     dark on this subject. It is in the interest 
     <lb/>
     of the people of the east as well as of the 
     <lb/>
     west to know whether there should be one 
     <lb/>
     province or two, and whether the terri<lb break="no"/>torial government is at present adminis<lb break="no"/>tered in the interest of the people of Can<lb break="no"/>ada as a whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another question and it is whether 
     <lb/>
     the present machinery of the territories can 
     <lb/>
     be extended cheaper than creating new 
     <lb/>
     machinery. The question is whether there 
     <lb/>
     is any justification for refusing to organize 
     <lb/>
     these territories into a province. If we go 
     <lb/>
     to the far eastern provinces of Canada we 
     <lb/>
     find that the population comprising what is 
     <lb/>
     now the province of Prince  Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     was much less when it was organized into 
     <lb/>
     a province than the population of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCREARY</persName>. It had a much smaller  
     <lb/>
     population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr.  INGRAM</persName>. Yes, a much smaller popu<lb break="no"/>lation.  We find also that the territories to<lb break="no"/>day have as large a population as British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia when British Columbia was 
     <lb/>
     brought in as a province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Quite a bit larger. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr.  INGRAM</persName>. Yes, quite a bit larger. 
     <lb/>
     Now, let us make a comparison with the 
     <lb/>
     area of the North-west Territories with that 
     <lb/>
     of British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     If the  territories are brought in as they are 
     <lb/>
     proposed to be, I believe the area of the 
     <lb/>
     new province sought to be organized would 
     <lb/>
     be about 302,000 square miles. British Col<lb break="no"/>umbia has 383,000 square miles, Ontario 222,<lb break="no"/>000 square miles, and Quebec 228,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles. I find that so far as area is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, the people of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories are as much entitled to be organized 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <pb n="3081" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1902-04-18_Page_03081.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3081</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 18, 1902</fw> <fw type="num">3082</fw>
       
       
       
     into a province as are these other provinces 
     <lb/>
     which I have named and so far as popula<lb break="no"/>tion is concerned they are in a better posi<lb break="no"/>tion than Prince Edward Island and British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia. If the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories are, organized into a province I 
     <lb/>
     hold that they would be able as local auth<lb break="no"/>orities to understand their requirements 
     <lb/>
     very much better than we could as members 
     <lb/>
     of this House or as members of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion government. I say that it would be 
     <lb/>
     better in the interests of the. local govern<lb break="no"/>ment that the request should be acceded to 
     <lb/>
     and that the reasons given by the hon. Mini<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior are not sufficient why 
     <lb/>
     these people should be refused to be or<lb break="no"/>ganized into a province. Some better rea<lb break="no"/>son should be given why these people should 
     <lb/>
     be refused that which they believe to be in 
     <lb/>
     their own interests. Let as take another 
     <lb/>
     point : I recognize that there are some very 
     <lb/>
     ticklish questions that come up in the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent provinces. I recognize that the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act gives each province 
     <lb/>
     certain rights as to the administration of 
     <lb/>
     its own affairs, and we know as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     fact that the residents of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories of all classes and of all creeds 
     <lb/>
     will be alive to their interests, and that once 
     <lb/>
     you undertake to organize them into a pro<lb break="no"/>vince and give them rights under the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act they will be very jealous 
     <lb/>
     of these rights and may be. hard to please. 
     <lb/>
     Is that the chief reason why the govern<lb break="no"/>ment refuse to organize these people into a 
     <lb/>
     province? It strikes me after considering 
     <lb/>
     the whole question as carefully as I can, 
     <lb/>
     that there is really more in that objection 
     <lb/>
     than there is in the reasons given by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. minister who represents the govern<lb break="no"/>ment in this matter. I do not desire to take 
     <lb/>
     up more of the time of the committee, nor 
     <lb/>
     do I wish to advocate an expensive form of 
     <lb/>
     government. but. taking the viewS of the 
     <lb/>
     representatives who come. from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. who have expressed them<lb break="no"/>selves in favour of the organization of these 
     <lb/>
     territories into a province. I for one, feel 
     <lb/>
     that if they can do that without imposing 
     <lb/>
     any additional burdens on the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country they are justified in advocating 
     <lb/>
     that course. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCREARY</persName>. Leaving to one side the 
     <lb/>
     question of provincial autonomy for the ter<lb break="no"/>ritories at present, leaving that question to 
     <lb/>
     be settled by the territorial government at 
     <lb/>
     the next general elections, we will say, tak<lb break="no"/>ing the situation as we find it may I ask the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman if he will endorse the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in increasing the subsidy by say 
     <lb/>
     $200,000 a year ? Let him commit himself 
     <lb/>
     upon that point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. The hon. member for Sel<lb break="no"/>kirk (Mr. McCreary has not been long 
     <lb/>
     enough in this House to get an answer 
     <lb/>
     from me to a question of that kind. I have 
     <lb/>
     been too long in this House to answer any 
     <lb/>
     questions of that kind. If the members of 
     <lb/>
           
           
            <cb/>
        
        
     the opposition occupied seats on the govern<lb break="no"/>ment side of the House, I would be very 
     <lb/>
     glad to hear the leader of my party answer 
     <lb/>
     that question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV4">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. In consequence of the sug<lb break="no"/>gestion thrown out by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Elgin (Mr. Ingram), it may be thought 
     <lb/>
     by members of the committee that there was 
     <lb/>
     some question as to the position taken by 
     <lb/>
     the government of the North-west Territor<lb break="no"/>ies on this subject of provincial organization. 
     <lb/>
     There is no question whatever on that point. 
     <lb/>
     The North-west territorial government has 
     <lb/>
     gone so far as to lay a proposed Bill for the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of the territories into a pro<lb break="no"/>vince before the government 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. Does the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Oliver) approve of that Bill as he finds 
     <lb/>
     it ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV4">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I think, if the Bill is agreed 
     <lb/>
     to in all its provisions. that it would be a 
     <lb/>
     very satisfactory arrangement, but, of 
     <lb/>
     course, whether I would agree to the for<lb break="no"/>mation of a province or not would depend 
     <lb/>
     entirely on the terms of the agreement. I 
     <lb/>
     hope the hon. gentleman will understand 
     <lb/>
     that, but I think that I would be perfectly 
     <lb/>
     safe in endorsing the Bill as it is prepared. 
     <lb/>
     If a province can be secured on those terms 
     <lb/>
     I think it would be a satisfactory arrange<lb break="no"/>ment to the people of the territories. What 
     <lb/>
     I wanted to particularly point out was that 
     <lb/>
     the people of the territories are not respon<lb break="no"/>sible in any shape or manner for coming to 
     <lb/>
     this parliament and making any indefinite 
     <lb/>
     demand. They came and made a definite 
     <lb/>
     demand and if that definite demand is not 
     <lb/>
     accepted, then, we say the only alternative 
     <lb/>
     you should take is that you should ascer<lb break="no"/>tain what their requirements are and meet 
     <lb/>
     these requirements. I wish to add to what 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Selkirk (Mr. McCreary) 
     <lb/>
     has said in regard to the making of ex<lb break="no"/>penditures in the territories. I had the 
     <lb/>
     honour to be a member of the local 
     <lb/>
     assembly for a number of years and 
     <lb/>
     without going into details I will back up 
     <lb/>
     the broad assertion made by that hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman that there is no province in this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion and there is no country in the 
     <lb/>
     world, where every dollar of revenue goes 
     <lb/>
     as far in meeting the actual requirements of 
     <lb/>
     the public service as in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. That is as has been and that is 
     <lb/>as it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I would like to ask the 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman (Mr. Oliver) a question. The 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman has not answered the point 
     <lb/>raised by the hon. Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>representing the government. He said that 
     <lb/>organization having been refused he is pre<lb break="no"/>pared to take the alternative of increasing 
     <lb/>the subsidy as the next best thing, but the 
     <lb/>point that the hon. gentleman who repre<lb break="no"/>sents the North-west Territories should 
     <lb/>make clear is this: Does the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man approve of the ground and steps taken 
     <lb/>by the hon. Minister of the Interior. repre<lb break="no"/>

     senting the government? Does he think 
     <lb/>
     the reasons given by the hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior are sufficient reasons for refus<lb break="no"/>ing the North-west Territories organization

     into a province.

     <persName ref="pers:OLIV4">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. In the words of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. Ingram) I have been too 
     <lb/>
     long in the House. The question under con<lb break="no"/>sideration at the present time is, the vote

     of certain moneys, and that is what we are

     to discuss now and not to answer all ques<lb break="no"/>tions under the sun.

     Respecting present financial requirements the

    question of an increase in your subsidies is now 
     <lb/>receiving consideration, but the result cannot 
     <lb/>as you are aware be communicated until the

            <p>Here are the estimates now, and instead of 
     <lb/>an increase there is a decrease of $10,000. 
     <lb/>Last year there were $435,359 and this year 
     <lb/>they are $425,359. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. What I spoke about was the 
     <lb/>
     vote of $357,000 which is in reality the sub<lb break="no"/>sidy granted to the North-west Territories. 
     <lb/>
     There are some other items included in this 
     <lb/>
     vote, but that is the subsidy, and it is the 
     <lb/>
     same as last year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. And those other items ap<lb break="no"/>peared last year in the vote, and the fact 
     <lb/>
     remains that the vote for the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories is $10,000 less. The minister 
     <lb/>
     should tell us why this vote is not increased, 
     <lb/>
     and whether he intends to increase it or 
     <lb/>
     not. The member for East Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Douglas) told us that this question was sec<lb break="no"/>ond to none in importance before this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and if that be so; and hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men from the North-west Territories being
<lb/>friends (if the government they have the
<lb/>public documents at their disposal in the
<lb/>departments, and they should be prepared
<lb/>to come to this House and tell us whether
<lb/>they endorse the action of the government
<lb/>on that question or not. They have not done
<lb/>so, and it appears they are not going to do
<lb/>so. As an eastern member of this House,
<lb/>I say that the three objections raised in the
<lb/>letter of the Minister of the Interior are not 
<lb/>sufficient to warrant the government in re<lb break="no"/>fusing to give an increased subsidy.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV4">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. We are now discussing the
<lb/>vote for the North-west Territories and the
<lb/>hon. member (Mr. Ingram) ought to be satis<lb break="no"/>fied that we have placed ourselves thorough<lb break="no"/>ly on record on that point.<lb/> 
               <lb/>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOYD3">Mr. BOYD</persName>. I wish to say a few words 
     <lb/>
     on this question, and principally for the 
     <lb/>
     reason that last winter I had the pleasure 
     <lb/>
     of attending a public meeting at Indian 
     <lb/>
     Head in East Assiniboia, where about 1,000 
     <lb/>
     people were gathered to discuss this very 
     <lb/>
     question as to whether the territories should 
     <lb/>
     or should not have their own provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment or governments. Whatever doubt 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain may have had previous to 
     <lb/>
     that meeting, there was not the slightest 
     <lb/>
     doubt that the people present there were 
     <lb/>
     quite unanimous on the question. I could 
     <lb/>
     not help smiling when I heard the members 
     <lb/>
     for the territories speaking, and when I 
     <lb/>
     watched the only three or four ministers 
     <lb/>
     present and how they acted. The Post<lb break="no"/>master General and the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     were industriously reading their newspapers; 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Agriculture was busy with 
     <lb/>
     his letters; they were all very indifferent, 
     <lb/>
     and they thought the question of so little 
     <lb/>
     account that they took the first opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to get up and slide out of the House. They 
     <lb/>
     have left the whole thing to the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior. It is true that he has told 
     <lb/>
     the people of Manitoba and the North-west 
     <lb/>
     that he assumes responsibility and is to be 
     <lb/>
     held responsible for the management of that 
     <lb/>
     country, but if he were to tell us what he 
     <lb/>
     thinks to-night—I do not expect he will for 
     <lb/>
     he has been too long in the House for that— 
     <lb/>
     he would tell us that he really believes that 
     <lb/>
     he would give the people of the territories 
     <lb/>
     what they want. The objection raised by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman for Selkirk (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Creary) is not a good one. He tells us that 
     <lb/>
     when the country fills up with people we 
     <lb/>
     will be better able to know whether it is 
     <lb/>
     better to have one or two provinces—

<lb/>the more diversified will be the opinion. and
<lb/>the greater the difficulty in settling that<lb/>question as to whether it shall be one pro<lb break="no"/>vince or whether it shall be two provinces
<lb/>or three provinces. The meeting at Indian 
<lb/>Head was equally divided as to whether it
<lb/>should be one or two provinces. I am speak<lb break="no"/>ing now, frankly as a man who viewed the

     to each of the speakers. How would you

     judge the feeling of a meeting, except by 
     <lb/>
     the sentiments expressed by the people in 
     <lb/>
     front of you. Now then, I say that the 
     <lb/>
     government might just as well face the 
     <lb/>
     question at once. If we knew the truth of 
     <lb/>
     the matter I believe we would find that this 
     <lb/>
     is one of the questions that the cabinet is 
     <lb/>
     fighting like blazes about, because has not 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Public Works told us that 
     <lb/>
     they frequently fight like blazes on different 
     <lb/>
     questions ? If the truth were known, it is 
     <lb/>
     one of the questions which is causing trouble 
     <lb/>
     to this cabinet, formed of the ex-ministers 
     <lb/>
     of different provinces. It is not a question 
     <lb/>
     of finance or a question of the division or the 
     <lb/>
     territory, that is causing the delay. The 
     <lb/>
     government might just as well admit that 
     <lb/>
     the delay is caused by the question of the 
     <lb/>
     schools, and the question of the language, 
     <lb/>
     and don't think for a moment that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in the North-west are not pretty well 
     <lb/>
     aware of that. You might just as well face 
     <lb/>
     the question now, and the less people you 
     <lb/>
     have in the territories the more easily it can 
     <lb/>
     be dealt with. At the Indian Head meet<lb break="no"/>ing the complaint was that the territories 
     <lb/>
     were not able to aid railways, were not able 
     <lb/>
     to do what they would do in the matter of 
     <lb/>
     transportation, and what they would do if 
     <lb/>
     they had their provincial government. That 
     <lb/>
     is the important question that is now agit<lb break="no"/>ating the people of the territories. I agree 
     <lb/>
     with my hon. friend from East Elgin (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ingram) that the gentlemen representing 
     <lb/>
     the territories should speak out frankly on 
     <lb/>
     this subject. I understand the difficulties of 
     <lb/>
     supporters of a government. I have been 
     <lb/>
     over there. But if they would speak out 
     <lb/>
     frankly and say whether or not they ap<lb break="no"/>prove of the action of the government in 
     <lb/>
     this instance, they would be giving much 
     <lb/>
     more satisfaction to their constituents than 
     <lb/>
     they are doing by the little by-play which 
     <lb/>
     we have had here this evening. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DOUG2">Mr. DOUGLAS</persName>. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who has just taken his seat draws his con<lb break="no"/>clusions from the meeting at Indian Head, 
     <lb/>
     he is very gravely mistaken as to the state 
     <lb/>
     of feeling on this question in Eastern As<lb break="no"/>siniboia. I think I can safely say that not 
     <lb/>
     one-tenth of the people there are in favour 
     <lb/>
     of provincial autonomy in the immediate 
     <lb/>
     future. They know that it must come and 
     <lb/>
     that we must prepare for it; but it would 
     <lb/>
     saddle additional burdens on the people. 
     <lb/>
     They feel that under existing circum<lb break="no"/>stances they could not carry out even a 
     <lb/>
     complete municipal organization because of 
     <lb/>
     the sparseness of settlement. There may 
     <lb/>
     perhaps be a few people or a considerable 
     <lb/>
     number of people about Indian Head who 
     <lb/>
     desire provincial autonomy, who have the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that it would enable them to get 
     <lb/>
     more support for the development of the 
     <lb/>
     country in the way of building railways. 
     <lb/>
     I remember very well the argument of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain, the premier of the North-west 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
          
          
     Territories. He argued that there should 
     <lb/>
     be only one province, because the larger 
     <lb/>
     the province the greater its facility in rais<lb break="no"/>ing money to build railroads; but if that is 
     <lb/>
     an argument, then it is better that the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories should remain under the supervision 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion government, which has 
     <lb/>
     better credit in the money markets of the 
     <lb/>
     world than any province could possibly 
     <lb/>
     have. Therefore, under existing circum<lb break="no"/>stances and for some years to come, I think 
     <lb/>
     we are better as we are than we could pos<lb break="no"/>sibly be with provincial autonomy. We 
     <lb/>
     know it must come, and no progressive set<lb break="no"/>tler would desire to retard it unduly; but 
     <lb/>
     just now it would certainly impose addi<lb break="no"/>tional burdens on the people, and, voicing 
     <lb/>
     the sentiment of Eastern Assiniboia, I would 
     <lb/>
     state decidedly that as far as I can inter<lb break="no"/>pret the feeling of the people, they are not 
     <lb/>
     in favour of provincial autonomy immedi<lb break="no"/>ately. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOYD3">Mr. BOYD</persName>. As the hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     been a long time in the country, I would 
     <lb/>
     like to ask him how long a time would it 
     <lb/>
     be before it would be ready for provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy? I am very glad he has placed 
     <lb/>
     himself squarely before his people on this 
     <lb/>
     point.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DOUG2">Mr. DOUGLAS</persName>. Quite so ; we do not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate at all. In meetings where we have op<lb break="no"/>portunities to test the feelings of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, they do not support the immediate for<lb break="no"/>mation of new provinces. I am not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to say how long it should be. If the 
     <lb/>
     population goes on increasing as it has been 
     <lb/>
     doing of late years, it may come in the near 
     <lb/>
     future; but certainly, under existing cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, I am not prepared to advocate 
     <lb/>
     the immediate organization of the country 
     <lb/>
     into provinces.

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Would not the 
     <lb/>
     question of additional burdens depend alto<lb break="no"/>gether on the terms under which the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories were formed into a pro<lb break="no"/>vince? And are not the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     and his friends arguing now that the sub<lb break="no"/>sidies should be increased? If the subsi<lb break="no"/>dies were increased and the territories were 
     <lb/>
     formed into a province, what difference 
     <lb/>
     would it make? I do not understand the 
     <lb/>
     logical conclusion of the hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     remarks.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DOUG2">Mr. DOUGLAS</persName>. We are asking an in<lb break="no"/>crease in the subsidy not as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     charity, but as a matter of right, in view 
     <lb/>
     of the increased population and the grow<lb break="no"/>ing demands on the funds of the terri<lb break="no"/>torial government, because it is found that 
     <lb/>
    they cannot possibly overtake the work 
     <lb/>which is brought under their notice, re<lb break="no"/>tain the population, and minister to their 
     <lb/>comfort and consolidation in the country 
     <lb/>without an addition to the subsidy. As I 
     <lb/>understand, a certain amount has been 
     <lb/>granted in each province per head of the. 
     <lb/>population. This the government has been

     at periods of some ten years have drawn 
     <lb/>
     on the fund in favour of the province or

     the territory. What we wish them to do 
     <lb/>
     in this case, in view of the rapid increase 
     <lb/>
     of population, is not only to give us the 
     <lb/>
     proportionate grant per head that is given 
     <lb/>
     in the other provinces, but to discount the 
     <lb/>
     future and enable the government of the

     territories to overtake the work which is

     piling up in their hands.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Perhaps I have 
     <lb/>
     not made myself clear to my hon. friend; 
     <lb/>
     but certainly he has not made himself very 
     <lb/>
     clear to me. I asked him how provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy could possibly increase the bur<lb break="no"/>dens of the people if adequate terms were 
     <lb/>
     given to the North-west Territories, which 
     <lb/>
     I understand perfectly are being asked, not 
     <lb/>
     as a matter of charity, but as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     right. I did not suggest that they were 
     <lb/>
     asked as a matter of charity. Whether or 
     <lb/>
     not the territories are formed into a pro<lb break="no"/>vince cannot possibly affect the burdens of 
     <lb/>
     the people, if a subsidy which the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories regard as adequate is given 
     <lb/>
     to them when they are formed into a pro<lb break="no"/>vince ; and we know that such an adequate 
     <lb/>
     subsidy is being asked now. Then, how 
     <lb/>
     can the establishment of provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the territories result in any addi<lb break="no"/>tional burdens on the people? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DOUG2">Mr. DOUGLAS</persName>. I think I can answer the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's question. The burdens I 
     <lb/>
     have reference to are simply these: If we 
     <lb/>
     have two provinces, or probably three, 
     <lb/>
     we shall require three separate sets 
     <lb/>
     of buildings, three sets of organiza<lb break="no"/>tion, and a large body of officials all 
     <lb/>
     over the country, which at present we 
     <lb/>
     do not need. It is one thing to speak 
     <lb/>
     of one of the older provinces main<lb break="no"/>taining municipal organization to the full 
     <lb/>
     extent to which it is enjoyed in Ontario 
     <lb/>
     and Quebec, and quite another thing to deal 
     <lb/>
     with a country where the people live four 
     <lb/>
     or six or eight miles apart, and where you 
     <lb/>
     may have a stretch of fifteen miles with 
     <lb/>
     nobody living upon it. Hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     need to know the country, the immens<lb break="no"/>ity of the area, and the necessity of this 
     <lb/>
     area being filled up, in order to maintain 
     <lb/>
     and carry out with comfort and success 
     <lb/>
     municipal organization. So that we believe 
     <lb/>
     the burdens of the people would be very 
     <lb/>
     largely increased, and the taxation would 
     <lb/>
     became much higher than it is in any of 
     <lb/>
     the older provinces. Hence we say it is 
     <lb/>
     better to delay somewhat the organization 
     <lb/>
     of the country into provinces, and to wait 
     <lb/>
     until it is more fully settled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I take it, from the re<lb break="no"/>marks of the hon. gentleman, that in the 
     <lb/>
     constituency he represents the feeling of 
     <lb/>
     the people is not in favour of provincial 
     <lb/>
     organization. I understand that the major<lb break="no"/>ity of the local representatives coming from

            <cb/>
       
       
     his constituency support Mr. Haultain's 
     <lb/>
     government. I find that at Yorkton, which 
     <lb/>
     I think is in the hon. gentleman's consti<lb break="no"/>tuency, Mr. Haultain made this statement— 
     <lb/>
     I am quoting from the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia : 
     <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Before the local elections in 1898, the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain spoke at various points through<lb break="no"/>out the territories on this subject, and I shall 
     <lb/>
     quote from the language he used at one place 
     <lb/>
     to show that even three years ago this change 
     <lb/>
     was looked forward to and that the present 
     <lb/>
     legislature of the territories was in reality 
     <lb/>
     given a mandate to open up negotiations with 
     <lb/>
     respect to the subject. Speaking at Yorkton, 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Mr. Haultain said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If the financial question is capable of other 
     <lb/>
    solution, I will be satisfied to remain as at 
     <lb/>present. The only thing there seems to be to 
     <lb/>do is to think at least of negotiating for pro<lb break="no"/>vincial establishment. I feel convinced that 
     <lb/>it will be the principal work of the new legis<lb break="no"/>lature before the end of its four years' term 
     <lb/>to enter into such negotiations. With the 
     <lb/>greater development that now seems assured, 
     <lb/>the needs in respect of schools and improve<lb break="no"/>ment will certainly develop. Outside of direct 
     <lb/>taxation, there seems no possibility of a solu<lb break="no"/>tion except by provincial establishment.

            <p>That language was used, I take it, all over 
     <lb/>the territories during the contest previous 
     <lb/>to 1898. Then what do we find ? When 
     <lb/>these very same representatives went to 
     <lb/>the North-west Territories legislature, this 
     <lb/>document, with several other sections 
     <lb/>was passed unanimously by the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the North-west Territories. And 
     <lb/>here is a sample of these several clauses

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. It might cost him some<lb break="no"/>thing. I do not say that that is the case, 
     <lb/>
     but where a large landholder might find his 
     <lb/>
     taxes increased were the territories given 
     <lb/>
     provincial organization, that might be a 
     <lb/>
     justifiable reason for his opposing such a 
     <lb/>
     policy. I do not charge him with being 
     <lb/>
     actuated by such a motive, because of course 
     <lb/>
     it is not his personal interest that he is 
     <lb/>
     considering, but the interests of his con<lb break="no"/>stituents.

     East Assinaboia (Mr. Douglas) have any

     <lb/>
     prompt every person in the territories to

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. The hon. gentleman from 
     <lb/>
     Elgin (Mr. Ingram) was not frank enough 
     <lb/>
     to answer the question put to him. Very 
     <lb/>
     properly, in connection with the item in the 
     <lb/>
     estimates to provide a sum to enable the 
     <lb/>
     North-west government to carry on its ad<lb break="no"/>ministration this year, a straight question 
     <lb/>
     was put, and he declined to answer it. I 
     <lb/>
     shall be more frank than he was. I notice 
     <lb/>
     that he had last year's 'Hansard' before 
     <lb/>
     him. He has been quoting from the remarks 
     <lb/>
     I made last year on the subject of auton<lb break="no"/>omy. and probably does not need to be told 
     <lb/>
     what my answer is to the question he 
     <lb/>
     asked North-west members to answer. I 
     <lb/>
     said that I believed the time had come 
     <lb/>
    when the question of giving the territories 
     <lb/>provincial rights should be taken up and 
     <lb/>dealt with. As far as I am concerned, I 
     <lb/>believe that the people in the territories in 
     <lb/>general are ready to accept provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy. Of course they are not unanimous, 
     <lb/>and I think that if the powers at Ottawa 
     <lb/>wait until they are, they will wait until 
     <lb/>Kingdom come, because neither on that or 
     <lb/>any other question will the people of so 
     <lb/>large. an area ever entertain one opinion. 
     <lb/>It is a fact, as has been stated by my hon. 
     <lb/>friend opposite, that the population of the 
     <lb/>territories now is vastly larger than was 
     <lb/>that of Manitoba when that part of the 
     <lb/>country was formed into a province. It is 
     <lb/>probably 600 or 700 per cent greater, and if 
     <lb/>the population of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>is not as large to-day as that of the province 
     <lb/>of British Columbia with a smaller area, it 
     <lb/>will be before the close of the present year.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). What is the 
     <lb/>
     population of the territories and British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia respectively ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. According to the census 
     <lb/>
     of a year ago, the population of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories was in the neighbourhood 
     <lb/>
     of 160,000 and that of British Columbia a 
     <lb/>
     little less than 200,000; but we received in 
     <lb/>
     the territories last year a very large im<lb break="no"/>
      
      
            <cb/>
      
      
     migration, the exact number of which can<lb break="no"/>not be stated. To-day, however, I think we 
     <lb/>
     have a population of between 180,000 and 
     <lb/>
     190,000, and probably before the end of the 
     <lb/>
     year it will have swelled to 220,000 or 230,<lb break="no"/>000. I have stated my own opinion very 
     <lb/>
     positively, but at the same time there is a 
     <lb/>
     large number of people who are very much 
     <lb/>
     of the opinion expressed by my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from East Assiniboia (Mr. Douglas), and as 
     <lb/>
     has been stated by Mr. Haultain, the pre<lb break="no"/>mier of the territories—whose remarks were 
     <lb/>
     quoted a moment ago—if a sufficient 
     <lb/>
     grant were made annually by this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, there would be no cry from the terri<lb break="no"/>tories for provincial establishment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DOUG2">Mr. DOUGLAS</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Year after year, however, 
     <lb/>
     the local authorities in the territories have 
     <lb/>
     been obliged to come to Ottawa for an in<lb break="no"/>crease in the grant. In some years they 
     <lb/>
     obtained an increase fairly satisfactory, but 
     <lb/>
     the position taken by the Northwest govern<lb break="no"/>ment to-day is that which I am sup<lb break="no"/>porting. If my hon. friends in this govern<lb break="no"/>ment would agree to an increase perfectly 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory for this year, still it would 
     <lb/>
     be better for the territories that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of provincial establishment should be 
     <lb/>
     taken up and dealt with, because next year 
     <lb/>
     we will find our needs again largely in<lb break="no"/>creased, and the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     would have a difficult task in obtaining from 
     <lb/>
     this House the increase required. Even if 
     <lb/>
     he were able to provide this year the neces<lb break="no"/>sary increase, one which would be perfectly 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory, the position next year would 
     <lb/>
     be just as it has been heretofore. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The testimony which has been borne by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friends from Selkirk (Mr. McCreary) 
     <lb/>
     and Alberta (Mr. Oliver) to the character of 
     <lb/>
    government which the people of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories have been enjoying for years past, 
     <lb/>is a fair argument which can be urged 
     <lb/>in favour of their being granted provincial 
     <lb/>autonomy. I am willing to join in the as<lb break="no"/>sertion which has been made that better 
     <lb/>government than has been enjoyed in the 
     <lb/>last ten years by the people of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories has not been enjoyed by the people 
     <lb/>of any province in the Dominion. We 
     <lb/>have as able, shrewd, judicious and careful 
     <lb/>men at the head of our government as are 
     <lb/>at the head of government in any province 
     <lb/>of the Dominion. We have an educational 
     <lb/>system, which was framed by Premier 
     <lb/>Haultain, and in which my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>Alberta had a hand, when he was a member 
     <lb/>of the legislative assembly, which has not 
     <lb/>a superior anywhere in the Dominion. We 
     <lb/>have in the matter of education, a system 
     <lb/>as satisfactory as that which now prevails 
     <lb/>in Manitoba, and we have arrived at that 
     <lb/>position without any of the turmoil which 
     <lb/>was created before the Manitoba system 
     <lb/>could be brought to its present satisfactory 
     <lb/>state. But we are getting a little beside. 
     <lb/>the question. I did not intend this evening 
     <lb/>to give rise to any lengthy discussion upon 
     <lb/>
        
        
    
            <pb n="3091" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1902-04-18_Page_03091.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3092</fw>
        
        
     the question of provincial autonomy. We 
     <lb/>
     are dealing now with the grant to the 
     <lb/>
     North-west assembly for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     carrying on their business this year, and it 
     <lb/>
     would not do our people any particular good 
     <lb/>
     this year if the House were to decide that 
     <lb/>
     full provincial powers ought to be granted 
     <lb/>
     and at the same time allow the vote for the 
     <lb/>
     present year to remain as it is, and leave us, 
     <lb/>
     in some measure, in a state of starvation. 
     <lb/>
     </p>
            
            <p>I think we should direct our attention, as 
     <lb/>I endeavoured to direct my remarks in the 
     <lb/>first instance, to the question of the vote 
     <lb/>and to providing this session for a consid<lb break="no"/>erable enlargement of it. Possibly, it would 
     <lb/>not be out of order to make the comparison 
     <lb/>of the vote for this service, a service for 
     <lb/>which this parliament is entirely respon<lb break="no"/>sible, and the votes for other services. My 
     <lb/>hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) did 
     <lb/>make a comparison in one particular. I 
     <lb/>have taken the pains to copy the total 
     <lb/>figures devoted to some services voted for 
     <lb/>by parliament. I may say that, for fear 
     <lb/>some of our friends might say I was intro<lb break="no"/>ducing sectional questions, I have taken 
     <lb/>votes which apply to one part of this country 
     <lb/>as much as to any other. For penitentiar<lb break="no"/>ies, we spend a total of $491,490, consider<lb break="no"/>ably in excess of the amount deemed to be 
     <lb/>sufficient for the whole purposes of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the North-west Territories. Leg<lb break="no"/>islation costs $446,290, entirely apart from 
     <lb/>the.indemnity paid to the members of par<lb break="no"/>liament. This is the amount it costs to 
     <lb/>manage these parliament buildings and sup<lb break="no"/>ply the printing in connection with the 
     <lb/>work of parliament. To the Agriculture De<lb break="no"/>partment we vote about $400,000, apart 
     <lb/>from the vote for the taking of the census. 
     <lb/>Then, as my hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. 
     <lb/>Oliver) pointed out, we spend almost half 
     <lb/>a million dollars on immigration. That is, 
     <lb/>we spend fully as much to bring people 
     <lb/>into the North-west Territories as we spend 
     <lb/>for all their local needs after we get them 
     <lb/>there. Fisheries inspection costs $337,000, 
     <lb/>or almost as much as this Whole vote to 
     <lb/>the North-west Territories. The expense of 
     <lb/>looking after the Indians is considerably 
     <lb/>in excess of a million dollars. And, as the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Eastern Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>Douglas) remarked, we spend $417,000 for 
     <lb/>the education of Indian children, much more 
     <lb/>than we spend for the whole cost of educa<lb break="no"/>tion and all other punposes as well in the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories. 0n the North-west 
     <lb/>mounted police in that territory, one single 
     <lb/>service, we spend $400,000, and, on the 
     <lb/>mounted police in the Yukon $450,000. The 
     <lb/>Yukon government vote, which is exactly 
     <lb/>similar to the item under discussion and 
     <lb/>which applies to a country where there is 
     <lb/>not a population, probably, of more than 
     <lb/>25,000, costs $250,000. There is voted this 
     <lb/>year for superannuation, $328,000. almost 
     <lb/>as much as the entire vote for local govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the North-west Territories. I wish 
     <lb/>to say that I am not taking the slightest 
     <lb/>exception to these votes. Speaking more 
     <lb/>
   
   
            <cb/>
         
         
     particularly to my hon. friends in the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and to my friends on this side, 
     <lb/>
     I may say that it has been a matter of pride 
     <lb/>
     to us that the general services throughout 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion has been so well looked after 
     <lb/>
    since the Liberals came into power. Under 
     <lb/>the government's policy of a revenue 
     <lb/>tariff— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Whatever dispute there may 
     <lb/>
     be about the name, there is no question that 
     <lb/>
     it lives up to the name of a revenue tarilf, 
     <lb/>
     for under it Canada has been getting a suffi<lb break="no"/>cient revenue. And it has been a matter 
     <lb/>
     of pride to us that every service that has 
     <lb/>
     required looking after has been generously, 
     <lb/>
     properly and adequately looked after. But, 
     <lb/>
     unless a very considerable increase is made 
     <lb/>
     in the vote for the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     there is one item in which we shall be 
     <lb/>
     obliged to admit that there is no cause for 
     <lb/>
     pride.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). I am glad, that, 
     <lb/>
     in one respect the education of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend (Mr. Scott) is improving. I think he 
     <lb/>
     is one of the gentlemen who were not able 
     <lb/>
     to understand the meaning of the word 
     <lb/>
     'adequate' in a resolution lately moved in 
     <lb/>
     this House. I have noticed that in the var<lb break="no"/>ious addresses with which he has favoured 
     <lb/>
     the House, he has used that word at least 
     <lb/>
     fifteen or twenty times this evening. It is 
     <lb/>
     evident that during the period intervening 
     <lb/>
     he has made excellent use of the dictionary. 
     <lb/>
     I trust that some hon. gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     laboured under the same difficulty have been 
     <lb/>
     employing their leisure in the same excellent 
     <lb/>
     way.

     <lb/>
     hon. friend's endeavours have had such ex<lb break="no"/>cellent results. There is a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     food for reflection in what the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has said. I, for one, am convinced 
     <lb/>
     that the administration of the government 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories must have 
     <lb/>
     been carried on in a very excellent way in 
     <lb/>
     order to have given the people any semb<lb break="no"/>lance of provision for the public service, 
     <lb/>
     seeing they have what seems to me a very 
     <lb/>
     meagre sum, considering the large number 
     <lb/>
     of people and the enormous territory that 
     <lb/>
     has to be dealt with. It does seem that this 
     <lb/>
     service cannot, out of such a subsidy, be 
     <lb/>
     provided for quite as well as the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west have a right to expect 
     <lb/>
     having regard to the interests which have 
     <lb/>
     been mentioned by hon. gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site. I am still not quite clear as to what 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from East Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Douglas) means when he says that provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy would increase the burdens 
     <lb/>
     of the people. There are certain services 
     <lb/>
     to be provided for in the North-west. They 
     <lb/>
     must either be provided for by the people 
     <lb/>
     in that country themselves, or they must 
     <lb/>
     be provided for by all the people of the

     country, that is, through the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I do not see how the adoption 
     <lb/>
     of provincial autonomy will necessarily af<lb break="no"/>fect the question one way or the other. It 
     <lb/>
     is entirely a question of the terms upon 
     <lb/>
     which autonomy is established. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend who has just taken his seat (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Scott) has brought to the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House certain services upon which a good 
     <lb/>
     deal of money has been spent in this coun<lb break="no"/>try. We on this side might add to the illus<lb break="no"/>trations he has given. I might point out 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. gentleman that the bringing 
     <lb/>
     down of a contract with respect to the 
     <lb/>
     building of a railway in the Yukon eight 
     <lb/>
     days before the meeting of this parliament 
     <lb/>
     has resulted in a claim against the govern<lb break="no"/>ment which will probably cost this coun<lb break="no"/>try nearly as much as the whole grant to 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories in one year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. That was the fault of an 
     <lb/>
     out of date Senate.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). I would be in<lb break="no"/>clined to think it was the fault of a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment that was not able to wait for 
     <lb/>
     eight days until the parliament met and 
     <lb/>
     the matter could be dealt with. Of course, 
     <lb/>
     these are different points of view. Another 
     <lb/>
     thing I would call the attention of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen to is that this government spent, 
     <lb/>
     I think unnecessarily—and I think anybody 
     <lb/>
     who fairly examines the evidence will say 
     <lb/>
     unnecessarily—in the purchase of the Drum<lb break="no"/>mond County Railway, enough to double 
     <lb/>
     the subsidy to the Territories for five or six 
     <lb/>
     years. The same remark is true of the con<lb break="no"/>tract this government made with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the Grand Trunk Railway and also with 
     <lb/>
     regard to a great many public works in 
     <lb/>
     respect to which, during the past five or 
     <lb/>
     six years, enormous sums of money have 
     <lb/>
     been, as I believe, spent unjustifiably and 
     <lb/>
     extravagantly. I have no doubt that if a 
     <lb/>
     proper system of administration had been 
     <lb/>
     adopted with regard to a great many of these 
     <lb/>
     works, the amount granted to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories might have been increased 
     <lb/>
     50 per cent during the past five or six years 
     <lb/>
     without increasing the burdens of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this country by a single dollar. As 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend has brought some illustra<lb break="no"/>tions with regard to this subject, I thought 
     <lb/>
     it only right to remind him of this, because 
     <lb/>
     he has given me some food for reflection 
     <lb/>
     in the sensible remarks he has made, and 
     <lb/>
     I desire to give him food for reflection with 
     <lb/>
     regard to these matters, and I trust he will 
     <lb/>
     take my remarks as much to heart as I have 
     <lb/>
     in all sincerity taken to heart the remarks 
     <lb/>
     he has addressed to the House on that 
     <lb/>
     subject.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). At last we have 
     <lb/>
     had one member from the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories on the other side of the House 
     <lb/>
     coming out and expressing himself as 
     <lb/>
     strongly opposed, at the present time at any 
     <lb/>
     rate to provincial autonomy being granted 
     <lb/>
     to the territories. I think he is the only 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <cb/>
      
      
     member from the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     who has had the boldness to come out and 
     <lb/>
     in explicit terms to take that stand. But 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman, I think, when he was 
     <lb/>
     elected in 1896, came to this House as an 
     <lb/>
     independent, he came as representing a pa<lb break="no"/>tron organization, and he rather scorned the 
     <lb/>
     average Conservative or Liberal who came 
     <lb/>
     down here to be caucused with the rest of 
     <lb/>
     the members, and to respond to the party 
     <lb/>
     lash. I notice that he is now just as servile 
     <lb/>
     a supporter of the government as you will 
     <lb/>
     find on the other side, and he does not think 
     <lb/>
     it any disgrace now to be caucused with 
     <lb/>
     other members, and to respond to the party 
     <lb/>
     lash with the best of them; so much so, 
     <lb/>
     that he is willing to give credit to the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment for having taken a stand that will 
     <lb/>
     displease the people of the territories, in re<lb break="no"/>fusing to grant them provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     at the present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DOUG2">Mr. DOUGLAS</persName>. May I ask a question ? 
     <lb/>
     The people of the west have not asked for 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy, and the 'member for 
     <lb/>
     East Assiniboia (Mr. Douglas) is not ad<lb break="no"/>vocating nor opposing provincial autonomy. 
     <lb/>
     He has only stated that in his judgment the 
     <lb/>
     time has not fully come when it ought to be 
     <lb/>
     given, but it must come in the near future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). Now the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Assiniboia has stated that 
     <lb/>
     the people of the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     have not asked for provincial autonomy. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to know who their government 
     <lb/>
     represents. Does not the government repre<lb break="no"/>sent the people? Do they not voice the 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of the people, and has not the 
     <lb/>
     territorial assembly asked this parliament 
     <lb/>
     to grant them provincial autonomy? You 
     <lb/>
     may just as well say that this government 
     <lb/>
     do not represent the people of Canada at 
     <lb/>
     the present time, as in many things I grant 
     <lb/>
     they do not. But the member for East 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia stated in his remarks that he did 
     <lb/>
     not think the time had fully come when it 
     <lb/>
     would be wise to grant provincial autonomy. 
     <lb/>
     I do not know what he means by that quali<lb break="no"/>fied statement. Probably next session, if 
     <lb/>
     the government comes down with a Bill 
     <lb/>
     granting provincial autonomy, he will be 
     <lb/>
     the first to get up and give them credit for 
     <lb/>
     it, stating that he is very glad to see them 
     <lb/>
     do it, and I have no doubt that had they 
     <lb/>
     taken that stand on this occasion, he would 
     <lb/>
     have been equally ready to give. them credit 
     <lb/>
     for so doing. That shows what a good party 
     <lb/>
     man he is. Now after the declaration of 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior he falls in with 
     <lb/>
     the views of the government and says he 
     <lb/>
     believes the people of the territories do not 
     <lb/>
     desire provincial autonomy at the present 
     <lb/>
     time. One reason, he says. is that it will 
     <lb/>
     increase the burdens of the people. I think 
     <lb/>
     the question asked by the leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position was very appropriate. and I could 
     <lb/>
     not see exactly what the member for East 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia meant in his reply. As the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition has said, it rests en<lb break="no"/>

        tirely with the two governments as to whe<lb break="no"/>ther the burden of the people will be in<lb break="no"/>creased or not, according to the terms that 
     <lb/>
     will be made. I agree with the members 
     <lb/>
     from the territories that the present subsidy 
     <lb/>
     is not adequate; and by the way, the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition took the words out of my 
     <lb/>
     mouth when he jollied the member from 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) on his educa<lb break="no"/>tion having been advanced to that position 
     <lb/>
     that he understands that word adequate far 
     <lb/>
     better than he did when the budget debate 
     <lb/>
     was on.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. McCREARY</persName>. Probably the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman will be a little more definite on this 
     <lb/>
     point than he was on the tariff, and say 
     <lb/>
     what an adequate amount will be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). I will reply to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member in the words of the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the government when he was in opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, that is time enough to prescribe 
     <lb/>
     when you are called in. I hope the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will agree in the opinion of his 
     <lb/>
     chief. I admit that the subsidy granted 
     <lb/>
     at the present time to the territories is 
     <lb/>
     not sufficient. and if autonomy was granted 
     <lb/>
     to those territories, as a Manitoban I would 
     <lb/>
     be quite agreeable to see better terms 
     <lb/>
     granted to the new province, for then we 
     <lb/>
     would have a lever to get a little better 
     <lb/>
     terms ourselves. The member for West 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia says that at the present time, if 
     <lb/>
     the subsidy was increased, the people of the 
     <lb/>
     territories would prefer not to have auton<lb break="no"/>omy. I do not agree with that sentiment. 1 
     <lb/>
     think there is a feeling in the average elec<lb break="no"/>tor of the west that the subsidy should be 
     <lb/>
     increased. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Does the hon. gentleman at<lb break="no"/>tribute that opinion to me ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber said a few minutes ago that if an ad<lb break="no"/>ditional subsidy was granted to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories the people would not ask 
     <lb/>
     for provincial autonomy. If the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber looks in the 'Hansard' to-morrow he 
     <lb/>
     will find that statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. If I said that, I said some.<lb break="no"/>thing that I did not mean to say.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). I took down the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's words, and I think he will 
     <lb/>
     find that declaration in the 'Hansard.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I think I said that, even if 
     <lb/>
     the subsidy for this present year were made 
     <lb/>
     entirely satisfactory, I would still think 
     <lb/>
     there was good reason for asking for a final 
     <lb/>
     settlement, because next year. with the in<lb break="no"/>crease in population, and the increased 
     <lb/>
     needs for an additional amount of money, 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior would be in the 
     <lb/>
     same difliculty as has been experienced in 
     <lb/>
     the past in obtaining the increase annually 
     <lb/>
     made necessary by increasing population 
     <lb/>
     and needs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman should thank me for having drawn 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
     
     
     his attention to his statement, as it has 
     <lb/>
     given him an opportunity of setting himself 
     <lb/>
     right, and to-morrow he will have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of revising his speech in the 'Han<lb break="no"/>sard.' I think the people of the west, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding that there might be an addi<lb break="no"/>tional subsidy would still be in favour of 
     <lb/>
     local autonomy. They all desire to manage 
     <lb/>
     their own local alfairs, and even an addi<lb break="no"/>tional subsidy would not long quiet them. 
     <lb/>
     Now the reasons given for refusing provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy by the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior I do not think were sufficient in them<lb break="no"/>selves, certainly they were not satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to the government of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Mr. Haultain had been led to be<lb break="no"/>lieve that this government would take into 
     <lb/>
     immediate consideration the question of 
     <lb/>
     granting provincial autonomy. The Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior, in writing to him, said 
     <lb/>
     that no doubt it would not come as a sur<lb break="no"/>prise to Mr. Haultain that the government 
     <lb/>
     at the present time had decided not to grant 
     <lb/>
     autonomy ; but Mr. Haultaln was surprised. 
     <lb/>
     These are the words used by the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior when he refused provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy to Mr. Haultain:

     It is the view of the government that it will

    not be wise at the present time to pass legis<lb break="no"/>lation forming the North-west Territories into 
     <lb/>a province or provinces. Some of the reasons

            <p>I think that is an argument that will not

     That the rapid increase in population now

            <p>I think that objection in itself is very weak. 
     <lb/>it is, as has been said, one that will always 
     <lb/>exist. There will always be a difference of 
     <lb/>opinion on that subject. There is one thing 
     <lb/>I can tell the hon. member for East Assini<lb break="no"/>boia, and that is, if only one province is 
     <lb/>granted, a great many of his own constitu<lb break="no"/>ents will favour annexation to Manitoba. 
     <lb/>But most people. I think, in the territories 
     <lb/>are favourable to two provinces. However.

     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, the discussion which has 
     <lb/>
     taken place on both sides of the House has, 
     <lb/>
     I think, been a desirable discussion because 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that it has placed before the 
     <lb/>
     country and before hon. members from the 
     <lb/>
     eastern part of the country—I am sorry 
     <lb/>
     that there are not more of them here this 
     <lb/>
     evening—a very fair and moderate state<lb break="no"/>ment of the position of affairs. I can find 
     <lb/>
     no fault with my hon. friends from the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories for the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which they have stated their position, 
     <lb/>
     although hon. members in the committee 
     <lb/>
     will see that they, themselves, are not 
     <lb/>
     agreed in regard to what ought to be 
     <lb/>
     done. This is no particular discredit to any 
     <lb/>
     of the members who have expressed their 
     <lb/>
     opinions, because the circumstances are of 
     <lb/>
     such a character that there is plenty of 
     <lb/>
     room for a difference of opinion. It would 
     <lb/>
     be a very strange thing if, amongst men 
     <lb/>
     who have formed their opinions themselves, 
     <lb/>
     there should not be differences of opinion 
     <lb/>
     in regard to a matter of such importance, 
     <lb/>
            
            
            <cb/>
         
         
     where all the circumstances are of such an 
     <lb/>
     unusual character. It does not very often 
     <lb/>
     happen that any legislative assembly has to 
     <lb/>
     deal with a question involving the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional status of a territory such as that 
     <lb/>
     which we are now discussing. The com<lb break="no"/>mittee, perhaps, handly realizes the fact 
     <lb/>
     that we are discussing the questions of the 
     <lb/>
     financial and constitutional status of a ter<lb break="no"/>ritory which has almost as much fertile 
     <lb/>land as the continent of Europe, and which 
     <lb/>bids fair, under existing circumstances to 
     <lb/>be an enormously important factor in the 
     <lb/>development of the business, not only of 
     <lb/>Canada, but of the north American con<lb break="no"/>tinent before very many years pass away. 
     <lb/>When I speak of the extent of that territory, 
     <lb/>I am not speaking of the extent of its super<lb break="no"/>ficial area. but of the number of acres which 
     <lb/>are actually fertile and are capable of pro<lb break="no"/>ducing in such a way that they are fairly 
     <lb/>and reasonably equipped for settlement in 
     <lb/>the ordinary sense of the word. I do not 
     <lb/>know that it is necessary for me to go into 
     <lb/>a very lengthy or detailed discussion of the 
     <lb/>matter, but, I would say to the committee, 
     <lb/>that I think I am justified in taking the 
     <lb/>position that the North-west Territories have 
     <lb/>not been badly treated during the last five 
     <lb/>years. Immediately upon assuming office, 
     <lb/>I was met by the members of the territorial 
     <lb/>government, and they made a proposal to 
     <lb/>me in regard to what they thought they 
     <lb/>ought to have in the way of subsidy for 
     <lb/>the next four years. If I remember rightly, 
     <lb/>this took place in the fall of 1896, before I 
     <lb/>was sworn in, and before I had actually 
     <lb/>assumed the performance of my duties in 
     <lb/>this place. I indicated to the members of 
     <lb/>the government what I thought, under the 
     <lb/>circumstances, I could recommend. and I 
     <lb/>was led by these gentlemen to believe that 
     <lb/>the amount which I was disposed to re<lb break="no"/>commend would be satisfactory for the next 
     <lb/>three or four years. The amount which I 
     <lb/>recommended was added to the subsidy of 
     <lb/>the North-west Territories at the next ses<lb break="no"/>sion of parliament, and I think, under the 
     <lb/>then existing circumstances, I had the right 
     <lb/>to believe that in the opinion of the members 
     <lb/>of the executive at the time of the con<lb break="no"/>ference that for three or four years the 
     <lb/>amount thus added would prove a satis<lb break="no"/>factory addition to the subsidy. Then cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances changed, and demands were 
     <lb/>made upon the government here for in<lb break="no"/>creases and additions to the subsidy of the 
     <lb/>North-west Territories, to some extent. in<lb break="no"/>consistently with the understanding which 
     <lb/>was reached at that time, although I am 
     <lb/>quite prepared to admit there was nothing of 
     <lb/>a binding character, but at the same time, 
     <lb/>it was of such a character that I had reason<lb break="no"/>able grounds for believing that they had 
     <lb/>succeeded in getting the government to deal 
     <lb/>satisfactorily with the position as it then 
     <lb/>existed. Population began to flow into the 
     <lb/>territories, and as an hon. member from the 
     <lb/>North-west has properly and pertinently' 
     <lb/>explained to the committee, the expenditure 
     <lb/>

     necessary on the part of the territories has 
     <lb/>
     been to a very considerable extent affected 
     <lb/>
     and affected unfavourably in the sense that 
     <lb/>
     the expenditure has been increased to a 
     <lb/>
     very considerable extent owing to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that there has lately been a series of wet 
     <lb/>
     seasons which have resulted in making a 
     <lb/>
     very much larger demand on the resources 
     <lb/>
     of the territorial government for necessary 
     <lb/>
     public works and for the construction of 
     <lb/>
     roads and bridges. That increase, having 
     <lb/>
     been made, was continued. A still further 
     <lb/>
     increase was made a couple of years ago, 
     <lb/>
     and when last year the members of the ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial government waited upon us and ex<lb break="no"/>plained that, owing to the floods which had 
     <lb/>
     taken place in the northern part of the ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, many of their bridges had been 
     <lb/>
     washed away and that renewals were an 
     <lb/>
     urgent necessity, a very large additional 
     <lb/>
     amount was voted for the purpose of assist<lb break="no"/>ing them in making these renewals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). May I ask the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of the Interior a question ? 
     <lb/>
     Was the amount of the subsidy based in 
     <lb/>
     any way upon estimated population or on 
     <lb/>
     what was it based ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     No, it was arbitrarily fixed. Every year the 
     <lb/>
     premier of the North-west Territories sends 
     <lb/>
     down a detailed estimate. When I say it 
     <lb/>
     is detailed, I should explain that it is not 
     <lb/>
     detailed, as it is not a detailed estimate in 
     <lb/>
     the way in which our estimates are de<lb break="no"/>tailed, but an estimate generally stating 
     <lb/>
     what is required for each service, and giving 
     <lb/>
     a certain amount of detail in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the moneys that are asked for. As I 
     <lb/>
     said, last year or the year before, $100,000 
     <lb/>
     was voted for the purpose of enabling the 
     <lb/>
     territorial government to renew bridges and 
     <lb/>
     public works which had been destroyed by 
     <lb/>
     the floods which had taken place the pre<lb break="no"/>vious year. On the whole, therefore, I 
     <lb/>
     think we have been, in a fair and reasonable 
     <lb/>
    way, endeavouring to meet the wishes of 
     <lb/>our friends in the North-west Territories, 
     <lb/>and therefore, I do not think that the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the territorial government feel that 
     <lb/>we have treated them illiberally, or that we 
     <lb/>have been disposed to turn a deaf ear to 
     <lb/>their representations. I may add that in the 
     <lb/>first year after the government took office, 
     <lb/>we extended to the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>what they had been vainly seeking for years 
     <lb/>before, a system of responsible government. 
     <lb/>But I remember very distinctly that the 
     <lb/>day I brought that Bill into the House, the 
     <lb/>late Mr. Davin stood up and expressed 
     <lb/>agreeable surprise at the Bill being brought 
     <lb/>in, declaring that he had been trying to get 
     <lb/>the Conservative government to introduce 
     <lb/>a similar Bill for the previous ten years. 
     <lb/>Great progress has been made in the 
     <lb/>North-west. We have in the last five years 
     <lb/>established in that country a system of res<lb break="no"/>ponsible government, we have increased 
     <lb/>their subsidy largely and we have reason<lb break="no"/>ably and fairly endeavoured to meet them 
     <lb/>
        
   
            <cb/>
          
          
     in their demands of a financial character. 
     <lb/>
     I am free to say that in the last year or two 
     <lb/>
     circumstances have changed rapidly, and 
     <lb/>
     the march of events has been quicker than 
     <lb/>
     in former years. That is due to the rapid 
     <lb/>
     increase of the population and the pros<lb break="no"/>pect of a still more rapid increase in the 
     <lb/>
     future, I do not suppose that my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friends would think that the situation were 
     <lb/>
     so urgent if it were not for the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the population has increased with great 
     <lb/>
     rapidity. I believe the subject is one that 
     <lb/>
     requires the greatest of consideration, and 
     <lb/>
     I fully agree with the members from the 
     <lb/>
     territories who say that it would be a 
     <lb/>
     national disaster if we neglected to provide 
     <lb/>
     for the public service of the territories, so 
     <lb/>
     that the people would go in there and be<lb break="no"/>come dissatisfied, and that the tide of popu<lb break="no"/>lation which is flowing in that direction 
     <lb/>
     should be turned back as it was turned 
     <lb/>
     back some fifteen or twenty years ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But I venture to say, Mr. Chairman, that 
     <lb/>
     there is no such grievance existing in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories at the present time 
     <lb/>
     as, within the next year at least, renders it 
     <lb/>
     in the smallest degree probable that any such 
     <lb/>
     disaster would take place for the reason 
     <lb/>
     indicated. I think during the next year 
     <lb/>
     the territorial government will be somewhat 
     <lb/>
     strained in their efforts to meet their obli<lb break="no"/>gations if some increased assistance is not 
     <lb/>
     given. I indicated in my letter to Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain that the subject of an increased sub<lb break="no"/>sidy was under the consideration of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. If I recollect aright the main 
     <lb/>
     estimates had been brought down on the 
     <lb/>
     Table of the House at that time. I may say 
     <lb/>
     for the satisfaction of my hon. friends on 
     <lb/>
     the other side, that the estimates to which 
     <lb/>
     I referred were the supplementary esti<lb break="no"/>mates which have not yet been laid upon 
     <lb/>
     the Table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     In regard to what will be done or what 
     <lb/>
     can be done, I shall not be able to say any<lb break="no"/>thing until the supplementary estimates 
     <lb/>
     appear, and they will speak for themselves. 
     <lb/>
     As to the criticism which has been made 
     <lb/>
     on the action of the government with re<lb break="no"/>spect of the application for provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Before the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman leaves that point, might I ask 
     <lb/>
     him: Has the government of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories any independent source of 
     <lb/>
     revenue apart from that which it derives 
     <lb/>
     from this grant ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing substantial. The local revenues 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories are of a very
     <lb/>
     trivial description. I think they amount 
     <lb/>
     to not more than $30,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Last year they amounted 
     <lb/>
     to $80,000, and possibly this year they will 
     <lb/>

     amount to $100,000, derived from the local 
     <lb/>
     land tax.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     Respecting what has been said in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the conduct of the government 
     <lb/>
     upon the application of the territorial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment for provincial autonomy, let me 
     <lb/>
     say I do not think that in respect to 
     <lb/>
     that application, that as yet at least there 
     <lb/>
     is any serious, reasonable grievance exist<lb break="no"/>ing on the part of our territorial friends. 
     <lb/>
     The settlement of the constitutional and 
     <lb/>
     financial status of that vast territory is 
     <lb/>
     surely worth a little consideration. The 
     <lb/>
     time to consider the question, even in the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the most urgent friends of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy, did not arrive until a year 
     <lb/>
     ago. It was not suggested until about a 
     <lb/>
     year ago that the subject should be seriously 
     <lb/>
     considered, and if hon. gentlemen will re<lb break="no"/>member how long it takes to settle ques<lb break="no"/>tions of this kind and to settle them satis<lb break="no"/>factorily, I think they will admit that rash 
     <lb/>haste with regard to a question of such 
     <lb/>vast importance—a question which must 
     <lb/>be satisfactorily settled if settled at all- 
     <lb break="yes"/>rash haste would not at all be conducive 
     <lb/>to a settlement which would be satisfactory 
     <lb/>in the long run to the people of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories. I would not feel that I was taking 
     <lb/>an unreasonable position before this House 
     <lb/>if I said : That if the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories get a reasonable and satis<lb break="no"/>factory settlement, a settlement that the 
     <lb/>people of Canada and the people of the 
     <lb/>territories particularly will regard as a good 
     <lb/>settlement; a fair and reasonable settle<lb break="no"/>ment promising permanency; promising 
     <lb/>lack of agitation, and difficulties, and appli<lb break="no"/>cations for re-opening of the case in future 
     <lb/>years—if they get such a settlement within 
     <lb/>three or four years I should feel very well 
     <lb/>satisfied indeed, and I should feel that we 
     <lb/>have accomplished that result in a com<lb break="no"/>paratively short time. In saying that, I am 
     <lb/>not at this moment indicating any view I 
     <lb/>have just now as to when this question 
     <lb/>will be finally and definitely settled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I wish to say in answer to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     for Macdonald (Mr. Boyd) whose face I see 
     <lb/>
     wearing a smile of a somewhat critical 
     <lb/>
     character—I wish to say a few words in 
     <lb/>
     regard to what he evidently has in his 
     <lb/>
     mind. He evidently has in his mind the 
     <lb/>
     idea that we are deterred from dealing with 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional question relating to the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories by the possible diffi<lb break="no"/>culty of the separate school question being 
     <lb/>
     raised in connection with that constitu<lb break="no"/>tional settlement. I think some of his 
     <lb/>
     friends are under the impression that the 
     <lb/>
     reason why we have not dealt with it at 
     <lb/>
     this session of parliament is, that there is 
     <lb/>
     some political game to be played, and that 
     <lb/>
     the party with which the government is 
     <lb/>
     identified hopes to gain something politi<lb break="no"/>cally by reason of the delay. I am bound 
     <lb/>
     to say Mr. Chairman, so far as I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned and so far as I know, there is no 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
       
       
     political advantage to be gained by either 
     <lb/>
     party in connection with the settlement of 
     <lb/>
     this question. I know of no political game 
     <lb/>
     that can be played, and so far as the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools are concerned my own 
     <lb/>
     view is that the school question is settled 
     <lb/>
     so far as the North-west Territories is con<lb break="no"/>cerned. I understand that the settlement 
     <lb/>
     at which they have arrived—and I am very 
     <lb/>
     happy to be able to express that opinion- 
     <lb/>
     is a satisfactory settlement, and that the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic people on the one hand 
     <lb/>
     and the Protestant people on the other, feel 
     <lb/>
     that they have a satisfactory compromise 
     <lb/>
     and that there is no necessity for difficulty 
     <lb/>
     or agitation upon the question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, I think we may possibly be able 
     <lb/>
     to look forward to a settlement of this 
     <lb/>
     constitutional question, at least when it 
     <lb/>
     is proposed by the government to this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, being carried out without any acri<lb break="no"/>monious discussion upon a question of that 
     <lb/>
     kind which might be a most difficult and 
     <lb/>
     unpleasant one to have to decide, if there 
     <lb/>
     were any contention upon it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I gave certain reasons in the brief letter 
     <lb/>
     which I wrote to Mr. Haultain as to why 
     <lb/>
     the government did not feel disposed to 
     <lb/>
     deal with this question at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I have lived a great many years in 
     <lb/>
     the western portion of Canada and I think 
     <lb/>
     I have some little understanding of our 
     <lb/>
     people there. I sympathize with them, but 
     <lb/>
     I know that when they get an idea about a 
     <lb/>
     thing to be done they generally have an 
     <lb/>
     idea that it should be done right off. They 
     <lb/>
     are not disposed to allow the march of 
     <lb/>
     events to proceed very long without having 
     <lb/>
     a final settlement of what they claim ought 
     <lb/>
     to be settled. They are not generally de<lb break="no"/>sirous to listen to counsel which goes in the 
     <lb/>
     direction of delay. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Alberta (Mr. Oliver) has possibly been the 
     <lb/>
     clearest exponent of that principle which 
     <lb/>
     is generally followed by western people, 
     <lb/>
     and he puts it very well. He says: We 
     <lb/>
     have asked you for certain things and if 
     <lb/>
     you are not prepared to do just exactly 
     <lb/>
     what we say, why pay the shot and pay 
     <lb/>
     as much as we ask. My hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Oliver) forgets that he takes for granted 
     <lb/>
     the whole of the discussion and all the 
     <lb/>
     points involved in the discussion because 
     <lb/>
     he says: We are entitled to what we ask 
     <lb/>
     in the first place, and if you do not give us 
     <lb/>
     what we ask we are entitled to fix the 
     <lb/>
     amount you will give us. I think the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons will hardly admit that 
     <lb/>
     that is the case, because we shall have to 
     <lb/>
     take the position, however much we sym<lb break="no"/>pathize with our friends in the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories, that there are two parties to 
     <lb/>
     the question of their financial status, and 
     <lb/>
     two parties to the question how much they 
     <lb/>
     ought to have. These questions cannot 
     <lb/>
     be settled by a logical proposition such as

     my hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. Oliver)        
     <lb/>
     puts with such clearness. A good deal of        
     <lb/>
     thoughtful consideration will have to be          
     <lb/>
     given to the details.        
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>I want to say a word on two phases of      
     <lb/>the question—what the position of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories is, and whether it is desirable for          
     <lb/>them to have provincial autonomy at the         
     <lb/>present time. I am bound to say that I          
     <lb/>think the view expressed so strongly by         
     <lb/>certain gentlemen representing the territor<lb break="no"/>ies is not justified by the facts, although       
     <lb/>there is considerable difference of opinion          
     <lb/>on the subject. They express the opinion        
     <lb/>that the financial difliculties of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories would entirely disappear if they had         
     <lb/>provincial autonomy. Now, it has been       
     <lb/>pointed out—and it might be pointed out        
     <lb/>more in detail if it were necessary—that         
     <lb/>there are services performed by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada in the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories at thepresent time which are of an ex<lb break="no"/>ceptional character, because of the excep<lb break="no"/>tional position of that country. We main<lb break="no"/>tain a large police force there; but let not          
     <lb/>our friends think that that police force is          
     <lb/>maintained solely for what may be called         
     <lb/>Dominion purposes. Not at all. We re<lb break="no"/>quire to maintain a force of some kind for          
     <lb/>Dominion purposes; but at present we main<lb break="no"/>tain it not only for Dominion purposes, not         
     <lb/>only because it is desirable to have a mili<lb break="no"/>tary force in so large a territory, and where        
     <lb/>in former years at least there were a con<lb break="no"/>siderable number of Indians who were some<lb break="no"/>what hostile in their tendency, but at the         
     <lb/>present time we maintain a large number        
     <lb/>of those policemen scattered about the coun<lb break="no"/>try, singly or in groups of two or three,         
     <lb/>for the purpose of performing the duties of         
     <lb/>local constables; and if we undertook to         
     <lb/>remove one of those constables from the        
     <lb/>neighbourhood where he is placed, such a         
     <lb/>storm would arise as no minister would        
     <lb/>care to face. There is a stronger demand        
     <lb/>for local police in the North-west Territories        
     <lb/>than in any other part of Canada. I will         
     <lb/>not be so uncharitable as to say that it is        
     <lb/>so strong simply because the Federal gov<lb break="no"/>ernment has to pay the shot; but the de<lb break="no"/>mand is there, and there is some reason for           
     <lb/>it, because at the present time and for some         
     <lb/>years to come the population will be so        
     <lb/>sparse that they will not be able to form      
     <lb/>themselves into local communities and by         
     <lb/>small local taxation give themselves the        
     <lb/>police protection which is provided in other           
     <lb/>parts of Canada. When the population of        
     <lb/>the North-west Territories increases to five          
     <lb/>of six hundred thousand, circumstances will         
     <lb/>be different. The people will be closer to<lb break="no"/>gether, municipalities will be formed, we       
     <lb/>shall be able to collect our police force into        
     <lb/>military companies for military purposes,        
     <lb/>and the people will look after their own          
     <lb/>police protection. But that time has not       
     <lb/>'come yet, and that is one of the things that          
     <lb/>are to be considered in connection with this      
     <lb/>question. The territorial government would         
     <lb/>not be prepared to undertake any such ex<lb break="no"/>
        
        
            <cb/>
          
          
     penditure for police purposes, and if we 
     <lb/>withdrew that police force from local ser<lb break="no"/>vice, they would have to come back to the<lb/>Dominion government and ask us again to<lb/>undertake that kind of work.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>There are other circumstances which I<lb/>think might well lead the House to take a<lb/>year or two to consider the questions which<lb/>have to be settled. We have in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories a vast extent of country,<lb/>and if you will take the trouble to note<lb/>the discussions which have taken place,<lb/>you will find that the people who live in<lb/>the district of West Assiniboia are almost<lb/>unanimously in favour of immediate pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy and of the territories be<lb break="no"/>ing constituted into one province, whereas<lb/>in the neighbourhood of Indian Head, where<lb/>the meeting was held to which my hon.<lb/>friend from Macdonald (Mr. Boyd) refers,<lb/>there is not that same amount of unanimity<lb/>of opinion. My hon. friend said he was<lb/>at a public meeting, where 1,000 people were<lb/>present, and where there was a very unani<lb break="no"/>mous expression of opinion ; and, if I under<lb break="no"/>stood him rightly, he said that he judged of<lb/>the view of the meeting by the applause<lb/>given to the speakers. I was not at the<lb/>meeting, but I read a very full account of<lb/>it made by a shortland reporter, to the<lb/>effect, which I think was not disputed, that<lb/>the meeting was a large and very intelli<lb break="no"/>gent one, that they gave a reasonable and<lb/>courteous reception and applause to the<lb/>speakers on both sides, and assumed the at<lb break="no"/>titude of intelligent men who had come to<lb/>listen and consider the arguments that would<lb/>be presented to them; and it can hardly be<lb/>said that the people at that meeting, which<lb/>assembled to hear Mr. Haultain on one side<lb/>and Mr. Roblin on the other side of the<lb/>question, whether the territories should be<lb/>formed into one province, or that portion of<lb/>the territories should be united with the<lb/>province of Manitoba, fully made up their<lb/>minds on the question that evening. There<lb/>is still some difference of opinion among the<lb/>people. There is some sentiment in favour<lb/>of that district being united to the province<lb/>of Manitoba; but the prevailing sentiment<lb/>is that it should remain a part of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. If you go to the district<lb/>of Saskatchewan, you will find an entirely<lb/>different sentiment prevailing among the<lb/>people there. They are not in favour of<lb/>the territories being formed into one pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and they are not in a hurry for pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy; but when it comes they<lb/>do not want their district to be united with<lb/>the territory to the south. At the present<lb/>time you have a vast territory there con<lb break="no"/>taining about 200,000 people. The census<lb/>showed about 150,000 in the organized terri<lb break="no"/>tories; there are perhaps 10,000 or 12,000<lb/>in the country to the north; and with the<lb/>increment caused by the immigration of<lb/>last year, there are at the present time ap<lb break="no"/>proximately about 200,000 people. The<lb/>analogy as to the number of people who<lb/>were in Manitoba when it became a member<lb/>

     of the confederation, or as to the number 
     <lb/>
     in British Columbia, does not hold at all, 
     <lb/>
     because those provinces were brought into 
     <lb/>
     confederation by way of a necessity which 
     <lb/>
     existed at that time. It was not in the 
     <lb/>
     deliberate exercise of the discretion of the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada, thinking that it 
     <lb/>
     would be an ideal or desirable state of 
     <lb/>
     affairs to have 17,000 people constituted into 
     <lb/>
     a province, that the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     was formed. It was formed because the 
     <lb/>
     necessity arose. There were people there 
     <lb/>
     who demanded local powers, and the peace<lb break="no"/>ful settlement of the country could not 
     <lb/>
     have been effected, and that territory could 
     <lb/>
     not have been brought under the rule of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada, without those terms 
     <lb/>
     being granted at that time. Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men will remember that there was a re<lb break="no"/>bellion, and it is possible that the trouble 
     <lb/>
     arose only on account of the belief that 
     <lb/>
     was created by interested persons that the 
     <lb/>
     government here did not intend to give them 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy or to treat them fairly. 
     <lb/>
     They had to be treated in that way, be<lb break="no"/>cause they were insisting that the existing 
     <lb/>
     status should be recognized, and it was re<lb break="no"/>cognized as a matter of necessity. British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia came in as a sovereign colony 
     <lb/>
     under a bargain made with the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and the people of Canada had no 
     <lb/>
     choice in that respect. But that is no 
     <lb/>
     reason for saying that when you get 17,000 
     <lb/>
     people in a territory in any part of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada, you are to form them 
     <lb/>
     into a province. That is not justified by 
     <lb/>
     common sense or by the precedents cited in 
     <lb/>
     favour of it. I think what parliament will 
     <lb/>
     be disposed to do will be to treat this ques<lb break="no"/>tion on a fair and liberal basis; but 
     <lb/>
     they will desire, when they come to 
     <lb/>
     deal with it, to have before them 
     <lb/>
     sufficient data to enable them to feel 
     <lb/>
     that they are working out a settlement 
     <lb/>
     which has in it the element of permanency. 
     <lb/>
     And 1 think parliament would be rather 
     <lb/>
     prepared for two or three or four years 
     <lb/>
     to vote sums of money, which might be rea<lb break="no"/>sonably arrived at as approximately what 
     <lb/>
     the territories actually require for their im<lb break="no"/>mediate necessities, and let us get more in<lb break="no"/>formation with regard to what the position 
     <lb/>
     will be and what the necessary require<lb break="no"/>ments of the territories will be, so that 
     <lb/>
     when we do arrive at a settlement, it shall 
     <lb/>
     have some of the elements of finality. At 
     <lb/>
     this late hour, I shall not undertake to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss the various details which will have 
     <lb/>
     to be considered in the formation of a pro<lb break="no"/>vince in the North-west. If hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     will look through the Bill presented for our 
     <lb/>
     consideration by our friends from the terri<lb break="no"/>tories, they will see at once that there are 
     <lb/>
     items in it quite suflicient to make any gov<lb break="no"/>ernment take a little time for their consid<lb break="no"/>eration. We have in this Bill a provision 
     <lb/>
     that all mines, minerals, timber and royal<lb break="no"/>ties, belonging to the Crown, situated or 
     <lb/>
     arising in the territories, and all sums due 
     <lb/>
     and payable on the 1st of January, 1903, 
     <lb/>
     


            <cb/>
          
          
     for such mines, minerals, timber and royal« 
     <lb/>
     ties shall belong to the province. In addi<lb break="no"/>tion to other matters relating to the fin<lb break="no"/>ances, which were supposed to be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with somewhat on the line, that has been 
     <lb/>
     taken in the other provinces, and as to 
     <lb/>
     which possibly no serious objection would 
     <lb/>
     be taken, there is a provision that the pro<lb break="no"/>vince shall be entitled to receive, by half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     yearly payments in advance from the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada, interest at 5 per cent per 
     <lb/>
     annum on the sum of one dollar per acre 
     <lb/>
     for every acre of land granted by the Do<lb break="no"/>minion otherwise than as homesteads or 
     <lb/>
     pre-emption. I see some hon. members smil<lb break="no"/>ing, and I think I have convinced the com<lb break="no"/>mittee that there is sufficient material in 
     <lb/>
     that Bill for a year's consideration. When 
     <lb/>
     I said that it was desirable that we should 
     <lb/>
     take a little time to consider, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     I was asking anything unreasonable. I did 
     <lb/>
     not discuss with premier Haultain the de<lb break="no"/>tails of the Bill. I desire to say, in all 
     <lb/>
     frankness, to the committee, that I did not 
     <lb/>
     think it desirable to discuss the details. I 
     <lb/>
     do not think it desirable, in a matter of 
     <lb/>
     such vast importanece to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada generally and of the territories in 
     <lb/>
     particular, to unnecessarily rush the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada into a record on these 
     <lb/>
     questions. They are questions upon which 
     <lb/>
     a good deal of light may be thrown by fur<lb break="no"/>ther discussion. The circumstances during 
     <lb/>
     the last year were not propitious to a com<lb break="no"/>plete discussion of the question with the 
     <lb/>
     members of the North-west government, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps that is one of the most im<lb break="no"/>portant features which I ought to bring 
     <lb/>
     before the House.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. Did the delegates of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories come down over a 
     <lb/>
     year ago to discuss the question with the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     No, but it is pretty hard to make a categori<lb break="no"/>cal statement about what the members of 
     <lb/>
     the territorial government did come down 
     <lb/>
     to discuss. The hon. gentleman will appre<lb break="no"/>ciate that difliculty. I suppose that there 
     <lb/>
     has been no time when I have met the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the North-west government—and I 
     <lb/>
     have met them every year since I have been 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior—that I have not 
     <lb/>
     discussed with them, in a casual manner, 
     <lb/>
     the question of provincial autonomy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I understood Premier 
     <lb/>
     Haultain and Mr. Ross were here a year 
     <lb/>
     ago and discussed this very question with 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     The point which I want to convey to my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend is this, that during the last four 
     <lb/>
     or five years, on every occasion when I 
     <lb/>
     had the pleasure of meeting the members 
     <lb/>
     of the territorial government, there has per<lb break="no"/>haps not been a meeting at which, in a 
     <lb/>
     casual way, the question of the time when, 
     <lb/>
     and the circumstances under which, pro<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3108</fw>
         
         
         
         vincial autonomy would be given the terri<lb break="no"/>tories, has not been more or less discussed. 
     <lb/>
     But as to any meeting for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     taking up the question of provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy, in the sense of a serious discussion 
     <lb/>
     of the terms upon which we would contem<lb break="no"/>plate forming a province of the territories, 
     <lb/>
     there has only been one discussion in that 
     <lb/>
     sense of the word, and that is the discus<lb break="no"/>sion which took place during last year, after 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ross went out of the government. There 
     <lb/>
     was a preliminary talk about a year and a 
     <lb/>
     half ago, and of course some correspond<lb break="no"/>ence followed, and it was arranged that 
     <lb/>
     there should be a discussion when we would 
     <lb/>
     atempt to come down to details. And let 
     <lb/>
     me say that until the discussion of this 
     <lb/>
     last year, 1901, it was not understood, either 
     <lb/>
     by myself or the members of the territorial 
     <lb/>
     government, that we were at close quar<lb break="no"/>ters upon this question. We were simply 
     <lb/>
     discussing it as a thing which would come 
     <lb/>
     in the future, but no attempt was made to 
     <lb/>
     fix a time for discussion when any settle<lb break="no"/>ment would be arrived at. Last year it 
     <lb/>
     was arranged that a discussion should take 
     <lb/>
     place, and our friends of the territorial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment did urge that it should take place 
     <lb/>
     earlier. But the Minister of Finance was 
     <lb/>
     obliged to go to England immediately after 
     <lb/>
     the session, and a discussion in his absence 
     <lb/>
     would of course have been impossible, he 
     <lb/>
     being one of the members of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment whose presence would be absolutely 
     <lb/>
     necessary in addition to the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     and myself. So that until the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance returned from England, it was im<lb break="no"/>possible altogether to arrive at any arrange<lb break="no"/>ment, as to when the conference should take 
     <lb/>
     place. When the members of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment who were away in England did come 
     <lb/>
     back, the happy event of the visit of the 
     <lb/>
     Prince of Wales occurred. That engaged 
     <lb/>
     the attention of everybody some little time, 
     <lb/>
     and the result was that it was impossible 
     <lb/>
     to give any time for the discussion of this 
     <lb/>
     question until after that event took place. 
     <lb/>
     Two members of the territorial government 
     <lb/>
     came down just about the time His High<lb break="no"/>ness was leaving. We proceeded to get to<lb break="no"/>gether to discuss the question on two or 
     <lb/>
     three occasions, and go into the details as 
     <lb/>
     fully as possible. From time to time mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the government gave the various 
     <lb/>
     phases of the question consideration, and 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion I arrived at was that not<lb break="no"/>withstanding a case, strong in some re<lb break="no"/>spects, was made out by our friends in the 
     <lb/>
     territories, it was better that the matter 
     <lb/>
     should be laid over for the present, and I 
     <lb/>
     am bound to say that the more I have 
     <lb/>
     thought of the matter since that decision 
     <lb/>
     was arrived at, the more strongly I am 
     <lb/>
     convinced that it was a wise one. I am 
     <lb/>
     not desirous of binding myself this evening 
     <lb/>
     to any expression of opinion, as very rapid 
     <lb/>
     changes are likely to take place in the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the territories in the next year or 
     <lb/>
     two, and it would be most unwise for us 
     <lb/>
     now to undertake to settle a question of 
     <lb/>
  
  
            <cb/>
     
     
     this character, the settlement of which must 
     <lb/>
     largely depend on the amount of population 
     <lb/>
     in the territories. Why, one of the first 
     <lb/>
     things we would have to deal with would 
     <lb/>
     be a per capita allowance according to the 
     <lb/>
     population, upon the assumption that the 
     <lb/>
     cost of government is to be based to some 
     <lb/>
     extent on the number of the population. We 
     <lb/>
     were asked to fix a per capita allowance 
     <lb/>
     based on a population of 250,000; but if our 
     <lb/>
     anticipations turn out to be at all correct, it 
     <lb/>
     will increase very rapidly, and our esti<lb break="no"/>mate of the number of people upon which 
     <lb/>
     the per capita allowance should be based 
     <lb/>
     might prove to be wholly inadequate and 
     <lb/>
     erroneous within two or three years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The suggestion was made that we should 
     <lb/>
     take frequent censuses. But, there are un<lb break="no"/>usual features about that; and, moreover, 
     <lb/>
     we would have to face another difliculty, as 
     <lb/>
     to what the limit would be upon which the 
     <lb/>
     per capita allowance would be granted, be<lb break="no"/>cause there is a limit in the cases of the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces. So, the House can see at a 
     <lb/>
     glance, that if you take this enormous terri<lb break="no"/>tory which is six or seven hundred miles long 
     <lb/>
     and runs from the international boundary to 
     <lb/>
     north of Prince Albert—speaking of the ter<lb break="no"/>ritory habitable in the sense of being useful 
     <lb/>
     for agricultural settlement, and consider 
     <lb/>
     that people are likely to go in it at the 
     <lb/>
     rate of 50,000 a year and that quite proba<lb break="no"/>bly those places where settlement is now 
     <lb/>
     the thickest will be the thinnest in that re<lb break="no"/>spect in a few years, for unquestionably, 
     <lb/>
     settlement will go in places where it has not 
     <lb/>
     been hitherto—taking these things into con<lb break="no"/>sideration the House will understand that 
     <lb/>
     rapid and great changes will take place in 
     <lb/>
     the territories within a few years, and it 
     <lb/>
     would hardly be the part of wise statesman<lb break="no"/>ship to make arrangements that would so 
     <lb/>
     completely lack the element of permanency. 
     <lb/>
     The House will understand that there 
     <lb/>
     would be no advantage in giving provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy to these people and having 
     <lb/>
     them come down here every year for better 
     <lb/>
     terms. Every province has had to come 
     <lb/>
     to the Federal government for better terms. 
     <lb/>
     I was a boy in Manitoba when the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of that province had to come 
     <lb/>
     every year for better terms. Every year 
     <lb/>
     they made their pilgrimage to Ottawa, for 
     <lb/>
     this purpose. This was because the ele<lb break="no"/>ments of permanency and finality did not 
     <lb/>
     exist in the terms between Manitoba and the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. The arrangements were made at 
     <lb/>
     a time when population was so small and 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances were of such a character 
     <lb/>
     that nobody could understand what the 
     <lb/>
     financial arrangement of the future needed 
     <lb/>
     to be. There was constant agitation going 
     <lb/>
     on in the province as to what better terms 
     <lb/>
     were acceptable. And there was constant 
     <lb/>
     difficulty over these questions between the 
     <lb/>
     provincial and Dominion governments. We 
     <lb/>
     should bring upon ourselves exactly the 
     <lb/>
     same condition of affairs in the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories. If any settlement were made 
     <lb/>
     which it would be possible to get this House 
     <lb/>

     to ratify, within twelve months you would 
     <lb/>
     have the territorial government asking for 
     <lb/>
     better terms and for a re-opening of the 
     <lb/>
     financial situation. From my experience in 
     <lb/>
     the west, I venture to say that that is what 
     <lb/>
     would happen. I feel confident that if some 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen who have agitated for au<lb break="no"/>tonomy, will quietly think of the matter, 
     <lb/>
     they will agree with me that this would 
     <lb/>
     probably be the result. So, we should not 
     <lb/>
     be in a better position if they were given 
     <lb/>
     autonomy. We have already given them 
     <lb/>
     responsible government. To all intents and 
     <lb/>
     purposes they have the advantages of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial life, except that they do not look 
     <lb/>
     after the administration of justice, registry 
     <lb/>
     office or the police force. This is a great 
     <lb/>
     financial relief to them. One or two things 
     <lb/>
     like the registry office we would be prepared 
     <lb/>
     to hand over to them if they desire.

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Would my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend (Hon. Mr. Sifton) be good enough to 
     <lb/>
     inform the House what the exact status 
     <lb/>
     would be if the provincial autonomy were 
     <lb/>
     granted. I am not as familiar with the leg<lb break="no"/>islation as the hon. gentleman.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     They have responsible government, but the 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction of the government is defined 
     <lb/>
     specifically by the Act of this government. 
     <lb/>
     There are, as I have said, certain depart<lb break="no"/>ments in which they have no jurisdiction, 
     <lb/>
     one being the police, another the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of justice and another the registry 
     <lb/>
     office. This last is a small matter, as I say, 
     <lb/>
     which might be turned over without dis<lb break="no"/>cussion. We get a little surplus revenue out 
     <lb/>
     of the registry offices, but it might readily 
     <lb/>
     be admitted that they might have it. These 
     <lb/>
     are the three principal subjects with regard 
     <lb/>
     to which they have no jurisdiction, which 
     <lb/>
     occurred to me at the present moment. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend will see, without provincial sta<lb break="no"/>tus, they have no power to incur debt, and 
     <lb/>
     I am not sure that that is an unmixed evil. 
     <lb/>
     Let the House consider that a moment— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Is there really any differ<lb break="no"/>ence with regard to the police in the state 
     <lb/>
     of the territory and the state of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     Speaking from recollection, I think there 
     <lb/>
     are only two clauses in the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion under which the police jurisdiction of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces arises. The province has con<lb break="no"/>trol over municipal institutions, which has 
     <lb/>
     been held in some cases, I think, to give a 
     <lb/>
     certain amount of police power. In addi<lb break="no"/>tion, the province has power over the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of justice. That is in reality 
     <lb/>
     the clause in the constitution which gives 
     <lb/>
     the provinces the power to do and to control 
     <lb/>
     police work. The North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     have not the power under the present con<lb break="no"/>dition of things, that power being held by 
     <lb/>
     the government here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
  
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). This govern<lb break="no"/>ment retains control of mines and land and

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). In that respect 
     <lb/>
     the position differs from that of a province.

            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     From the position of the original provinces. 
     <lb/>
     The only two portions of Canada where 
     <lb/>
     the Crown lands belong to the Dominion are 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba and the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     west Territories, including, of course, the 
     <lb/>
     Yukon. The control of the administration of 
     <lb/>
     justice and police by the Dominion <choice><sic>govern<lb break="no"/>mens</sic><corr>government</corr></choice> brings upon this government very 
     <lb/>
     great expense, caused very largely by the 
     <lb/>
     present peculiar circumstances of the case. 
     <lb/>
     The proportionate expense would be nothing 
     <lb/>
     like the same if there was a large popula<lb break="no"/>tion in the territories. The position would 
     <lb/>
     be very substantially changed if there was 
     <lb/>
     a reasonably large population in that dis<lb break="no"/>trict. On the question of the power to incur 
     <lb/>
     indebtedness, I speak with some deference. 
     <lb/>
     I do not wish to express the idea that the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories are not 
     <lb/>
     as competent to conduct their own affairs 
     <lb/>
     as the people of any other portion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, for I think they are. But it must not 
     <lb/>
     be forgotten by a body like the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons who are responsible for what 
     <lb/>
     may happen in the future, that you have 
     <lb/>
     there a very sparse population of about two 
     <lb/>
     hundred thousand people situated in a vast 
     <lb/>
     and very rich territory. If they had the 
     <lb/>
     power to mortgage that territory for all 
     <lb/>
     time to come, which they would have if 
     <lb/>
     they were granted provincial powers, it 
     <lb/>
     might be mortgaged for very unwise and 
     <lb/>
     very unnecessary purposese. In saying 
     <lb/>
     this, I wish to guard against the imputation 
     <lb/>
     of saying that the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Territories are not as capable of taking care 
     <lb/>
     of themselves and doing their own busi<lb break="no"/>ness as any others. But I say it is a fair 
     <lb/>
     subject for consideration for this parliament 
     <lb/>
     whether the time has come when power 
     <lb/>
     should be given to the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to incur indebtedness.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. The hon. minister has

     <lb/>
     any financial arrangement with the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to form it into a province, 
     <lb/>
     the financial arrangement that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment would make would not last long, that 
     <lb/>
     the new province would be here in a short

     <lb/>$50,000 at the outset, and 80 cents per head 
     <lb/>for every additional person coming in, the

     <lb/>
     I think my hon. friend will not find that his 
     <lb/>
     inference is justified by the facts, if he in<lb break="no"/>fers that the result of the increase in popu<lb break="no"/>lation would enable the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories adequately to discharge, 
     <lb/>
     their financial responsibility by an allow<lb break="no"/>ance for government fixed simply upon the 
     <lb/>
     number of population arrived at in the way 
     <lb/>
     suggested by Mr. Haultain. Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain's confidence in the ability of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to discharge their financial 
     <lb/>
     obligations is, I think, derived much more 
     <lb/>
     largely from certain other clauses of his 
     <lb/>
     Bill, the clause, for instance, which suggests, 
     <lb/>
     that they should have control of all the 
     <lb/>
     mines, timber and royalties thereon, and 
     <lb/>
     the clause which suggests that $1 an acre 
     <lb/>
     should be given them for all the land grants 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories. I think if those 
     <lb/>
     grants were provided for they would be 
     <lb/>
     able to get along very well.

     <lb/>
     in a short time for additional money ?

     No, the hon. gentleman misunderstood me. 
     <lb/>
     I did not say that if they got everything 
     <lb/>
     they asked they would not be satisfied, I 
     <lb/>
     had no idea of suggesting that. On the con<lb break="no"/>trary, I think if parliament were prepared 
     <lb/>
     to give them all they asked in that Bill, 
     <lb/>
     they would be willing to stay away for quite 
     <lb/>
     a while. I think if they got an allowance 
     <lb/>
     of a trifle over a million dollars a year it 
     <lb/>
     would be a very adequate allowance.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I will put it in another 
     <lb/>
     way. Supposing this government and the 
     <lb/>
     North-west authorities entered into an agree<lb break="no"/>ment, agreed upon by both parties, does 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman mean to say that that 
     <lb/>
     agreement would be broken within a short 
     <lb/>
     period, and that they would be back here 
     <lb/>
     for an additional amount ?

            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     The experience of the government is that 
     <lb/>
     in governmental matters you cannot make a 
     <lb/>
     bargain, agreed to by both parties, that will 
     <lb/>
     bind people not to come back again if it 
     <lb/>
     does not meet the necessities of the case. 
     <lb/>
     If it does not enable them to discharge their 
     <lb/>
     financial responsibility, then they will come 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <cb/>
        
        
     back. It does not make any difference 
     <lb/>
     whether you make a bargain with them or 
     <lb/>
     not, they will come back any way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. The hon. gentleman says 
     <lb/>
     that if they did enter into an agreement with 
     <lb/>
     them they would come back in a short time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     The question whether they would come back 
     <lb/>
     for further assistance depends upon whether 
     <lb/>
     you make a permanent arrangement which 
     <lb/>
     will enable them properly to discharge the 
     <lb/>
     functions they have to discharge. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend will see that my argument has been 
     <lb/>
     to show that circumstances are changing 
     <lb/>
     so fast that the wisdom of man cannot de<lb break="no"/>vise any arrangement, such as this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment would sanction, which at the present 
     <lb/>
     time would enable them to discharge the 
     <lb/>
     financial requirements of their position.

     <lb/>
     Not at all. I think for the next few years 
     <lb/>
     circumstances will change very rapidly in 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories, and I think that 
     <lb/>
     when they acquire a population of 600,000 or 
     <lb/>
     700,000, which may not be very far away, 
     <lb/>
     then we shall have arrived at a position of 
     <lb/>
     affairs in which parliament can fairly under<lb break="no"/>stand what is ahead of the territories, and 
     <lb/>
     can fairly address themselves to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of permanently settling the financial 
     <lb/>
     status of those territories.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). The Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior has referred to the very ex<lb break="no"/>plicit statement or demand by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Alberta (Mr. Oliver), with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the amount of subsidy. I will men<lb break="no"/>tion to him, however, that the views of my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Alberta with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     granting of provincial autonomy to these 
     <lb/>
     territories, do not seem to be quite so clear ; 
     <lb/>
     because, so far as I was able to understand 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman, he said that if we 
     <lb/>
     passed a Bill for that purpose such as 
     <lb/>
     exactly suited him, it would be entirely 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory to him. That is about as near 
     <lb/>
     as he could get the hon. gentleman to com<lb break="no"/>mit himself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV4">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Was not that clear enough? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). I admire my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend's caution. Now with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the details of the Bill, with which I am not 
     <lb/>
     at all familiar, as I have not had an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of seeing it—I do not think those 
     <lb/>
     details have much to do with the question. 
     <lb/>
     It is a question which will have to be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with by this government, it is a question, 
     <lb/>
     of course, which should be dealt with in a 
     <lb/>
     manner satisfactory to the territories for the 
     <lb/>
     time being. But because the government 
     <lb/>
     of the territories submits a Bill which this 
     <lb/>
     government does not regard as satisfactory, 
     <lb/>
     that of itself is hardly a sufficient reason 
     <lb/>
      for putting off a settlement of this question 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <pb n="3113" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1902-04-18_Page_03113.jpg"/>

     for four or five years. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     say to the Minister of the Interior, that some 
     <lb/>
     of the reasons which he has advanced for 
     <lb/>
     not dealing with this question at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time seem to be reasons for never 
     <lb/>
     dealing with it. He speaks of the question 
     <lb/>
     of population. Now we do not apprehend 
     <lb/>
     that population in the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories is going to stand still after the ex<lb break="no"/>piration of four or five years. It will pro<lb break="no"/>bably continue to increase, at least we hope 
     <lb/>
     it will, at the rate of 60,000, 70,000 or 80,<lb break="no"/>000 every year, and that for many years to 
     <lb/>
     come. My hon. friend suggests that the 
     <lb/>
     question should be put off four or five years, 
     <lb/>
     or until the population attains 600,000 or 
     <lb/>
     700,000 people. Well, is there any par<lb break="no"/>ticular reason why the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, when they have attained 
     <lb/>
     the number of 200,000 or 300,000, should not 
     <lb/>
     be entrusted with the government of their 
     <lb/>
     own territory ? My hon. friend refers to 
     <lb/>
     the fact that they have a very rich coun<lb break="no"/>try, a country of great resources. Is it not 
     <lb/>
     true that we may place the same confidence 
     <lb/>
     in the people of that country as we place 
     <lb/>
     in the people of other communities in Can<lb break="no"/>ada ? Is there any special reason to sup<lb break="no"/>pose they will unduly mortgage their future? 
     <lb/>
     There is not a province in Canada that is 
     <lb/>
     not capable at this very moment of abus<lb break="no"/>ing its borowing powers so as to make itself 
     <lb/>
     hopelessly bankrupt, not one ; and why 
     <lb/>
     should it be supposed that these people are 
     <lb/>
     any more likely to abuse their borrowing 
     <lb/>
     powers than the people of Ontario, Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     or the maritime provinces ? I am glad to 
     <lb/>
     note that my hon. friend regards the school 
     <lb/>
     question in that country as satisfactorily 
     <lb/>
     settled, and I trust that it is so. With re<lb break="no"/>gard to his view that if terms were made 
     <lb/>
     with that territory now these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     would come again year by year, I suppose 
     <lb/>
     that is more an argument of convenience, 
     <lb/>
     from the standpoint of the government, than 
     <lb/>
     otherwise. It does not seem to possess 
     <lb/>
     much value, even from that standpoint, be<lb break="no"/>cause the people of the North-west Territor<lb break="no"/>ies are coming every year, as it is now, and 
     <lb/>
     if they should continue to come it will oc<lb break="no"/>casion no greater inconvenience to the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment than it has in years past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not see that the financial question, 
     <lb/>
     or the question of making an arrangement 
     <lb/>
     on a per capita basis, if it is an adequate 
     <lb/>
     reason now, will not be an adequate reason 
     <lb/>
     in the future for preventing these territories 
     <lb/>
     from having self-government. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend says that it is difficult to arrange it 
     <lb/>
     upon a per capita basis and that even the 
     <lb/>
     proposal which has been suggested of hold<lb break="no"/>ing a census at frequent intervals is not 
     <lb/>
     sufficient. How will my hon. friend deal 
     <lb/>
     with it at the expiration of four or five 
     <lb/>
     years ? Will not exactly the same diffi<lb break="no"/>culty present itself then to the government 
     <lb/>
     that presents itself now ? We do not sup<lb break="no"/>pose that the population of the territories 
     <lb/>
     will not continue to increase by leaps and 
     <lb/>
     bounds after the next four or five years, 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <cb/>
         
         
     and will there not, therefore, always be 
     <lb/>
     the same difficulty that exists now ? My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend did not make himself very 
     <lb/>
     clear to me on that point, because I do not 
     <lb/>
     see, if there is a certain difficulty now ex<lb break="no"/>isting which the government has to face, 
     <lb/>
     that it will not present itself in the future 
     <lb/>
     if the settlement is delayed for four or five 
     <lb/>
     years. There is, it seems to me, a strong 
     <lb/>
     reason for lending an ear to what these peo<lb break="no"/>ple demand in this respect, and it is that the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories will be 
     <lb/>
     more adequately represented in respect to 
     <lb/>
     local matters if they possess provincial auto<lb break="no"/>nomy than they are at present. Certain 
     <lb/>
     branches of their government are dealt with 
     <lb/>
     here as my hon. friend has stated in his 
     <lb/>
     speech. If provincial autonomy were granted 
     <lb/>
     to them, if they had the right of provincial 
     <lb/>
     self-government, then, such matters would . 
     <lb/>
     be dealt with in their own legislature by gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who are more familiar with the 
     <lb/>
     wants and necessities of that country than 
     <lb/>
     the majority of the members of this com<lb break="no"/>mittee. I feel, here, that the great majority 
     <lb/>
     of the members of this House are not ade<lb break="no"/>quate—if I may be pardoned for the use 
     <lb/>
     of the word—to the discussion of these sub<lb break="no"/>jects because they do not understand the 
     <lb/>
     country, because they do not understand 
     <lb/>
     the people, or their wants, or necessities as 
     <lb/>
     well as the people who live in that country, 
     <lb/>
     or as well as hon. members from that coun<lb break="no"/>try. In that respect it would be a very 
     <lb/>
     important advance in the government of 
     <lb/>
     that country if these local matters, which 
     <lb/>
     are ordinarily assigned to provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ments, should be dealt with by the people 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories themselves, 
     <lb/>
     through their representatives in their own 
     <lb/>
     provincial assemblies. I do not pretend to 
     <lb/>
     have given this subject sufficient considera<lb break="no"/>tion to make my remarks of any great value. 
     <lb/>
     What I have said is merely my impression 
     <lb/>
     gathered from what has been placed before 
     <lb/>
     the committee to-night so fully and ably by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friends on both sides of the House 
     <lb/>
     from the North-west Territories, and from 
     <lb/>
     statements which have been made by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of the Interior ; but, having 
     <lb/>
     regard to the information which I have de<lb break="no"/>rived from these hon. gentlemen, it does 
     <lb/>
     seem to me that the hon. Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior is inclined to unduly postpone the 
     <lb/>
     granting of provincial rights to the people 
     <lb/>
     of the North-west Territories in stating 
     <lb/>
     that it is not a matter which can be proper<lb break="no"/>ly or reasonably considered until the ex<lb break="no"/>piration of four or five years from the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOYD3">Mr. BOYD</persName>. Mr. Chairman, I rise to cor<lb break="no"/>rect a wrong impression which the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior derived from my re<lb break="no"/>mark about the Indian Head meeting. What 
     <lb/>
     I wished to convey to the committee was, 
     <lb/>
     while the meeting was divided as to whe<lb break="no"/>ther the boundaries of Manitoba should be 
     <lb/>
     extended into the territories, or whether 
     <lb/>
     they should have provincial government in 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <pb n="3115" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1902-04-18_Page_03115.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3116</fw>
         
         
     the territories as they are now known, if I 
     <lb/>
     could gather anything from the meeting at 
     <lb/>
     all, it was that there was the greatest pos<lb break="no"/>sible unanimity that some form of local gov<lb break="no"/>ernment should prevail. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:SIFT1">The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</persName>. 
     <lb/>
      It is time for a change. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOYD3">Mr. BOYD</persName>. Apparently that is the way 
     <lb/>
     they viewed it. I think we must admit that 
     <lb/>
     it is an unfortunate thing, after the ex<lb break="no"/>perience which the hon. gentleman, now 
     <lb/>
     the head of his department, has had in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, if an arrangement cannot be 
     <lb/>
     arrived at which will be satisfactory. There 
     <lb/>
     might have been some excuse in the years 
     <lb/>
     gone by with the government that preceded 
     <lb/>
     the present government in total ignorance 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba at that time, but I think that 
     <lb/>
     it is unfortunate, to say the least, that at 
     <lb/>
     this time and with the experience that these 
     <lb/>
     men have had of the west, we are not able 
     <lb/>
     to agree on some form of government here. 
     <lb/>
     I am pleased that this debate has brought 
     <lb/>
     out something that it is quite evident was 
     <lb/>
     not known at the time of the Indian Head 
     <lb/>
     meeting. I heard many of the people say 
     <lb/>
     after the meeting that they were pleased to 
     <lb/>
     have Mr. Haultain placed in such a position 
     <lb/>
     that they could understand where he was. 
     <lb/>
     It is evident that Mr. Haultain has not been 
     <lb/>
     able to ascertain exactly where the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior stood. However, I 
     <lb/>
     think that this debate has brought forth 
     <lb/>
     very clearly the fact that he, for the pres<lb break="no"/>ent, at least, is not prepared to say that 
     <lb/>
     they should have provincial government in 
     <lb/>
     the west for the next four or five years. It 
     <lb/>
     is quite clear that has been brought forth 
     <lb/>
     and also it has been brought out that the 
     <lb/>
     form of school legislation that they now 
     <lb/>
     have would have been satisfactory to him. 
     <lb/>
     I, for my part, trust that it may be and 
     <lb/>
     whatever will satisfy them will satisfy me. 
     <lb/>
     We have also had brought forth in the de<lb break="no"/>bate the fact that the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Assiniboia (Mr. Douglas) is not in 
     <lb/>
     favour of a provincial government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DOUG2">Mr. DOUGLAS</persName>. You are mistaken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOYD3">Mr. BOYD</persName>. Not at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman wants four or five 
     <lb/>
     years delay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DOUG2">Mr. DOUGLAS</persName>. I did not define. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOYD3">Mr. BOYD</persName>. He is not very definite. We 
     <lb/>
     know where he stands. We know where 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Scott) stands, but we are not so fortunate 
     <lb/>
     as to the hon. member for Alberta (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Oliver). He will probably tell his consti<lb break="no"/>tuents all about it. I am quite free to ad<lb break="no"/>mit that if the government are not going 
     <lb/>
     to give the people of the North-west this 
     <lb/>
     form of government I will support a pro<lb break="no"/>posal to increase the amount of the subsidy 
     <lb/>
     to them. While I do not suppose it would 
     <lb/>
     affect the action of the present government, 
     <lb/>
     I do not mind telling hon. gentlemen what 
     <lb/>
     my position is in regard to the form of 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
        
        
     government in that country. I believe we 
     <lb/>
     should have two provinces in that country. 
     <lb/>
     The experience which we have had in the 
     <lb/>
     country from which the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. Fielding) and the hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition (Mr. Borden, Halifax) come, 
     <lb/>
     I think, shows us that a multiplicity of 
     <lb/>
     governments is not the wisest or the best 
     <lb/>
     thing to have. But, in the west, I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it would be wise to have three or 
     <lb/>
     four small governments. Nor do I believe 
     <lb/>
     that the people of that country, or the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House will be satisfied if you 
     <lb/>
     say to them : We propose to form one 
     <lb/>
     government in the North-west Territories 
     <lb/>
     and to constitute a province comprising 1,<lb break="no"/>250,000 square miles alongside of another 
     <lb/>
     province with 250,000 square miles. I do 
     <lb/>
     not think that the people of the western 
     <lb/>
    country will be satisfied with that; at least, 
     <lb/>I do not believe the people of Canada will 
     <lb/>approve of it, nor do I think the people of 
     <lb/>Canada will look upon it as a fair distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of the territory, but I do think that if 
     <lb/>it is fairly discussed and laid before the 
     <lb/>people of Canada, they will agree that there 
     <lb/>is room for two large and prosperous pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in that country. That will be ex<lb break="no"/>tending the boundaries of Manitoba a rea<lb break="no"/>sonable distance, and that each of them 
     <lb/>shall be in that way sufficiently large. I 
     <lb/>do not hesitate to say that this is my view, 
     <lb/>and the government is welcome to the bene<lb break="no"/>fit of it ; not that I expect they will give 
     <lb/>attention to any opinion that I may ex<lb break="no"/>press on the subject.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Boyd) has endeavoured to explain the refer<lb break="no"/>ence he made to the feeling expressed at 
     <lb/>
     the Indian Head meeting. I understood 
     <lb/>
     him to say that the people were divided 
     <lb/>
     there on the question as between one or 
     <lb/>
     two provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. The question as between 
     <lb/>
     one or two provinces in the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories on which the people are divided, is 
     <lb/>
     as between two provinces or one province 
     <lb/>
     to be made up out of the present organ<lb break="no"/>ized territories. The Indian Head meet<lb break="no"/>ing was called to hear a discussion be<lb break="no"/>tween the premier of the territories and 
     <lb/>
     the premier of Manitoba on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to whether the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories should be formed into a province, 
     <lb/>
     or whether part of the North-west Territor<lb break="no"/>ies should be placed in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, which is an entirely different 
     <lb/>
     question. My hon. friend the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior stated that there were various 
     <lb/>
     opinions amongst the people of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories, and that in certain parts of the terri<lb break="no"/>tories there was a feeling in favour of a 
     <lb/>
     portion being placed in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. I would bring to the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the House that within the last few days 
     <lb/>
     this matter was voted upon in the legisla<lb break="no"/>tive assembly at Regina, and by a practi<lb break="no"/>

     cally unanimous vote the representatives 
     <lb/>
    of the people in the legislature there de<lb break="no"/>cided that they did not wish any part of 
     <lb/>the North-west Territories to be placed in 
     <lb/>the province of Manitoba. There may be a 
     <lb/>few people scattered here and there who 
     <lb/>would not object to the annexation of some 
     <lb/>part of the territories to the province of 
     <lb/>Manitoba, but the opinion as expressed by 
     <lb/>the representatives of the people in their 
     <lb/>assembly was unanimously against division 
     <lb/>of the territories, by taking away any part 
     <lb/>lying to the westward of Manitoba and add<lb break="no"/>ing it to that province. I do not know that 
     <lb/>this debate upon provincial autonomy in all 
     <lb/>its phases is appropriate to a discussion of 
     <lb/>this item, but let me say a word with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to certain 'demands,' it we may call 
     <lb/>them so, or, suggestions that were made by 
     <lb/>the responsible people representing the 
     <lb/>North-west Territories. The Minister of the 
     <lb/>Interior has quoted a clause in which they 
     <lb/>practically demand—or in which they sug<lb break="no"/>gest, at all events—that the public resources 
     <lb/>should be handed over to the local author<lb break="no"/>ity. The hon. minister also said that he 
     <lb/>doubted whether any agreement which the 
     <lb/>House of Commons at the present time 
     <lb/>could be got to accept, would be such an 
     <lb/>agreement as would not compel the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to come back here within 
     <lb/>one or two years. That simply proves to 
     <lb/>my mind that the demands or suggestions 
     <lb/>made by the government of the North-west 
     <lb/>are not unreasonable. It may be that to a 
     <lb/>majority of the members of the House of 
     <lb/>Commons at the present time, they might 
     <lb/>seem unreasonable, but if, unless these sug<lb break="no"/>gestions are adopted, the position is going 
     <lb/>to involve a lack of permanency in the ar<lb break="no"/>rangement, then we must come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that there is reason in the sugges<lb break="no"/>tion made by those who represent the 
     <lb/>North-west Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I dealt at some length last session with 
     <lb/>
     this phase of the question, devoting myself 
     <lb/>
     not to an argument in favour of the propo<lb break="no"/>sition that the time had arrived, but to some 
     <lb/>
     phase of the terms which I thought ought 
     <lb/>
     to be arranged. I say now, as I said then, 
     <lb/>
     that I do not believe that any arrangement 
     <lb/>
     will have the basis of permanency, or that 
     <lb/>
     any arrangement will ever be arrived at 
     <lb/>
     that would be satisfactory to the people of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west, except an arrangement by 
     <lb/>
     which the public resources shall be handed 
     <lb/>
     over to the local authority, and that they 
     <lb/>
     shall be placed upon the same basis as are 
     <lb/>
     the people of the other provinces of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     except the province of Manitoba. Leaving 
     <lb/>
     that phase of the question, and turning to 
     <lb/>
     the item, it is evident that the people of the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories are not going to be 
     <lb/>
     granted provincial autonomy this year, and 
     <lb/>
     that being so, the local authority needs money 
     <lb/>
     to carry on this year's business. I accept 
     <lb/>
     what has been said by my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     minister, and I am glad to have the intima<lb break="no"/>tion that there will be an increase brought 
     <lb/>
     down in the supplementary estimates. But 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
         
         
     with regard to the reply he made to my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) re<lb break="no"/>specting the fact that there were two sides 
     <lb/>
     to the question, even with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     estimate; I do not know that it would be 
     <lb/>
     fair to adopt that statement with too great 
     <lb/>
     positiveness. As I endeavoured to explain 
     <lb/>
     at an earlier stage, this in reality at the 
     <lb/>
     present time, is simply one of the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     services which parliament is in duty bound 
     <lb/>
     to provide for. With regard to every other 
     <lb/>
     department of government, the minister has 
     <lb/>
     the advice of officers who are directly re<lb break="no"/>sponsible to him, as to the money he asks 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons to vote; but with 
     <lb/>
     regard to this particular service the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior has no responsible officer 
     <lb/>
     who is in a position to declare whether the 
     <lb/>
     estimates that are submitted by the North<lb break="no"/>west government are reasonable estimates 
     <lb/>
     or not. I therefore say that the demand 
     <lb/>
     that is made by the North-west govern<lb break="no"/>ment has in a great measure to be accepted 
     <lb/>
     as final. The North-west authorities are 
     <lb/>
     the people who make the estimate: they 
     <lb/>
     are responsible to the electors there for the 
     <lb/>
     amount of the estimate which they present, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore this service is in a different 
     <lb/>
     position from probably any other service 
     <lb/>
     that the House of Commons has to provide 
     <lb/>
     for. The authorities there have this year 
     <lb/>
     stated that they need an amount approxi<lb break="no"/>mating $600,000. As a matter of fact, esti<lb break="no"/>mates were brought down in the House of 
     <lb/>
     Assembly at Regina last week appropriating 
     <lb/>
     about $600,000. I accept with pleasure the 
     <lb/>
     intimation of the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     that an increase will be provided in the 
     <lb/>
     supplementary estimates, and I wish again 
     <lb/>
     to impress upon him as strongly as I can 
     <lb/>
     the real necessity for a very large and sub<lb break="no"/>stantial increase.

     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. It is early yet, only 
     <lb/>
     two minutes past twelve, and we have a 
     <lb/>
     large subject before us. Possibly we cannot 
     <lb/>
     do better than discuss it fully even at this 
     <lb/>
     late hour of the night. To my mind we have 
     <lb/>
     a very serious problem to settleinthe North<lb break="no"/>west. I look upon this question as one that 
     <lb/>
     will require the very best consideration 
     <lb/>
     this government can give to it. A new popu<lb break="no"/>lation is coming in to the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories; coming in from various countries, 
     <lb/>
     and no doubt that population will demand 
     <lb/>
     increased rights. To my mind, so long as 
     <lb/>
     the people of the North-west Territor<lb break="no"/>ies consider themselves only as wards 
     <lb/>
     of this government, no spirit of self-reli<lb break="no"/>ance will ever assert itself amongst them. 
     <lb/>
     They will realize that they are dependant on 
     <lb/>
     us for the little bit of money we choose from 
     <lb/>
     year to year to dole out to them, and in<lb break="no"/>stead of becoming a great people, they will 
     <lb/>
     feel that they are simply the wards of the 
     <lb/>
     rest of the Dominion. Now, I would regard 
     <lb/>
     that as a matter of considerable importance. 
     <lb/>
     The sooner these people realize that they 
     <lb/>
     stand on the same basis as all other 
     <lb/>
     portions of the Dominion, the better it will 
     <lb/>

     be for Canada. Who has a right to say 
     <lb/>when provincial autonomy should be given<lb/>to the North-west ? I do not claim that we<lb/>here have any right to dictate to those peo<lb break="no"/>ple or coerce the North-west Territories to<lb/>any form of government. When confedera<lb break="no"/>tion was brought about we obtained our<lb/>charter from the parliament of Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain ; but the parliament of Great Britain<lb/>did not pass the British North America Act<lb/>until the people of Canada asked it to do so;<lb/>and when that parliament was asked by the<lb/>people of Canada to crystallize into law a<lb/>constitution for the untied provinces, it did<lb/>not hesitate to do so ; and it framed that<lb/>constitution, I believe, entirely on the basis<lb/>which we desired. Now, we stand in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to the North-west Territories very much<lb/>in the same position that the parliament of<lb/>Great Britain did to the old provinces of<lb/>Canada ; and to my mind, when the people<lb/>of the North-west demand provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy, this parliament had better not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate one minute, but give them what<lb/>they desire. I believe that will be better for<lb/>the Dominion as a whole, and materially<lb/>better for those people, more especially for<lb/>the new population who are coming in, and<lb/>who will join in giving effect to the new<lb/>form of government which will be perman<lb break="no"/>ent ; and there will be a greater spirit of in<lb break="no"/>dependence among the people. They will<lb/>realize that they have their rights, that they<lb/>are Canadians in the true sense of the word,<lb/>and they will become better citizens. For<lb/>my part, I would not for a single day with<lb break="no"/>hold provincial autonomy from those people<lb/>after we learn that they desire it. There<lb/>seems to be some difference of opinion<lb/>amongst the hon. members who come from<lb/>that section of the country as to what the<lb/>people of the North-west do desire. One<lb/>hon. member says that in his section<lb/>they are opposed to provincial autonomy,<lb/>and other members say that the people in<lb/>their sections take the opposite view. To<lb/>my mind the best guide we can get is the<lb/>government of the North-west Territories.<lb/>Mr. Haultain, the Prime Minister of those<lb/>territories, is certainly more immediately in<lb/>touch with the requirements of that country<lb/>and the sentiments of the people on the<lb/>question than hon. members representing<lb/>that country in this parliament. I find, in<lb/>a letter which he has written to the hon.<lb/>Minister of the Interior only within the past<lb/>few weeks, he says :<lb/>

            <p>Mr. Haultain, we are told, is a good ruler<lb/>and administrator, has economically handled<lb/>every dollar handed over to him, stands high<lb/>in the estimation of the people, has been<lb/>kept in power for a considerable length of<lb/>time, and seems to voice the requirements of<lb/>the country.

     We are told by our friends from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories that there would be no cry<lb/>if a sufficient amount of money were given<lb/>by this parliament to the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories to meet their expenses. I am not sure<lb/>that the whole thing is a matter of money.<lb/>I think there is some sentiment above that.<lb/>Those people realize that they are simply<lb/>the children of the Dominion, being taken<lb/>care of by the rest of the Dominion, that<lb/>they have no such status as we have in On<lb break="no"/>tario, in Quebec or in the small province of<lb/>Prince Edward Island. They feel that they<lb/>are the wards of the nation, like the In<lb break="no"/>dians, that we give them so much money<lb/>and send police out to look after them. In<lb/>that way they feel that they are not citizens<lb/>of this great Dominion to the same extent as<lb/>the people of all the other provinces. I have<lb/>no objection to vote more money to the<lb/>North-west Territories. I think the present<lb/>allowance is too small for their growing<lb/>needs, and I do not think the government<lb/>will meet with any opposition if they in<lb break="no"/>crease the grant. At any rate, we cannot<lb/>afford to have those people feel that they<lb/>are not treated fairly. We shall have to sub<lb break="no"/>mit very largely to what they determine to<lb/>be best in their own interest, and if we can<lb/>satisfy them more readily by giving them<lb/>provicinal autonomy than by giving them a<lb/>larger grant. I would say, give them pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy, and let us satisfy them in<lb/>the best way we can. But if hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men stand out and say that the time has not<lb/>arrived for provincial autonomy, and that<lb/>further demands must be made on the trea<lb break="no"/>sury of this country, in order that adequate<lb/>assistance, as we are told, may be given to<lb/>them to meet their requirements, the best<lb/>thing they can do to obtain that adequate<lb/>assistance, is to join in giving adequate pro<lb break="no"/>tection to the industries in the east where<lb/>a large part of this money comes from, and<lb/>then they will have better hope of fulfilling<lb/>their expectations. Hon. members from the<lb/>west must sink some of these small ideas<lb/>which they have, and become men of broad<lb/>minds ; and when they want to get an ade<lb break="no"/>quate sum to carry on the affairs of their<lb/>country, they must deal on adequate terms<lb/>with the rest of the Dominion, where a large<lb/>part of the money is raised.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I hope the day is not far distant when<lb/>we will realize that another great province<lb/>has been added to the Dominion. If there<lb/>is the slightest fear that there is going to<lb/>be trouble in the west over the question, I<lb/>hope that the government will at once take<lb/>the matter into their most serious consider<lb break="no"/>ation. They should not have allowed the<lb/>simple matter of the Finance Minister<lb/>having to go on a pleasure trip to<lb/>England, or the visit of a royal personage<lb/>to Canada, or any reason of that kind to<lb/>prevent their taking up this question. Let<lb/>us have the question settled before any<lb/>trouble arises which might perhaps cause<lb/>another rebellion in the North-west.<lb/>
