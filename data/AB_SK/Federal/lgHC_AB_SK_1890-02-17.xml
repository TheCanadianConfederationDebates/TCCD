<p><persName ref="pers:CHAR2">Mr. CHARLTON</persName>. I wish to detain the House <lb/>
for a moment, before the Orders of the Day are <lb/>
called. I notice that in the Queen's Speech <lb/>
delivered at the opening of Parliament, on the <lb/>
11th instant, no reference is made to the Behring <lb/>
Sea difficulty, which is a matter of very great <lb/>
importance to us. It is also stated that the United <lb/>
States Government are making provision for more <lb/>
efficient police regulations with respect to seizures <lb/>
in that sea; and in view of our action some time <lb/>
ago, and the expression of our unbounded confi<lb break="no"/>dence in the Queen and loyalty to her, we naturally <lb/>
look to England for a little protection in this <lb/>
matter. I would ask the Premier if he has any <lb/>
information to give to the House on this subject? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. The only infor<lb break="no"/>mation I can give the hon. gentleman is that <lb/>
negotiations have commenced-that the British <lb/>
Ambassador and the Secretary of State for the <lb/>
United States are now discussing the preliminaries <lb/>
for negotiations on this subject. <lb/></p> 
</div>
<div type="debate">

<head rendition="simple:centre">THE FRENCH LANGUAGE IN THE NORTH-<lb break="yes"/>WEST.</head>

<p>House resumed adjourned debate on the pro<lb break="no"/>posed motion of Mr. McCarthy for second reading <lb/>
of Bill (No. 10) to further amend the Revised <lb/>
Statutes of Canada, chapter 50, respecting the <lb/>
North-West Territories; the motion of Mr. Davin <lb/>
in amendment thereto, and the motion of Mr. <lb/>
Beausoleil in amendment to the amendment. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. If I, for one, could accept the <lb/>
declaration often made by the mover of this Bill, <lb/>
not only while introducing it, but on several oc<lb break="no"/>casions before, protesting that to the course which <lb/>
he had adopted for himself, and of which this is only <lb/>
the preliminary step, he was impelled by no other <lb/>
motive than a desire, a lofty desire, of securing <lb/>
the future of this country from dissension, and of <lb/>
ensuring peace and harmony by removing all causes <lb/>
of contention, I would be sorry that the hon. <lb/>
gentleman, harboring in his heart aims so high, <lb/>
should have endeavored to accomplish them by <lb/>
means so selfish, and so ungenerous, as those which <lb/>
underlie the measure which he has brought before <lb/>
the House. When, however, the hon. gentleman, <lb/>
in order to find a motive for the measure to which <lb/>
he called the attention of the House, invokes con<lb break="no"/>siderations of such far-reaching prudence, he is <lb/>
simply deluding himself. The hon. gentleman, no <lb/>
doubt, may persuade himself, but he will with <lb/>
difficulty convince those to whom he has been ad<lb break="no"/>dressing himself, that his ultimate object in this <lb/>
matter is simply to secure the future peace and <lb/>
harmony of this country, while his present action <lb/>
must tend to endanger the peace and harmony <lb/>
which happily prevail. I can find nothing in <lb/>
this Bill, I must say, but the old, old spirit of <lb/>
domination and intolerance which, in this land, <lb/>
and in other lands, has always characterised the <lb/>
course of pure, unadulterated Toryism. This <lb/>
measure, taken by itself, disconnected from the <lb/>
motives which inspired it, would not be of very <lb/>
great importance—we are all agreed upon that— <lb/>
but it is of the greatest importance for this reason, <lb/>

<cb/>

that it constitutes a declaration of war by the <lb/>
hon. gentleman and those with whom he is acting, <lb/>
against the French race. It is a declaration of <lb/>
war, I say, against the French race of this coun<lb break="no"/>try, of which the hon. gentleman, in this House, <lb/>
spoke in no disrespectful terms, but of which, in <lb/>
other places in the Province of Ontario, he spoke— <lb/>
I am sorry that he is not now in his place to hear <lb/>
me—the hon. gentleman spoke in terms which he <lb/>
would not dare to repeat on the floor of this <lb/>
House; the hon. gentleman spoke of the French <lb/>
race in terms of opprobrium, which, I say again, <lb/>
he would not dare to repeat in this House, <lb/>
in presence of French Canadians, who, by law, are <lb/>
on a plane of equality with him in this House. He <lb/>
would not dare to apply here to my fellow—country<lb break="no"/>men of French origin, the terms and epithets which he <lb/>
applied to them on former occasions in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario. He would not dare to say here<lb/>what he said elsewhere; he would not dare call <lb/>
that race here as he did elsewhere—a "bastard <lb/>
nationality." I have here his language, which he <lb/>
used not later than the 12th July last, at Stayner, <lb/>
Ont., where he said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"In Barrie, last election, I pointed out, in a few simple <lb/>
words, that the great danger which overshadowed Canada <lb/>
was the French national cry, this bastard nationality, not <lb/>
a nationality which will take us in as we will take them <lb/>
in, but a nationality which begins and ends with the <lb/>
French race—which begins and ends with those who pro<lb break="no"/>fess the Roman Catholic faith, and which now threatens <lb/>
the dismemberment of Canada."   <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>A "bastard nationality," a "danger to Canada!" <lb/>
Why, Sir, the days are not five years distant when <lb/>
this  "bastard nationality," to use the choice words <lb/>
of the hon. gentleman, was unanimous in their sup<lb break="no"/>port of the Conservative party to which the hon. <lb/>
gentleman, then as now, belonged; the days are not <lb/>
five years distant when the hon. gentleman might <lb/>
have counted on his fingers the members of that <lb/>
race in this House who did not belong to the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party. And yet in those days, and as long <lb/>
as that race gave his party nearly the whole weight <lb/>
of their influence, we never heard of any danger to <lb/>
Canada from this French national cry. In those. <lb/>
days the sensitiveness of the hon. gentleman, now <lb/>
so easily alarmed, did not seem to be in the least <lb/>
concerned. Nay, more, my fellow-countrymen of <lb/>
French origin, on the same side of the House to <lb/>
which he belongs, could appeal, and did appeal, to <lb/>
all the prejudices of my own race; but that was a <lb/>
legitimate warfare, because the national cry was <lb/>
made to do service in behalf of the Conservative <lb/>
party, to give them office, and to procure for them <lb/>
the direct and indirect profits of oflice. The speech <lb/>
delivered the other night by my hon. friend, the <lb/>
Minister of Public Works, and to which, I must <lb/>
say, legitimate objection was taken by my hon. <lb/>
friend rom North Oxford (Mr. Sutherland), was <lb/>
simply, in condensed form, the food which, for <lb/>
the last twenty-five years, has been served up <lb/>
every day by the Conservative ministerial press of <lb/>
the Province of Quebec. Yet in those days not <lb/>
one word was ever heard as to any danger to Can<lb break="no"/>ada from this national cry. But matters are altered <lb/>
to-day. To-day the French Canadians are no longer <lb/>
a unit in their support of the Conservative party; <lb/>
and what was commendable, or at least unobjec<lb break="no"/>tionable, in those days, has now become a danger to <lb/>
Canada. A danger to Canada, Sir! I venture to say, <lb/>
judging of the future by the past, that if the French <lb/>
Canadians were again to unite and give the whole <lb/>

<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">728</fw> 

weight of their influence to the party to which the <lb/>
hon. gentleman still belongs, not one word <lb/>
more would we hear about this danger to Canada <lb/>
from the French national cry; because, though the <lb/>
hon. gentleman affects now to be a free lance, still <lb/>
he belongs to the party commanded by the Prime <lb/>
Minister. He may not be a very disciplined soldier, <lb/>
he may be carrying on a guerilla warfare, according <lb/>
to his methods, but after all, he is working for the <lb/>
benefit of the Conservative party. He has told us <lb/>
himself on more than one occasion. Not fifteen <lb/>
days ago he said so in Collingwood, and he said so <lb/>
on the 12th July last, at Stayner. It is well known <lb/>
<choice><sic>hat</sic><corr>that</corr></choice> it was on the 12th July last at Stayner, <lb/>
amongst his own constituents, that the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man started on the war path. He then stated that <lb/>
he was furnishing his own weapons, and that when <lb/>
Parliament again met he was going to give assault <lb/>
to the French. His ardor was such that he depre<lb break="no"/>cated the unfortunate condition of things which, <lb/>
under the Constitution, did not permit him to <lb/>
attack them wherever his ardor would impel him, <lb/>
but under the Constitution, he says he could attack <lb/>
the French language in the North-West Territ<lb break="no"/>ories, and attack he would as soon as the occasion <lb/>
offered. But at the same time the hon. gentleman, ad<lb break="no"/>dressing his constituents—all of them, probably, good <lb/>
Tories—was careful to tell them that he was still a <lb/>
Conservative, that he would remain a Conservative, <lb/>
and that a Conservative he hoped to die; and I <lb/>
have no doubt that that is true, because I do not <lb/>
think the hon. gentleman has the slightest particle <lb/>
of Liberalism in his composition. After this, some <lb/>
candid souls have asked if the hon. gentleman was <lb/>
in sympathy with the Prime Minister, or if he was <lb/>
starting a new movement of his own. A most useless <lb/>
question, for, whatever may be the aim of the hon. <lb/>
gentleman, it is quite certain that he means no <lb/>
harm to the Conservative party, still less to the <lb/>
leader of the party. Upon that occasion he spoke <lb/>
of his attachment to the party, and to the leader of <lb/>
the party, in terms of gushing effusiveness which, <lb/>
I must say, the hon. gentleman is not accustomed <lb/>
to use. I might quote several expressions of his, <lb/>
but here is one which is characteristic of the whole <lb/>
tenor of his speech: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"I will treat my old chieftain with all tenderness, for <lb/>
I am still a member of the party. I cannot be read out, <lb/>
although I do not know what is in store for me."<lb/>
</p>
 </quote>
 <p>
The hon. member (Mr. McCarthy) is not here, but, <lb/>
if he were, I would tell him that he can keep his <lb/>
soul in peace. He need not fret or worry over what <lb/>
is in store for him, for I know the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's astuteness too well—not to mention his <lb/>
nobler qualities—not to be aware that, if the hon. <lb/>
gentleman brings recruits to the party, he will be <lb/>
forgiven; and it is for recruits to the party that he is <lb/>
looking now. I regret that the hon. gentleman is <lb/>
not here, as I would rather speak in his presence <lb/>
than in his absence, but, in all sincerity, I say that <lb/>
I believe he is looking for recruits for the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party, while, of course, not forgetting <lb/>
himself. The Conservative party have been in <lb/>
power for a long time; they have been in power <lb/>
nearly continuously for thirty years, and it is a <lb/>
matter of history that, during that time, they have <lb/>
been kept in power almost entirely by the French <lb/>
Catholic support of hhe Province of Quebec. That <lb/>
is a support upon which they can no longer  rely, <lb/>
because the people of Quebec are now divided in <lb/>
their political allegiance; but it must be manifest <lb/>



<cb/>

to everybody that an English Protestant united <lb/>
Ontario would be just as effective for party <lb/>
purposes, and this seems to be the task <lb/>
which the hon. gentleman has set before <lb/>
him to accomplish. It is always an <lb/>
easy and a cheap task to arouse and inflame <lb/>
prejudices. Give me a meeting or assembly of <lb/>
men, whether it be small or large, and in that <lb/>
meeting I will find passions and prejudices, noble <lb/>
in themselves, but which can be easily excited into <lb/>
dangerous passions and prejudices. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is now endeavoring to arouse prejudices which <lb/>
old quarrels, religious fervor, and pride of race, <lb/>
may have left in the breasts of his fellow-country<lb break="no"/>men of English origin. He tells them that if the <lb/>
country is to be kept British all Canadians of <lb/>
British origin must unite; at the same <lb/>
time he states that he is a Conservative, <lb/>
that he will remain a Conservative, that he <lb/>
will not be separated from his leader. If the <lb/>
appeals which he has been making were to be <lb/>
successful, to whom would they profit and whom <lb/>
would they affect? They certainly would not <lb/>
affect the Conservatives, because the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man states that he is still in allegiance with them, <lb/>
and that they belong to the same party. If they <lb/>
would affect anybody, they would affect the <lb/>
Liberals of Ontario, who, fearing perhaps for <lb/>
British connection, might be induced to follow the <lb/>
hon. gentleman into the Conservative party, for <lb/>
which he could frame a policy and of which then he <lb/>
would be dictator. Well, if this movement of the <lb/>
hon. gentleman were to be terminated here, if it <lb/>
were attempted merely to do service as a party <lb/>
device and to end there, it might not be viewed   <lb/>
with much alarm. If this measure of the hon. <lb/>
gentleman were not to be followed by any other, <lb/>
if it were to remain as it appears here, a measure <lb/>
for the proscription of the French language con<lb break="no"/>fined to the North-West Territories alone, where <lb/>
the French population is small, I say at once that <lb/>
I would be inclined to say: Let the measure pass <lb/>
and let us return to those measures of practical <lb/>
usefulness which demand our attention. But this <lb/>
is not the last movement of the hon. gentleman. <lb/>
This is only a preliminary skirmish, soon to be <lb/>
followed by a general onslaught upon the whole <lb/>
French race in Canada. I have before me the <lb/>
words of the hon. gentleman, and he has more than <lb/>
once told us that his object is a hand-to-hand <lb/>
conflict with the French race of Canada. If he <lb/>
did not say so in so many words, there is no <lb/>
mistaking his meaning that his ultimate object is <lb/>
the annihilation of the French race as an indivi<lb break="no"/>dual people in this Dominion. In his speech at <lb/>
Stayner, he unfolded his whole mind, and, address<lb break="no"/>ing himself to the English section of the people of <lb/>
the Dominion, he said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"There is a great work cut out for us to do. Let us <lb/>
begin with that which seems most possible of accomplish<lb break="no"/>ment. Let us deal with the dual languages in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West. In the Local House let us deal with the teaching <lb/>
of French in the schools. When these two matters are <lb/>
settled, we will have accomplished something, and we <lb/>
may be able to do something better in future." <lb/>
</p>
 </quote>
 <p>
These words are quite significant. This Bill, the <lb/>
introduction of this measure, is simply a pre<lb break="no"/>liminary step, and when that is accomplished it is <lb/>
to be followed by something better. And what is <lb/>
that something better which is to follow? The <lb/>
hon. gentleman has not left us in doubt as to that. <lb/>
Here are his words:   <lb/></p>

<pb n="729" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00729.jpg"/> 

<fw type="num">729</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">730</fw> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"We must buckle on our armor. * * * * This is a <lb/>
British country, and the sooner we take up our French <lb/>
Canadians and make them British, the less trouble will <lb/>
we leave for posterity, for sooner or later must this matter <lb/>
be settled." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Nothing can be plainer than this language. The <lb/>
French Canadians are to be deprived of their <lb/>
language, not only in the North-West Territories, <lb/>
but wherever their language exists. They. must <lb/>
be deprived of everything which constitutes their <lb/>
distinct individuality in this Dominion, and this <lb/>
must be done by legislation now; but, if not <lb/>
done now by legislation, in future it will <lb/>
be done by force and violence—by bullets <lb/>
and bayonets. The expression is not mine, but <lb/>
that of the hon. gentleman himself. It has been <lb/>
repeated, not once or twice, but several times <lb/>
in different parts of the Dominion. So this is the <lb/>
policy upon which the hon. gentleman is endeavor<lb break="no"/>ing to form a new party, or to re-organise an old <lb/>
party. This is the policy the hon. gentleman <lb/>
offers to his fellow-countrymen of English origin. <lb/>
I denounce this policy as anti-Canadian; I denounce <lb/>
it as anti-British; I denounce it as being at <lb/>
variance with all the traditions of British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in this country; I denounce it as fatal to the <lb/>
hope we at one time entertained, and which I, for <lb/>
one, am not disposed to give up, of forming a <lb/>
nation on this Continent; I denounce it as <lb/>
a crime, the consequences of which are <lb/>
simply shocking to contemplate. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man may mean nothing more than a mere party <lb/>
device, but he is opening the flood-gates to <lb/>
passions which, once aroused, perhaps no human <lb/>
power may be able to restrain. He is appealing to <lb/>
national and religious passions, the most inflexible <lb/>
of all passions, and—whatever may be his motive, <lb/>
whatever his end, whatever his purpose—his <lb/>
movement cannot be characterised by any other <lb/>
language than that of a national crime. I do not <lb/>
know what are the motives which are actu<lb break="no"/>ating the hon. gentleman; I do not know <lb/>
them fully. I look only at the consequences. <lb/>
But, whatever may be the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
motives, he has more than once felt impelled to <lb/>
repudiate the statement that he is actuated by <lb/>
hatred of the French race. If he were here, I <lb/>
would tell him that I accept his statement abso<lb break="no"/>lutely and entirely. Hatred is so base a senti<lb break="no"/>ment that I would not impute it to him, but, if he <lb/>
is not actuated by hatred, it is evident that he has <lb/>
a very strange misconception of the character of <lb/>
French Canadians, and must have a very low <lb/>
estimate of their moral standard. In the speech <lb/>
to which I have already alluded, the hon. <lb/>
gentleman did not hesitate to go consider<lb break="no"/>ably out of his way, in order to refer to <lb/>
the agitation which, a few years ago, passed over <lb/>
the Province of Quebec, consequent upon the <lb/>
rebellion in the North-West and the execution <lb/>
of the chief participant in the same. He did not <lb/>
hesitate then to attribute the storm of indignation <lb/>
which, at that time, convulsed a highly emotional <lb/>
race to the lowest sentiments which can actuate <lb/>
the human heart, and those expressions were, to a <lb/>
certain extent, reproduced in the House, the other <lb/>
day, by the hon. member for North Bruce (Mr. <lb/>
McNeill), in the attempt he made to attack my <lb/>
hon. friend beside me (Mr. Blake) for the cour<lb break="no"/>ageous stand which he took upon that question. <lb/>
The hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) did not hesitate to say, that, if the people <lb/>


<cb/>

of Quebec took the stand they did at that time, it <lb/>
was from a most dishonest motive; that it was <lb/>
simply an attempt to stand between a criminal <lb/>
and justice, because the so-called criminal hap<lb break="no"/>pened to be one of their own race. <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Those who have done me the honor to pay close at<lb break="no"/>tention to my political career, will remember that in the <lb/>
County of Haldimand two or three years ago I raised the <lb/>
warning note. I pointed out that the Province of Quebec <lb/>
had been worked up to madness against the Dominion <lb/>
authorities for daring to execute justice upon a French<lb break="no"/>man." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>"For daring to execute justice upon a French<lb break="no"/>man." I repeat this sentiment in his own words. <lb/>
Well, I have simply this to say, that whoever de<lb break="no"/>clares that the position taken by the people of <lb/>
Quebec upon this question was not an honest one <lb/>
is guilty of slander, and makes a statement the <lb/>
truth of which he cannot prove. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has not, however, the odium of having invent<lb break="no"/>ed that charge. It has been a stock phrase of the <lb/>
Conservative ministerial press of Ontario for the. <lb/>
last three or four years. So long as it was simply <lb/>
confined to some obscure scribblers it might be <lb/>
passed in silence, but when the hon. gentleman did <lb/>
not hesitate to give it the countenance of his name <lb/>
and reputation, and when, moreover, such senti<lb break="no"/>ments are re-echoed in this House, I cannot allow <lb/>
the charge to pass unrebuked. I will meet the <lb/>
hon. gentlemen on his own grounds. I will not dis<lb break="no"/>pute his expression that the people of Quebec were <lb/>
driven to madness on this question, but as to the <lb/>
motives attributed by him I will state that the <lb/>
people of Quebec believe in their conscience, <lb/>
whether right or wrong, that the execution "of <lb/>
that Frenchman" (to use the words of the hon. <lb/>
gentleman) was an unjustifiable homicide. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman will not forget that twenty-three <lb/>
of his colleagues; twenty-three of those who <lb/>
 supported that Administration like himself—most <lb/>
of them who, like himself, will not be read out <lb/>
of the party, but who will remain Conservatives— <lb/>
telegraphed to the Prime Minister that the execu<lb break="no"/>tion would be a crime. This is not all; there is more <lb/>
than that. The hon. gentleman will not forget <lb/>
that the press of the civilised world decided upon <lb/>
that occasion that "mercy should rule and not <lb/>
severity." The opinion of the press of the whole <lb/>
 world; the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Lancet</hi>, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Christian World</hi>, <lb/>
 the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi>, the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Echo</hi>, the <lb/>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pall-Mall Gazette</hi> in England, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Le National</hi>, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Le <lb/>
  Journal des De'bats</hi> and <hi rendition="simple:italic">Le Télégraphe</hi> in France, <lb/>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">Harper's Weekly</hi>, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">World</hi>, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Com<lb break="no"/>mercial Advertiser</hi> of New York, and scores of other <lb/>
journals in the United States, gave it as their <lb/>
opinion that mercy should have been the rule upon <lb/>
that occasion. I tell the hon. gentleman who has <lb/>
interrupted me that if those great organs of public <lb/>
opinion came to the conclusion that mercy should <lb/>
have been the rule upon that occasion, how dare <lb/>
he now contest the honesty of the people of Quebec <lb/>
who came to the same conclusion? If those who <lb/>
were without the conflict, if those who looked <lb/>
from a calmer sphere came to this conclusion, is it <lb/>
to be wondered at that the people of Quebec came <lb/>
to the same conclusion, though it maybe regretted <lb/>
that they expressed their opinion in such violent <lb/>
language. I say more. There is no one man of <lb/>
English origin, if he be true to the standard <lb/>
of that proud race which never tolerated in<lb break="no"/>justice, and never submitted to tyranny, who, <lb/>
looking at the long tale of woe and misery <lb/>

which resulted in the rebellion in the North-West, <lb/>
but must feel his heart indignant—not against the <lb/>
poor wretches who, goaded to madness and driven <lb/>
to despair by years of careless indifference, at last <lb/>
risked life and limb and freedom, risked the loss <lb/>
of everything dear to man, to get justice, and then <lb/>
alone obtained it—but against those who by their <lb/>
own supineness had brought about such a crime <lb/>
on the fair name of the country. There is <lb/>
more than that. If the history of that rebellion <lb/>
were told, it would unfold to the world a tragedy <lb/>
darker than Hamlet. There was a race of men <lb/>
on the border between savage and civilised life; <lb/>
advanced enough to understand the value of pro<lb break="no"/>perty, but not advanced enough to defend their <lb/>
property against those unfeeling speculators who <lb/>
everywhere precede civilisation. Among the whole <lb/>
race then in Canada there was not one who had <lb/>
received the smallest rudiment of education; but <lb/>
they had heard there was one of their number <lb/>
who had been more favored than they in this re<lb break="no"/>spect, and he was then an exile. If he were <lb/>
brought back to the Territories, might he not pro<lb break="no"/>cure for them the act of simple justice which they <lb/>
themselves could not obtain? To him they <lb/>
appealed; but, misfortune greater than all their <lb/>
misfortune! the man to whom they thus appealed <lb/>
to be the eye to see for them, the mind to guide <lb/>
them, the arm to protect them, had been touched <lb/>
by the hand of God, and was the most help<lb break="no"/>less of them all. In the face of such facts, the <lb/>
judgment of my fellow-countrymen can be im<lb break="no"/>pugned, but their honesty cannot be assailed. It is <lb/>
a vile imputation to attack their honesty of pur<lb break="no"/>pose; and if I have thus alluded to these facts, it <lb/>
is not with a view of recrimination, it is not with <lb/>
a view of perpetuating the bitterness of these <lb/>
sad days. But since we are threatenod with a <lb/>
war of races, since my hon. friend (Mr. McCarthy) <lb/>
is going to appeal to the people of Ontario to <lb/>
unite together, I want at least fair play in the <lb/>
contest. I cannot allow that such a statement <lb/>
as this made at Stayner, should go unrebuked, <lb/>
and I must do my share in the attempt to re-esta<lb break="no"/>blish perverted truth. I cannot allow the fair <lb/>
name of my countrymen to be assailed by false <lb/>
statements, and that the expression should go <lb/>
abroad uncontradicted that the people of Quebec <lb/>
will follow no law but the law of their own <lb/>
selfishness. Since the hon. gentleman (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) has taken this attitude, since he has tried <lb/>
to introduce this new policy, which outlines the <lb/>
course he has taken recently, we might have hoped <lb/>
that he were impelled by motives of a higher <lb/>
and nobler consideration. I am not ignorant of <lb/>
the fact that, among the men who have adopted <lb/>
the same views as the hon. gentleman, there are <lb/>
many who have come to the conclusion which the <lb/>
hon. gentleman has given expression to, from the <lb/>
conviction that the existence of two separate nation<lb break="no"/>alities in Canada is not compatible with the exist<lb break="no"/>ence of the Dominion. This objection thus present<lb break="no"/>ed is one which I will not reject. On the contrary, <lb/>
I say this is a question which must engross the <lb/>
serious attention of all those who have at heart the <lb/>
future <choice><sic>ef</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> the country, for no one can close his eyes <lb/>
to the fact that the existence of two distinct <lb/>
nationalities must produce sometimes, as it has <lb/>
produced already, causes of angry friction and, <lb/>
therefore, of danger. But, Sir, we must deal with <lb/>
facts as they are, and deal with them as we find <lb/>


<cb/>

them. Here are two different races geographi<lb break="no"/>cally united under the same political allegiance, <lb/>
but separated by numerous ethnical features. <lb/>
With those conflicting elements, it is the object <lb/>
of the hon. gentleman apparently—it is my own <lb/>
object certainly, and it is the object of us all, I <lb/>
believe—to try to form a nation. This is the <lb/>
problem we have to solve; how shall we proceed <lb/>
to solve it? The hon. gentleman has given us his <lb/>
method, the Tory method, and he has once more <lb/>
demonstrated that Tory methods never proceed <lb/>
from the nobler, higher instincts of the human <lb/>
heart and the human intellect, but always from the <lb/>
dread, the diffidence, and the distrust which every<lb break="no"/>where has made the Tory party, wherever it has <lb/>
had sway,suspicious and cruel. The hon. gentleman, <lb/>
looking around this broad Dominion, sees a popula<lb break="no"/>tion of one and a-half million inhabitants, nearly <lb/>
one-third of our whole population, who are of French <lb/>
origin, attached to their language, their laws, their <lb/>
institutions, and their religion—attached to every<lb break="no"/>thing which characterises their separate individu<lb break="no"/>ality. If the hon. gentleman had stated that this <lb/>
was a cause of possible friction, and that we should <lb/>
endeavor to find some means of alleviating that fric<lb break="no"/>tion, I would agree with him; but the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man did not take that view. On the contrary, he <lb/>
coldly asserts that the existence of two separate <lb/>
races here is not compatible with the existence of <lb/>
the Dominion, and, therefore, one must disappear; <lb/>
and I have quoted his words in which he appeals <lb/>
to his friends of English origin to buckle on their <lb/>
armor, and see to it that we have only one nation<lb break="no"/>ality on this continent. Sir, if this policy were to <lb/>
prevail, what would be the result? What is it <lb/>
the hon. gentleman has in view? It is simply <lb/>
this: that the French Canadians should feel the <lb/>
yoke on their shoulders, that they should be <lb/>
deprived by legislation, or by force if necessary, <lb/>
of everything which has been granted to them <lb/>
hitherto. If this doctrine were to prevail, on <lb/>
what foundation would this Confederation rest? <lb/>
The hon. gentleman, I am sure, would himself <lb/>
admit that pride of race, attachment to the <lb/>
memory of one's nation and ancestors, are noble <lb/>
sentiments; and yet the hon. gentleman coldly <lb/>
proposes that one and a-half million of Canadians <lb/>
—in order, as he says, that they should become <lb/>
good Canadians—should renounce their origin and <lb/>
the traditions of their race. He proposes that <lb/>
the humiliation of one whole race in this country <lb/>
should be the foundation of this Dominion. Woe <lb/>
to the party which can adopt such degrad<lb break="no"/>ing doctrines as this. Who does not see <lb/>
that the humiliation of one race would be a <lb/>
far greater danger to Confederation than any we <lb/>
have ever yet known? I endorse the words spoken <lb/>
a short time ago by the hon. member for North <lb/>
Bruce (Mr. McNeill), that we want to build up a <lb/>
nation on this continent; and we want to establish <lb/>
such a state of things that every citizen of this <lb/>
country, whatever his origin may be, whether he <lb/>
is English or French, shall feel in his heart a <lb/>
supreme pride to call himself a Canadian. But I <lb/>
would ask the hon. gentleman—I could not appeal <lb/>
perhaps to his heart, though I might to his <lb/>
logical mind—does he believe that to subject <lb/>
one whole section of our population to the hu<lb break="no"/>miliation of renouncing its origin, of turning its <lb/>
back upon its history, would make them proud <lb/>
of the country? Who does not perceive that if you <lb/>

<pb n="733" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00733.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">733</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">734</fw>

should force one section to hate the institutions <lb/>
under which they live, those institutions cannot <lb/>
live? Sir, the humiliation of one race, one class, <lb/>
one creed, or one man is not the foundation on <lb/>
which this Confederation can rest. There is but <lb/>
one foundation for it, that is, to give the fullest <lb/>
scope and the fullest sway to all those sentiments <lb/>
which could not be torn from the heart without <lb/>
causing a loss of pride. The hon. gentleman seems <lb/>
to think that all Canadians should be cast in <lb/>
the same mould. He is proud of his race, and he <lb/>
has every reason to be proud of it; but, Sir, it <lb/>
does not follow that we should all be English-<lb break="yes"/>speaking Canadians, that we should all be merged <lb/>
in the Anglo-Saxon element. Certainly no one <lb/>
can respect or admire more than I do the Anglo-<lb break="yes"/>Saxon race; I have never disguised my sentiments <lb/>
on that point; but we of French origin are satisfied <lb/>
to be what we are, and we claim no more. I claim <lb/>
this for the race in which I was born, that though <lb/>
it is not perhaps endowed with the same qualities <lb/>
as the Anglo-Saxon race, it is endowed with <lb/>
qualities as great; I claim for it that it is endowed <lb/>
with qualities unsurpassed in some respects; I <lb/>
claim for it that there is not to-day under the sun <lb/>
a more moral, more honest or more intellectual race; <lb/>
and if the hon. gentleman came to Lower Canada, <lb/>
it would be my pride to take him to one of those <lb/>
ancient parishes on the St. Lawrence or one of its <lb/>
tributaries, and show him a people to whom, pre<lb break="no"/>judiced as he is, he could not but apply the words <lb/>
which the poet applied to those who at one time <lb/>
inhabited the Basin of Minas and the meadows of <lb/>
Grandpré: <lb/></p>

</quote>
<p>Sir, I claim no more than this is fairly due to <lb/>
my countrymen, and I say let the two races stand <lb/>
together, each with its own characteristics; they <lb/>
will be all the more speedily united in the same <lb/>
aspirations towards a common object—British in <lb/>
allegiance and Canadian in sentiment. But, Sir, if <lb/>
you attempt to rend from one whatever is dear and <lb/>
sacred to it, instead of having peace and harmony, <lb/>
you will have ever increasing discord. My hon. <lb/>
friend from North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) the other <lb/>
day told us that it was in the interest of the French <lb/>
Canadians to become a part of the Anglo-Saxon <lb/>
race; and proceeding to relate the achievements of <lb/>
that great race, both in war and peace, he almost <lb/>
asked permission from and apologised to the French <lb/>
Canadians for feeling proud of the British feats of <lb/>
arms on the Plains of Abraham, in the Bay of Tra<lb break="no"/>falgar, on the field of Waterloo. Sir, my hon. friend <lb/>
needed not to apologise; his sentiments are quite <lb/>
natural to those who have the same blood as he has <lb/>
in his veins, and they cannot be offensive to <lb/>
anyone; but I, who belong to the race which was <lb/>
defeated in those battles, claim no permission to <lb/>
say that I lay no claim to that stoical hero<lb break="no"/>ism, if heroism it be, which can contemplate <lb/>
without a pang, even retrospectively, the defeat of <lb/>
one's own race, though my judgment is clear <lb/>
that in two, at least, of those battles—that on the <lb/>
Plains of Abraham and that on the field of Water<lb break="no"/>loo—the victory of England was a victory of liberty. <lb/>
Ihave,more than once in this House, told my fellow-<lb break="yes"/>countrymen of the Province of Quebec, that the day <lb/>
which had severed Canada from France had not <lb/>

<cb/>

been an evil day for the descendants of France, <lb/>
because they had found under the British Crown <lb/>
greater liberty than they could have hoped for <lb/>
under the French régime, and after all liberty is <lb/>
the greatest boon of life. But, Sir, while I say <lb/>
that, I do not disguise to my fellow-countrymen <lb/>
of English origin, who will, I hope, understand <lb/>
me, that even at this day, holding the opinions <lb/>
which I hold, whenever I take up our history, as I <lb/>
follow the long, the persistent, the implacable duel <lb/>
between England and France for the possession of <lb/>
this continent; as I trace, page by page, the fatal <lb/>
climax, dim at first, but gradually taking shape <lb/>
and becoming inevitable; as I follow the brave <lb/>
army of Montcalm retreating before superior forces, <lb/>
retreating, even after victory, retreating into a <lb/>
circle made every day narrower and narrower; as <lb/>
I come to the last page and the last struggle where <lb/>
that truly great man, the gallant Montcalm, found <lb/>
death with his first defeat, I do not disguise from <lb/>
my fellow-countrymen of English origin that my <lb/>
heart is clenched and that my French blood runs <lb/>
colder in my veins. Talk to me not of your purely <lb/>
utilitarian theories! men are not mere automatons! <lb/>
It is not by trampling on the tenderest sentiments <lb/>
of the soul that you will ever accomplish your end <lb/>
if such an end you have in view. And yet it is <lb/>
in the name of British allegiance, it is with the <lb/>
apparent object of securing the future of this <lb/>
country, that this new policy is introduced—this <lb/>
so-called British policy which is at total variance <lb/>
with the policy ever followed by the British author<lb break="no"/>ities on this continent. This country had but a <lb/>
few years before passed under the régime of the <lb/>
English Crown, when the great conflict arose <lb/>
between England and her colonies to the south, <lb/>
which ended in the separation of those colonies <lb/>
from the mother land. England at once real<lb break="no"/>ised that, if she was to retain a foothold upon <lb/>
this continent, it was necessary for her to win the <lb/>
affections of her new subjects, since she had lost <lb/>
the allegiance of those of her own kith and kin; <lb/>
and that unless she made just concessions she could <lb/>
not hope to do so. In a just and generous spirit <lb/>
she made the concessions necessary to gain this <lb/>
object. To her new subjects she gave their laws, <lb/>
their language, and their religion, although at the <lb/>
time that very religion was subjected to many dis<lb break="no"/>abilities in England. Does not the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who moved this Bill know, as everybody <lb/>
must know, that these timely concessions saved <lb/>
this colony to England? Does he not know that <lb/>
if the new subjects of England had joined the <lb/>
armies which Congress sent over to force Cana<lb break="no"/>dians into the movement of insurrection, the result <lb/>
would have been for Canada what it has been for the <lb/>
rebellious colonies—total separation. And the <lb/>
hon. gentleman might have known that, though <lb/>
the Marquis de Lafayette and the Count d'Estaing <lb/>
sent their emissaries to wave the old colors of <lb/>
France before the eyes of the old subjects of <lb/>
France, the latter still remained true and fought <lb/>
under the British flag around the walls of Quebec <lb/>
with the same courage which they had dis<lb break="no"/>played against that flag but sixteen years be<lb break="no"/>fore. Supposing the hon. gentleman had been <lb/>
living then and had had a voice in the council of the <lb/>
King, what advice would he have given? Would <lb/>
he have said: Do not allow these men to talk their <lb/>
own language; do not give them any privileges? <lb/>
If he had, and if his advice had been taken, this <lb/>

country would not be British as it is to-day. I <lb/>
have stated, and I repeat the statement, that the <lb/>
French Canadians having claimed and received <lb/>
from England the privileges of British subjects, it <lb/>
would be the blackest ingratitude on their part if, <lb/>
to-day, they were to reject the obligations which <lb/>
British citizenship entails; but I a so say to the <lb/>
hon. gentleman that it would be ungrateful, un<lb break="no"/>manly, and ungenerous to repeal at this moment, <lb/>
or to attempt to take from the French Canadians, <lb/>
the concessions made to them to win their affections <lb/>
and to secure their support in the day of England's <lb/>
danger. The hon. member for North Norfolk <lb/>
(Mr. Charlton) stated, a few evenings ago, that he <lb/>
had his doubts as to whether the loyalty of French <lb/>
Canadians upon that occasion had been altogether <lb/>
unmixed; he had his doubts as to whether, instead <lb/>
of being loyal, they did not only look to their <lb/>
language, their laws, their institutions and their <lb/>
church. I do not understand the doubts of the <lb/>
hon. gentleman. I do not doubt at all. I am <lb/>
quite sure these were the motives which impelled <lb/>
my countrymen to be loyal. They had to choose <lb/>
between the action of the British Crown and that <lb/>
of the Philadelphia Congress. The British Crown <lb/>
had just granted them the Act of 1774, which <lb/>
secured to them everythin they held dear—their <lb/>
language, their laws and their religion—and they <lb/>
had to choose between that and the Act of the <lb/>
Philadelphia Congress, which will always remain a <lb/>
blot on a noble page of American history. The <lb/>
hon. gentleman shows that in the proclamation <lb/>
which the Congress of Philadelphia issued to the <lb/>
English people that very concession was declared to <lb/>
be one of the grievances of which the colonies <lb/>
had to complain. These were the motives that <lb/>
induced my countrymen to take the stand they <lb/>
did. Does the hon. gentleman find fault with <lb/>
them for being guided by motives? Do not men <lb/>
generally act on motives? As Mr. Lincoln said, <lb/>
in 1862, in the darkest period of the war: Negroes <lb/>
themselves will act upon motives. I would like <lb/>
to know What objection my hon. friend has to <lb/>
that? What are his views of loyalty? Does loyalty <lb/>
consist only in kissing the smiting hand? Is it <lb/>
meritorious when submissive and slavish? No; <lb/>
loyalty is meritorious when it proceeds from favors <lb/>
granted and from justice done. And this has been <lb/>
the invariable tradition of the race to which my <lb/>
hon. friend has the honor to belong, and of which <lb/>
he is justly proud. But there were before to<lb break="no"/>day men whose memory was short and whose <lb/>
sense of atitude was limited. In the first Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, which sat in 1791 under the Constitution <lb/>
then granted, there were men like the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) and the hon. <lb/>
member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), who <lb/>
wished to have the use of the French language <lb/>
abolished in the legislative hall. Their attempts <lb/>
were frustrated, chiefly by the efforts of one man, <lb/>
who, upon that subject, could speak with authority. <lb/>
That man was Joseph Papineau, the illustrious <lb/>
father of a still more illustrious son; and his whole <lb/>
life was the repudiation of the theory advanced <lb/>
here in the last four days. He was an example of <lb/>
the fact that a man can speak in the language of <lb/>
his ancestors, and still remain a true subject <lb/>
of the Crown of England. At the time <lb/>
when Arnold and Montgomery were invading <lb/>
Canada, despatches had been brought from Lord <lb/>
Howe, who commanded the British forces in the <lb/>



<cb/>

insurgent colonies, to Sir Guy Carleton, who com<lb break="no"/>manded the English forces in Canada. The des<lb break="no"/>patches reached Montreal. Sir Guy Carleton had <lb/>
been forced to retreat to Quebec before Mont<lb break="no"/>gomery's army, and was busily preparing that city <lb/>
against the invaders. The despatches could not be <lb/>
carried further than Montreal, except at the cost of <lb/>
great perils and hardships; but two young men <lb/>
undertook to carry them through. Joseph Papineau, <lb/>
then a young man, twenty-five years of age, was one <lb/>
of the two who volunteered for this service. The <lb/>
country was in the hands of the enemy; it was un<lb break="no"/>settled, and there were great rivers to be crossed, <lb/>
without bridges, and it was in the fall of the year. <lb/>
Mr. Papineau and his friend tramped the whole dis<lb break="no"/>tance. They reached Quebec and delivered their <lb/>
despatches. Then, what did they do? They <lb/>
enlisted as volunteers and served in the defence of <lb/>
Quebec, until the enemy was repulsed from Cana<lb break="no"/>dian soil. Some few years afterwards, in 1791, Mr. <lb/>
Papineau had been elected member for Montreal, <lb/>
and when the attempt was made to banish the <lb/>
French language from the walls of the legislature <lb/>
of Quebec, Mr. Papineau could speak with some <lb/>
authority, and he asked: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Is it simply because Canada forms part of the British <lb/>
Empire that Canadians, who speak not the language in <lb/>
use on the banks of the Thames, are to be deprived of <lb/>
their natural rights?" <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Mr. Papineau's recent services, his fidelity to the <lb/>
cause in danger, were such as to convince the <lb/>
English members of the Legislature that his argu<lb break="no"/>ments were reasonable and generous; and I submit <lb/>
that his words should find an echo, even at this <lb/>
distant day, within the walls of this chamber. <lb/>
The hon. gentleman told us that, at a later date, <lb/>
Lord Durham, in his famous report, advised the <lb/>
suppression of the French language in the legisla<lb break="no"/>tive halls of Canada. It is perfectly true, and his <lb/>
views were incorporated in the Imperial Act of <lb/>
1840, but five years had not elapsed before the <lb/>
Canadian Legislature unanimously decided, all <lb/>
shades of opinion united, to petition the Imperial <lb/>
Parliament to remove the obnoxious clause, and it<lb/>
was so removed. The union of Upper and Lower <lb/>
Canada had just been consummated, and it was <lb/>
soon perceived, under the guidance of that master <lb/>
mind, Mr. Baldwin, that if the union was to be <lb/>
for the good of the whole people, every section <lb/>
of the people had to be protected in what was <lb/>
held dear by every one of them. This Act of the <lb/>
Legislature has, however, been criticised by my <lb/>
hon. friend from Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). He <lb/>
found nothing in it great, generous or statesman <lb/>
like. On the contrary, he characterised it as a <lb/>
weak concession from politicians in order to <lb/>
capture French votes. I would not do justice to <lb/>
the hon. gentleman if I did not here quote his <lb/>
words. This is what he said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Parliament of 1840 did all it could to repair the <lb/>
injury of 1774; but gentlemen, it was not very long before <lb/>
our politicians undid it all." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Mark the supreme contempt in these words, "our <lb/>
politicians!" The hon. gentleman was on tender <lb/>
ground when he spoke of "politicians," he was <lb/>
at one time a politician, though he informed his. <lb/>
audience that he was no longer of that class. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). A statesman. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Mr. LAURIER</persName>. The hon. gentleman was too <lb/>
modest to say that, but he left it to be inferred, <lb/>
that the great statesmen of the present day should<lb break="no"/>

endeavor to undo the great wrong inflicted on <lb/>
this country, from such base motives, by such <lb/>
puny politicians as Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Lafontaine, <lb/>
Sir Allen MacNab and Mr. Morin. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man was proud, he said, to fortify his views with <lb/>
the views of Lord Durham, and he was proud to <lb/>
refer to Lord Durham as a Liberal of the Liberals. <lb/>
It is true that Lord Durham was a Liberal, but I <lb/>
will show that, While he was a friend of liberty, <lb/>
and was one of the most advanced statesmen of his <lb/>
day, he did not know the force of free institutions, <lb/>
and that, however large the range of his mind, he <lb/>
was not such a keen-sighted statesman, nor even <lb/>
true Liberal, as was our own Robert Baldwin. <lb/>
My hon. friend the other day recalled the famous <lb/>
words of Lord Durham, wherein, in graphic <lb/>
language, he depicted the state of Lower Canada <lb/>
in the summer of 1838. He had expected, he <lb/>
said, to find here a conflict between a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and a people, but he had found two <lb/>
peoples warring in the bosom of the same state; he <lb/>
had found a struggle, not of principles, but of <lb/>
races. The language is perfectly true. It cannot <lb/>
be doubted at this day, that the movement which <lb/>
culminated in the rebellion of 1837-38 in Lower <lb/>
Canada, when it assumed that acute form, had <lb/>
degenerated into a war of races. My hon. friend <lb/>
did not tell us the cause which had brought <lb/>
about that war of races, but Lord Durham told <lb/>
us, and my hon. friend might have quoted his <lb/>
language. The cause was the contest between <lb/>
the Legislative Assembly and an irresponsible <lb/>
Government. For almost fifty years the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Assembly passed laws which were deemed <lb/>
essential, absolutely essential, for the welfare of <lb/>
the country, and even for the very existence of <lb/>
the Legislative Assembly itself, as a body; and as <lb/>
often as those laws were passed, so often were they <lb/>
trampled upon by an irresponsible Government. <lb/>
The Assembly was altogether French; the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive was almost entirely English, and its members <lb/>
were recruited by the Colonial Office among its <lb/>
creatures. As may be expected in any such <lb/>
case, the Whole French population took part with <lb/>
the Assembly, and nearly the whole of the English <lb/>
population took part with the Executive. Very <lb/>
few, probably, thought much as to Who was in the <lb/>
right or as to who was in the wrong; but, if you <lb/>
desire to know who was in the main right in that <lb/>
dispute, I cannot do better than to call in the testi<lb break="no"/>mony of Lord Durham himself, as it is couched <lb/>
in his report. And this is what he said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"From the commencement, therefore, to the end of the <lb/>
disputes which marked the whole parliamentary history <lb/>
of Lower Canada, I look on the conduct of the Assembly <lb/>
as a constant warfare with the Executive, for the purpose <lb/>
of obtaining the powers inherent in a representative body <lb/>
by the very nature of representative government." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Thus you have the admission that, if there was a <lb/>
rebellion, it was forced upon the French Canadians <lb/>
of that day by the action of the Executive Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, which had refused to give to the Legislative <lb/>
Assembly the powers inherent to a legislative <lb/>
body. Yet, in face of that opinion, Lord Durham <lb/>
said that the loyalty of the French Canadians <lb/>
could not be trusted, and that henceforth Lower? <lb/>
Canada would have to be governed by an English <lb/>
population, and the method he suggested was the <lb/>
union of the two Canadas, with a provision that the <lb/>
English population should have in the House a <lb/>
large majority in numbers. The reason he gives <lb/>

<cb/>

for coming to that conclusion is given in very pithy <lb/>
terms. Here it is: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Never again will the present generation of French <lb/>
Canadians yield a loyal submission to a British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>I have already stated that Lord Durham did not <lb/>
know the full force of free representative institu<lb break="no"/>tions, and that our own Baldwin was a greater <lb/>
statesman in that respect than Lord Durham. <lb/>
Lord Durham had not imagined, he had not <lb/>
thought, that, if the French Canadians were <lb/>
given all their privileges, they would at once <lb/>
become loyal subjects, that they would not have <lb/>
to be governed by the strong hand of an English <lb/>
majority, that division would not take place on <lb/>
the line of races but on the broader lines which <lb/>
impel men to move onwards or to cling to the past. <lb/>
Mr. Baldwin understood that, and he was the <lb/>
first to suggest that the French Canadians should <lb/>
have their language restored, and should be treated <lb/>
as the equals of their fellow-citizens of English <lb/>
origin. That was true statesmanship and that <lb/>
view was unanimously adopted by the Legislature; <lb/>
and I ask, in face of subsequent facts, who is the <lb/>
greater statesman, Lord Durham or Mr. Baldwin? <lb/>
Lord Durham stated that the then living generation <lb/>
of French Canadians would never yield submission <lb/>
to an English Government. At that very time, there <lb/>
was a young man who was an exile from his native <lb/>
country, because he had been a few months before a <lb/>
rebel in arms, and the British Government had set a <lb/>
price upon his head. There is no doubt that, if he <lb/>
had been captured, he would have met the fate of <lb/>
those who, on the scaffold, paid the penalty of <lb/>
having loved their country not wisely but too well. <lb/>
Under the policy introduced in 1845, this young <lb/>
man became a member of Parliament and leader <lb/>
of the Conservative party, and he died a baronet <lb/>
of the realm. Sir, this took place in face of the <lb/>
words Lord Durham wrote in 1838, when he said <lb/>
that never again would that generation of French <lb/>
Canadians yield a loyal submission to the British <lb/>
Government. Now, my hon. friend from Simcoe <lb/>
asks us to go back upon this policy. Are we to <lb/>
be told at this day, or is it to be believed by any <lb/>
one at this day, that the policy introduced by Mr. <lb/>
Baldwin has not made Canada what it is? Is there a <lb/>
man living in this land, especially if he is of the <lb/>
Liberal party, who Would at this day go back upon <lb/>
the policy inaugurated by their leader forty years <lb/>
ago? Sir, there is not a man in this country to-day <lb/>
who must not feel proud of the wise and statesman<lb break="no"/>like policy which wasintroduced upon that occasion. <lb/>
I am not ignorant of, nor will I minimise, the danger <lb/>
which arises to Canada from the fact that we have <lb/>
here a dualty of language and a dualty of race. But <lb/>
the fact exists, and ostracism of any kind, instead <lb/>
of removing the danger, would simply intensify it, <lb/>
by forcing a section of our population to hate the <lb/>
institutions under which they live—intensify it, <lb/>
because it would bring a section of our population <lb/>
into conflict with the majority, which would thus <lb/>
abuse the brute power of numbers. It seems to <lb/>
me that the hon. gentleman must feel that the <lb/>
policy which he is now championing is weak and <lb/>
inferior. Any policy which appeals to a class, to <lb/>
a creed, to a race, or which does not appeal to the <lb/>
better instincts to be found in all classes, in all <lb/>
creeds, and in all races, is stamped with the stamp <lb/>
of inferiority. The French Canadian who appeals <lb/>
to his fellow-countrymen to stand by themselves, <lb/>

<pb n="739" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00739.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">739</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">740</fw> 

aloof from the rest of this continent; the English <lb/>
Canadian who, like my hon. friend, appeals to his <lb/>
fellow-countrymen on grounds affecting them alone, <lb/>
may, perhaps, win the applause of those whom they <lb/>
may be addressing, but impartial history will pro<lb break="no"/>nounce their work as vicious in conception as it is <lb/>
mischievous and wicked in its tendency. We are <lb/>
here a nation, or we want to be a nation, composed <lb/>
of the most heterogeneous elements—Protestants <lb/>
and Catholics, English, French, German, Irish, <lb/>
Scotch, every one, let it be remembered, with his <lb/>
traditions, with his prejudices. In each of <lb/>
these conflicting antagonistic elements, however, <lb/>
there is a common spot of patriotism, and the <lb/>
only true policy is that which reaches that <lb/>
common patriotism and makes it vibrate in all, to<lb break="no"/>wards a common end and common aspirations. I <lb/>
may be asked: What, then, is to be the future of <lb/>
Canada? The future of Canada is this: that it <lb/>
must be British. I do not share the dreams or the <lb/>
delusions of those few of my fellow-countrymen of <lb/>
French origin, who talk to us of forming a French <lb/>
nation onthe banks of the St. Lawrence; and I would <lb/>
say to my hon. friend from Simcoe, if he were <lb/>
here, that these dreams ought not to disturb his <lb/>
sleep. Those who share these delusions are very <lb/>
few; they might be counted upon the fingers of one <lb/>
hand, and I never knew but one newspaper which <lb/>
ever gave them utterance. Yet, while I say that this <lb/>
country is bound to be British, it does not follow <lb/>
at all that there must be but one language—the <lb/>
English language—to be spoken in this country. <lb/>
I claim that I am as loyal as the hon. gentleman <lb/>
to the institutions of this country, and I am the son <lb/>
of a French mother, and I declare that I cling to <lb/>
the language which I learned at her knee as I <lb/>
cling to the life which she gave me. And upon <lb/>
this ground I appeal to every man of British origin, <lb/>
to every man of that race in which the domestic <lb/>
affections are so strong; and I know that in <lb/>
the heart of every one the answer will be, <lb/>
that, situated as we are, they would do as <lb/>
we do. But the hon. gentleman will revert <lb/>
to the cold, dry arguments that, after all, a dualty <lb/>
of race will produce friction, and that friction will <lb/>
produce danger. But where is the remedy? I <lb/>
tell the hon. gentleman that the remedy is not in <lb/>
ostracism, not in harsh methods nor in cruel <lb/>
methods. My hon. friend from North Bruce (Mr. <lb/>
McNeill)—who, like many other good men, preaches <lb/>
better than he practices—gave us the other day <lb/>
the true remedy. The true remedy, he said, is <lb/>
mutual forbearance and respect. I altogether <lb/>
agree with my hon. friend from North Bruce. But <lb/>
he complained in his speech that the forbearance <lb/>
should not be all on one side. Sir, is it all on one <lb/>
side? What he complains of is afew expressions, <lb/>
I admit very imprudent, that have fallen from the <lb/>
lips of some men in the heat of the debate. Well, <lb/>
I am pretty sure that when those expressions <lb/>
are sifted and explained they readily fall away. <lb/>
The newspapers of Ontario, during the past year, <lb/>
have been full of citations of the words of my hon. <lb/>
friend from Bellechasse (Mr. Amyot), pronounced at <lb/>
the St. Jean Baptiste celebration last year; and when <lb/>
he took occasion, a few days ago, to explain those <lb/>
words, he explained them so thoroughly that my <lb/>
hon. friend from North Bruce immediately wanted <lb/>
to make him a member of the Imperial Federation <lb/>
League. If all the other expressions were so sifted <lb/>
I do not despair that my hon. friend from North <lb/>

<cb/>

Bruce would try to make Mr. Mercier himself a <lb/>
member of the Imperial Federation League. This <lb/>
is what he claims his fellow-countrymen and my <lb/>
fellow-countrymen of English origin have to bear. <lb/>
Well, I tell him that the French Canadians have <lb/>
also something to bear. I will tell him what we <lb/>
have to bear. What we object to is the meddle<lb break="no"/>some interference of certain men in Ontario in our <lb/>
domestic politics; What I object to is the whinin <lb/>
pity bestowed by some over-zealous and over-good <lb/>
men in Ontario upon the poor, down-trodden, <lb/>
prostrate French Canadians. Only the other day <lb/>
my hon. friend from North Norfolk (Mr. Charl<lb break="no"/>ton) complained that the Province of Quebec was <lb/>
making no progress, and he instanced the fact that <lb/>
in that Province we still have the tithing system, <lb/>
and he said if there was in Quebec a true Liberal <lb/>
party, they would grapple with such an evil as <lb/>
that. There is in Quebec a Liberal party, not <lb/>
without fault, I admit, but a party which has <lb/>
fought as noble a battle as was ever fought by any <lb/>
party in any land. But before I tell him why the <lb/>
Liberal party in Quebec do not grapple with the <lb/>
tithing system, let me remind him that there is in <lb/>
England a Liberal party of which any man ought <lb/>
to be proud, a party led to-day by one of the <lb/>
greatest men that England has ever produced, or <lb/>
that any land has ever produced—Mr. Gladstone. <lb/>
Does my hon. friend also know that there is a <lb/>
tithing system in England just as there is a tithing <lb/>
system in Lower Canada—no, not just the same, <lb/>
because the tithing system in England is far more <lb/>
oppressive and unjust than the system in Lower <lb/>
Canada. The tithing system in Lower Canada only <lb/>
affects Roman Catholics and no one else, but in Eng<lb break="no"/>land the tithing system affects every man, whether <lb/>
he is a member of the Church of England or of <lb/>
another. And yet never to this day did the Liberal <lb/>
party grapple with that system or attempt to bring <lb/>
the English people to abolish that system. Why? <lb/>
Because the great majority of the English people <lb/>
would not part with it. And for the very same <lb/>
reason the Liberal party has never grappled with <lb/>
that system here, because the people of Quebec are <lb/>
satisfied with it. My hon. friend has read some<lb break="no"/>where that the people are oppressed under the <lb/>
tithing system, that they are compelled to abandon <lb/>
their lands because the oppression is such that they <lb/>
cannot pay the tithes. The truth is the people of <lb/>
Quebec to-day give double the amount to the Church <lb/>
voluntarily than they give by law. I declare, in the <lb/>
name of the Liberal party of Quebec, of which <lb/>
I am an humble member, that so long as the con<lb break="no"/>science of Quebec is satisfied with the system, never <lb/>
will the Liberal party attack that system. I will <lb/>
say this to the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy), that if we could make a compact between <lb/>
the English and the French, each to mind his own <lb/>
business and not meddle with the business of <lb/>
the other, we would get along tolerably well, not <lb/>
only tolerably well, but perfectly well. Yet the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) perhaps <lb/>
may say: If you are to bring the two races together, <lb/>
simply by relying upon moral influence and persua<lb break="no"/>sion, the union may be far away. There is orce in <lb/>
the objection, because there are in Quebec, as there <lb/>
are in Ontario, extreme men who will not be amen<lb break="no"/>able either to reason or generous considerations. <lb/>
The extreme men of Quebec talk today of forming <lb/>
a French nation on the banks of the St. Lawrence, <lb/>
and the extremists of Ontario talk of driving away <lb/>

<pb n="741" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00741.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">741</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">742</fw>

the French with bayonets. When the very large <lb/>
body of the nation, composed of the two races, come <lb/>
closer together and know each other better, I have <lb/>
no doubt that friction of races here will be as rare <lb/>
as it is in Switzerland after hundreds of years of <lb/>
political union. The hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
(Mr. McCarthy) if he were here, would say, per<lb break="no"/>haps: Is this system ever to remain? Is there never <lb/>
to be a day when we shall have here nothing but <lb/>
the English language? I would tell my hon. friend <lb/>
that I do not trouble myself with such considera<lb break="no"/>tions as to a dim and distant future. The only <lb/>
thing which troubles me at this moment is, to keep <lb/>
peace and harmony in this land, and not have peace <lb/>
and harmony endangered under the vain pretence of <lb/>
securing the future against feuds and contentions. <lb/>
I have great pleasure in telling the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man—and I am sorry he is not present—that, in my <lb/>
judgment, the English language is to-day and must <lb/>
be for several generations, perhaps for several <lb/>
centuries, the commanding language of the world. <lb/>
So long as the centre of civilisation was on the basin <lb/>
of the Mediterranean, three languages in succession <lb/>
held sway: the Greek, the Latin and the French. <lb/>
At the end of the seventeenth century the French <lb/>
language was undoubtedly the dominating language <lb/>
of civilisation. It is still the language of diplomacy, <lb/>
the vehicle of communication for international ex<lb break="no"/>change in the higher productions of the human <lb/>
mind, but it is no longer the language of the many. <lb/>
That position now belongs to the English language. <lb/>
That revolution has been accomplished by the <lb/>
wonderful development of the Anglo-Saxon race <lb/>
during the eighteenth and in the nineteenth <lb/>
centuries. That race have carried their language <lb/>
with them in their emigration around the world, <lb/>
and now it is the language of more than 100,000,000 <lb/>
of people scattered over Europe, Africa, Am<lb break="no"/>erica, Asia, and the islands and continents of the <lb/>
Pacific Ocean. Sir, the very fact that the English <lb/>
language is to-day the dominating language of this <lb/>
continent of America, makes it imperative on <lb/>
French Canadians, although they will retain their <lb/>
language, to learn and speak English. Nothing <lb/>
was more appropriate, more wise than the words <lb/>
that fell a few days ago from the junior member <lb/>
for Ottawa (Mr. Robillard). The French Canadian <lb/>
father who to-day does not give an English educa<lb break="no"/>tion to his son does not do justice to his child, <lb/>
because hecompels him to stand back in the hard <lb/>
struggle for life. I would say more. It is im<lb break="no"/>perative for us French Canadians to learn English, <lb/>
but—I have no right to give advice to any other <lb/>
man—if I were to give any advice to my Anglo-<lb break="yes"/>Canadian friends, it would be that they would do <lb/>
well to learn French too. The English are a proud <lb/>
race; but the Romans were a proud race also; <lb/>
and after they had conquered the world, a Roman <lb/>
acknowledged that the education of his son was <lb/>
not complete unless he was as familiar with Greek <lb/>
letters as he was with Latin letters. Perhaps, <lb/>
however, my hon. friend for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy) would not admit such an example for <lb/>
himself or the people of this country, because the <lb/>
object of my hon. friend is not simply to remove <lb/>
the use of the French language in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories and from every legislative hall in <lb/>
Canada, but his object is to prevent the teaching of <lb/>
French in the schools of Ontario. There are to<lb break="no"/>day, in the back townships and new concessions in <lb/>
Ontario, schools where a few French settlers are <lb/>

<cb/>

attempting to impart some knowledge to their <lb/>
children in the langua e of their ancestors. The <lb/>
eagle eye of my hon. riend has caught sight of <lb/>
that fact. The eye of the eagle can withstand the <lb/>
sun, but the eye of my hon. friend cannot with<lb break="no"/>stand that little li ht. He spoke a few days ago <lb/>
in this city, the Capital of Canada, at a meeting <lb/>
which adopted the following resolution:— <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"And this meeting avails itself of this opportunity of <lb/>
expressing the opinion that in our own Province the use <lb/>
of the French language as the language of instruction in <lb/>
the public schools should be abolishe and for ever pro<lb break="no"/>hibited, and that no undecided measure for obtaining this <lb/>
end will be satisfactory to the people of Ontario." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>The hon. gentleman spoke to that resolution and <lb/>
endorsed every word of it. This is what he said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"At the same time, as a citizen of Ontario—of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, I heartily endorse the sentiment which the meet<lb break="no"/>ing has given utterance to—that we ought, and ought at <lb/>
once an for all time, to ut an end to the teaching of our <lb/>
children, either French, anadian or English, in any other <lb/>
language than the language of the country in which we <lb/>
live." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Is this really the measure of my hon. friend? We <lb/>
always knew him to be a restrictionist, but not to <lb/>
that extent, I am sure; we always knew him to be <lb/>
a restrictionist in trade, but he is a restrictionist <lb/>
even in knowledge. If the hon. gentleman, on that <lb/>
occasion, had said that the people of Ontario would <lb/>
insist that English should be taught in all their <lb/>
schools, I would raise both my hands in favor of it. <lb/>
But that is not enough; not only must English be <lb/>
taught, but he objects to any other language being <lb/>
taught in Ontario schools. Can it be that an hon. <lb/>
gentleman possessing the attainments, power and <lb/>
ability of my hon. friend should stoop to <lb/>
things so low? It is a thing low, and vile, and <lb/>
contemptible, to say that the people of Ontario, <lb/>
whatever be their creed or their origin, shall not <lb/>
have the right to teach a second language to their <lb/>
children if they choose. Men are not usually <lb/>
wantonly cruel; men do not, as a rule, pur<lb break="no"/>posely degrade their lives, and what is the <lb/>
reason, I want to know, which impels my hon. <lb/>
friend to use such language as that? Sir, <lb/>
the reason is, that Tories of the stamp of my hon. <lb/>
friend never can bring themselves up to the point <lb/>
of trusting the better instincts of the human heart; <lb/>
they never can divest themselves of the base notion <lb/>
that, if they treat their opponents with generosity <lb/>
or with justice, their opponents will abuse the privi<lb break="no"/>lege. They can never divest themselves of the <lb/>
base notion that, if the French Canadians are to be <lb/>
allowed their language and their characteristics as <lb/>
a race, they will turn traitors as a race. They <lb/>
want to make this country British in the same <lb/>
manner they have tried to make Ireland British. <lb/>
For the last seven hundred years, English states<lb break="no"/>men have attempted to make Ireland British, not <lb/>
by justice, not by generosity, not by appealing to <lb/>
the better instincts of the generous hearts of that <lb/>
people, but by every form of violence and cruelty. <lb/>
They have proscribed her religion, they have <lb/>
killed her agriculture, they have destroyed her <lb/>
commerce, they have done everything to degrade the <lb/>
land and the people. And with what result? With <lb/>
the result of making Ireland a thorn in the side <lb/>
of England, with the result of filling the heart of <lb/>
the people of Ireland with bitterness against <lb/>
England. Sir, Mr. Gladstone has done more in <lb/>
five years to make Ireland British than English <lb/>
statesmen have done for seven hundred years before. <lb/>

Will I show you the different results which can be <lb/>
wrought upon the feelings of a sensitive people by <lb/>
generous treatment? Let me quote a speech <lb/>
delivered by Mr. John Dillon, M. P. for <lb/>
Tipperary, last year. The occasion was a demon<lb break="no"/>stration in favor of Mr. Dillon on his being released <lb/>
from jail, where he had served a term under the <lb/>
odious Coercion law. Now, I cite this speech because <lb/>
it may be a lesson to the hon. member for North <lb/>
Siincoe (Mr. McCarthy) and those who agree with <lb/>
him in this House. Mr. Dillon said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"But it is impossible for me to be blind to the facts <lb/>
that are forced upon my notice as regard the mighty <lb/>
change which have come over the minds of the masses of <lb/>
the people of England, and remembering this, I think it <lb/>
is not wise to be impatient, because the liberty of <lb/>
Ireland is not to be accomplished in a day. I can see no <lb/>
cause for impatience, but cause rather for hope and even <lb/>
exultation. Coming now, as I do, from what was meant to <lb/>
be a degradation and an insult to me, and as I hope an <lb/>
honorable man, I can find in my heart not the slightest <lb/>
trace of bitterness against the people of England. I re<lb break="no"/>collect the day when the power and when the name of <lb/>
Englishmen were hateful to my heart. It may be that <lb/>
I have been demoralised by the countless acts of kind<lb break="no"/>ness I have received at the hands of Englishmen; but <lb/>
the feeling has now changed, and I cannot find it in my <lb/>
heart to regret that it is fast passing away." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Those last words, I am sure, will fill with un<lb break="no"/>bounded joy the friends of Ireland and the friends <lb/>
of England as well. But with what terrible mean<lb break="no"/>ing are not these words prefaced? It is known <lb/>
that Mr. Dillon is a man of noble and unstained <lb/>
character. No harsh words would be expected to <lb/>
cross the lips of such a man, yet he tells us there <lb/>
was a time when the very name of England was <lb/>
hateful to him. How terrible these words are? <lb/>
They are the expression of the bitterness accumul<lb break="no"/>ated through centuries and centuries of persecu<lb break="no"/>tions in succeeding generations of Irishmen. But, <lb/>
Sir, mark the change. Less than five years of a <lb/>
generous attempt by a great party to do justice <lb/>
to Ireland, to give her the liberty and justice <lb/>
to which she is entitled, has worked wonders <lb/>
and changed the disposition of the Irish people. <lb/>
These five years of generous attempts to do justice <lb/>
to Ireland have erased the sentiment of bitterness <lb/>
and replaced it by sentiments of affection to the <lb/>
land whose very name was hateful to Ireland <lb/>
only a few years ago. What a triumph this is for <lb/>
the cause of Ireland? What a triumph this is for <lb/>
those who, in this House, told the English people <lb/>
that if they were to treat the Irish people gener<lb break="no"/>ously, they would have the same result in Ireland <lb/>
as in this country? What an evidence also <lb/>
this is that the only manner, after all, in <lb/>
which you can attach a people to their alle<lb break="no"/>giance is to treat them with fairness and <lb/>
generosity; and what a rebuke it is to all those <lb/>
(my hon. friend from North Simcoe included) <lb/>
who believe that the only manner in which to make <lb/>
a people loyal is to trample under foot everything <lb/>
which they hold dear and sacred. Sir, I have just <lb/>
pronounced the name of Home Rule. Home Rule <lb/>
with us is local autonomy, and I hope that this <lb/>
principle of local autonomy will some day afford us <lb/>
some solution of the difficulty we have now to deal <lb/>
with. What is objectionable in this Bill is not, as <lb/>
has been often stated, the object of the Bill itself, <lb/>
(which is, after all, with some exceptions, a local <lb/>
question), but the tendency of the Bill and the <lb/>
principles which underlie it, for we know that <lb/>
this is only a preliminary step that is to be fol<lb break="no"/>lowed by many others. We are, today, in the <lb/>

<cb/>

fourth day of this debate, and I have to make the <lb/>
reproach that the Government have not yet told <lb/>
us what their policy is on the question. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, of late, do not discharge the duty they <lb/>
owe to this House. They can advise us on matters <lb/>
of details and matters of procedure, but when it <lb/>
comes to a question of principle they refuse to dis<lb break="no"/>charge the duties for which they are responsible to <lb/>
the House. We had a speech the other day from <lb/>
the hon. the Minister of Public Works. He simply <lb/>
told us he was against the Bill, but he affirmed no <lb/>
principle which we might apply to the situation. <lb/>
We have three propositions before us: the Bill itself, <lb/>
the amendment of my hon. friend from Assiniboia <lb/>
(Mr. Davin) and the amendment of my hon. friend <lb/>
from Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil). I am free to speak <lb/>
of them, but in what I say I declare that I express <lb/>
my own personal opinion. I do not speak here as the <lb/>
leader of a party—I express my own opinion, and <lb/>
nothing more. As to the amendment of the hon. <lb/>
member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), I have to say <lb/>
that, in my opinion, it is premature. It is endeav<lb break="no"/>oring to give to the people of the Territories <lb/>
upon one question, plenary power, while they are <lb/>
still in a form of tutelage. We are not repared <lb/>
to give to the people of the North-West full local <lb/>
autonomy. We cannot expect that a population <lb/>
which in 1885 numbered only something like 30,000 <lb/>
souls—the population of a small town, scattered <lb/>
over immense territories, out of which several <lb/>
empires can be carved—can be entrusted with the <lb/>
full power of responsible government. The amend<lb break="no"/>ment of my hon. friend from Berthier (Mr. Beau<lb break="no"/>soleil) is, perhaps, more consistent with our true <lb/>
position. The amendment affirms the proposition <lb/>
that the present state of things ought to be per<lb break="no"/>manent. With this, however, I cannot agree, and <lb/>
although I am prepared to vote for the amendment <lb/>
of my hon. friend from Berthier, I cannot do so <lb/>
Without taking exception to his statements. It is <lb/>
impossible to admit, for instance, that the institu<lb break="no"/>tions of the North-West are permanent. On the <lb/>
contrary, they are exceptionally temporary; they <lb/>
deal with a state of things which is exceptional in <lb/>
itself; they were devise at a time when there was <lb/>
no population, and they must be modified from <lb/>
time to time as the necessities of the case require. <lb/>
But at this moment to say they are permanent, is <lb/>
a thing in which I cannot agree, except so far as <lb/>
they must be permanent in every particular, so <lb/>
long as we are not ready to give these peo<lb break="no"/>ple a more extended form of local authority. <lb/>
My hon. friend also says in this amendment, that <lb/>
since we passed this law and gave this incipient <lb/>
constitution to the North-West Territories, no<lb break="no"/>thing has occurred to change our views. I cannot <lb/>
agree with that. Everything has occurred since <lb/>
that time, not to change our views, but to set us <lb/>
thinking about what we should do at a future time, <lb/>
not very far off, in regard to those Territories. <lb/>
What has occurred is this: a population has gone <lb/>
into those Territories; they have been given a <lb/>
Legislature; and that Legislature has demanded <lb/>
certain measures—not only on the question of lan<lb break="no"/>guage, but on that of the schools, and on the <lb/>
system of Government. Bearing these facts in <lb/>
mind, it seems to me that the proper time to deal <lb/>
with this question will be when we are repared <lb/>
to give the Territories, perhaps not absolute, but <lb/>
a more extended form of local self—government; <lb/>
and when that time comes, we must be prepared <lb/>

to deal with this question upon the broad principle <lb/>
of this Constitution, which has been devised for <lb/>
the safety of the majority and the protection of <lb/>
the minority, and in the light of the condition of <lb/>
things which may exist at that time in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. But till then I believe it is better to defer <lb/>
the consideration of this question. There is this <lb/>
remarkable feature in the Bill we have before us: <lb/>
it is not founded on an expression of the will <lb/>
of the people of the Territories; it is founded <lb/>
simply on alleged principles applicable to the <lb/>
whole Dominion. This is what I object to in <lb/>
this Bill, and—though it is my own individual <lb/>
opinion only—I submit to all parties in this House, <lb/>
French or English, Liberals or Conservatives, <lb/>
that the best thing for us to do is to defer the <lb/>
consideration of this question to a future time <lb/>
when we shall be prepared to deal with all the <lb/>
questions now affecting the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. In the meantime, however, we ought to <lb/>
remember this—French, English, Liberals, Con<lb break="no"/>servatives—that no race in this country has abso<lb break="no"/>lute rights, only the rights which do not invade <lb/>
the rights of any other race. We ought to remem<lb break="no"/>ber that the expression of race feelings and race <lb/>
sentiments should be well restrained to a point, <lb/>
beyond which, if pressed, though still kept within <lb/>
legitimate limits, they might hurt the feelings and <lb/>
sentiments of other races. But when the time <lb/>
comes for dealing with this question, I hope we <lb/>
shall all be prepared, without party differences, to <lb/>
deal with it on the broad principles that apply to <lb/>
this Constitution; that we shall not, French or <lb/>
English, hesitate to apply true principles under <lb/>
the fear that evil consequences may flow from <lb/>
them, because we must remember that true prin<lb break="no"/>ciples are only an emanation of Divine truth, and <lb/>
that there is above us an eternal Providence whose <lb/>
infinite wisdom knows better than man what is <lb/>
best for man, and who, even when all seems lost, <lb/>
still guides everything for the greatest good. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. I go a great way <lb/>
with my hon. friend in his remarks concerning the <lb/>
principle of this Bill. I sympathise with his very <lb/>
natural feelings of indignation at much of the lan<lb break="no"/>guage that has been used in su port of this mea<lb break="no"/>sure now before the House. I have no accord <lb/>
with the desire expressed in some quarters that by <lb/>
any mode whatever there should be an attempt <lb/>
made to oppress the one language or to render it <lb/>
inferior to the other; I believe that would be im<lb break="no"/>possible if it were tried, and it would be foolish <lb/>
and wicked if it were possible. The statement <lb/>
that has been made so often that this is a conquered <lb/>
 country is <hi rendition="simple:italic">à propos de rien</hi>. Whether it was con<lb break="no"/>quered or ceded, we have a constitution now under <lb/>
which all British subjects are in a position of ab<lb break="no"/>solute equality, havin equal rights of every kind <lb/>
—of language, of region, of property and of <lb/>
person. There is no paramount race in this coun<lb break="no"/>try; there is no conquered race in this country; <lb/>
we are all British subjects, and those who are <lb/>
not English are none the less British subjects on <lb/>
that account. But while I say so much, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, I must regret that my hon. friend, per<lb break="no"/>haps yielding to the necessity of his position as <lb/>
a party leader, should have commenced his <lb/>
speech with some party attacks against the <lb/>
Tories. My hon. friend felt constrained, I sup<lb break="no"/>pose, to make those allusions which, in the cir<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

cumstances of the case, I think were not altogether <lb/>
generous or altogether politic. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
spoke of the spirit of this Bill being that of <lb/>
Toryism, utter Toryism, oppressive Toryism. <lb/>
Why, Sir, if he looks at the history of England in <lb/>
modern days, I think he will find that most of the <lb/>
liberal measures passed there have been passed, if <lb/>
not by Tories, by Conservatives. I think also, if <lb/>
he will look at the history of Canada, he will find <lb/>
at all events, that liberality towards the French <lb/>
Canadian race was pretty much confined to the <lb/>
Conservative party. The hon. gentleman had to <lb/>
admit that while this Bill was, as he affirmed, an <lb/>
evidence of utter Toryism, the exclusion of the <lb/>
French language, the injury done to the French <lb/>
people, the insult offered to them, came from a <lb/>
Radical, the Earl of Durham. To be sure, my hon. <lb/>
friend said that Lord Durham was a Radical who <lb/>
did not understand all about liberty. That is quite <lb/>
evident; and so great a Radical was he that in <lb/>
order to get rid of him the English Government <lb/>
sent him to this country to show us his liberalism <lb/>
by attempting to deprive half the people of their <lb/>
right to use their own language. Ay, Mr. Speaker, <lb/>
and he succeeded in carrying out that effort; he <lb/>
succeeded in excluding the French language, and <lb/>
the measure was carried by a Liberal Government-<lb break="yes"/>in England. That was in 1840. The first <lb/>
Government formed in Canada under that <lb/>
measure in 1841 was a confused Government, <lb/>
where Liberals, and Tories, and officials were <lb/>
mixed up together. But, Sir, in 1844, when there <lb/>
was a stand-up fight between Conservatives and <lb/>
Liberals, when the Conservatives rallied around <lb/>
Lord Metcalfe, and carried a majority; when the <lb/>
Parliament met in Montreal in that year, with a <lb/>
Conservative majority, the whole of the French <lb/>
Canadian race, with the exception, I think, of <lb/>
four, were in opposition to the Government. I <lb/>
was then elected for the first time, and I sat in <lb/>
that Parliament as a Tory, a supporter of Lord <lb/>
Metcalfe. In that Parliament the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians were powerless; and yet, Mr. Speaker, <lb/>
what did that House do? Let me read to you a <lb/>
resolution that was passed, not by a Liberal or <lb/>
Radical Government, not by a Parliament having <lb/>
sympathy with the French Canadians exactly, but <lb/>
by a Conservative Parliament elected, as was then <lb/>
alleged, in opposition to the interests of the <lb/>
Province of Lower Canada; and yet passed, <lb/>
from a more sense of justice, and without <lb/>
one single dissenting voice. Yes, from a <lb/>
more sense of justice, the resolution was <lb/>
passed and the address was passed without <lb/>
one dissenting voice. I, as a member of the young <lb/>
Tory party, was proud then to have the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of pronouncing on that question. The yeas <lb/>
and nays were not taken because we were unani<lb break="no"/>mous, but I was proud of having had a part, as a <lb/>
member of a great party, in the resolve to relieve <lb/>
our French Canadian friends from the oppressive <lb/>
action of the Liberal Government in England, at <lb/>
the instigation of the Radical Earl Durham. What <lb/>
said that address? I shall not read the whole ad<lb break="no"/>dress which went home to Her Majesty, and of <lb/>
which the chief clause was repealed, but it went <lb/>
on to say: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

<p>That was the measure of justice offered to the <lb/>
French Canadians by a Liberal Parliament in <lb/>
England and a Radical Governor General and High <lb/>

Canada say? <lb/></p>

<p>"That in the very first session of the Legislature under <lb/>

and for every other practical urpose, it is as much used <lb/>
as it ever has been. That the only distinctlon which <lb/>
crusts, then, is, that the French is not permitted to be the <lb/>
legal language of Parliamentary record, a distinction of <lb/>
little value, perhaps, in itself—one which cannot produce <lb/>
any beneficial results on the feelings or the habits of <lb/>
the people using it, while it gives rise to a feeling among <lb/>
them injurious to the best peace and tranquility of the <lb/>

an unfavorable distinction towards themselves. <lb/></p>

</quote>
<p>There is an instance of the oppressive Toryism <lb/>
which my hon. friend lamented. But my hon. <lb/>
friend ought to have looked at the history <lb/>
of old Canada after that period. My hon. <lb/>
friend says truly that a Conservative Government <lb/>
was kept in for years by the support of the Con<lb break="no"/>servatives of Lower Canada. And why was that <lb/>
so? Because from the Conservative party the <lb/>
Lower Canadians got full and ample justice. What <lb/>
 party was it that relieved the <hi rendition="simple:italic">habitants</hi> of Lower <lb/>
 Canada, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">censitaires</hi> of Lower Canada, from the <lb/>
oppression of the seigniorial tenure? What was it <lb/>
that made them free men instead of being victims <lb/>
of antiquated feudalism? The seigniorial tenure <lb/>
oppressed them, and the people rose against it; <lb/>
and it was a Conservative Government, of which I <lb/>
had the honor to be a member, that relieved <lb/>
them of that burden. You might remember, Sir, <lb/>
that when the Hon. George Brown brought his <lb/>
immense force and ability and unsusurpassed energy <lb/>
to lead the Reform party of old Upper Canada, <lb/>
his whole aim was oppression to the French. <lb/>
Every speech he made, every article that he wrote in <lb/>
 the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, every resolution almost which he moved, <lb/>
was a denunciation of the French law, the French <lb/>
language, and the Catholic religion; and because <lb/>
we, the Conservatives, opposed him with all our <lb/>
might and all our vigor, we were in a minority in <lb/>
our Province. Again and again have the best and <lb/>
the strongest of our Conservatives been de<lb break="no"/>feated at the polls simply because we would not <lb/>
do injustice to our French follow-countrymen. <lb/>

<cb/>

Again and again have we been put in a <lb/>
minority because we declined to join in <lb/>
that crusade against the French Canadians, <lb/>
against the Catholic religion, and against French <lb/>
institutions. Again and again have I been mis<lb break="no"/>represented and called the slave of popery, and <lb/>
told that I had sold myself to the French of Lower <lb/>
Canada and was sacrificing my own race, my own <lb/>
religion, and my own people because, without a <lb/>
moment of hesitation, without swerving for an <lb/>
instant, I and those who followed me—for even <lb/>
when I was not the nominal leader, I greatly <lb/>
directed the course of the Conservative party—de<lb break="no"/>clined, from no personal motive or desire of popu<lb break="no"/>larity, the popular cry was raised against the <lb/>
French Canadians in Upper Canada then as it is <lb/>
in Ontario, to-day—to do an injustice to our French <lb/>
Canadian fellow-citizens; and it was not a fair <lb/>
taunt of the hon. gentleman to tell us that we <lb/>
owed our position to the support of the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tives of Lower Canada. Does the hon. gentleman <lb/>
not remember when the agitation was raised in <lb/>
Upper Canada on a very specious cry—the question <lb/>
of representation by population—that the popu<lb break="no"/>lation being equal in Upper Canada should have <lb/>
as many members as Lower Canada, which it <lb/>
had not at the time of the Union, because at <lb/>
that time Lower Canada had a larger popula<lb break="no"/>tion than Upper Canada—does the hon. gentleman <lb/>
not remember that the Conservative party opposed <lb/>
that cry, specious and popular as it was? And <lb/>
why did we oppose it? Because the avowed <lb/>
object was to crush and oppress our French <lb/>
Canadian subjects. The reason why I oppose the <lb/>
Bill of my hon. friend to-day is the same—because <lb/>
that Bill, a small Bill; I might almost call it an <lb/>
insignificant Bill in its enacting clause—is based <lb/>
on the purpose of doing away with the French <lb/>
language, of discarding the French language, at all <lb/>
events, and depriving the French Canadian people <lb/>
of the solace of the language they learned at the <lb/>
feet of their mothers. Why, Mr. Speaker, if there <lb/>
is one act of oppression more than another which <lb/>
would come home to a man's breast, it is that he <lb/>
should be deprived of the consolation of hearing <lb/>
and speaking and reading the language that his <lb/>
mother taught him. It is cruel. It is seething <lb/>
the kid in its mother's milk. The greatest, per<lb break="no"/>haps, of all the objections to this measure, is that <lb/>
it is a futile measure. It will not succeed. It <lb/>
cannot succeed. As my hon. friend from Both<lb break="no"/>well (Mr. Mills) said the other day, and as the hon. <lb/>
member from the West Riding of Durham (Mr. <lb/>
Blake) repeated, in order to carry out an oppressive <lb/>
measure we must have a Russian Government or <lb/>
we must have a Stafford here; we must put down <lb/>
the language with a strong hand; we must exclude <lb/>
it from the schools; we must exclude it from <lb/>
oflicial life; no man in Canada who spoke French <lb/>
must be allowed to take office; the Frenchman <lb/>
must be made a Pariah, and his language must be <lb/>
made a mark of scorn; that is the only way to <lb/>
carry out the principle or the object of my hon. <lb/>
friend the Minister for North Simcoe. <lb/></p> 

<p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. Did I call my <lb/>
hon. friend the Minister from North Simcoe? That <lb/>
is giving him more than equal rights. But in <lb/>
hon. friend has commenced at the wrong end. He <lb/>
should attack the language where it is; he should <lb/>

<fw type="num">749</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">750</fw>

not attack it where it is not. He should have <lb/>
gone down to the Province of Quebec, and, by <lb/>
peaceable means—he says by peaceable means, <lb/>
though I heard some remarks about bayonets from <lb/>
my hon. friend opposite—and, by his skill and his <lb/>
eloquence, and by other means which, no doubt, he <lb/>
has presented to his own mind and will give to us <lb/>
by-and-bye, he should have shown the people there <lb/>
that it is for their good, that it is for the good of <lb/>
the party, and for the unity and good of the <lb/>
country, and should. have convinced them that it <lb/>
was necessary for them to give up their language. <lb/>
His present proposal is like the sting of a gnat—a <lb/>
sort of irritation which can be of no use, and could <lb/>
not carry out the avowed object of my hon. friend. <lb/>
There is scarcely any French spoken in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West. There are a few French Canadians there, <lb/>
and a scattered population of French half-breeds, <lb/>
and the whole effect of this Bill would be to deprive <lb/>
these poor people of reading or knowing the laws <lb/>
to which they are subject. I say the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man commenced at the wrong end. If the butcher <lb/>
goes to kill an ox, he goes to strike him on the <lb/>
head, and does not cut a little piece off the tail, <lb/>
which, after all, is the only effect of the measure of <lb/>
my hon. friend. But he is such an able man that <lb/>
one wonders—I wonder, with my limited appre<lb break="no"/>hension—what he would accomplish by this <lb/>
measure. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MITC2">Mr. MITCHELL</persName>. He got loaded up the wrong <lb/>
way. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. It cannot be <lb/>
from any desire to save the $400 which my hon. <lb/>
friend is ready to pay. It cannot be for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of spreading the English language more than <lb/>
it is spread there. It cannot have the effect of <lb/>
inducing the half-breeds who are hunting over the <lb/>
plains to change their language from French to <lb/>
English. Unless it be that my hon. friend has a <lb/>
dislike to the language—and I am not aware that <lb/>
he knows much about it—or has a dislike to the <lb/>
people who use the language, I cannot understand <lb/>
why he has pressed this Bil1. It is on record that <lb/>
an English sailor, returning from France, was <lb/>
asked what kind of people the French were. "Oh," <lb/>
said the sailor with an expletive, "they are a bad <lb/>
lot." "What is the matter with them?" "Oh," <lb/>
 he said, "they call a hat a <hi rendition="simple:italic">chapeau</hi>; why the deuce <lb/>
could they not call it a hat at once, and be hanged <lb/>
to them?" And that is very much the spirit of <lb/>
my hon. friend. I did not intend to speak on this <lb/>
matter at all after having heard the exhaustive <lb/>
speeches which have been made on the other side, <lb/>
and I must say, with the little exception of the <lb/>
slight touch of partisanship in the speech of my <lb/>
hon. friend who spoke last (Mr. Laurier), the <lb/>
speeches of the gentlemen who have honored the <lb/>
House have been of such a kind that I agree with <lb/>
almost everything they say. <lb/></p>

<cb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>. At all events, <lb/>
he sits in very suspicious juxtaposition to the leader <lb/>
of that party. The objections to be taken to the <lb/>
resolution now before the House, moved by the <lb/>
hon. member for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil), have <lb/>
been already given by the hon. member for West <lb/>
Durham (Mr. Blake). Without entering into the <lb/>
general discussion of the resolution, it is in my mind <lb/>
sufficiently condemnatory of it to call upon the <lb/>
House to reject it, that, if it means anything, it <lb/>
means the continuation of the present state of <lb/>
things must be perpetual. It says that any alter<lb break="no"/>ation will cause a distrust, a suspicion, a doubt of <lb/>
the stability of our laws. If that is any reason <lb/>
against giving to the Legislature in the North-West <lb/>
now the power to deal with this matter, the same <lb/>
reason will exist twenty years hence, and it would <lb/>
keep the question permanently a source of disquiet <lb/>
and agitation and discomfort, not only in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, but in Ontario and other Provinces, amongst <lb/>
all those who take a warm interest in this matter. <lb/>
I think also the resolution of which we had some <lb/>
information from the hon. member from the West <lb/>
Riding (Mr. Blake) is liable to almost a similar <lb/>
objection. It leaves the case undecided, and <lb/>
while these two resolutions have that effect, <lb/>
we must remember that this is a subject of great <lb/>
agitation in different parts of the Dominion. <lb/>
Lower Canada is agitated on account of this attack <lb/>
on their language; the North-West will be agitated <lb/>
if it is supposed that they are deprived of the <lb/>
right of judging on this subject; and we must take <lb/>
great care, Mr. Speaker, that while we are calming <lb/>
the agitation and soothing the agitated feelings of <lb/>
the people of Quebec, we are not arousing the <lb/>
feelings of the freemen of the North-West by <lb/>
passing a resolution which postpones for an indefi<lb break="no"/>nite time, it may be for a long period, a question <lb/>
in which we can see, from the resolution they have <lb/>
adopted, that they are greatly interested. I think, <lb/>
therefore, Mr. Speaker, that the true solution of <lb/>
this question, a solution that will quiet the feelings <lb/>
of the East and that will be satisfactory to the <lb/>
people who roam over the plains of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, will be the resolution in principle of my <lb/>
hon. friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), in <lb/>
which he says: Let the representatives of the <lb/>
people up there judge for themselves, after having <lb/>
had a commission from the people to deal with the <lb/>
subject. I think if that were adopted it would <lb/>
 satisfy the North-West, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">amende honorable</hi> <lb/>
that was made in this House by that resolution <lb/>
would quiet the insulted feelings of the people <lb/>
of the Province of Quebec, and we would have <lb/>
peace, through the benign influence of this reso<lb break="no"/>lution of my hon. friend from Assiniboia. I <lb/>
would ask my hon. friend opposite, my hon. friend <lb/>
from the West Riding of Durham (Mr. Blake), to <lb/>
take this matter into his consideration, and see <lb/>
whether there cannot be adopted very much of his <lb/>
resolution, with which I am most heartily in <lb/>
accord, and, in addition, to enquire whether, after <lb/>
the people had an opportunity of considering the <lb/>
question, after the next general election, and after <lb/>
they have read the discussion in this House, and <lb/>
after they have seen the general opinion of Par<lb break="no"/>liament the great inquest of the nation, it would <lb/>
not be right and fair to trust to the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the people in our far west to choose for <lb/>
themselves? They will act for their own county, <lb/>
for their own section, and their action will be only <lb/>

temporary. That country is infinitely too large to <lb/>
be one Province; it is too large, in my opinion, to <lb/>
be four Provinces, and this is a matter for the <lb/>
future, and, therefore, a resolution of this kind, <lb/>
giving them the power to deal with the subject, <lb/>
after being commissioned by the people, will be <lb/>
quite safe. After the population comes in there, <lb/>
if there is a large German population—and I should <lb/>
be very glad to see it—who shall take possession of <lb/>
a large section of that area, why not give them the <lb/>
right to use the German language? They would <lb/>
insist upon it whenever their numbers were suffi<lb break="no"/>cient. If the French Canadian settlement, which <lb/>
was commenced under rather unfavorable auspices <lb/>
at Edmonton, should increase and grow so that <lb/>
they would become a French Canadian Province, <lb/>
they would insist upon having their own language. <lb/>
This is a measure of peace and a measure for only <lb/>
a time. Under all the circumstances, the fact that <lb/>
they are not yet a Province, is of very little con<lb break="no"/>sequence. Whether they are called a Province or <lb/>
a Territory, they have rights as British subjects. <lb/>
Whether the people occupy a Territory or occupy <lb/>
a Province, if they want to use the French language, <lb/>
they should be allowed to use it; and if they want <lb/>
to use the English language, they should be allowed <lb/>
to use it, and it should be left to themselves. If <lb/>
there should be anything else attached to a mea<lb break="no"/>sure of this kind when transmitted from the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, if there is anything further than a mere <lb/>
statement respecting the language, if any improper <lb/>
legislation attached to this, there is a remedy. All <lb/>
that this House and that this Government has to do <lb/>
is to check any improper legislation exceeding <lb/>
their powers, as, for instance, constituting them<lb break="no"/>selves a constituent Assembly instead of a Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive body, as they are now. These are my senti<lb break="no"/>ments, very crudely expressed, and I must ask my <lb/>
hon. friends opposite to weigh this question care<lb break="no"/>fully to see whether some joint measure of peace <lb/>
should not be adopted, and then the whole ques<lb break="no"/>tion, in my opinion, would be ended forever. <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Mr. BLAKE</persName>. I would ask the privilege of the <lb/>

to me personally before the recess. I wish to say <lb/>
that I have given the consideration which was due <lb/>
to everything the hon. gentleman has said, and <lb/>
that while my own judgment remains that the <lb/>
proper solution of this question is embodied in the <lb/>
suggestion which I submitted for the consideration <lb/>
of the House, I believe that the best interests of <lb/>
Canada are to be served by, if possible, a harmo<lb break="no"/>nious settlement of the question. For my part, I <lb/>
should not desire to adhere to any individual <lb/>
opinion, or to the terms of my suggestion, if there <lb/>
could be devised any reasonable modification of <lb/>
those terms which might meet the assent of the <lb/>
leading men of both sides and of both races within <lb/>
this chamber, and I have some hope that such a <lb/>
result may be reached before this debate is ended. <lb/>
I think it my duty to have made that statement to <lb/>
the House, because the great disaster which has <lb/>
happened to the University of which I am Chan<lb break="no"/>cellor, obliges me to leave to-night in connection <lb/>
with its interests; therefore, my own proposition <lb/>

<cb/>

I must leave in the hands of the House at large. <lb/>
I know not whether it may be adopted or whether <lb/>
some modification of it may be adopted, but I do <lb/>

debate, I wish to remark that I have seen an im<lb break="no"/>portant statement in an evening paper, to which, <lb/>
I think, the attention of the House should <lb/>
be called. It is headed: "It hovered over us. <lb/>
The close shave we had of a war with the United <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"CINCINNATI, Ohio Feb. 17.—In a speech at the dedi<lb break="no"/>cation of the First Regiment Armory, Saturday night, <lb/>

<p>It is a very important statement, and I would <lb/>

<p>House resumed debate on proposed motion of <lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:COCK7">Mr. COCKBURN</persName>. I am sure that every hon. <lb/>
member has been delighted to hear from the lips of <lb/>
the hon. member for West Durham (Mr. Blake), the <lb/>
declaration just made that he desires that the pre<lb break="no"/>sent difficulty should be amicably settled, and I feel <lb/>
confident that in this House there is enough <lb/>
patriotism, enough religious and political toleration, <lb/>
and enough statemanship to enable us to arrive at <lb/>
a solution which will be acceptable to all. Indeed, <lb/>
Sir, it has been to me, I may say, a source of grief <lb/>
to witness the acrimonious spirit in which this <lb/>
debate has been conducted, and to see old feuds, <lb/>
old emnities and religious animosities excited, <lb/>
which I am sure every one in this House <lb/>
must have felt had better have lain forever <lb/>
dormant until they had died their natural death. <lb/>
At the same time I do not see why the Bill of the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) <lb/>
should have excited so much alarm. I speak of <lb/>
the Bill itself, for when I look at the preamble I <lb/>
must confess I cannot father it. It is the preamble <lb/>
which in its nature may tend, and has tended, to <lb/>
excite the strongest animosity and the strongest <lb/>
distrust on the part of our French members, and <lb/>
many have seen in it an attempt on the part of my <lb/>
hon. friend to deprive them of their political and <lb/>
religious liberties throughout the Dominion. I am <lb/>
sure, from the intercourse I have enjoyed for some <lb/>
years with the hon. gentleman, that such purposes <lb/>
are not in his heart. It may be that this preamble <lb/>
is a kind of indication of what was lurking in his <lb/>

<fw type="num">753</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">754</fw>

mind, and of that condition he would desire to see <lb/>
established throughout the length and breadth of <lb/>
the land—one language; but, at the same time, <lb/>
it is not in his heart, nor is it his intention, to adopt <lb/>
any legislation, or other such means, to endeavor to <lb/>
bring about such a result, as he must be conscious <lb/>
that such a mode of action would be utterly <lb/>
futile. I must express my sympathy with those <lb/>
French members who have been alarmed on the <lb/>
present occasion. I have spent a good part of my <lb/>
life in France, and my boyhood and early manhood <lb/>
are associated with the pleasures of that country, <lb/>
and I have seized every opportunity I have had <lb/>
since manhood to renew my acquaintance with <lb/>
France; and, therefore, I enter on a discussion of <lb/>
such a subject as this with no sympathy for any <lb/>
fanatics, but with a desire to arrive at some result <lb/>
which may be satisfactory to all parties, and which <lb/>
may be for the ultimate benefit of our common <lb/>
country. I regret that religious animosities should <lb/>
have been excited, for I can never forget that over <lb/>
three hundred years ago, it was the Catholic Lord <lb/>
Howard of Effingham who led the fleet of England <lb/>
against the Spanish Armada, and that he did so <lb/>
after having kissed the hand of the English Queen, <lb/>
whom he knew had been declared by the Sovereign <lb/>
Pontiff to be illegitimate, to be a heretic, and to <lb/>
have been excommunicated. I cannot help think<lb break="no"/>ing that during the whole of this debate we have <lb/>
been moving on too high a plane, and have been <lb/>
led away by the preamble of the Bill, to which most <lb/>
of the efforts of opponents of the Bill have been <lb/>
directed. I might take the ground, following the <lb/>
decision of last year arrived at by the authorities on <lb/>
constitutional law, on both sides of this House, that <lb/>
the preamble has nothing to do with the Bill, that <lb/>
we must consider the Bill itself; that was the doc<lb break="no"/>trine proclaimed last year, and it is one which may <lb/>
be applied on the present occasion. But, apart from <lb/>
the preamble, when you look at the Bill, what is it? <lb/>
It is a Bill founded simply on the petition of a number <lb/>
of gentlemen in the North-West Territories, called <lb/>
the Legislative Council. Those gentlemen, rightly <lb/>
or wrongly, wisely or unwisely, have been entrusted <lb/>
with the management of the affairs of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories. They have the confidence, so <lb/>
far as we know, of the electors of these Territories, <lb/>
they are as duly qualified to vote as are the electors <lb/>
of Ontario or of Quebec, and they are there on the <lb/>
spot, and in a full House almost unanimously they <lb/>
have asked to be relieved of a disability which was <lb/>
imposed upon them, and which they never re<lb break="no"/>quested or expected would have been laid upon <lb/>
them. They tell us that circumstances have so <lb/>
changed that the system which has been in opera<lb break="no"/>tion in the Territories is no longer satisfactory and <lb/>
that it is unwise to continue such a disability, and <lb/>
they beg to be relieved of it. I have examined the <lb/>
returns of the last census in 1885, and I find in the <lb/>
North-West Territories the whole population by <lb/>
nationalities was 48,362 souls, of whom there were <lb/>
savage Indians 20,170, leaving a population of <lb/>
28,192; and of that number the French population <lb/>
amounted to 1,520; or only 5 2/3 per cent. of the <lb/>
population of 28,000 , or 3 1/10 per cent. of the whole <lb/>
population. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:LARI1">Mr. LARIVIERE</persName>. It is true that the French <lb/>
Canadian population is 1,500, but there is a large <lb/>
French half-breed population which the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man forgets.   <lb/>

<cb/>

Mr. COCKBURN. I will take up that point <lb/>
immediately. I am kindly reminded by my hon. <lb/>
friend, that there is another population in the <lb/>
North-West Territories, a half-breed French popu<lb break="no"/>lation. I am aware of the fact that that popula<lb break="no"/>tion numbers 3,387, but I understand on reliable <lb/>
authority that this is not a French-speaking popu<lb break="no"/>lation, but a population which speaks the Cree <lb/>
language, and I do not think I am entitled to <lb/>
rank them with the 1,520 French in the Territories. <lb/>
At all events, I cannot put them on the same foot<lb break="no"/>ing. I will go further, and say, that since that <lb/>
census was taken I have no doubt in my own <lb/>
mind, and my conviction is strengethened by <lb/>
authentic information, that the increase of the <lb/>
English-speaking population and the German-<lb break="yes"/>speaking population and other nationalities has <lb/>
been so great, that, instead of the French popula<lb break="no"/>tion being 5 per cent. it is now probably less. The <lb/>
hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) spoke to us <lb/>
the other day of this being an attempt on the part <lb/>
of 3,000,000 people to swallow 2,000,000. There is <lb/>
no such attempt. He said this reminded him of <lb/>
the fact that it was a whale and not a cod that <lb/>
swallowed Jonah. I beg to remind the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, that if he is going to reverse the decision <lb/>
of the majority for 5 per cent. of the population, <lb/>
he is asking Jonah to swallow the whale. With <lb/>
respect to the population in the Province of <lb/>
Quebec, with which a comparison has been made, <lb/>
I find that there is a total population of 1,350,000, <lb/>
the French population numbering upwards of <lb/>
1,000,000, the English-speaking numbering 268,000, <lb/>
or 19 per cent. of the population. I do not think <lb/>
we have a right to institute such comparisons, <lb/>
and I only mention them as they have been <lb/>
already made, because those rights of the people of <lb/>
the Province of Quebec, the rights of the minority <lb/>
in Quebec and of the minority in Ontario, and in <lb/>
every other Province in the Dominion, will, I trust, <lb/>
for ever remain undisturbed; and I will be no party, <lb/>
directly or indirectly, to do anything which, in my <lb/>
humble judgment, would amount to an attempt to <lb/>
break up one of the most sacred contracts into <lb/>
which any two people have ever entered. I mention <lb/>
this matter fully in order that my position may be <lb/>
clearly understood. The position of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories has been presented to us as <lb/>
resembling very much the position occupied by <lb/>
Switzerland. We have been pointed to Switzer<lb break="no"/>land as a guiding star for us. Even the member <lb/>
for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) was so careful as to give <lb/>
all the exports and imports of that country, and he <lb/>
showed us how it was purely an agricultural coun<lb break="no"/>try, and how it was particularly blessed in having <lb/>
a treble language. The analogy was a forced one; <lb/>
in fact, I know of no two countries so utterly dissi<lb break="no"/>milar in every respect as the North-West Territo<lb break="no"/>ries and Switzerland. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I wish to correct the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, because I know he does not wish to misinter<lb break="no"/>pret my remarks in proceeding with his lucid <lb/>
argument. I did not compare Switzerland to the <lb/>
North-West Territories. I said there was an <lb/>
analogy between Canada and Switzerland, although <lb/>
Canada stretches across an entire continent and <lb/>
Switzerland is in the heart of Europe. <lb/></p>

attention to the fact that each of those Territories <lb/>
is only slightly less than the area of the whole <lb/>
of the United Kingdom, 121,000 square miles, while <lb/>
the whole area of Switzerland is only some 15,964 <lb/>
square miles, of which 34 per cent. is over <lb/>
four thousand feet above the level of the sea. <lb/>
There are some 4,521 square miles unproductive, <lb/>
and six per cent. of the whole country is covered <lb/>
with snow fields and glaciers. I do not think you <lb/>
can compare a country like that with what I might <lb/>
call the immense ocean land territory we have in <lb/>
the North-West. I have trudged through the whole <lb/>
of Switzerland, again and again, with my knapsack <lb/>
on my back; and, speaking generally, you could <lb/>
take the whole of it and duck it in Lake Superior, <lb/>
sink it to the bottom there, and were it not for its <lb/>
high mountains like Mount Rosa and others you <lb/>
would never know that it was at the bottom of the <lb/>
lake. I consider Switzerland in almost every respect <lb/>
dissimilar to Canada. In its whole history Swit<lb break="no"/>zerland is entirely different from Canada. In <lb/>
Switzerland we are not dealing with a virgin <lb/>
country as we are in Canada with the North-West, <lb/>
 <lb/>
which was until lately the habitat of the wild <lb/>
beast and the home of the buffalo. We are not <lb/>
dealing with a country without a history; a <lb/>
country spread out before us waiting for emigrants <lb/>
to possess it. In Switzerland we have a country <lb/>
which, in one form or another, has had some form <lb/>
of Government for six hundred years. Switzerland <lb/>
saw the beginning of its Confederation in the year <lb/>
1291, when Uri, Schwyr and Unterwalden united <lb/>
to check the encroachments of the House of Haps<lb break="no"/>burg. In 1332, Luzern joined; in 1351, Zurich <lb/>
joined; in 1353, Glarus and Zug and Berne city <lb/>
joined; in 1481, Freiburg city and Solothurn joined; <lb/>
in 1501, Basie and Schaflhausen joined; in 1513, <lb/>
Appenzell joined: and these 13 cantons remained <lb/>
the Confederation of Switzerland. In 1798, two <lb/>
centuries and a-half or more after this, the Helvetic <lb/>
Republic, under the protection of the French Direc<lb break="no"/>tory, was established. When you look at this coun<lb break="no"/>try which has been held out as a model to ours, what <lb/>
do you find? You find that its growth was from <lb/>
prehistoric times, unaccompanied by serious dis<lb break="no"/>turbing influences. Our growth in the North—West, <lb/>
and throughout the whole of this country, is very <lb/>
different. It has been made up of individual <lb/>
elements brought from all countries, amalgamated <lb/>
together from their own desire to satisfy their <lb/>
economic wants, whereas in Switzerland they were <lb/>
brought together by the external hostile influences <lb/>
around them. There were Austria, Italy, France <lb/>
and Germany crowding them altogether; we find, <lb/>
as soon as they were freed from this external <lb/>
pressure upon them, there was internecine warfare. <lb/>
This country held up to our admiration is a country <lb/>
which had no settled form of government until <lb/>
1848, when the new constitution as adopted by a <lb/>
majority of cantons, though material changes in the <lb/>
form of necessary extension of the constitutional <lb/>
law were made in 1865, and finally in 1874. In <lb/>
the year 1832, we find that seven of the twenty-<lb break="yes"/>two cantons formed themselves together in a Liberal <lb/>
Sonderbund. We find in 1846 the Catholic cantons <lb/>
united in a separate Diet, and a separate Legislature <lb/>
and Senate, so to speak, a revival of the league of <lb/>
Sarnen. So strong is the feeling of a want of <lb/>
union among them that you find in 1832 a civil and <lb/>
religious war; and in 1846 these Catholic cantons <lb/>
raised 50,000 men while the Federation on its side <lb/>

<cb/>

raised some 100,000 men and overcame those op<lb break="no"/>posed to it. We find that in the twenty-two cantons <lb/>
in Switzerland, the official language is that spoken <lb/>
by the majority. The rule they have laid down for <lb/>
themselves is that the majority should decide what <lb/>
the official language should be in each canton. It is <lb/>
not a question of whether five or ten per cent. of <lb/>
the population should speak one language, and be <lb/>
correspondingly represented, but in every case it is <lb/>
decided that the official language shall be the <lb/>
language of the majority in the cantons. Now, <lb/>
in considering those cantons, we must never con<lb break="no"/>found them with our Provinces, although consti<lb break="no"/>tutionally they possess greater rights than the <lb/>
Provinces themselves. In fact, they accepted the <lb/>
doctrine of extreme state rights as it existed before <lb/>
the great civil war in the United States. I have <lb/>
pointed to Switzerland as adopting the official <lb/>
language of the majority, and I should like to see <lb/>
the same thing carried out in our North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. Louisiana has also been brought forward. <lb/>
I find an Act of Congress on the 20th February, <lb/>
1811, with reference to the incorporation of Louis<lb break="no"/>iana, to the effect that they shall be allowed to come <lb/>
into the Union on condition that all its laws, all its <lb/>
records, and all its legislative proceedings were to <lb/>
be preserved in the English language. Austria-<lb break="yes"/>Hungary has also been referred to. In that <lb/>
country we have a population of 41,000,000. Of <lb/>
this we have 8,000,000 Germans, 6,000,000 Magyar, <lb/>
7,000,000 Czechs, 3,000,000 Roumanians, 3,000,000 <lb/>
Poles, 3,000,000 Serbs and Croatians, and 1,500,000 <lb/>
Turks, and other peoples speaking various tongues. <lb/>
There are 21 legislative assemblies and executive <lb/>
councils, and all of these transact their affairs in <lb/>
the distinct languages of the majority. If we look <lb/>
to Switzerland or to Austria-Hungary we shall find <lb/>
that the ruling there is the rule of the majority. <lb/>
Such a rule I would like to see introduced into this <lb/>
Dominion without any reference to religion or to the <lb/>
status of the language, and I am sure there would, <lb/>
in such a case, be very few found in this House who <lb/>
would contest the accuracy of such a proposition. <lb/>
The debate has proceeded as if the proposal were <lb/>
made to obliterate altogether the French language. <lb/>
We have been told that we shall have all to learn <lb/>
English; that the French language will be un<lb break="no"/>known in our country; that we shall have all our <lb/>
papers printed in English, and all our proceedings <lb/>
and private business conducted in English. I con<lb break="no"/>sider such argument a travesty on the question <lb/>
now before us. The question before us is simply <lb/>
and in reality the petition of the North—West <lb/>
Assembly. This Assembly, in the words of their <lb/>
petition, say: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"That whereas, by section one hundred and ten of <lb/>
'The North—West Territories Act,' it is enacted that <lb/>
either the English or the French language may be used <lb/>
by any person in the debates of the Legislative Assembly <lb/>
of the Territories and in the proceedings before the <lb/>
courts; and both these languages shall be used in the <lb/>
records and journals of the Assembly, and all ordinances <lb/>
made under this Act shall be printed in both these lan<lb break="no"/>guages. <lb/></p> 

<p>"And whereas this Assembly is of the opinion that the <lb/>
sentiment of the people of the North-West Territories <lb/>
is against the continuance of the section recited on the <lb/>
grounds that the needs of the Territories do not demand <lb/>
the official recognition of a dual language in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West or the expenditure necessitated by the same. <lb/></p>
 <p>
"And whereas this Assembly is also of the opinion that <lb/>
sound public policy demands the discontinuance of two <lb/>
oflicial languages in the North-West: <lb/></p> 

<p>"Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray." <lb/></p>

ately expressed, of those men who are entrusted with <lb/>
the management of the affairs of the North-West <lb/>
Territories, and they ask us simply to rescind the re<lb break="no"/>solution or law passed by this House binding them <lb/>
to the use of two languages in their courts and in the <lb/>
proceedings of the Legislative Assembly. Why, Sir, <lb/>
I understand that in the whole North-West Council <lb/>
there is not a single member to be found who speaks <lb/>
the French language; and why, in the name of <lb/>
common sense, should we refuse to grant to these <lb/>
men a simple request of this kind? They are the <lb/>
directors and managers of those Territories; they <lb/>
are the men most conversant with all its wants; <lb/>
and they come and tell us that it is a trouble to <lb/>
them to be compelled to use that language, that <lb/>
they wish to be free from it, that it is not wanted, <lb/>
that it is against the sentiment of the people, and <lb/>
that no sound public policy demands its continu<lb break="no"/>ance. We have, unfortunately, in the preamble of <lb/>
this Bill, a totally different question raised; but I <lb/>
trust that the House will divest itself of the feeling <lb/>
that has been aroused by this preamble, and will <lb/>
consider solely and exclusively the request <lb/>
made by this board of gentlemen to this House and <lb/>
will grant it. We have had various countries <lb/>
pointed out to us, among them Schleswig-Holstein, <lb/>
in which the policy of Great Britain was to give to <lb/>
the various sections of the population the use of <lb/>
 their languages—to the Danes, the Danish language, <lb/>
and to the Germans, theirs; and we were told that <lb/>
the Russians in 1862 were advised by England and <lb/>
other countries on the continent of Europe to grant <lb/>
to the Poles the right to speak their own language. <lb/>
I quite agree with these recommendations; but <lb/>
surely it is not contended that the Poles for whom <lb/>
this petition was made, consisted of only 5 or 10 <lb/>
per cent. of the population of Poland, or that the <lb/>
Danes and Germans for whom a similar request <lb/>
was made numbered only 10 per cent. of the total <lb/>
population? Why, the arguments brought forward <lb/>
in reference to other countries have only tended to <lb/>
confirm and strengthen, in my mind, the right of <lb/>
those people in the Legislative Assembly of the <lb/>
North-West to be granted what they ask. Before <lb/>
I take my seat, I should like to read, with reference <lb/>
to Switzerland, one or two paragraphs from the <lb/>
Federal Government of Switzerland by Mr. Moses, <lb/>
published last year, in which he says: <lb/></p>
 
 <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
  <p>
"The conglomerate character of the Swiss population, <lb/>
composed of representatives of the German, French and <lb/>
Italian peoples, has made it difficult to bring all parts to <lb/>
co-operate towards a common national end. The act that <lb/>
these representatives of different peoples have continued <lb/>
in separate groups, each within its own territory, and <lb/>
speaking its own language, has made the growth of a <lb/>
national sentiment slower than it might have been had all <lb/>
been thrown together into a common society and com<lb break="no"/>pelled in the course of time to use a common language. <lb/>
At present German is spoken in fourteen cantons and <lb/>
parts of others; while Italian is confined to the canton of <lb/>
Ticino and a part of Graubunden. To state the relations <lb/>
between these groups in another way, there are 1,352 Ger<lb break="no"/>man communes, 945 French and 291 Italian. Besides <lb/>
these there are 118 communes in Graubunden where the <lb/>
Romansch language is used. Only German, French and <lb/>
Italian, however, are regarded as oflicial languages, and <lb/>
in these three all the federal laws"— <lb/>
 </p>
</quote>
 <p>
Not the cantonal or provincial laws—— <lb/></p>
 <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
 <p>
—"are published, and they may all be used in the trans<lb break="no"/>action of federal business, whether in the assemblies, in <lb/>
the council, or in the courts; moreover, all must be repre<lb break="no"/>sented in the Federal Council. The Romansch language, <lb/>
on the other hand, is not an oflicial language and is sel<lb break="no"/>dom employed in the affairs of the Federal Government. <lb/>
Not only as it regards their language, but in a general <lb/>
way, also as it regards their manners and customs, have <lb/>
the several cantons maintained their individuality. <lb/>
</p>
<cb/>
<p>
"While in Switzerland the representatives of the Ger<lb break="no"/>man, French and Italian peoples have preserved their <lb/>
peculiar characteristics, to a certain extent, by remain<lb break="no"/>ing territorially separated, in the United States there has <lb/>
been a mingling of peoples on the same territoy, and <lb/>
there is already manifest a tendenc to mould those of <lb/>
English, Scotch, Irish, German and candinaviau stock <lb/>
into a new national product." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Well, Sir, I entertain those views with reference <lb/>
to the request of the North-West Assembly; but <lb/>
while I recognise its wisdom, I am not blind to <lb/>
the objections raised in this House or to the sus<lb break="no"/>ceptibilities of our French kindred. I am, there<lb break="no"/>fore, prepared to accept the proposal which has <lb/>
been made with reference to finding some means <lb/>
of dealing with this question, after showing every <lb/>
desire to conciliate those susceptibilities, by leav<lb break="no"/>ing the whole question to be determined by the <lb/>
electors themselves in the North-West Territories, <lb/>
and I can only hope that the brief delay in its settle<lb break="no"/>ment will not give occasion for idle strifes. In view <lb/>
of the fact that we desire to give our French friends, <lb/>
and all the electors, an opportunity to be fully repre<lb break="no"/>sented after the matter has been fully discussed, and <lb/>
in view of the fact that our friends in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West will have before them the debates which <lb/>
have taken place in this House on the question, I <lb/>
think the wisest policy is to accept the suggestion <lb/>
thrown out by the hon. gentleman, and to join all <lb/>
our hands together, and see if we cannot settle <lb/>
this difficulty, which I regret has ever arisen, but <lb/>
which, I hope, will soon be finally solved. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I wish to make a few and only <lb/>
a few observations on this important question. I <lb/>
think the subject from almost every standpoint <lb/>
has been dealt with ably, logically, and generally <lb/>
reasonably; but I consider it to be the duty of <lb/>
every public man, in cases of national emergency, <lb/>
when the national life is at stake, to, as far as pos<lb break="no"/>sible, use conciliatory language, to allay the sus<lb break="no"/>picions of some, and the excitement of others, and <lb/>
to have regard to the feelings of those classes, <lb/>
those religions and those nationalities which are <lb/>
always in opposition to each other. The hon. <lb/>
member for West Durham (Mr. Blake) made use <lb/>
of much more eloquent language in a similar line <lb/>
the other night, and I thought it was to be re<lb break="no"/>gretted that that hon. gentleman, with his great <lb/>
ability, had not successfully carried out the <lb/>
principles which he was then endeavoring to in<lb break="no"/>culcate throughout his previous history. I can <lb/>
only say that from my first entrance into political <lb/>
life to the present time, I have at various times <lb/>
recognised that he has been one of the very im<lb break="no"/>portant factors in creating a strong feeling in <lb/>
the Province of Ontario against our French fellow-<lb break="yes"/>subjects in the Province of Quebec. I know <lb/>
that it was the case in 1871 and 1872, and I <lb/>
thought, when Ithe hon. gentleman was addressing <lb/>
us so elequently the other night, it was a great pity <lb/>
he had not adopted the same moderation when <lb/>
speaking in our local Legislative Assembly in Tor<lb break="no"/>onto, and referringto the murder of "Brother Scott," <lb/>
and when among the English-speakin people the <lb/>
feeling was almost at fever height, an the excite<lb break="no"/>ment so great that men could scarcely restrain <lb/>
themselves, and there was a strong hostility engen<lb break="no"/>dered against our French fellow-citizens, so much so <lb/>
that reason did not always hold her sway, and that <lb/>
very often excitement of sentiment and national <lb/>
prejudice took the place of reason. I think that <lb/>
those gentleman who have dealt with this question <lb/>

<pb n="759" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00759.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">759</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">760</fw> 

have dealt with it very ably. They brought into <lb/>
service many very important lessons of history, and <lb/>
if we wish to learn anything with reference to <lb/>
national life there is no source from which we <lb/>
can glean greater knowledge. From history <lb/>
we can learn the causes of the rise, the <lb/>
growth, the progress and the decay of na<lb break="no"/>tions; from it we can learn those principles <lb/>
which tend to make nations great, powerful, and <lb/>
long-lived; and if the lessons of history teach any<lb break="no"/>thing, they teach us one important truth, that <lb/>
community of language is not essential to national <lb/>
unity, because some of the greatest nations have <lb/>
been cited in which national unity, to all intents <lb/>
and purposes, either for political or social life, ex<lb break="no"/>ists without community of language, which the <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe professes to say is <lb/>
necessary for the well-being of a nation. If <lb/>
Switzerland has now endured for over seven hun<lb break="no"/>dred years and stands as an emblem of greatness <lb/>
in national life, as a federation of states based up<lb break="no"/>on somewhat the same principles as our Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and yet has three different languages recog<lb break="no"/>nised as state languages, does she not teach us the <lb/>
very important lesson that it is not essential to <lb/>
have community of language in order to have a <lb/>
great state? The hon. member for Bothwell laid <lb/>
down some very important rules to guide us <lb/>
in our choice among the resolutions proposed <lb/>
or to be proposed for the solution of this <lb/>
question. He said that the rule upon which the <lb/>
English authorities followed, in reference to what <lb/>
language or languages should be the official lan<lb break="no"/>guage of any new state or country when it was <lb/>
organised, was the rule of convenience. Well, we <lb/>
should apply the rule of convenience to this case, <lb/>
and if the hon. gentleman's logic went to prove <lb/>
anything, it went to prove that the solution of the <lb/>
present difficulty is the one proposed by the hon. <lb/>
member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), because <lb/>
it cannot be inconvenient to that country to have <lb/>
but one language, seeing that there is not one <lb/>
member in the North-West Council who speaks <lb/>
French. If the rule of convenience should be the <lb/>
rule to guide us, when we have the unanimous <lb/>
voice of the North-West Council asking that <lb/>
only one language be official, surely there can be <lb/>
no injustice in granting their petition; and the <lb/>
hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) ought to <lb/>
support the resolution of the hon. member for <lb/>
Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) if he has the strength of <lb/>
his convictions. The hon. member for West Dur<lb break="no"/>ham (Mr. Blake) intimated to this House the <lb/>
nature of the resolution that he would have pro<lb break="no"/>posed had he the opportunity; but I do think that <lb/>
with all his great eloquence and ability, his pro<lb break="no"/>position fell far short of meeting the requirements <lb/>
of the mass of the people. What was his pro<lb break="no"/>position? It was this: We will postpone the day <lb/>
of settlement in that country until, if I may <lb/>
so term it, vested rights grow up in reference to <lb/>
the French language there; until the question may <lb/>
be much more difficult to settle than it is now. <lb/>
He roposes that we should shunt off the respon<lb break="no"/>sibility from our shoulders to-day and relegate it <lb/>
to the future, and in the meantime, allow to be <lb/>
kept up a very dangerous agitation, that may <lb/>
ultimately result in the destruction of the state. <lb/>
I do not think it was statesmanlike on the part of <lb/>
that hon. gentleman to make that proposition. It <lb/>
is much more practical to solve the difficulty by <lb/> 

<cb/>

giving the power into the hands of the people <lb/>
themselves, and thus do no injustice to our French <lb/>
fellow-citizens. Moreover, the hon. gentleman and <lb/>
his supporters have invariably held that the duty <lb/>
of the Federal Parliament was, as far as possible, <lb/>
to give power into the hands of the people to settle <lb/>
these provincial or territorial questions themselves. <lb/>
In harmony with that theory, he has always <lb/>
argued, during the last ten or twelve years, in <lb/>
which I have had the honor of a seat in this House, <lb/>
that in matters affecting provincial rights, the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should be left to deal with them alone. Why <lb/>
not put that theory into practice on this occasion? <lb/>
To do so would be a much better solution of the <lb/>
difficulty than the hon. gentleman proposes. I can <lb/>
see practically no difference between the motion of <lb/>
the hon. gentleman and that proposed by an hon. <lb/>
French member (Mr. Beausoleil) a few evenings <lb/>
before. They are both in the same direction, and <lb/>
are attended with the difficulty that they post<lb break="no"/>pone the settlement of this vexed and difficult <lb/>
question to the future, and merely tide over <lb/>
the present. One hon. member said that the <lb/>
reason we ought not to touch this question at <lb/>
present, and allow the French language to be spoken <lb/>
in that country, was because the Act has been so <lb/>
long in existence. For thirteen years it has been <lb/>
on the Statute-book, and previous to that time he <lb/>
said the French language was also spoken there; <lb/>
and if for no other reason, the right of priority <lb/>
would compel us to decide that the French language <lb/>
should be the language spoken in that country. <lb/>
The hon. member for Toronto (Mr. Denison) <lb/>
answered that argument ably, when he said if it was <lb/>
the right of priority which should determine the <lb/>
question, the Cree language ought to be made the <lb/>
official language instead of the French, because the <lb/>
Cree was spoken in those Territories by the <lb/>
aborigines long before there was any Eng<lb break="no"/>lish spoken there. Another hon. gentleman <lb/>
said that a large number of the French who <lb/>
were there almost compelled us to do justice <lb/>
to them by retaining this clause in the Act; but <lb/>
in Ontario to-day we have ten times the number <lb/>
of French Canadians that there are in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, and no one contends that in the Legislative <lb/>
Hall of Ontario it would be wise or needful in <lb/>
the interests of that Province that the two <lb/>
languages should be official. If the reasoning of <lb/>
the hon. member for Bothwell were correct, that <lb/>
because French Canadians were there, and the <lb/>
right to use the dual language was given them a <lb/>
few years ago, we should continue it to them now, <lb/>
with much greater force should the French <lb/>
Canadians of Ontario ask us to make the dual <lb/>
language official in that Province. A great many <lb/>
strictures have been passed upon the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe for having brought this question <lb/>
before the House. Stripping the question of all <lb/>
its surroundings, I do not think that the motion <lb/>
he has proposed or the amendment to that clause <lb/>
of the law, is in itself very extraordinary; but, <lb/>
unfortunately, when we came to consider <lb/>
the proposition, we found that in the pre<lb break="no"/>amble to his Bill the hon. gentleman fell into <lb/>
the mistake of imitatin the Bill passed by Mr. <lb/>
Mercier in Quebec, and mixed up in the other <lb/>
questions, with the one at issue, that are not rele<lb break="no"/>vant to it. But, if we strike out all that irrelevant <lb/>
matter, the preamble is not so objectionable, and I <lb/>
do not think we would be doing great injustice if <lb/>

<pb n="761" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00761.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">761</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">762</fw>

we accepted the Bill as so amended. It is most un<lb break="no"/>fortunate, that at this time, when there is a disturb<lb break="no"/>ing element abroad in the land, men with perhaps <lb/>
more enthusiasm than judgment, are creating a <lb/>
great deal of excitement both in Quebec and <lb/>
Ontario, and in the North-West Teritories; and <lb/>
in view of this fact we should deal with this <lb/>
question very carefully, and extend as generously <lb/>
as we can all the concessions we can reason<lb break="no"/>ably extend to our French compatriots. But, <lb/>
While doing that, we would be doing an injus<lb break="no"/>tice to ourselves if we were to allow any encroach<lb break="no"/>ments that, in our honest convictions, we believed <lb/>
would be contrary to the interests of the state or <lb/>
of our national life. I believe there is a disposition <lb/>
on the part of eminent men on both sides of this <lb/>
chamber, to, as far as possible, come together in <lb/>
a great emergency, and support the state rather <lb/>
then support their national sentiment. I think it <lb/>
is wise and well that they should do so, and we <lb/>
would fall far short of our duty if we were unable   <lb/>
to join with them, in this important crisis of our   <lb/>
history, in trying to stamp out anything which <lb/>
partook rather of sentiment than of statesmanship, <lb/>
of race rather than of national rights. We <lb/>
should stand by one another, and endeavor to re<lb break="no"/>concile those conflicting elements we so often find <lb/>
in this country of ours. I am far from believing <lb/>
that we have not a bright future before us. I do <lb/>
not believe that, because we may speak the French <lb/>
or the German or the Gaelic language, that is anything <lb/>
against the glorious future instore forour state; but <lb/>
we must endeavor to reconcile those conflicting ele<lb break="no"/>ments and to bring together the people who are in a <lb/>
manner under our charge, and who are looking to <lb/>
us for advice in important times like this. I think <lb/>
we would meet the duty which devolves upon us <lb/>
by accepting the amendment of the hon. member <lb/>
for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), because, in that way <lb/>
we would be doing no great injustice to anyone; <lb/>
we would be following the lines of provincial <lb/>
rights; we would be giving into the hands of the <lb/>
people the right of saying what they should have <lb/>
now and what they should have in the future. At <lb/>
the same time, we would do our duty to the state; <lb/>
we would allay for the time one of those exciting <lb/>
questions which are becoming more and more <lb/>
annoying every day, and we would be doing our <lb/>
duty as members of this great country, which must <lb/>
in time become one of the most important in the <lb/>
history of the world. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:WRIG3">Mr. WRIGHT</persName>. As a member who, for twenty-<lb break="yes"/>five years, has represented in this House a county <lb/>
in the Province of Quebec, a county in which a <lb/>
large majority are French Canadians, and as a <lb/>
Quebec member, I cannot allow this debate to pass <lb/>
without saying a few words. Sir, I regret exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly that the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy) should have brought this matter under <lb/>
the notice of the House. It appears to me to be <lb/>
one of the most disturbing questions which could <lb/>
have been brought under our consideration. Pro<lb break="no"/>vidence has placed us here in this magnificent <lb/>
northern home land of ours, men of divers races <lb/>
and creeds and languages, but I think animated by <lb/>
a common patriotic purpose, to develop our re<lb break="no"/>sources to the utmost, to live in peace and harmony <lb/>
together in the enjoyment of equal rights and pri<lb break="no"/>vileges. I think, take it for all in all, we have the <lb/>
best and freest country that ever the sun shone on. <lb/>

<cb/>

I think we have every material element of wealth <lb/>
within our midst, that we have a hardy, a bold, an <lb/>
energetic and a kindly population, and that we have <lb/>
the best country that can be found in the world. <lb/>
We have a form of government which is free to the <lb/>
fullest extent, and every man has the absolute <lb/>
right of freedom of conscience and worship. All <lb/>
that is wanted to build up this national edifice is a <lb/>
little common sense—a little sense of justice, a little <lb/>
of that spirit of compromise, which is of the very es<lb break="no"/>sence of the British system, and then the work may <lb/>
be said to be accomplished. I must confess that I <lb/>
have been very much astonished at the course which <lb/>
has been taken by the hon. member who introduced <lb/>
this Bill, and his friends who advocate Imperial <lb/>
Federation. They profess to endeavor to bring <lb/>
about the union of the British Empire; they pro<lb break="no"/>fess to unite instead of dividing us, but what does <lb/>
this course of action mean? Instead of peace and <lb/>
harmony, they bring us the faggot and the sword; <lb/>
instead of that spirit of compromise, which, as I <lb/>
said, is of the essence of the British system, and <lb/>
gives it its magnificent power throughout the world, <lb/>
they bring us dissension and disorder. To my <lb/>
mind, their course—I regret to say it, for per<lb break="no"/>sonally I have the greatest respect for those hon. <lb/>
gentlemen—leads me, though I cannot believe <lb/>
that they are animated by treasonable purposes, <lb/>
to think that they are not animatedly patri<lb break="no"/>otic purposes, and I regret exceedingly that <lb/>
they have chosen to adopt this course, which <lb/>
cannot but be disastrous to the interests of our <lb/>
common country. But I believe in the common <lb/>
sense of the great body of the people, and while, <lb/>
if certain fanatics in the Province of Quebec, and <lb/>
certain fanatics in the Province of Ontario had <lb/>
their way, the result would be most disastrous, <lb/>
still I have faith in the patriotism of the great <lb/>
body of that people, and I believe that when this <lb/>
storm has swept over us, the result will be beneficial <lb/>
and not disastrous. To my mind, the hon. member <lb/>
for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) has received at the hands <lb/>
of the three gentlemen who attacked his position <lb/>
with such singular force and power a summary and <lb/>
condign punishment. It appeared to me that his <lb/>
punishment was almost too great for him to bear. <lb/>
He bore it, however, with a bravery and a stoicism <lb/>
which was worthy of every admiration. Not the <lb/>
Jesuit Breboeuf at the stake, tortured to death by <lb/>
savages, not Rowland Taylor in the fires of Smith<lb break="no"/>field, passed the ordeal more gallantly than did the <lb/>
hon. gentleman. Sir, in a great story told by a great <lb/>
master of French literature, he gives us a description <lb/>
of the torture. In the "Notre Dame" of Victor <lb/>
Hugo, he gives us a graphic account of the death <lb/>
of the Gitana Esmeralda who was executed by the <lb/>
cruel code of a barbarous age. He tells us how her <lb/>
limbs were dislocated, her arms and legs were <lb/>
broken, and how then she was pressed to death dying <lb/>
with the name of her lover and her Saviour on her <lb/>
lips. When the member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), <lb/>
who was the first executioner, proceeded to perform <lb/>
this dreadful task, when he proceeded to inflict that <lb/>
punishment, the result could not be doubtful. When <lb/>
Eos or the Dawn comes in contact with Chaos <lb/>
or the Dark, no one can doubt what the result <lb/>
will be. In the great book of Sir Walter Scott, <lb/>
when Wilfrid of Ivanhoe charges down upon the <lb/>
Templar, who can doubt the result? And so, when <lb/>
the eagle from the west swooped from his eyrie <lb/>
upon the serpent of Simeoe—I use the term only in <lb/>

<pb n="763" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00763.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">763</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">764</fw> 

a parliamentary sense—who could doubt what the <lb/>
result must be? Sir, he destroyed him with dithy<lb break="no"/>rambics. His punishment was something almost <lb/>
too dreadful for him to bear. Mr. Davin poured out <lb/>
upon him all the vials of wrath of the English lang<lb break="no"/>uage. He pointed out the extraordinary temerity of <lb/>
 a lawyer, and a <hi rendition="simple:italic">nisi prius</hi> lawyer at that, engaging <lb/>
in this attempt. Why, it was the very apotheosis <lb/>
of six-and-eight-pence. In the older civilisation, <lb/>
if the firm of Quirk, Gammon &amp; Snap had attempt<lb break="no"/>ed to work a revolution, they would have been <lb/>
driven out of every European country. This is <lb/>
the man who is attempting to destroy a magni<lb break="no"/>ficent language and literature and to divert the <lb/>
course of an empire. Sir, he pointed out too, <lb/>
indirectly, that all the great traitors were not <lb/>
lawyers. He detested every deserter from his <lb/>
party. Someone had said that a gentleman never <lb/>
changed either his religion or his politics. He <lb/>
could not go so far, but he could not forget that, at <lb/>
the famous "Siege of Corinth," the "First to fire <lb/>
the shot and wield the blade, was Alp the Adrian <lb/>
renegade." He was in religion a Low Church <lb/>
radical; but in almost all other matters he was in<lb break="no"/>clined to be High. Some concessions must be <lb/>
made to the sentiments of a democratic country <lb/>
like this. A sot must be occasionally thrown to <lb/>
the Cerberus. It was difficult to maintain the dis<lb break="no"/>tinctions of caste. In "Guy Livingston," the old <lb/>
Irish Colonel was unwilling even to die with an <lb/>
attorney; in this country it is still more difficult <lb/>
to live with them. They had an unpleasant fashion <lb/>
of interfering with the private affairs of a gentle<lb break="no"/>man—which, to say the least, was inconvenient. <lb/>
Lucifer, Catiline, Iscariot, the Constable of Bour<lb break="no"/>bon, Benedict Arnold and their congeners might <lb/>
have been indiscreet; but, however, they had <lb/>
never been indentured. In the older civilisations, <lb/>
in order to float a company, you must have the <lb/>
name of a lord in the prospectus. It was one of the <lb/>
prerogatives of those who charged with the con<lb break="no"/>queror at Senlac. There was a great English <lb/>
statesman, who if his career had not been cut <lb/>
short, by circumstances over which he had no <lb/>
control, would have solved this difficult problem. <lb/>
He understood the peculiar genius of the Anglo-<lb break="yes"/>Saxon race; he combined the practical with the <lb/>
poetical; the sensualistic with the idealistic philo<lb break="no"/>sophy. When John Locke will have been forgotten, <lb/>
when "Paradise Lost" will have paled before the <lb/>
lustre of Ens, or the Dawn, when Shakespeare will <lb/>
have been relegated to obscurity then the name of <lb/>
the lamented John Cade will be held in veneration <lb/>
and honor, as one who loved his fellowmen and un<lb break="no"/>derstood the genius of his people; the object of his <lb/>
life was to increase the pleasures of his people, by <lb/>
adding to the size of the drinking pots, by increas<lb break="no"/>ing their number of hoops thereon, and to complete <lb/>
their happiness by hanging all the lawyers. If that <lb/>
system had been carried out, if that project had <lb/>
been realised, what a start would have been made <lb/>
in the direction of the millennial period! Then, Sir, <lb/>
the Vice-Chancellor took up the parable. It was said <lb/>
of Lord Bacon that he wrote of exhaustive science, <lb/>
like a Lord Chancellor; it may be said of the Vice-<lb break="yes"/>Chancellor that he attacked the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe, with singular force and power. He went <lb/>
back to past ages; he made an exhaustive review <lb/>
of the Egyptian, Assyrian and ancient civilisations. <lb/>
Then the hon. member for Bothwell deluged him <lb/>

<cb/>

with authorities, the result was the complete dis<lb break="no"/>comfiture of the unhappy gentleman. The hon. <lb/>
member for West Assiniboia destroyed him as the <lb/>
Parthian horse destroyed the legions of Crassus. <lb/>
The member for York charged him as the Greek <lb/>
phalanx did the Persians at Arbela. While, like <lb/>
the Roman legion, the hon. member for Both<lb break="no"/>well, destroyed his opponent. And so the doom <lb/>
 was acaccomplished and <hi rendition="simple:italic">peni forte et dure</hi> was <lb/>
inflicted upon the unhappy member for Simcoe. <lb/>
I regret, for one, and I am sure this House <lb/>
will regret, that such a course has been taken <lb/>
by an hon. gentleman for whom we all have <lb/>
so high an esteem. For my part I have been <lb/>
twenty-five years in this House, and, in my <lb/>
capacity as a soldier in the ranks, have done <lb/>
my best to build up this nation, and to keep <lb/>
together the various elements of our system of Con<lb break="no"/>federation. Our difficulties have been very great, <lb/>
but now, after the edifice has been completed, after <lb/>
this splendid structure has been erected, I, for one, <lb/>
do not wish to live to see it destroyed, and if this <lb/>
motion of the hon. gentleman had carried, I state <lb/>
my honest conviction to this House when I say <lb/>
that I believe it would be followed by disastrous <lb/>
results. If we were, by this insidious attempt, to <lb/>
succeed in destroying the French language in the <lb/>
North-West, and then carry the policy still <lb/>
farther, as is the evident intention, to the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of which I have the honor to be an inhabi<lb break="no"/>tant, I believe that the system of Confederation <lb/>
would be destroyed. Sir, contact has brought <lb/>
us into sympathy. We have constructed a magni<lb break="no"/>ficent system of railways, we have become acquaint<lb break="no"/>ed with the Maritime Provinces and the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, and we have spanned this land from ocean <lb/>
to ocean, and from sea to sea. The people of this <lb/>
Dominion like each other. For my part, I have <lb/>
always had a profound and supreme admiration <lb/>
for the toilers of the sea in Nova Scotia and New <lb/>
Brunswick. I have always liked the people of <lb/>
British Columbia. I have even admired the splen<lb break="no"/>did people of Ontario. We have always held them in <lb/>
our heart of hearts. And so with the men that come <lb/>
from that grand prairie Province, the wheat-field <lb/>
of the world, we hold them in special regard on <lb/>
account of their ability, their energy, their enter<lb break="no"/>prise, and I do not wish to see the separation of <lb/>
those Provinces which send us such men. But, <lb/>
Sir, with all that, there is one place which I <lb/>
hold still dearer, it is my native Province, the <lb/>
Province of Quebec. Sir, that Province contains <lb/>
divers races. We have there the Englishman, the <lb/>
Irishman, the Scotchman, coming from bold and <lb/>
hardy races, who are able to hold their own against <lb/>
all comers. We have also the French Canadian <lb/>
people, and I who know them well, who was born <lb/>
in their midst, who have lived among them have <lb/>
learned to respect their zeal for their ancient faith, <lb/>
their kindly courtesy, and the chivalrous gallantry <lb/>
which they inherit from their Norman and Breton <lb/>
ancestors. I, for one, would be the first to protest <lb/>
against any interference with, or any outrage <lb/>
upon, the rights and privileges of my native <lb/>
Province. Sir, I do not believe that this House <lb/>
or this country would tolerate any such a thing. <lb/>
If we could eliminate the French Ianguage, would <lb/>
we do so? I ask every member of this House to <lb/>
answer this question honestly in his own mind. <lb/>
If we could eliminate the French Canadians, <lb/>
whom we know so well for their kindly <lb/>

<fw type="num">765</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">766</fw>

courtesy, for their generous hearts, for <lb/>
their marked ability, as we have seen those quali<lb break="no"/>ties exemplified in this House, would we do so? <lb/>
would we strike out such an element as this from <lb/>
our population? I do not believe that there is a <lb/>
man throughout the Dominion who would say so. <lb/>
Sir, there can be no doubt that the hon. member <lb/>
for Simcoe has, with strange power, aroused a <lb/>
singular fanaticism in this land. Last summer I <lb/>
visited one of the greatest counties in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario, one of the greatest in the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion, a county of which any Province might well <lb/>
be proud. Sir, it was a land of which it might al<lb break="no"/>most be said that it was literally flowing with milk <lb/>
and honey, with creameries and with cheese fac<lb break="no"/>tories. It was a land of extraordinary fertility, a <lb/>
land of which any man might well boast. The <lb/>
pastures were covered with herds of the choicest <lb/>
cattle; forests alternated with cultivated fields; the <lb/>
sluggish rivers flowed with smooth serenity through <lb/>
rich meadows and fields of waving corn. Its people <lb/>
were bold and brave and manly, whose ancestors <lb/>
had held their country against the invaders; and <lb/>
the sons looked as though they would hold that <lb/>
land as bravely as their fathers had won it. A <lb/>
little graveyard was pointed out to me where the <lb/>
victors and vanquished slept quietly together await<lb break="no"/>ing the judgment day: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p rendition="simple:centre">"These in the robings of glory; <lb/>
Those in the gloom of defeat, <lb/>
Both with the battle blood gory, <lb/>
In the dusk of eternity meet; <lb/>
Under the sod and the dew, <lb/>
Waiting the judgment day, <lb/>
Under the laurel—the blue, <lb/>
Under the willow—the grey." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>It was literally an agricultural paradise, but <lb/>
the trail of the hon. member for Simcoe was over <lb/>
it all. A great anti-Jesuit meeting had been held. <lb/>
There the 188 were denounced in the fiercest <lb/>
terms. I remember reading in the local news<lb break="no"/>papers that one reverend gentleman had called us, <lb/>
I think, a "complicated comminuted community <lb/>
of cowardly cannibals." That was the term applied <lb/>
to the 188. On the other hand, the noble 13, gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen of whom we have always been very proud, <lb/>
were held up in the highest honor and esteem. <lb/>
When I went there the storm had passed over, <lb/>
and I only remained to receive its ground swell. <lb/>
As I have said, the county was a most magnifi<lb break="no"/>cent one, and the people were a generous and <lb/>
brave people. But there was a gloom upon their <lb/>
countenances which struck me with surprise, con<lb break="no"/>sidering that they had such a. beautiful country, <lb/>
that their crops were splendid, that they had every <lb/>
element of material prosperity. They said to me: <lb/>
"What do you think of these Jesuits who have <lb/>
taken possession of the land? You come from the <lb/>
land of Loyola, you come from the land of these <lb/>
Jesuits, you come from this priest-ridden Province <lb/>
of Quebec." I said: "Yes; but it does appear to <lb/>
me that there are other Provinces which are <lb/>
priest-ridden as well as Quebec." "Well," they <lb/>
said, "what is going to become of those <lb/>
oor, miserable, oppressed Protestants of that <lb/>
rovince?" I said: "Yes; we may be op<lb break="no"/>pressed, but as you can see, they do not <lb/>
starve me, at any rate." "With regard to the <lb/>
English inhabitants of that Province, those poor <lb/>
slaves who are hunted by Mercier and his congeners, <lb/>
what about them?" I said: "I think they bear <lb/>
their punishment very patiently, at any rate they <lb/>

<cb/>

get on very well with all their neighbors." Then <lb/>
then they said: "What of the priesthood?" I said: <lb/>
"So far as the priests of the Province of Quebec <lb/>
are concerned, not alone the Catholic priests, but <lb/>
the Presbyterian clergy, the Methodist clergy, and <lb/>
the clergymen of all the denominations, they live in <lb/>
peace and harmony together, they like each other." <lb/>
I said: Father Brown of Chelsea told me the men <lb/>
who first came to assist him when his church was <lb/>
burning were the Orangemen of the district. I <lb/>
saw myself at the funeral of an excellent lady, the <lb/>
wife of the Presbyterian clergyman, the Catholic <lb/>
priest among the friends in the sad procession. <lb/>
Everywhere the same kindly feeling prevailed, and <lb/>
I said that among the priests of my district, some <lb/>
six or seven, there are not finer gentlemen, not <lb/>
better servants of Christ, or better servants of <lb/>
the Man who in the olden times gave us His laws <lb/>
under the palm trees of Judea, than the very <lb/>
Catholic priests of whom I have spoken. I said <lb/>
that if some of these men were animated by the <lb/>
feelings which appeared to animate a few of the <lb/>
clergymen of Ontario, we would have had a very <lb/>
sad time indeed; but they preached the gospel of <lb/>
peace, love, law and order. Under these circum<lb break="no"/>stances, I said, we got on exceedingly well. But, <lb/>
they said: You have a lot of nuns. Yes, I said, we <lb/>
have, and most excellent and worthy ladies they are, <lb/>
ladies who by their truly Christian charity are cal<lb break="no"/>culated to convince one of the reality of the Christian <lb/>
religion. The Rev. Mr. Carson said that when some <lb/>
of his family were dying from diphtheria, that those <lb/>
who first came to his assistance were Catholic <lb/>
nuns, and I said in my own region they attend <lb/>
Protestant and Catholic alike. I said I felt it to be <lb/>
my duty to state this to you, because great misap<lb break="no"/>prehension has arisen with respect to the feelings <lb/>
which prevail among those who reside in the <lb/>
Province of Quebec. When I was seated by the <lb/>
bedside of the dying Father Delliages, he said to <lb/>
me: Every night my dreams carry me back to <lb/>
dear old France, but my heart is with the people <lb/>
of the Gatineau region. So it is with most of the <lb/>
clergy in our midst. They get on admirably with <lb/>
the Protestant clergy there. The Methodist goes <lb/>
about most energetically to promote the interests <lb/>
of the Master; so does the Presbyterian clergyman; <lb/>
and so does the English clergyman, unless, unhap<lb break="no"/>pily, he is too poor to have a horse, and he then walks <lb/>
as did the Apostles of old. Then they proceeded <lb/>
to put me through a course of cross-questioning. <lb/>
They said: Tell us of the night; tell us of the future: <lb/>
what party will it be which will sweep away those <lb/>
rotten old parties, as the leaves are sweept away by <lb/>
the autumn blast? I ventured to say a word on <lb/>
behalf of my friend of the Left Centre. I said: <lb/>
Here was an opportunity for the Left Centre, who <lb/>
is a chief of singular energy and intelligence, but <lb/>
without a party; and here is a splendid party, but <lb/>
without a head: still should the two join together, <lb/>
great results may be anticipated. I told them of <lb/>
his heroic struggles in favor of the Widow Murphy <lb/>
and her cow. I told them that in Sir Peter they <lb/>
had one who was always foremost in works of good<lb break="no"/>will; I told them of his marvellous energy, ability <lb/>
and perseverance; I told them of his heroic struggles <lb/>
in favor of the helpless and the poor; I told them <lb/>
that when the widow's wail and the cry of orphan <lb/>
children came from the woods of New Brunswick, <lb/>
that he performed one of the most generous and <lb/>
gallant acts on record; I told them that he was <lb/>

<pb n="767" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00767.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">767</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS] 768</fw> 

always foremost in works of good-will; I told them <lb/>
that to be poor and helpless and miserable was to <lb/>
commend them to his generous nature, and that if <lb/>
he were not ennobled by Downing Street, he was <lb/>
ennobled by right of an earlier creation and the <lb/>
imposition of a mightier Hand. What then they <lb/>
said of the superb old sorcerer who sits securely <lb/>
throned on a thousand wiles in his city of Ottawa? <lb/>
I told them that the "old sorcerer," as they called <lb/>
him, had apparently taken a new lease of life. He <lb/>
was sorcerer, magician and necromancer all in one <lb/>
—like Aaron's rod, his wand had swallowed up <lb/>
those of all the other magicians;—like Prospero, he <lb/>
had waved his wand, and a nation had sprung into <lb/>
 existence;—by his magic power he had bound our <lb/>
Dominion together with a network of iron, and <lb/>
strewed it with cities, "like shells along the sea<lb break="no"/>shore";—he had clothed the dry bones with flesh, <lb/>
and breathed life into the northern part of this <lb/>
continent. Will the magician's wand be broken, <lb/>
his spells reversed, and this gorgeous edifice of <lb/>
Confederation disappear? Will the sorcerer say: <lb/></p>
 <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
 <p rendition="simple:centre">
"Our revels now are ended. These our actors, <lb/>
As I foretold you, were all spirits, and <lb/>
Are melted into air, into thin air; <lb/>
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, <lb/>
The cloud—capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, <lb/>
The solemn temples, the great globe itself, <lb/>
Yea, all which it inherit shall dissolve, <lb/>
And like this unsubstantial pageant faded, <lb/>
Leave not a wreck behind?" <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>But that magician has laid the stones faithfully <lb/>
and well, and the edifice will not fade away. But <lb/>
they said, he was gone over to the scarlet woman <lb/>
who sits on the seven hills. I ventured to say that <lb/>
I was not aware of the state of the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
spiritual harem at the present time, <lb/></p>
 <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
 <p rendition="simple:centre">
"Not age could change, nor custom stale, <lb/>
His infinite variety." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>I thought I knew that at an early period he <lb/>
was captured by Madame Calvin; then that <lb/>
he had certain coquetries with Madame Wes<lb break="no"/>ley; then he had a liaison with a certain <lb/>
beautiful Baptist lady; but I said, perhaps, <lb/>
inasmuch as he had an infinite versatility, <lb/>
the Italian beauty, the scarlet lady, had at <lb/>
last won his heart. But, I said, it is well known <lb/>
that he has had the best of everything in this <lb/>
world, and, if I am not mistaken, he will get the <lb/>
best in the next. They said, what about the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Cabinet? I said they were most admir<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen, who were selected, as I have often <lb/>
said, not only on account of their singular ability <lb/>
and merits, but also because they represented cer<lb break="no"/>tain historical events. I ventured to say that the <lb/>
Minister of Customs represents, or did represent, <lb/>
the battle of the Boyne; the Minister of Inland <lb/>
Revenue was supposed to represent the broken <lb/>
treaty of Limerick; the Minister of Finance repre<lb break="no"/>sented the crystal globules of cold water; while <lb/>
the Minister of Agriculture represented that <lb/>
amber beverage which was dear to our Scandi<lb break="no"/>navian forefathers. And, as regards the old <lb/>
Chieftain himself, we who deal so much in futures, <lb/>
who hold him in our heart of hearts, do not take <lb/>
for him the opprobious term conferred by the <lb/>
savages, of "Old To-morrow," but, lookin to the <lb/>
future, we call him the "Sweet By-an-Bye." <lb/>
Those people were very much agitated by the <lb/>
course adopted by my hon. friend for North Sim<lb break="no"/>coe (Mr. McCarthy). <lb/></p> 


<cb/>

<p>Then they said: "Is there any chance of the <lb/>
Left Centre joining the present administration?" <lb/>
I replied: "I notice certain little passage of sweet<lb break="no"/>ness and light confitures and compliments, and one <lb/>
can never tell what the result might be. We, who <lb/>
are lookers—on in Venice, sometimes thought that <lb/>
it was quite possible that the Third Party might <lb/>
take his place in the ranks of the present govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and we remember that passage in "Mar<lb break="no"/>mion ": <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p rendition="simple:centre">"Let the wild falcon take her fling, <lb/>

<p>And, perhaps, when the hour comes, when the cry <lb/>
goes forth, "the Philistines are upon thee Sam<lb break="no"/>son," when the morning breaks, he will be found <lb/>
fighting in the ranks of the Chieftain, as of yore. <lb/>
At all events, I know that so far as the leader of <lb/>
the Government is concerned his feeling is always <lb/>
in favor of one who is given to a little judicious <lb/>
bolting. My hon. friend to my left will bear testi<lb break="no"/>mony to that, and the horse which bolts, as the <lb/>
House will recollect, is always treated with a little <lb/>
more attention than the steady old hack that never <lb/>
kicks over the traces; and I am aware of the <lb/>
kindly feelings which always animate the right <lb/>
hon. Premier towards the leader of the Left Centre. <lb/>
Not to parody, but to speak with certain reverence <lb/>
I may, refer to a hymn which appears to be sin<lb break="no"/>gularly appropriate, and which always impresses <lb/>
me with its strange power and pathos: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p rendition="simple:centre">"There were ninety and nine that safely lay, in the <lb/>
shelter of the fold, <lb/>
But one was out on the hills away, far of from <lb/>

Away from the tender chieftain's care." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>I left that pleasant country with a feeling that, <lb/>
take it for all in all, the difficulty was not insur<lb break="no"/>mountable. They said to me: If the old parties <lb/>
are swept away, what of the new party which will <lb/>
be formed? I replied: I do not see What they can <lb/>
do unless the anti—Jesuits muster their battalions <lb/>
and move down on Quebec. Before they had <lb/>
reached Montreal they would be met by you, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, and the gallant 65th. I can fancy <lb/>
what the feelings of the old guard would be <lb/>
when they met on the plains before the great com<lb break="no"/>mercial city of the Dominion. I can fancy the <lb/>
scene which was enacted on the plain. Colonel. <lb/>
O'Brien—I beg pardon for using his name—would <lb/>
bow pleasantly to Mr. Speaker, and would say: <lb/>
"Gentlemen of the French guard, fire first," <lb/>
and the Speaker would say: "Gentlemen of the <lb/>
English guard, you fire first;" and then the <lb/>
soldiers would look upon each other, and realis<lb break="no"/>ing they were brothers, march together to the <lb/>
city of Montreal, universally rejoicing and feeling <lb/>
they might have other enemies at some future time <lb/>
to fight against rather than amongst themselves. <lb/>
I beg pardon of the House, Sir, for treating a serious <lb/>
subject with such apparent irreverence. I sit <lb/>
opposite my hon. friend from Simcoe and I notice <lb/>
the equanimity with which he bears his punish<lb break="no"/>ment, and I have no doubt that when the time <lb/>
comes he will hit back with all that strength and <lb/>
power of which we all know he is capable. I <lb/>
would, however, ask that hon. gentleman and those <lb/>
who are with him on this question—some of whom <lb/>
I have ranked as my dearest friends in this House <lb/>
and in the country—to consider their course. We <lb/>
cannot afford to have our Confederation destroyed, <lb/>

and the people of Canada will not permit a few <lb/>
fanatical men in Quebec or Ontario to bring about <lb/>
so undesirable a result. Somebody has stated that <lb/>
the French and the English dislike each other. I <lb/>
deny it. The two races on the contrary like each <lb/>
other, and I know that in my part of the country, <lb/>
we would not part with our French compatriots, <lb/>
even if we could. We all recollect what happened <lb/>
a few years ago, when a great rebellion took place <lb/>
in the North-West. We remember when feel<lb break="no"/>ing ran high throughout the whole length <lb/>
and breadth of the land. Was there any <lb/>
division between the French, English and Irish <lb/>
then? No; not one soldier faltered. Every <lb/>
Canadian, whether English, Irish or French, was <lb/>
ready to go forward to put down the rebellion and <lb/>
to protect the laws. Some histories tell us that <lb/>
at the battle of Marathon a light ran along the <lb/>
Grecian spears when the Greeks saw the enemy, <lb/>
and that at the battle of Salamis a light shone on <lb/>
the masts of the Grecian ships. So it was with the <lb/>
patriotic sentiments which animated our people <lb/>
then. A friend of mine, Major Joshua Wright, <lb/>
who travelled with the 65th Battalion, told me that <lb/>
braver soldiers and more patriotic men could not be <lb/>
found in the world. They vindicated the honor <lb/>
and glory of their country, and so it was with the <lb/>
people of every race throughout that awful time. <lb/>
And is there no word to be said for these few un<lb break="no"/>happy men, these hunters of the plains, who ani<lb break="no"/>mated by their native gallantry and believing they <lb/>
were injured, deceived as they were by an ignorant <lb/>
man who preyed upon their feelings, went down <lb/>
into these rifle pits and faced death as calmly and <lb/>
as bravely as ever men did? Is there not one <lb/>
word for these hunters who were swept away by <lb/>
the bullet and the resistless charge of the Canadian <lb/>
volunteers? Sir, we have the elements of a great <lb/>
country. We have noble, generous and patriotic <lb/>
feelings animating the great body of our people, and <lb/>
there is no need for discontent. At any rate one <lb/>
can see by the votes which have been given in this <lb/>
House what the concensus of opinion of the great <lb/>
majority of the people of Canada is. They are <lb/>
determined that our Confederation shall be built <lb/>
up and shall not be destroyed. Sir, we have one <lb/>
thing on which we must rely. We must hold our <lb/>
faith towards each other. For one, I cannot con<lb break="no"/>sent, under any circumstances, to any step towards <lb/>
the destruction of that magnificent French <lb/>
language and literature. I believe that with me <lb/>
the great body of the people of Canada share that <lb/>
sentiment. We have one way of building up that <lb/>
country and one only way; it is the grand old <lb/>
English system of justice, fair play and equal <lb/>
rights; and, Sir, the angels of light which will build <lb/>
up our country and make us a great nation will be <lb/>
"justice, fair play, love, truth and faith in each <lb/>
other." <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:LAND3">Mr. LANDRY</persName>. I join with a great deal of <lb/>
pleasure in the general expression which has been <lb/>
given this evening to the sentiment that there is <lb/>
great satisfaction in finding that the leaders on <lb/>
both sides of the House believe they can arrive <lb/>
at a settlement of this vexed and difficult question. <lb/>
Inthe meantime I desire the indulgence of the House <lb/>
for a short time to express what I, as an humble <lb/>
member of this House, believe to be the true posi<lb break="no"/>tion on this question. Before proceeding to do so <lb/>
I will call the attention of hon. members of <lb/>

<cb/>

this House to an assertion made the other after<lb break="no"/>noon by the hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. <lb/>
Charlton), when he was urging to this House how <lb/>
well it would be for this Dominion to follow the <lb/>
example of the United States and their mode of <lb/>
dealing with the languages of the people in the <lb/>
different territories they acquire. He told us that <lb/>
in the colonisation of Louisiana the United States <lb/>
of America had simply held out to that country to <lb/>
come with them and partake of the institutions of <lb/>
the United States as they existed, and that they <lb/>
would make no concessions to them as to their <lb/>
language. He told us the same applied to Florida, <lb/>
Texas, and I believe Mexico. I have looked at the <lb/>
constitution of Louisiana and what do I find? If <lb/>
the hon. gentleman is as incorrect in all his other <lb/>
assertions as he is in reference to Louisiana then I <lb/>
say that no credence can be attached to his state<lb break="no"/>ments, for I think that he did not take the trouble <lb/>
of looking up the facts before he made the statement <lb/>
to this House. I find that in the Revised Statutes <lb/>
of Louisiana down to 1856 a constitutional provision <lb/>
of the General Assembly, section 101, says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Secretary ofthe Senate and House of Representa<lb break="no"/>tives shall be conversant with the French an English <lb/>
tongues, and members may address either House in the <lb/>
French or English language." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Now, if I read aright the constitution of our Domi<lb break="no"/>nion, they went farther in Louisiana, in relation <lb/>
to the French language, than we do in the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion; for not only do they give the privilege of <lb/>
using the two languages in Parliament, but they <lb/>
require that the Secretary of the Senate and the <lb/>
Clerk of the House of Representatives should be <lb/>
conversant with both languages. Article 129 of the <lb/>
same constitution says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The constitution and the laws of the State shall be <lb/>
promulgated in the English and French languages." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>And that continues down to 1856. I repeat that <lb/>
if the hon. gentleman is as incorrect in the other <lb/>
statements he made as he is with reference to <lb/>
Louisiana, he did not take the trouble to inform <lb/>
himself. We were told to-day, Sir, by some gentle<lb break="no"/>man who addressed this House, that the true prin<lb break="no"/>ciple is to leave this question to the North-West <lb/>
Territories or to the Council. As an humble member <lb/>
of this House I am willing to make some sacrifice <lb/>
of my opinion in order to join the majority of this <lb/>
House for the purpose of securing peace and pros<lb break="no"/>perity and establishing our unity on a solid basis, <lb/>
but I cannot conceal the fact that my opinion is in<lb/>
an entirely different direction from theirs. I believe <lb/>
we ought, in this Parliament, to retain the power <lb/>
invested in us and deal with this difficult question <lb/>
of education and languages. We have done so <lb/>
in regard to the other Provinces, and why should <lb/>
we not do so in the North-West Territories? <lb/>
The principles laid down by the constitution <lb/>
and laws of this Dominion since 1867 all <lb/>
point in the direction in which I speak, namely, <lb/>
that these difficult, delicate, disquieting questions <lb/>
the Parliament of Canada has retained the power <lb/>
to deal with. I do not believe it would be right to <lb/>
leave the Council of the North-West Territories? <lb/>
question so difficult of solution. If a majority of <lb/>
this Parliament believe that it is not in the interests <lb/>
of the North-West Territories to have the use of <lb/>
both languages, then I say that this Parliament <lb/>
ought to take the responsibility of saying so, and <lb/>
giving those Territories such laws as they think are <lb/>
avorable to the development and welfare of that <lb/>

country. The legislation of this Parliament has <lb/>
not left that question to be dealt with by the <lb/>
other Provinces when there has been any legisla<lb break="no"/>tion on it at all. We find that section 133 of the <lb/>
British North America Act of 1867 reads thus: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Either the English or the French language may be <lb/>
used by any person in the debates of the Houses of the <lb/>
Parliament of Canada and of the Houses of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture of Quebec; and both those languages shall be used <lb/>
in the respective records and journals of those Houses; <lb/>
and either of those languages may be used by any person <lb/>
or in any pleading or recess in or issuing from any court <lb/>
of Canada established under this Act, and in or from all <lb/>
or any of the courts of Quebec." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Now, Sir, if it was important to establish by this <lb/>
Act that the two languages should be used in the <lb/>
Province of Quebec, as well as in the courts of <lb/>
Canada, in the interest of the people of those Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, it is just as important that the Parliament <lb/>
of Canada to-day should decide the question for the <lb/>
North-West Territories. If it were left to the <lb/>
people of the North-West Territories to decide <lb/>
whether it would be in their interest or not to use <lb/>
both languages, what would be the result? The <lb/>
result would be that all the excitement consequent <lb/>
on the decision of a question of this kind would be <lb/>
transferred to the people of those Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA9">Mr. McCARTHY</persName>. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:LAND3">Mr. LANDRY</persName>. And a gentlemen with the <lb/>
ability of my hon. friend might go into the country <lb/>
there and make the speeches he is capable of mak<lb break="no"/>ing on one side, and a gentleman with the ability <lb/>
perhaps of the leader of the Government of the <lb/>
Province of Quebec might go and make speeches on <lb/>
the other side, and we should have in all probability <lb/>
a war of races among the people themselves in their <lb/>
attempts to settle this very disquieting question. <lb/>
The spirit of our laws has not been to leave such <lb/>
question to the settlement of the people either in <lb/>
the Province of Ontario or in the Province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec. It has been to settle them in this Parliament. <lb/>
Then, why leave this question to the people of the <lb/>
North-West Territories? Let us suppose that <lb/>
their decision would be that they do not want the <lb/>
dual languages; then we should be bound to enact <lb/>
laws here in pursuance of that decision, and to <lb/>
carry out the will of the people as expressed by <lb/>
them at the polls, and if the time came, as it must <lb/>
come, when the North-West Territories will be <lb/>
divided into Provinces, should we not be bound by <lb/>
that decision, in framing the constitution of those <lb/>
Provinces, whether there Were three or four or ten <lb/>
—because the territory is very large—to give to <lb/>
each one of those Provinces a constitution such <lb/>
as decided upon by the present population of the <lb/>
North-West? My impression is that we should <lb/>
be bound to act by the decision the people of <lb/>
the North-West should give on this question today, <lb/>
in framing the constitutions of all those future <lb/>
Provinces. If it were then thought in the interest <lb/>
of one Province that it should have the use of <lb/>
the dual languages, and in the interest of another <lb/>
Province that it should not, depending entirely <lb/>
on the number of French people who might be <lb/>
there, I do not think that is the proper course <lb/>
to follow now to leave that decision to the people <lb/>
of the North-West Territories. I say that the <lb/>
right policy is to retain in the hands of this <lb/>
Parliament the power of dealing with this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. When the Provinces come to be formed, <lb/>
we should look to the conditions then existing, <lb/>
to the number of people there, and give them <lb/>

<cb/>

a constitution in accordance with those con<lb break="no"/>ditions and the desire and best interests of the <lb/>
people. The British North America Act not only <lb/>
takes the subject of legislation with regard to <lb/>
languages out of the hands of this Parliament, but <lb/>
also a subject which is of perhaps as much, if not <lb/>
greater importance, namely, the subject of educa<lb break="no"/>tion. We find that section 93 provides: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"In and for each Province the Legislature may exclu<lb break="no"/>sively make laws in relation to education, subject and <lb/>
according tothe following provisions:— <lb/></p> 

<p>"Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any <lb/>
right or privilege with respect to denominational schools <lb/>
which any class of persons have by law in the Province <lb/>
at the Union; <lb/></p> 

<p>"All the powers, privileges and duties at the Union by <lb/>
law conferred and imposed in Upper Canada on the <lb/>
Separate Schools and school trustees of the Queen's <lb/>
Roman Catholic subjects, shall be and the same are <lb/>
hereby extended to the Dissentient Schools of the Queen's <lb/>
Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects in Quebec." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Now, Sir, there was another question considered <lb/>
by the Fathers of Confederation as one of great <lb/>
difficulty, on which the people might divide with <lb/>
a great deal of animosity and feeling, and they took <lb/>
it entirely out of the power of the Provinces and <lb/>
placed it, not even in the hands of this Parliament <lb/>
—because this Act cannot be disturbed by a vote <lb/>
of this House. If it was considered so important <lb/>
with regard to these Provinces, why is it not of <lb/>
equal importance with regard to the North-West <lb/>
Territories? So jealous were the Fathers of Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the rights of the minorities in the <lb/>
Provinces of Ontario and Quebec that they went <lb/>
even a great deal further than I have yet pointed <lb/>
out. We find in section 80 of the same Act, this <lb/>
provision: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Legislative Assembly of Quebec shall be com<lb break="no"/>posed of 65 members, to be elected to represent the 65 <lb/>
electoral divisions or districts of Lower Canada in this <lb/>
Act referred to, subject to alteration thereof by the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of Quebec: Provided, that it shall not be lawful to <lb/>
present to the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, for assent <lb/>
any Bill for altering the limits of any of the electoral div<lb break="no"/>isions or districts mentioned in the second schedule to <lb/>
this Act, unless the second and third readings of such <lb/>
Bill have been passed in the Legislative Assembly with <lb/>
the concurrence of the majority of the members repre<lb break="no"/>senting all those electoral divisions or districts, and the <lb/>
assent shall not be given to such Bill, unless an address <lb/>
has been presented by the Legislative Assembly to the <lb/>
Lieutenant Governor stating that it has been so passed." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>So jealous were the framers of this Act of the <lb/>
rights of the minority, that in the case of some <lb/>
twelve counties in the Province of Quebec which <lb/>
were considered Protestant counties, it was not <lb/>
left even in the hands of the Legislature of that <lb/>
Province to alter the limits of these counties at any <lb/>
time thereafter. And yet to-day it is said that we <lb/>
must relegate to the people of the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories the authority to legislate upon this question <lb/>
which is similiar in fact to the question dealt with <lb/>
so judiciously in the British North America Act. <lb/>
At that time and previous to Confederation there <lb/>
were in what were then called Upper and Lower <lb/>
Canada questions similar to the one now being dis<lb break="no"/>cussed, and these questions were debated with, <lb/>
perhaps, even greater animosity than is the present <lb/>
one, and the differences of opinionthey excited had a <lb/>
great deal to do with bringing about Confederation; <lb/>
and I will take this opportunity of referring to the <lb/>
questions then at issue, not so much for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of recalling the discussions thereon, as for <lb/>
the purpose of i ustrating the position I take, that <lb/>
the questions which are raised to-day are similar <lb/>
to those which created excitement then, and <lb/>

<pb n="773" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00773.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">773</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">774</fw>

should be dealt with in the same manner. In <lb/>
1851, and while the two Canadas were united, I <lb/>
 find in the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> of the 17th July of that <lb/>
year, the following language:— <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Reform party are in power now—they have been so <lb/>
for four years. * * These four years have been palmy <lb/>
days of priestcraft. * <lb/></p> 

<p>"The sectarian grants which should have been swept <lb/>
away, have been increased. * * * When the present <lb/>
 party came into power, the common school system was free <lb/>
rom sectarian elements—but they introduced the wedge <lb/>
which threatens to destroy the whole fabric." <lb/></p>
 </quote>
 <p>
In 1853, two years afterwards, the same agitation <lb/>
was going on, and we find this language used in <lb/>
that same newspapers which was then one of the <lb/>
most, if not the most, influential newspaper then <lb/>
published in Ontario. The article is dated 6th <lb/>
September, 1853, and contains the following <lb/>
language:— <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"When we have freed our schools from Popish control, <lb/>
when Protestants are eligible to office, and when the <lb/>
people are no longer taxed for the support of the Roman <lb/>
Catholic Church * * * it wlll then be time to cry <lb/>
out, should we go further and touch upon the just rights of <lb/>
Romanists, but not till then." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
 <p>In the same year we find in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, the follow<lb break="no"/>ing remarks:— <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
 <p>"The Quebec <hi rendition="simple:italic">Journal</hi> says 'that Mr. Brown gave <lb/>
notice on t e last day of the session, that he would on the <lb/>
first day of the next session introduce a Bill to abolish <lb/>
tithes and compulsory taxes for ecclesiastical purposes <lb/>
in this Provmce. It is a bold step, but it is made <lb/>
necessary by the circumstances of the time. It is desir<lb break="no"/>able that as soon as possible, an issue may be raised <lb/>
upon which to try the great question of Catholic and <lb/>
Protestant, and we could not have a better test than this <lb/>
of Lower Canadian tithes.'" <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>I call attention to this state of things to show that <lb/>
the arguments then used were on a par and almost <lb/>
the same as those now used by the promoter of this <lb/>
Bill and by the hon. member for North Norfolk <lb/>
(Mr. Charlton). One could almost imagine, in <lb/>
listening to the speeches of these hon. gentlemen, <lb/>
that time had retraced its course, and we were <lb/>
back again in the old days when the Hon. George <lb/>
 Brown led the Liberal party and the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> <lb/>
trotted out the Protestant horse. To remedy the <lb/>
state of affairs which then existed and the intensity <lb/>
 of which is shown by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, Confederation was <lb/>
brought about, and these vexed questions were <lb/>
settled by the British North America Act, in the <lb/>
way I have pointed out. As I again repeat it, it was <lb/>
necessary then to put those vexed questions out of <lb/>
the arena of both local and Dominion politics, and <lb/>
it was considered that by the British North <lb/>
America Act they were laid at rest forever. To<lb break="no"/>day, however, a revival of the same discussions <lb/>
will bring about the same results that were brought <lb/>
about then. I would ask who received credit at <lb/>
the hands of the people of this country? Was it <lb/>
those who were engaged in the discussion of this <lb/>
question on the lines laid down by the Toronto <lb/>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, or those who resisted the prejudices that <lb/>
were sought to be excited by the party whose <lb/>
views that organ represented? Those who received <lb/>
credit at the hands of the people were not those <lb/>
who raised the issues such as are being raised to<lb break="no"/>day by the hon. member for North Simcoe and the <lb/>
hon. member for North Norfolk, but they were <lb/>
those who resisted the prejudices and the appeals to <lb/>
passion which were then being exploited. Among <lb/>
those who were thus rewarded was the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who leads this House. We find him in those <lb/>
times of eat disquiet and most violent and bitter <lb/>

<cb/>

discussions always resisting the party of prejudice; <lb/>
we find him, from 1851 down to Confederation, in <lb/>
the councils of his country, a member of the exe<lb break="no"/>cutive council when not a leader of his Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. We have found since Confederation down <lb/>
to the present time that he has been at the head of <lb/>
affairs for seventeen or eighteen years out of the <lb/>
twenty-three which have elapsed since then. This <lb/>
shows that the sound common sense of the people <lb/>
gave credit to him and the others who resisted <lb/>
these appeals to public passion and these appeals <lb/>
of the majority to crush the minority — appeals <lb/>
made on grounds similar to those taken to-day <lb/>
by the promoter of this Bill; and I venture to <lb/>
predict that, perhaps not for six months or a year <lb/>
—because these strong and loud appeals which are <lb/>
being made by gentlemen of the ability of those <lb/>
who are promoting the measure, to the prejudices <lb/>
of the people, must run a certain course—but I say <lb/>
in the long run those who will resist that wave of <lb/>
fanatiscism and the appeals made to prejudice, are <lb/>
the ones who will represent the great body of the <lb/>
electorate just as those who resisted similar appeals <lb/>
in the past have represented them from 1851 down to <lb/>
the present time. I was sorry to hear the leader of <lb/>
the Opposition, in the beginning of his beautiful ad<lb break="no"/>dress this afternoon, try to make political capital <lb/>
out of this question, but history shows that the party <lb/>
who resisted these prejudices in the past and the <lb/>
party which resists them now is after all the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party. To-day, however, different from <lb/>
the past, we must give credit to some mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Liberal party who have joined with us <lb/>
in opposing this fanatical crusade; but the fact re<lb break="no"/>mains unchanged, that, in the past, it was the Con<lb break="no"/>servatives who resisted these influences to a much <lb/>
larger extent than did the Liberal party. From <lb/>
Confederation down to the present, there has been <lb/>
relative peace in this country. And why? <lb/>
Because these disquieting questions were set at rest <lb/>
by the British North America Act, but unfortun<lb break="no"/>ately they were not settled, in so far as the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories are concerned, and, therefore, it is <lb/>
that they are being brought to the front again, and <lb/>
the attack is made on the only vulnerable and assail<lb break="no"/>able part which is left. But I will call the attention <lb/>
of the House to this fact, that the British North <lb/>
America Act of 1871 provides that while we are <lb/>
at liberty to make laws and constitution for the <lb/>
North-West Territories, yet when once those laws <lb/>
are made by this Parliament, those laws have the <lb/>
same force as the British North America Act itself. <lb/>
I will read the section. Section 6 of the British <lb/>
North America Act, chapter 28, reads as follows:— <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Except as provided by the third section of this Act,it <lb/>
shall not be competent for the Parliament of Canada to <lb/>
alter the provisions of the last mentioned Act of the said <lb/>
Parliament in so far as it relates to the Province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, or of an other Act hereafter establishing new <lb/>
Provinces in the said Dominion, subject always to the <lb/>
right of the Legislature of the Province of Manitoba to <lb/>
alter from time to time the provision of any law respect<lb break="no"/>ing the qualification of electors and members of the <lb/>
Legislative Assembly and to make laws respecting elec<lb break="no"/>tions in the said Prevince." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>This is the point I wish to make—that this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment has the power to make laws and a constitution <lb/>
for the North-West Territories and to divide the <lb/>
North-West Territories into Provinces. Down to this <lb/>
time it has not been thought advisable to divide the <lb/>
North-West Territories into Provinces, perhaps <lb/>
because the population has not been sufficiently <lb/>
numerous, but the time will come, and it may not be <lb/>

far distant, when this Parliament will be called upon <lb/>
to exercise that power. This Parliament can wait, <lb/>
and it will be time enough, when it is asked to <lb/>
make a constitution and laws for the different <lb/>
Provinces which may be established there, to con<lb break="no"/>sider the circumstances of the Territories and the <lb/>
Provinces to be established, and to see then whether <lb/>
it is advisable that the two languages should be <lb/>
preserved, or to provide that only one language <lb/>
shall be used. At present, I ask what great harm <lb/>
is the dual language doing to the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories? Let all hon. gentlemen who have taken <lb/>
the other side of this question or have listened to <lb/>
the speeches of the promoter of the Bill, and the <lb/>
other hon. gentlemen made both in and outside of <lb/>
this House, let all those who may have felt excited <lb/>
because it was held out to them that a great wrong <lb/>
and injustice was being done to their fellow country<lb break="no"/>men in this matter, consider this question. The other <lb/>
day my hon. friend from North Bruce (Mr. McNeill) <lb/>
said he was willing to go a long distance to meet the <lb/>
views of his French fellow-citizens, but he was not <lb/>
willing to sacrifice his own flesh and blood. that <lb/>
sacrifice of his own flesh and blood is he asked to <lb/>
make? I ask this House and the people of this <lb/>
country, who have studied this question and who <lb/>
may be somewhat excited in regard to it, what <lb/>
sacrifice of the hon. gentleman's flesh and blood is <lb/>
made by leaving the constitution of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories such as it is, until this Parliament <lb/>
is called upon to divide those Territories into Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and make a constitution for each Province? <lb/>
It simply leaves them in those Territories the <lb/>
liberty, if they desire, to use the two languages. <lb/>
They are not forced to use the French language. <lb/>
The English speaking people there are not obliged <lb/>
by law to learn that language, or to use it in the <lb/>
Legislature or to study it. They may use the <lb/>
English language if they will. There is no com<lb break="no"/>pulsion. Then, what great harm is it to them? <lb/>
And, further, they are not even called upon to pay <lb/>
for the translation of the public documents into <lb/>
the French language. Then, where are they in<lb break="no"/>jured, where are their rights and privileges <lb/>
interfered with, because the law says that those <lb/>
who desire to do so may use.the French language <lb/>
in the North-West Council, or that their public <lb/>
records shall be printed in both languages? Does <lb/>
that do any harm to them, or take away from <lb/>
them any right? If this matter is looked at calmly <lb/>
and in a proper spirit, it will be seen that this pro<lb break="no"/>vision does no harm to anyone, takes away no <lb/>
privilege, imposes no hardship, and does not make <lb/>
the English speaking population do what they do <lb/>
not wish to do. If it should have the effect of dif<lb break="no"/>fusing more knowledge amongst some part of the <lb/>
population of the North-West Territories, would it <lb/>
not be of some benefit to them to have these docu<lb break="no"/>ments printed in the French language. I repeat— <lb/>
and this is a point which I strongly feel—that this <lb/>
time is inopportune; that this discussion should <lb/>
not have been raised either in the country or in the <lb/>
House on the question, because the time has not <lb/>
arrived when Parliament is called upon to frame a <lb/>
constitution for the North-West Territories or for <lb/>
any Provinces which may be created there. If the <lb/>
leaders on both sides were to come together and <lb/>
adopt some common basis of amendment or motion <lb/>
which, although, perhaps, it might not be in <lb/>
entire accord with my views, would restore <lb/>
peace and accord in the Dominion, I do <lb/>
 
<cb/>

not say that I would not vote for such an <lb/>
amendment, even at the sacrifice of my views, <lb/>
but at present my views are that we should not <lb/>
interfere at all in the matter, and that we should <lb/>
not do so until the time is opportune, and we are <lb/>
called upon to legislate for those Provinces. For <lb/>
a few moments, I desire to reply to some of the <lb/>
assumptions which are to be deduced from the <lb/>
speeches of the hon. gentlemen from North Nor<lb break="no"/>folk (Mr. Charlton), and North Simcoe (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy). These hon. gentlemen are kind enough <lb/>
to say that they entertain no hatred to the French <lb/>
people of this Dominion, they are kind enough to <lb/>
say that they have even a great liking for the <lb/>
French people of this Dominion, they are kind <lb/>
enough to say that they wish them no harm; but <lb/>
I ask any unprejudiced man who has followed the <lb/>
speeches which have been made in this House, or <lb/>
who has read the speeches which have been made <lb/>
on the public hustings in the Province of Ontario, <lb/>
and one in the North-West, if he can arrive at any <lb/>
other conclusion than that these hon. gentlemen <lb/>
declare that at present the French people of this <lb/>
Dominion are not desirable subjects in this coun<lb break="no"/>try? It may be said that is a strained conclusion <lb/>
on my part. I do not think it is. If it is neces<lb break="no"/>sary, in their opinion, to have the French popula<lb break="no"/>tion—I will not say annihilated—but gradually <lb/>
made other than they are to-day, that must <lb/>
be their opinion. If they are desirable sub<lb break="no"/>jects, why should they not be left as they <lb/>
are, and why should any attempt be made either <lb/>
by legislation or by speeches to change them from <lb/>
what they are? They are blamed by these hon. <lb/>
gentlemen because they cannot be delighted by the <lb/>
same literature which delights these hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, because they are not delighted by the same <lb/>
pages of history which delighted these hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, because they are not moved by the same <lb/>
noble aspirations which move these hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men in their actions. No other deduction can be <lb/>
drawn from that than the deduction which I have <lb/>
stated. If you take the facts as they exist, what <lb/>
do you find? We, the French people of this Do<lb break="no"/>minion, are accused by these hon. gentlemen—not <lb/>
by the majority of the English speaking people, but <lb/>
I believe by a small minority, as I am sure it <lb/>
would be found if it were tested, but by a suffici<lb break="no"/>ently large number to create disquietude and some <lb/>
amount of excitement—of combining together as a <lb/>
nationality or people in order to obtain that which <lb/>
we have no right to obtain. That has been ad<lb break="no"/>vanced upon the public hustings, and, in effect, on <lb/>
the floor of this House. The records show an en<lb break="no"/>tirely different state of things. These hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men have not brought forward any proof in this <lb/>
House or in the country to justify that state<lb break="no"/>ment. I would ask on what particular question, <lb/>
since 1867, have the French people united <lb/>
on a matter of this kind? They have not <lb/>
united in any vote in this House or in any <lb/>
election in this Dominion. Look at the last general <lb/>
elections for the Dominion. There are some 45,000 <lb/>
French people in Nova Scotia, and there is not one <lb/>
representative of that nationality from that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince in this House. Is that any evidence of their <lb/>
uniting in order to get influence and power to use <lb/>
it to the detriment of the English speaking people <lb/>
of this country? In Prince Edward Island, the <lb/>
population is not so large as in Nova Scotia. I <lb/>
think the population is about 109,000 or 110,000, <lb/>

<pb n="777" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00777.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">777</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">778</fw>

and there are about 10,000 or 11,000 French <lb/>
there. It is true that they send a worthy represen<lb break="no"/>tative of that nationality here, but have you found <lb/>
him advocating anything but what he believed to <lb/>
be in the true interests of the people of this Dom<lb break="no"/>inion any more than you have found his English <lb/>
speaking colleagues? In New Brunswick, there <lb/>
are 56,000 French people, but, where they could <lb/>
send three representatives of that nationality to <lb/>
represent three counties there, what do you find? <lb/>
Your humble servant is the only representative of <lb/>
the French race from the Province of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. Does that show that the promoter of the <lb/>
Bill (Mr. McCarthy) and his friend from North <lb/>
Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) were right in trying to im<lb break="no"/>press upon the people of Ontario that the object of <lb/>
the French people of this Dominion is to dom<lb break="no"/>inate and to combine together in order to get a <lb/>
dominant influence and use it to the detriment of <lb/>
English speaking people and to their own advantage? <lb/>
I say, when you look at the three Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in the elections I have mentioned, we do <lb/>
not see any such desire to form a combination; <lb/>
they have not acted in the spirit which is attri<lb break="no"/>buted to them. Then let us go a little further <lb/>
and look at the Province of Quebec in the last <lb/>
election, and what do we see? The facts show us <lb/>
that, instead of combining, the people divided. In <lb/>
that large Province, so exclusively French, if I <lb/>
may say so—although there are a large number of <lb/>
English speaking people—if the French Canadians <lb/>
had been actuated by the motives attributed to <lb/>
them by the hon. gentlemen, we would not have <lb/>
seen the result which actually took place. If my <lb/>
memory serves me well, I think that 26 French <lb/>
speaking members were returned from that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince to support the Opposition in this House, and <lb/>
25 were returned to support the Government. <lb/>
Does that look as if there was no division among <lb/>
the French people? Does that look as if there <lb/>
was unanimity of feeling of a hostile character <lb/>
against the English people? Does that look as if <lb/>
they were isolating themselves from the rest of the <lb/>
community, and working in harmonyfor the purpose <lb/>
of obtaining things prejudicial to the English peo<lb break="no"/>ple and advantageous to themselves? The facts do <lb/>
not show that they were actuated by any such spirit; <lb/>
on the contrary, they were divided nearly half and <lb/>
half between the two great parties of this Domi<lb break="no"/>nion, and, Sir, have you observed in their votes in <lb/>
this House that feeling which is spoken of? I say <lb/>
you cannot point to a single vote upon the records <lb/>
of this House since 1867 that supports the as<lb break="no"/>sertion made by my hon. friend. If there ever <lb/>
was a question upon which the people of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec and the French speaking people <lb/>
of this Dominion could be united by national feel<lb break="no"/>ings, and, if you will, national prejudices, it was <lb/>
the Riel question, that came up in 1886. And <lb/>
what was the result of that vote? Speaking from <lb/>
memory again, I think there were twenty-four <lb/>
French members voting one way, and twenty-<lb break="yes"/>seven voting the other way. Does that show that <lb/>
there was a combination of the French people for <lb/>
any purpose hostile to the rest of the Dominion? <lb/>
Sir, you will appeal in vain to the records of any <lb/>
of the elections held in the Dominion of Canada <lb/>
since 1867, to find any proof whatever of the asser<lb break="no"/>tions made by my hon. friend who is pro<lb break="no"/>moting this Bill in this House, and who tried to <lb/>
promote the excitement that has been raised dur<lb break="no"/>

<cb/>

ing the last year in the Province of Ontario <lb/>
and in the other Provinces. It is true, the <lb/>
assertions are made, but no evidence is <lb/>
brought forward to prove them. These hon. <lb/>
gentlemen not only accuse us of combining in this <lb/>
House, but in their speeches they assert that we <lb/>
are endeavoring to combine the French people of <lb/>
the country together. I say those gentlemen do <lb/>
not study the effects of their speech, they do not <lb/>
consider the influence of the appeals that they <lb/>
make to their own people. They say it is wrong <lb/>
to have these combinations, it is wrong for the <lb/>
people of one race to combine against another, but <lb/>
if they would carefully study the effect of their <lb/>
own speeches, they will see that they are infinitely <lb/>
more calculated to bring together a certain portion <lb/>
of the people belonging to the majority in Canada <lb/>
in opposition to the French people. We need not <lb/>
go very far to find an example of this kind of <lb/>
appeal. I will quote from a speech made by the <lb/>
hon. member for North Norfolk, I think, on the <lb/>
12th July last, in which, speaking to Orangemen, <lb/>
he said among other things: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Set the mark of your mission as an order at a higher <lb/>
point than to keep a particular set of men in ofiice, and <lb/>
when Mr. Bowell and Sir Hector Langevin lie down to<lb break="no"/>gether, study the situation and be wary, for the net result <lb/>
will not be set down to the credit of the Orange Order." <lb/></p>
 </quote>
 <p>
Sir, here is a strong appeal to the people to com<lb break="no"/>bine together in opposition to the French, because <lb/>
he takes the trouble to point out that the Minister <lb/>
of Customs and the Minister of Public Works, if <lb/>
they have sufficiently community of feeling, and <lb/>
sufficient community of interest in this Dominion <lb/>
to work together politically for the interest of <lb/>
our common country, it is a fact which he asks the <lb/>
people to be aware, he tells them that it means <lb/>
evil to them, it means ill to the English people of <lb/>
this Dominion; it is a danger when French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians unite in the Government with English speak<lb break="no"/>ing Canadians. What other deductions can be drawn <lb/>
from his language? What other evil can he mean <lb/>
when he points to the fact of the Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms and the Minister of Public Works being in <lb/>
the same Cabinet? He goes on to say: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The issue is important, our foe is sleepless, resolute <lb/>
and unscrupulous." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Now, what does that mean? If we were to use <lb/>
such language to an assembly of French Canadians <lb/>
and tell them "the issue is important, our foe," <lb/>
the English speaking people," is resolute and un<lb break="no"/>scrupulous," would we not be accused of using <lb/>
language of an inflammatory character, and of try<lb break="no"/>ing to arouse the prejudices of our compatriots; <lb/>
would we not be accused of trying to rally together <lb/>
the people of our nationality for the purpose of <lb/>
resisting the people of another nationality? We <lb/>
would be so accused, I think, and very rightfully. <lb/>
And if these gentlemen say that, do we go too far, <lb/>
if we accuse them of having similar motives, if we <lb/>
say that by their language they are trying to form <lb/>
a. combination of the English speaking people <lb/>
against the French speaking people? Let me say <lb/>
that I do not, myself, approve of everything that <lb/>
I have read as having been said in the Province of <lb/>
Quebec by gentlemen calling themselves Nation<lb break="no"/>alists; I do not myself approve of everything I <lb/>
have seen in some newspapers I have read in that <lb/>
Province, upon the subject of French nationality, <lb/>
when they go so far as to intimate a desire to see <lb/>
upon the banks of the St. Lawrence French na<lb break="no"/>

<fw type="num">779</fw>
<fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">780</fw> 

tionality, as contradistinguished from a British <lb/>
nationality. I do not approve of that; but <lb/>
I would point out to these hon. gentlemen who <lb/>
are promoting this Bill, and to the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Norfolk who sympathises with them, <lb/>
that there is this inference between their speeches <lb/>
and the speeches of those public men I have referred <lb/>
to in the Province of Quebec. Those men who have <lb/>
spoken thus in the Province of Quebec, and those <lb/>
hon. gentlemen Who have spoken on that subject <lb/>
in this House, have made these speeches, so far as <lb/>
I have read them, only in self defence. The pur<lb break="no"/>port of their speeches have been this: If the <lb/>
English people attack us We are prepared to resist <lb/>
them; if these people attack our nationality we <lb/>
are prepared to resist them; if these people attack <lb/>
our language we are prepared to resist them; if <lb/>
these people attack our school system we are pre<lb break="no"/>pared to resist them; if they attack our religion <lb/>
we are prepared to resist them. But they have <lb/>
never gone so far as to say: We must go to Ontario <lb/>
and pluck from the English speaking people the <lb/>
rights and privileges which they enjoy. Their <lb/>
speeches have always, so far as I have seen, been <lb/>
in answer to attacks made upon them by those <lb/>
entitlement speaking in the Province of Ontario. <lb/>
But the speeches of these gentlemen promoting <lb/>
this Bill have not been on the defensive. The <lb/>
hon. member for North Simcoe and his friends, on <lb/>
the contrary, have spoken in an aggressive <lb/>
tone, as aggressive as the preamble of the Bill of <lb/>
my hon. friend is aggressive. It is not necessary <lb/>
that I should quote from the speeches delivered <lb/>
by hon. gentlemen, for they are fresh in the mem<lb break="no"/>ory of the House. It is only necessary, in order <lb/>
to emphasise my view, that I should read from <lb/>
the preamble of the Bill, which is as follows:— <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Whereas it is expedient in the interest of the national <lb/>
comity of the Dominion that there should be community <lb/>
of language among the people of Canada, and that the <lb/>
enactment in "North-West Territories Act" allowing <lb/>
the use of the French language should be expunged there<lb break="no"/>from." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Is this not an attack upon those rights which <lb/>
have been secured to the French people of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, primarily by treaty, and also by <lb/>
the Act of Confederation, and secured in such a way <lb/>
that not even the legislation of this House can in<lb break="no"/>terfere with them? When such an attack is made, <lb/>
and when it is embodied in violent speeches, it is <lb/>
not unnatural that the French members from <lb/>
Quebec should, in reply, say that if an attempt <lb/>
is made to interfere with the French language in <lb/>
the North-West Territories, we will resist it to the <lb/>
utmost of our power. There is not so much <lb/>
fault to be found with the attitude taken by <lb/>
the people there, irrespective of the points to <lb/>
which I have alluded. Some hon. gentlemen did <lb/>
not appear to wish to go so far, and they stated <lb/>
they had no intention of interfering with vested <lb/>
rights. That is not the attitude taken by the hon. <lb/>
member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), who intro<lb break="no"/>duced the Bill. He intends to interfere with vested <lb/>
rights; he intends to secure this entering wedge, <lb/>
and follow it up by attacking the Separate School <lb/>
system and the use of the French language in Que<lb break="no"/>bec, if we have to attach any credence to the <lb/>
speeches delivered by the hon. gentleman outside <lb/>
this House and within its walls. Other members, <lb/>
however, say they do not intend to go so far. The <lb/>
hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) <lb/>
 
<cb/>

will not go so far, but where the French are weak, <lb/>
as in the North-West Territories, he intends to <lb/>
attack them there, and to accomplish the purpose <lb/>
he has in view. But he should remember that an <lb/>
injustice to one is a menace to all. If it is an <lb/>
injustice to 10 or 50 people, it is a menace to any <lb/>
number. Holding those views, I consider it is not <lb/>
expedient to-day to pronounce an opinion upon this <lb/>
question, and I hold that this is an inopportune time <lb/>
to bring it forward, and I am prepared, if no better <lb/>
resolution is submitted, to vote for the sub-amend<lb break="no"/>ment before the House, and vote squarely against <lb/>
the Bill. I do not think I am prepared to vote for <lb/>
the amendment of the hon. member for Assini<lb break="no"/>boia (Mr. Davin), because it is not, to my view, <lb/>
the proper one. We should not revert to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple the power to deal with this subject, but we <lb/>
should keep it in our own hands, and when the <lb/>
proper times comes for legislation, we should, <lb/>
speaking for the whole Dominion, say what we <lb/>
belieVe to be right for the North-West and for the <lb/>
great Provinces to be established there, and we <lb/>
should consider the circumstances, the population, <lb/>
the different nationalities there, and we should <lb/>
legislate in the best interests of all. Believing that <lb/>
to be the proper policy, I am not disposed to vote <lb/>
either for the Bill or for the amendment of the <lb/>
hon. member for Assiniboia. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:WELD2">Mr. WELDON</persName> (Albert). At this hour of the <lb/>
evening and in view of the great length of the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion, I will speak very briefly and follow the <lb/>
most excellent example of moderation and of cour<lb break="no"/>tesy shown to-day by hon. gentlemen who have <lb/>
spoken, and most prominently by the leader of the <lb/>
Opposition. I have waited for four days in the <lb/>
hope that some English-speaking representative of <lb/>
the Provinces by the sea, older in parliamentary <lb/>
experience than I am, who could have spoken with <lb/>
more authority regarding the feeling of the eastern <lb/>
Provinces, would rise and take part in this debate. <lb/>
If such an hon. member addressed this House I <lb/>
would gladly resume my seat in silence. But, per<lb break="no"/>haps, in the course of remarks occupying a few <lb/>
moments, I may be able to contribute some points <lb/>
to this discussion which will enable us to arrive at <lb/>
a mutual understanding. The questions before the <lb/>
House are two: one, which seems to me to be rele<lb break="no"/>vant and a comparatively narrow question; the <lb/>
other, which seems to be irrevelant, is one which <lb/>
has taken a very broad range. In the very few re<lb break="no"/>marks I offer I will sharply distinguish between <lb/>
these two questions; one of which grows out of the <lb/>
enacting clause of the Bill of the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), and the other which grows <lb/>
out of the inconsequential and ill-constructed pre<lb break="no"/>amble of the Bill. The first is with respect to the <lb/>
simple and narrow question as to whether, all things <lb/>
considered, in this year of our Lord 1890, it is <lb/>
wise in this Parliament to strike out section <lb/>
110 of the North-West Territories Act, which <lb/>
was inserted in that Act thirteen years ago. I <lb/>
do not propose to review the reasons given <lb/>
by those who are opposed to the policy of <lb/>
expunging this section. I understood the hon. <lb/>
leader of the Opposition to say that the Bill, coupled <lb/>
with such apreamble, and heralded with such a <lb/>
speech as was delivered by the introducer of the <lb/>
Bill in this House, and still more by speeches out<lb break="no"/>side this House, was one they could not approve; <lb/>
but if that simple Bill had been introduced, without <lb/>

<pb n="781" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1890-02-17_Page_00781.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">781</fw> <fw type="dateline">[FEBRUARY 17, 1890.]</fw> <fw type="num">782</fw> 

the preamble, in a moderate speech by a member <lb/>
from the North-West, he would not have regarded <lb/>
it as one that was very objectionable. It is <lb/>
said that those who favor the preamble of the Bill <lb/>
are endorsing the action of the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), but those who endorse <lb/>
only the Bill itself occupy a different posi<lb break="no"/>tion. It has been said, and it was said by <lb/>
the hon. member for Assiniboia West (Mr. <lb/>
Davin), that it was unjust to the people of <lb/>
the western Provinces to strike out section 110. <lb/>
I come from a Province where, as the member for <lb/>
Kent (Mr. Landry) has said, there are a consi<lb break="no"/>derable number of French-speaking people. We <lb/>
come from a Province which has not the dual lan<lb break="no"/>guage, from a Province where we live on terms <lb/>
of good-will with each other; and no better evid<lb break="no"/>ence of the good-will of the English and French <lb/>
speaking people in that Province can be furnished, <lb/>
than the fact that a great party in that Province, <lb/>
mainly an English-speaking party, some years ago, <lb/>
chose as their leader the hon. member for Kent <lb/>
(Mr. Landry), whom we all respected and knew <lb/>
to be a capable administrator, and he held for some <lb/>
time a. very important portfolio in the Government <lb/>
of that Province. The argument of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for West Durham (Mr. Blake), that the conti<lb break="no"/>nuation of section 110 would have the effect of <lb/>
attracting emigrants from the New England States <lb/>
and leading to emigration westward seems to me <lb/>
to be not well founded on fact. Thirteen years <lb/>
ago this House passed section 110 as a bid for <lb/>
emigrants for the North-West; but that section <lb/>
has not had the effect of drawing emigrants there, <lb/>
and any French Canadians who have emigrated <lb/>
have gone to the factories and farms of the New <lb/>
England States. Many of my French Canadian <lb/>
friends have said to me since this discussion <lb/>
began: Be reasonable and endeavor to understand <lb/>
the present situation; suppose a hundred <lb/>
years ago the French had obtained possession of <lb/>
the northern part of the continent, and you and <lb/>
yours were in the minority, how would you feel <lb/>
about this question? I said: I would hope that <lb/>
the French Government would deal as generously <lb/>
as the English have been disposed to deal with the <lb/>
French people in the Provinces; but I would say <lb/>
frankly that in the matter of carving out new Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, however much I might desire the English <lb/>
language to be retained, I must accept the facts of <lb/>
history and could not hope for the perpetuation of <lb/>
my own language as an official language. I have <lb/>
only this to say in favor of repealing section <lb/>
110, and it is this: that I agree with ever argu<lb break="no"/>ment made in its favor. I thought a powerful <lb/>
ar ument was made by the hon. member for <lb/>
North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) in the earlier part of <lb/>
his speech, in which he appeared to devote close <lb/>
attention to the precise question before the House; <lb/>
and I concur in the opinion that it is desirable, <lb/>
other things being equal, without breaking faith, <lb/>
to have but one language, that Government is easier <lb/>
and that friction is less among a people in a <lb/>
country which has a homogeneous people. This <lb/>
remark is made by one whose duty all his life has <lb/>
been to study history, and I venture to say there is <lb/>
not in Europe a single example of a nation, with two <lb/>
rival races jealousy preserving their own nation<lb break="no"/>ality, and nearly equal in strength, whose power is <lb/>
at all commensurate with her resources and popula<lb break="no"/>tion as compared with a homogeneous nation. I will <lb/>

<cb/>

not follow that out in detail, because it has been <lb/>
discusssed fully by gentlemen on both sides of the <lb/>
House. In Switzerland, where there are three <lb/>
languages, the people live in good-will; but the <lb/>
force that holds Switzerland together is the iron <lb/>
band of pressure from the outside. If we had <lb/>
on the north and west of us, as we have on the <lb/>
south of us, jealous nations whom we felt were <lb/>
quite willing to eat us up at an hour's notice, I <lb/>
think we would have better feelings of brotherly <lb/>
love than we have now. The case of Austro-Hun<lb break="no"/>gary was different from that of Switzerland, but I <lb/>
have not time to enter at any great length into <lb/>
the question of why Austro-Hungary, since that <lb/>
great duel on the field of Sadowa, has not an in<lb break="no"/>fluence consistent with her large population, her <lb/>
fertile soil, and her great resources. Germany on <lb/>
the north, with far less population, is, beyond all <lb/>
question, themore powerfulnation; that is, the nation <lb/>
with a comparatively homogeneous race is stronger <lb/>
than the other, although nominally the smaller. <lb/>
My hon. friend from Noth Bruce (Mr. McNeill) <lb/>
made a very pertinent argument in the case of <lb/>
England, when he pointed out that when England <lb/>
was occupied by two rival races, the Saxons and <lb/>
the Normans, she made very little progress; but <lb/>
when these nations were fused together she went <lb/>
forward by leaps and bounds. The most pertinent <lb/>
of all the arguments advanced, to my thinking, is <lb/>
the argument based on facts with which we are all <lb/>
acquainted. We know something of the course of <lb/>
events in the great Republic to the south. Her <lb/>
success is something phenomenal in the history of <lb/>
nations; and what is the policy which that great, <lb/>
progressive and sensible people have pursued in <lb/>
this matter of founding a new colony? Have they <lb/>
not stood by the one language? Have they not <lb/>
stood by the public schools? Have they not stood <lb/>
by the common law of England, those just and <lb/>
clement laws, those institutions of government <lb/>
which guarantee personal liberty? Have they not <lb/>
held those out to the foreign nations, saying: <lb/>
"Come and share these laws with us, enjoy this <lb/>
liberty with us." And have not their most enlight<lb break="no"/>ened men, ever since they planted this policy in the <lb/>
land, discovered that these laws were a mighty force <lb/>
of assimilation and tended to make a people com<lb break="no"/>pact? To secure this homogeneity, it seems to me <lb/>
that, in this new commonwealth, it will be <lb/>
unwise to allure immigrants from France, from <lb/>
Denmark, from Germany, from Sweden, and <lb/>
from other foreign countries, by the hope that <lb/>
when they come into this Dominion, in our <lb/>
courts of justice, in our Legislatures, they will <lb/>
be entitled to the free use of their own language. <lb/>
I think, if we do so, we are holding out to <lb/>
them an illusive hope. I think it better to say <lb/>
to the Danes, Germans, Prussians, French and <lb/>
others who come here: we welcome you all; there <lb/>
are our fertile lands, occupy them; and there are <lb/>
our mighty English laws guarding your lives and <lb/>
property. There are schools in which your child<lb break="no"/>ren may be taught; there are representative insti<lb break="no"/>tutions of Government. If you wish, you can have <lb/>
equal rights with all of us; and then we may hope <lb/>
that in one or two generations the great difficulty of <lb/>
governing these western Provinces will be removed, <lb/>
and they will be united into one. In my judg<lb break="no"/>ment, there is no single force within the range of <lb/>
Government——I am not speaking of the almost <lb/>
unlimited force of religion, which is beyond the <lb/>

range of Government in our happy country—there <lb/>
is no force so subtle, so insidious, so powerful <lb/>
to effect this unity of races as the force of language. <lb/>
It is like the primary forces of nature. It makes <lb/>
a people like each other who did not like each <lb/>
other before. I agree with so many French <lb/>
members that it is a pity we cannot all speak the <lb/>
French language. If we could I am sure we would <lb/>
like them better, and they would like us better, <lb/>
and if I were a younger man and could learn as <lb/>
fast as I could in my earlier days, I would learn to <lb/>
speak that beautiful language as I long ago learned <lb/>
to read it. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:LAND3">Mr. LANDRY</persName>. And then you would pass a <lb/>
law to prevent yourself using it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:WELD2">Mr. WELDON</persName> (Albert). Far from it. I will <lb/>
deal with that remark of my hon. friend later on. <lb/>
I do not wish to recall past memories. I do not <lb/>
wish to speak of the events of 1877, but I do feel, <lb/>
in all soberness, that he who threw the apple of <lb/>
discord was not the hon. member singled out for <lb/>
condemnation by my friend from Assiniboia (Mr. <lb/>
Davin). It Was that man who inserted in the <lb/>
Upper House, late in the Session of 1877, that ill-<lb break="yes"/>fated section of the North-West Territories Act, <lb/>
which provided for the official use of the two lan<lb break="no"/>guages. It was he who planted the baleful <lb/>
cypress tree by the cradles of those young common<lb break="no"/>wealths between the Red River and the Rocky <lb/>
Mountains. A few words more and I have done. <lb/>
I will refer now to the somewhat irrelevant and <lb/>
larger question as to whether we should not con<lb break="no"/>sider that this Act is only a wedge by which its <lb/>
promoters commence to break up the institutions <lb/>
of the French Canadians, and that after they have <lb/>
succeeded in this, they are to go on and petition <lb/>
the Imperial Parliament to strike out section 133 of <lb/>
the British North America Act which guarantees <lb/>
the French language in this chamber, that they <lb/>
will go further and agitate for the repeal of the <lb/>
civil law in Quebec, and possibly endeavor to strike <lb/>
out that portion of the Act of Confederation which <lb/>
guarantees the freedom of the Roman Catholic re<lb break="no"/>ligion in the Province of Quebec. Coming from <lb/>
the Lower Provinces as I do, and without any au<lb break="no"/>thority to speak for any but myself and the county <lb/>
which I represent, as one who has been in the habit <lb/>
of meeting the public men of New Brunswick and <lb/>
Nova Scotia and studying the opinions of the press <lb/>
in that country, I desire to say, that, so far as I <lb/>
know, the one million people of the Lower Prov<lb break="no"/>inces sending forty-three members to this House <lb/>
are an absolute unit in believing that when we <lb/>
came into the Confederation there were agree<lb break="no"/>ments between the two Canadas and the Lower <lb/>
Provinces which should not be broken. The <lb/>
understanding was that our people were called in <lb/>
to keep the peace between those people on the St. <lb/>
Lawrence. We knew that a treaty in substance <lb/>
had been made. We knew that treaty has been <lb/>
crystallised and made lawful and bindin upon us <lb/>
by the Parliament at Westminster. We know <lb/>
that that treaty guaranteed the perfect freedom of <lb/>
the Catholic religion in Quebec, the use of the <lb/>
French language, the perpetuity of the civil law of <lb/>
Rome included, and I desire to say that the people <lb/>
down there, who are mostly English, love the <lb/>
truth and keep their faith. Long ago our old <lb/>
King Alfred was called the "truth teller," <lb/>
and we English people boast that we are <lb/>

<cb/>

truth tellers and boast that we keep our faith. <lb/>
It is a quality we are proud of. We are not faith <lb/>
breakers; we are faith keepers; and I think the <lb/>
one million people in the Provinces by the sea are <lb/>
one man in saying that it is our bounden duty, in <lb/>
good faith and honor, absolutely to preserve in<lb break="no"/>violate those provisions of the treaty, those gua<lb break="no"/>rantees of the constitution, which have been <lb/>
referred to by my hon. friend. That is the <lb/>
answer I give him when he asks me if I wish to <lb/>
strike out the French language. Mr. Speaker, I <lb/>
thank the House for its patience in indulging me <lb/>
thus far. As I sit down my attention has been <lb/>
called by the hon. member for Jacques Cartier <lb/>
(Mr. Girouard) to a constitutional point which, I <lb/>
think, might be very well stated at this juncture, <lb/>
namely, that whatever we desire to do in the <lb/>
North-West Territories in regard to the schools or <lb/>
the Assembly or the printing of papers or judicial <lb/>
proceedings, we have no power under the consti<lb break="no"/>tution to deal with the use of the French language <lb/>
in the courts; for section 133 of the British North <lb/>
America Act reads as follows:— <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Either the English or the French language may be <lb/>
used by any person in the debates of the Houses of Par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada and of the Houses of the Legislature <lb/>
of Quebec; and both those languages shall be used in the <lb/>
respective records and journals of those Houses; and <lb/>
either of those languages may be used by any person, or <lb/>
in any pleading or process in or issuing from any court <lb/>
of Canada established under this Act, and in or from all <lb/>
or any of the Courts of Quebec." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>And if we turn to section 101, which gives to this <lb/>
Parliament the power to establish Canadian courts, <lb/>
we find that it reads as follows:— <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding any<lb break="no"/>thing in this Act, from time to time, provide for the <lb/>
constitution, maintenance and organisation of a general <lb/>
Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of <lb/>
any additional courts for the better administration of the <lb/>
laws of Canada." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Reading these two sections together, I think they <lb/>
are conclusive that the courts of the North-West <lb/>
Territories are courts of Canada, and whatever we <lb/>
wish to do we cannot touch them. Let me sit <lb/>
down by saying that it makes a young member <lb/>
proud of his country, and proud of his Parliament, <lb/>
and proud of the French race, to observe the dignity <lb/>
and order which have been maintained through<lb break="no"/>out this debate; and if the hon. member who <lb/>
leads the Opposition will forgive me for saying so, <lb/>
and not think it improper, I should like to express <lb/>
the delight I have, as a peace lover, to see the <lb/>
increased dignity of debate and the elevated tone <lb/>
of discussion in this chamber during the four years <lb/>
that I have been here, for which I think the unfail<lb break="no"/>ing urbanity of the hon. gentleman himself is <lb/>
largely to be credited. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:DESS1">Mr. DESSAINT</persName>. (Translation) As a French <lb/>
Canadian, Mr. Speaker, representing a county most <lb/>
essentially French, I think that it is my duty, under <lb/>
the circumstances, to raise my voice in protest <lb/>
against the resolution which this House is asked to <lb/>
adopt. The North-West Territories were definitely <lb/>
organised by statute in 1877. The repeal of section <lb/>
110 of chapter 50 of Revised Statutes of Canada <lb/>
is asked for, by which section it is enacted that: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Either the English or the French language be <lb/>
used by any person in the debates of the Council or Leg<lb break="no"/>islative Assembly of the Territories and m the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings before the courts; and both those languages shall be <lb/>
used in the records and journals of the said Council or <lb/>
Assembly; and all ordinances made under this Act shall <lb/>
be printed in both those languages." <lb/></p>

<p>The hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) <lb/>
proposes by his Bill, now before the House, to <lb/>
repeal section 110 of "The North-West Territories <lb/>
Act." I will ask at once what can be the object <lb/>
which the hon. member has, and must necessarily <lb/>
have, in presenting such a resolution? If the Act <lb/>
which is now before the House, has but one par<lb break="no"/>ticular object, namely, to have justice done to the <lb/>
people of the North-West Territories, I ask what <lb/>
is his mission, what is his mandate, to thus take the <lb/>
part of these people? If there are any persons in <lb/>
the North-West Territories, who find themselves <lb/>
injured, let them make their voices heard in this <lb/>
House, through their authorized representatives. <lb/>
The object of the hon. member seems clear enough <lb/>
in the preamble of the Bill: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Whereas it is expedient in the interest of the national <lb/>
comity of the Dominion that there should be community <lb/>
of language among the people of Canada, and that the <lb/>
enactment in the 'North-West Territories Act' allowing <lb/>
the use of the French language should be expunged there<lb break="no"/>from: Therefore her Majesty, by and with the advice <lb/>
and comment of the Senate and House of Commons of <lb/>
Canada, enacts as follows:-<lb break="yes"/></p> 

<p>"1. Section one hundred and ten of the Act of the <lb/>
Revised Statutes of Canada, initiated 'An Act respecting <lb/>
the North-West Territories,' is hereby repealed. <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>After reading this preamble, it is easily ascertain<lb break="no"/>able that it is not merely to redress the grievances <lb/>
in the North-West that the hon. member has <lb/>
brought in this Bill. It has quite another object. <lb/>
It is not a piece of partial and local legislation <lb/>
which he undertakes to carry out, but general <lb/>
legislation attacking everything which is French <lb/>
Canadian in Canada. If the hon. member has local <lb/>
legislation in view, I ask what is his commission, <lb/>
what is his mission? I do not see that he has any, <lb/>
and I consider that he is meddling in what does not <lb/>
concern him, that he is meddling in the business <lb/>
of other people. It is said that many American <lb/>
citizens have made fortunes in minding their own <lb/>
business. This is the line of conduct which should <lb/>
be adopted by the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
(Mr. McCarthy). When the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tories Act was passed in 1877, it will be remem<lb break="no"/>bered that the section which is sought to be re<lb break="no"/>pealed was adopted first by the Senate; this <lb/>
section was then submitted to the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. The Government of Mr. Mackenzie was <lb/>
then in power. The hon. member for North Sim<lb break="no"/>coe was then in the House, and he consented with <lb/>
the others—he had not then the mission which he <lb/>
has to-day,——he consented, as did the other mem<lb break="no"/>bers, to the adoption of this section, which passed <lb/>
unanimously. Later on, in 1880, this North-West <lb/>
Territories Act again came before the House, and <lb/>
this section is found imbedded in the Revised <lb/>
Statutes, and never did the hon. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) think it proper to com<lb break="no"/>plain of it. Last year, he set out on the war path, <lb/>
and he was seen careering over Ontario and the <lb/>
North-West Territories. He thought himself <lb/>
charged with a special mission to regenerate the <lb/>
population, and to rub out from the map of Can<lb break="no"/>ada all that belonged to the French Canadians. I <lb/>
would not wish to insult the hon. member by <lb/>
comparing him to the celebrated knight who <lb/>
roamed over Spain and the other European coun<lb break="no"/>tries in order to fight windmills. I certainly would <lb/>
not desire to compare him to this renowned knight <lb/>
of the sorrowful figure, who, in his moments of <lb/>
sanguinary instinct, disembowelled armies of sheep; <lb/>
because the comparison would not be fair. The <lb/>

<cb/>

illustrious Don Quixote fought from pure gallantry <lb/>
and he sought always to protect the feeble and the <lb/>
oppressed, whilst the hon.. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe seeks to persecute them. This is the dif<lb break="no"/>ference I make between the two personages. Now, <lb/>
Mr. Speaker, the intention always shown by the hon. <lb/>
member, is not only, as all the world is per<lb break="no"/>fectly convinced, to abolish the French language <lb/>
in the North-West. If this were a Bill of limited <lb/>
effect which we are discussing at the present mo<lb break="no"/>ment, one might perhaps consider for moment <lb/>
the seasonableness of such a measure; but the Bill <lb/>
extends much farther. The aim of the hon. <lb/>
 member—he has not concealed it in his speech, <lb/>
and all those who followed him have preached <lb/>
 the same doctrine,—is the destruction of the <lb/>
French language not only in the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, but throughout the Dominion of Canada. <lb/>
Further, he would like to abolish the separate <lb/>
schools; he would equally like, if it were possible, to <lb/>
abolish the Roman Catholic religion, which has been <lb/>
attacked in a furious manner for some time past. <lb/>
I think that the movement which has now been set <lb/>
going throughout the country is far from being a <lb/>
patriotic one, but I am certain that those who <lb/>
intend such a persecution will not succeed in their <lb/>
efforts. History gives lessons which must not be <lb/>
disregarded; lessons which we should make use of, <lb/>
and which we will certainly put into practice. <lb/>
The hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) <lb/>
has told us that by the Act of Capitulation of <lb/>
Quebec and by the Act of Cession of 1763 the use <lb/>
of the French language was not guaranteed. If the <lb/>
Catholic religion has been preserved to us, if a <lb/>
guarantee for all our privileges has been given to , <lb/>
us, if we possess to-day the French civil law, the <lb/>
Code Napoleon, which is the admiration of the <lb/>
whole world, a system of law which goes back as <lb/>
 far as the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Costume de Paris</hi> and the old coutumes <lb/>
of France, we owe these to the guarantees given by <lb/>
the Treaty of Paris, and to our privileges granted <lb/>
by the Treaty of Capitulation. Well, when we <lb/>
have the right of exercising our religion as we <lb/>
understand it; when we have preserved for our<lb break="no"/>selves the coutumes, the laws in force in the <lb/>
country, by capitulation, are they going now to tell <lb/>
us that we have not the right of speaking our lan<lb break="no"/>guage? When they allowed us the use of our lan<lb break="no"/>guage before the courts, because they could not do <lb/>
otherwise, is this not a formal guarantee that we <lb/>
should have the enjoyment, along with our civil <lb/>
rights, of this beautiful French language, of which <lb/>
we are proud for more than one reason? The attempt <lb/>
made by the hon. member for Simcoe will not <lb/>
succeed, and I trust that he will not return again to <lb/>
the charge. At the time of the cession of Canada— <lb/>
as he has himself stated,—the population of Canada, <lb/>
which was entirely French at the time, was about <lb/>
65,000 souls. A great number quitted the country to <lb/>
return to France, notably the nobles and oificers, <lb/>
and the educated persons generally. They deserted <lb/>
the new country and we remained there in small <lb/>
numbers under the shield and guardianship of the <lb/>
priests, who were at that epoch the only people of <lb/>
education. Well, since 1763, until Confederation <lb/>
in 1867, and even up to the present time as is now <lb/>
proved, they have tried by every means in their <lb/>
power to prevent the French Canadians from <lb/>
speaking their language and practising their reli<lb break="no"/>gion. This people which originally reckoned only <lb/>
65,000 souls resisted the storm and presented a <lb/>

hold front to all attacks. It has preserved its <lb/>
privileges, its language, its religion, and its rights. <lb/>
How can it be imagined to-day, Mr. Speaker, that <lb/>
with a population of one million and one-half of <lb/>
French Canadians, settled in the Province of <lb/>
Quebec and the other Provinces of Canada, and <lb/>
about one million in the United States, how can <lb/>
it be imagined, I say, that the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe and the companions who support him, can <lb/>
hope to be able to destroy the French race, and <lb/>
take away from it the right of using its language, <lb/>
when there exists to defend it a population of more <lb/>
than one million living in the Dominion of Canada? <lb/>
The persecutions which have with intent been <lb/>
carried on against the French Canadians have not <lb/>
been confined to the Province of Quebec, but <lb/>
before the cession of 1763, the English who at <lb/>
that time peopled the thirteen colonies which <lb/>
later on made up the United States, already carried <lb/>
on before the warfor independence had been de<lb break="no"/>clared, a bloody war upon everything that was <lb/>
French, and they attacked the Acadians, who then <lb/>
dwelt in Nova Scotia. In order to show the dis<lb break="no"/>honesty with which they acted towards these <lb/>
Frenchmen, it will be sufficient for me to cite an <lb/>
extract from a work by Mr. Jacques de Baudon<lb break="no"/>court, at page 309: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The Acadians asked to be exempted from carrying <lb/>
arms a ainst France in case ofwar (for it must always be <lb/>
remein cred that war had not been declared). This mark <lb/>
of attachment was never forgiven and served as a pre<lb break="no"/>text for the carrying out of a measure the most brutal <lb/>
among all that history has recorded. The English fleets <lb/>
surrounded Acadia and the most profound secrecy was <lb/>
maintained in order that no one might escape. The <lb/>
ofiicers and the Protestant clergy had already exhausted. <lb/>
against the unfortunate Acadians. all their insults and <lb/>
annoyances. The supreme iniquity was about to be con<lb break="no"/>summated. To take seven or eight thousand men by force <lb/>
was impracticable, recourse was had to a ruse. A gen<lb break="no"/>eral proclamation from Moneton,invited all the men under <lb/>
the severest penalties, above the age of ten years, to assem<lb break="no"/>ble in the church of their respective villages, in order there <lb/>
to listen to the orders of the Grovernment. The day fixed <lb/>
was Friday the 5th day of September. In order to give <lb/>
an idea of what took place in the other Acadian villages, <lb/>
let us recount what passed in the village of Grand Pré, <lb/>
where 483 men, 337 women and 1,107 children were grouped. <lb/>
when they were shut up in the church, the approaches to <lb/>
which were guarded by the Bostonnais, Col. Winsloy having <lb/>
taken his place in the middle of the meeting, made this <lb/>
announcement, one worthy of Nero and Caligula: 'You <lb/>
are gathered together here in order that I may make you <lb/>
acquainted with the final resolve of His Majesty, respect<lb break="no"/>ing the French population of this Province. Your lands, <lb/>
your cattle, and your provlsions of all kinds, are confis<lb break="no"/>cated tor the benefit of the Crown, and as for yourselves <lb/>
you will be transported from the country. You owe to <lb/>
the goodness of His Malesty the right which I am going <lb/>
to allow you, namely, that of carrying off all your money <lb/>
and household stuff. provided always, that it will not <lb/>
encumber the vessels in which you are going to embark. <lb/>
From this moment I declare you to be prisoners of the <lb/>
King.' <lb/></p> 

<p>"And the unhappy Acadians without arms, were <lb/>
escorted in six ranks, at the bayonet's point, from the <lb/>
church to the ship where the men were to embark; they <lb/>
passed along groaning With grief in the midst of their <lb/>
Wives and e ildren, who were on their knees and calling <lb/>
down the blessings of heaven on the poor exiles from whom <lb/>
they were going to be separated. The Americans were <lb/>
pitiless, and took no pains to unite families; they had not <lb/>
even prepared a place for the reception of the exiles. the <lb/>
colonies were not forewarned. 0n the same day and hour <lb/>
all the other villages were treated in the same manner. <lb/>
and the seven thousand captured Acadians were em<lb break="no"/>barked for an unknown destination." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>The greater part of these poor wretches were <lb/>
deceived in this manner and despoiled of their <lb/>
goods; this act of cruelty will be a shameful blot <lb/>
on the history of British North America. These <lb/>
poor Acadians were embarked forcibly on board <lb/>

<cb/>

the vessels. They were scattered along the <lb/>
coasts of the United States; and they were de<lb break="no"/>prived of all, in order to prevent their return to <lb/>
their country where they possessed fertile and <lb/>
well cultivated lands and a fair amount of pro<lb break="no"/>perty. In spite of this persecution, Mr. Speaker, <lb/>
the Canadians so loved their soil; they so loved <lb/>
their country, that it ended in their repatriating <lb/>
themselves, and at the present day this population <lb/>
of 7,000, which had thus been scattered to the <lb/>
four winds, has come together again and numbers <lb/>
at least 110,000 Acadians, in Nova Scotia and New <lb/>
Brunswick. All this proves that there are certain <lb/>
feelings which cannot be driven out of the heart of <lb/>
man. The Canadians may be expelled from the <lb/>
country, but no one can succeed in stifling their <lb/>
national sentiment. I shall not enter upon all the <lb/>
historical incidents which followed this gloomy <lb/>
period, between 1760 and 1837. I shall only re<lb break="no"/>mark that the Government, every time the occa<lb break="no"/>sion presented itself, being then hostile, took all <lb/>
the means possible to deprive the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dian nation of their privileges. They tried to pre<lb break="no"/>vent our speaking the language peculiar to it. Our <lb/>
fellow-countrymen had not the right to speak offi<lb break="no"/>cially the French language in the Legislative As<lb break="no"/>semblies, nor even in the courts: they robbed <lb/>
them of their just rights. They had judges who <lb/>
understood not a word of French, and who were <lb/>
third-class men. They endeavored by this means <lb/>
 to prevent their having access to the courts,—and <lb/>
our countrymen chose the oldest men among them <lb/>
to adjust their differences; it was certainly the <lb/>
best way to bear up as they have done. The hon. <lb/>
First Minister has spoken to us about a memorable <lb/>
epoch; he spoke to us about the year 1844, the year <lb/>
in which he entered public life for the first time. He <lb/>
told us that if the French Canadians were pro<lb break="no"/>tected in that year it was by a Tory Government. <lb/>
I think that the hon. the First Minister makes a <lb/>
mistake in this connection, for the Government of <lb/>
the day was not Wholly Tory; and the measure to <lb/>
which he alluded, that is to say the restoration of. <lb/>
the French language in Canada, was not proposed <lb/>
by a Tory, but by the Hon. Mr. Papineau, who <lb/>
certainly was not a Tory, but a Reformer and an <lb/>
advanced Liberal. This measure was a protest <lb/>
against the Union Act of 1840; for it is known that <lb/>
in this Union Act a section had been interpolated <lb/>
by which the French language was completely for<lb break="no"/>bidden in the legislative debates. In 1845 the <lb/>
Hon. Mr. Papineau, moved a resolution and based <lb/>
a Bill upon this resolution, re-establishing the use of <lb/>
the French language in the Legislative Chamber. <lb/>
This resolution was unanimously adopted by the <lb/>
members present. Consequently the Conservative <lb/>
party of to-day, or the Tory party, cannot claim to <lb/>
have given us the benefit of such a measure. But <lb/>
if the hon. the First Minister had gone a little-<lb break="yes"/>further and had come down to 1849, he would, <lb/>
perhaps have been able to have made us see what<lb/>
 were the intentions of the Tories of that day. We <lb/>
can remember that, in 1849, the Tory newspapers <lb/>
declared war to the death on everything in the. <lb/>
shape of a French Canadian. We can recollect <lb/>
that at that time it was a Liberal Government <lb/>
which asked the House to vote a sum of money as <lb/>
an indemnity to those French Canadians who had <lb/>
suffered losses in the rebellion of 1837. The pro<lb break="no"/>posal of the Government was warmly debated, and <lb/>
the hon. the First Minister of the present moment, <lb/>

who was then in the House, was one of those who <lb/>
made the most revolutionary speeches that can be <lb/>
found in the history of our country. The press <lb/>
also discussed the question. It is necessary, said <lb/>
the Tory organs, that the French race should <lb/>
disappear from Canada. The hon. the First Minister <lb/>
was a Tory then, as he is now, and he was at the <lb/>
head of those who waged war upon the French <lb/>
Canadian race. We remember the disorders which <lb/>
were caused by this law. The Governor was <lb/>
insulted; stones and rotten eggs were thrown at <lb/>
him. An organised body laid siege to the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment House; threw in a shower of stones even into <lb/>
the Council Chamber; they drove out the members; <lb/>
they broke the desks and chairs; they carried off <lb/>
the mace; one of their leaders seated in the <lb/>
Speaker's chair proclaimed in the name of the <lb/>
people the dissolution of the Parliament. At the <lb/>
same time the building became the prey of the <lb/>
flames, as did the house of the Hon. Mr. Lafontaine. <lb/>
And who were at the head of this revolutionary <lb/>
movement? They were the Tories of the day, and <lb/>
I venture to say the political ancestors of the hon. <lb/>
member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). And <lb/>
who, setting aside Mr. Lafontaine, took up the <lb/>
defence of the French Canadians? It was a man <lb/>
whose name will live in the history of our country. <lb/>
It was the father of the Hon. Mr. Blake, who, in a <lb/>
most eloquent speech, demanded, as a good patriot, <lb/>
as a philosopher, their rights for the French <lb/>
Canadians. We have discovered in this House, <lb/>
within the last few days, that the son of this <lb/>
great patriot has followed the traditions of his <lb/>
father, and has adopted the same line of conduct <lb/>
by praising the French Canadians. He has placed <lb/>
himself above the considerations of party; he has <lb/>
taken the side of the persecuted, and the French <lb/>
Canadians will owe him an eternal acknowledg<lb break="no"/>ment, as they preserve a precious remembrance of <lb/>
his illustrious father. I am perfectly convinced, <lb/>
Mr. Speaker, that the hon. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) does not hope to obtain <lb/>
the result which he has in view, when proposing <lb/>
the measure which is now offered for our consi<lb break="no"/>deration. He knows that it is impossible to secure <lb/>
the abolition of the French language in the North-<lb break="yes"/>West, and still less in the Province of Quebec; <lb/>
and I tell him frankly that he is dashing his head <lb/>
against stone walls by endeavoring to secure the <lb/>
adoption of this measure. Before abolishing the <lb/>
French language, and taking from us the privileges <lb/>
which we enjoy, he will find, if need be, thousands <lb/>
upon thousands of breasts presented as a defence <lb/>
for the liberties which we enjoy. Mr. Speaker, <lb/>
recriminations are indulged in against the hon. the <lb/>
First Minister of the Province of Quebec. I do <lb/>
not know why they are continually attacking a <lb/>
man who is not in this House to defend himself; <lb/>
it would appear that there is a mad rage against <lb/>
him; it would appear that he has excited the pre<lb break="no"/>judices and the hatred of certain persons in the <lb/>
House. I am not commissioned to take up the <lb/>
defence of Mr. Mercier; but when they accuse <lb/>
him of fanaticism; when they 'state that the <lb/>
Government of Quebec desires to ostracise the <lb/>
English minority in that Province, I say that a <lb/>
statement is made which is not true. Let us <lb/>
examine the facts as they really are: There are in <lb/>
the Province of Quebec, ten members speaking the <lb/>
English language out of sixty-five who form the <lb/>
total membership of the Legislature. There are <lb/>

<cb/>

in the Ministry two English Protestant Ministers. <lb/>
Consequently these two English Ministers represent <lb/>
one-third of the membership. If Mr. Mercier had <lb/>
only granted to the Protestant minority the num<lb break="no"/>ber of Ministers to which they were entitled with <lb/>
regard to the population and the body of represen<lb break="no"/>tatives, he would have given them but one Pro<lb break="no"/>testant Minister. Now, let any one cite one single <lb/>
act,—I do not refer to a word spoken in a patriotic <lb/>
speech where one may go beyond the usual bounds <lb/>
of prudence, —let them cite one case where Mr. <lb/>
Mercier has not done justice to the Protestant <lb/>
minority, then I will admit that he has made <lb/>
himself blameworthy. Again, lately, during the <lb/>
session now in progress, he has shown his justice <lb/>
towards the Protestant minority. Mr. Hall pre<lb break="no"/>sented a Bill to the Legislature asking for a privi<lb break="no"/>lege favoring the Protestant minority, in the <lb/>
matter of the admission to the study of law of the <lb/>
bearers of University degrees. The Hon. Mr. <lb/>
Mercier was the first to impress upon his followers <lb/>
his own personal ideas, and he in this way made <lb/>
the Bill of Mr. Hall to pass in triumph. This is <lb/>
what the Sherbrooke Gazette says on the subject: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"We are quite aware that we are going to give the <lb/>
Sherbrooke Examiner an opportunity of delivering <lb/>
himself once more of his stupid jests, but we must render <lb/>
justice to Mr. Mercier for the statesmanlike act he has <lb/>
done in taking up the defence of the rights of the English <lb/>
Universities. in causing their diplomas of B.A. to be <lb/>
accepted as evidence that the bearer of the degree has <lb/>
received a sufficiently liberal education to enable him to <lb/>
commence the study of the law. Prejudice—blind irra<lb break="no"/>tional prejudice—is so spread over Quebec and possesses <lb/>
the Legislature to such a degree, that the chief of such a <lb/>
party as the National Party must have a large portion of <lb/>
moral courage to rise above the narrow and paltry ideas <lb/>
of the party, and render justice to the minority." <lb/></p>
 </quote>
 <p>
This is what Mr. Mercier has done in the case be<lb break="no"/>fore us. His support, his pleading and his elo<lb break="no"/>quence have assured the passing of Mr. Hall's Bill, <lb/>
and his efforts ought to be acknowledged to his <lb/>
face. <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"Honor to whom honor is due. Mr. Mercier deserves <lb/>
the gratitude of all true believers in equal rights." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>That is what an English newspaper said, quite <lb/>
recently, on the position taken by the Hon. Mr. <lb/>
Mercier towards the Protestant minority. This is <lb/>
not all: during the past few days a question of <lb/>
privilege was raised before this House by making <lb/>
allusion to certain disorders which have taken <lb/>
place in Hull. One hon. member allowed himself <lb/>
to make a furious tirade, not only against Mr. <lb/>
Mercier, but against French Canadians in general; <lb/>
he took advantage of the occasion to hurl upon the <lb/>
French Canadians an insult which I will not re<lb break="no"/>peat, but which we have felt keenly and which has <lb/>
wounded us in our most private feelings. He went <lb/>
so far as to recall the sad remembrances of the <lb/>
battle on the Plains of Abraham and the battle of <lb/>
Waterloo. He went so far as to tell us that the <lb/>
time would come when great Salvation Armies<lb/>
 would march through the streets of Quebec. Why <lb/>
provoke in this manner the French Canadians, who <lb/>
only ask to live like brothers, hand in hand with <lb/>
their fellow-citizens of whatever race or origin? <lb/>
This brand of discord is hurled in order to create a <lb/>
programme, in order to pick up at the next elec<lb break="no"/>tions a certain number of fanatics. I have nothing <lb/>
to say about the Salvation Army nor the battle of <lb/>
the Plains of Abraham. If the history of our <lb/>
fellow-citizens of English origin has some dates of <lb/>
honor and victory, I can say that we French Cana<lb break="no"/>

dians have some glorious pages in the history of <lb/>
our country. If we have suffered losses, if we have <lb/>
experienced checks, we can in any case march with <lb/>
head erect; we can look behind with pride and be <lb/>
proud of our ancestors. I say, Mr. Speaker, that <lb/>
it is not generous; I say that it is despicable to <lb/>
make illusions like that to the ancestors of a nation <lb/>
which has a glorious past. Occasion has been <lb/>
found to speak of the Salvation Army. I ask what <lb/>
has the Salvation Army to do with this case? I <lb/>
frankly admit that I have no very great admira<lb break="no"/>tion for this army, which may have a cause for its <lb/>
existence from its own point of view; but is, in my <lb/>
opinion, only a gathering of parasites, which I find <lb/>
simply ridiculous. I might say more, but as there <lb/>
may be found among those people some well-in<lb break="no"/>tentioned individuals, I wish to give them the <lb/>
benefit of the doubt. Nevertheless, there is one <lb/>
thing very certain, which is, that the Salvation <lb/>
Army, like many other fanatical religious organ<lb break="no"/>isations, has no justification for its existence, and <lb/>
I say that the law does not permit scandalous and <lb/>
noisy processions in the streets. We live in a free <lb/>
country; I respect all religious denominations, and <lb/>
we desire that our religion should be respected; <lb/>
but the liberty of creed in a country does not <lb/>
authorise license. This is what the first section of <lb/>
the Act respecting rectories says on the subject:— <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The free exercise and enjoyment of religious pro<lb break="no"/>fession and worship, without discrimination or prefer<lb break="no"/>ence, so as the same be not made an excuse for acts of <lb/>
licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent <lb/>
with the peace and safety of the Province, are by the con<lb break="no"/>stitution and laws of this Province allowed to all Her <lb/>
Majesty's subjects within the same." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Well, all creeds have free access to this country; <lb/>
all religions are respected; but this must not give <lb/>
an opening for license which may disturb the <lb/>
public peace. Will they say that the noisy demon<lb break="no"/>strations, of which we were witness on the streets <lb/>
of Quebec, are not of a kind to break the public <lb/>
peace? I say: yes, they are; and, further, I find in <lb/>
these processions a provocation which should be <lb/>
avoided by all legal methods. To show the good<lb break="no"/>will of the Hon. Mr. Mercier, who is always <lb/>
working in the interest of peace and harmony in <lb/>
our country, I shall cite the answer which he made <lb/>
to the Hon. Mr. Taillon in reference to the troubles <lb/>
which have occurred lately in Hull. This is What <lb/>
he said: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"At the opening of the Session the Hon. Mr. Taillon <lb/>
drew the attention of the Government to the regrettable <lb/>
disorders which took place recently in Hull,and asked <lb/>
whether it was their intention to take steps to put an end <lb/>
to them. <lb/></p> 

<p>"The Hon. Mr. Mercier said the question of the leader <lb/>
of the Opposition was in every way an opportune one,and <lb/>
in reply the would inform the House that the Government <lb/>
had etermined to maintain peace and order, and to pro<lb break="no"/>tect those who deemed to spea ,no matter on what subject, <lb/>
provided that while so doing they did not violate the laws <lb/>
of the country." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>.I think, Mr. Speaker, that the Hon. Mr. Mercier has <lb/>
in this instance only done his duty, and I trust that <lb/>
the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), <lb/>
and the other members who have spoken in the same <lb/>
strain as he has, will be satisfied with the attitude <lb/>
which he, Mr. Mercier, has taken on this occasion. <lb/>
Well, Mr. Speaker, with regard to the French <lb/>
language, they tell us that in this country it is im<lb break="no"/>possible—if we wish to be a homogeneous people, a <lb/>
true nationality,— that it is impossible that there <lb/>
should exist different languages. The learned re<lb break="no"/>searches of several of my co leagues have shown <lb/>
 
<cb/>

that the thing not only is not impossible, but that <lb/>
it is found to be practical and advantageous in <lb/>
several countries, notably in the United States, <lb/>
in the Island of Jersey, in Switzerland, and in <lb/>
several other countries. I will venture to remark <lb/>
to the hon. member for Simcoe that, if he expects <lb/>
by this means to make the English language <lb/>
spoken by all British subjects his breath will be <lb/>
a long time out of his body before this end is <lb/>
reached; because Canada is not the only country <lb/>
where another language is spoken: there are other <lb/>
British possessions where English is not spoken at <lb/>
all—thus, the East or English Indies, where the <lb/>
people speak different languages and have different <lb/>
customs. I should like to think that the hon. <lb/>
member for Simcoe does not entertain the hope <lb/>
that England can impose her language upon all the <lb/>
peoples who make up her empire: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The races which compose the population of India are <lb/>
as diverse as the climates" says Larousse, "the tribes, <lb/>
which are distinct as to language, creeds, and by their <lb/>
social organisation are innumerable." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>I do not know whether the hon. member for <lb/>
Simcoe wishes to carry on his crusade in favor of <lb/>
the English language into these regions. Let us <lb/>
see now what goes on in the Island of Jersey. It <lb/>
has been stated here that the French language <lb/>
was spoken there. It has been an English <lb/>
possession for many ages. The population is <lb/>
56,078, of which 2,000 are Frenchmen. Not<lb break="no"/>withstanding, what do we see? We see the <lb/>
French language there is held in high esteem; that <lb/>
it is spoken by the well-to-do people, and that it is <lb/>
the official language of the country. This does not <lb/>
prevent the inhabitants of Jersey from proving in <lb/>
many instances their deep attachment for their <lb/>
new nationality, that of Great Britain. One can <lb/>
recollect that several. years ago, France being at <lb/>
war with England, the people of Jersey took up <lb/>
arms against their old mother country, and fought <lb/>
for the Crown of England. This did not prevent <lb/>
them from preserving their customs, their privileges <lb/>
and their language up to the present time. This <lb/>
shows that one can be a patriot and a good British <lb/>
subject though speaking a foreign tongue. Let <lb/>
us look again at the Island of Ste. Lucie. It is a <lb/>
small island, exclusively, I think, or in great part <lb/>
peopled by French. Nevertheless for a great number <lb/>
of years the only language spoken in this island <lb/>
has been the French one; it is the official language. <lb/>
Several years back, when the Hon. Judge Armstrong <lb/>
was Governor of this island, which possessed French <lb/>
laws, they adopted the greater portion of the Code <lb/>
of Lower Canada. This does not prevent their being <lb/>
loyal subjects of Her Majesty, and if need be they <lb/>
would take up arms to defend the British Crown. <lb/>
I will not recall the glorious deeds of arms in which <lb/>
the French Canadians took part. These facts have <lb/>
already been mentioned in the Course of this debate, <lb/>
and it is sufficient to recall them to show the loyalty <lb/>
of the French Canadians under all circumstances <lb/>
and in all places. Now, in order to prove the <lb/>
qualities of the French language, which has been <lb/>
so violently attacked, and which it is desired to <lb/>
see disappear, I will venture to quote a page written <lb/>
by Mr. Oscar Dunn, who, I think, is of British <lb/>
origin. This is what he says: <lb/></p> 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>"The French language is a diamond of inestimable value; <lb/>
it is a work of gol worked on for centuries, of a beauty <lb/>
like to none other. All the world admires her; she charms <lb/>
every body: although she reveals her secrets to but few, <lb/>
one must love her, love her much, and court her assi<lb break="no"/>

duously and long; she only yields to him who knows how to <lb/>
conquer by per-severing labor and unshaken constancy; <lb/>
but what a treasure does she reveal to her favorites. <lb/>
Her exquisite delicacy ravishes the understanding: she <lb/>
is all love and all gaiety; full of nobility and enthu<lb break="no"/>siasm; accessible to the sciences as to fancy; to all ele<lb break="no"/>vated ideas as to all worthy sentiments; she understands <lb/>
your heart and assists your wit. If you once gain posses<lb break="no"/>sion of her, nothing will persuade you ever to give her up. <lb/>
You will keep her as your very best treasure." <lb/></p> 
</quote>
<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for North <lb/>
Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) has allowed himself, in the <lb/>
course of his remarks, to allude to the antipathy <lb/>
existing between the French Canadians and the <lb/>
Irish. He has received in this House the most <lb/>
solemn denial of this statement that he could <lb/>
obtain. We have seen the hon. member for <lb/>
Montreal Centre (Mr. Curran) rising and speaking <lb/>
in French, in the name of the Irish of the Province <lb/>
of Quebec, bearing witness, in this way, to the <lb/>
sympathies which his fellow-countrymen have for <lb/>
us. This is the most ample vindication which we <lb/>
could adduce as to this matter. This sympathy, <lb/>
Mr. Speaker, exists not only between the Irish and <lb/>
the.French Canadians; it exists and will exist in <lb/>
spite of the obstacles raised by the hon. member <lb/>
for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) between the <lb/>
French Canadians and the thinking Englishmen. <lb/>
We have had evidence of this in this House. They <lb/>
wish to respect our institutions, our laws, our cus<lb break="no"/>toms and our religion. On the other hand, we <lb/>
return the reverence which they pay us, and we <lb/>
respect likewise their institutions and their religion, <lb/>
their language and their character. We are capable <lb/>
of living in peace in this country. We have but <lb/>
one only object—to form a stronger Dominion, a <lb/>
great nation. But to reach this end it is not neces<lb break="no"/>sary to cast a brand of discord among us, as has <lb/>
done the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc <lb/>
Carthy). We wish to live in peace, we desire har<lb break="no"/>mony, we desire to be calm and unexcited. But I <lb/>
affirm that the proposition of the hon. member for <lb/>
North Simcoe is an act of tyranny, which will show, <lb/>
if it is sanctioned, that they are not so patriotic as <lb/>
they would wish us to believe. Before closing, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, let me be allowed to say that we look <lb/>
upon the Bill of the hon. member for North Simcoe <lb/>
(Mr. McCarthy) with calmness and tranquility. <lb/>
We are strong in our rights, and we fear nothing, <lb/>
even if this Bill were a declaration of war. We <lb/>
are strong in our rights and we are proud, at the <lb/>
same time, of our ancestors, whose memory we <lb/>
know how to make respected. I shall say no more. <lb/>
I am convinced that the Bill which is now before <lb/>
you for consideration will obtain the fate it <lb/>
deserves, and I am certain that all true patriots in <lb/>
this House will join hand to hand in order to give <lb/>
a lesson to the author of this Bill. <lb/></p>

<p>Mr. LAURIER. I hope the hon. gentleman <lb/>
will not press his motion. I think we have not <lb/>
yet reached a period of the Session when the <lb/>
Government should take another day. We have <lb/>
not yet discussed one of the numerous public Bills <lb/>
set down on the Order paper, and if Thursday is <lb/>
taken away, the only time when those Bills <lb/>
can come up will be Wednesday evening. It <lb/>
is not likely that we could dispose of them, having <lb/>
so short a time, and besides, to-morrow is Ash <lb/>
Wednesday. I would, therefore, suggest that the <lb/>
hon. gentleman should not press this motion to-day, <lb/>
but should reserve it until we have discussed some <lb/>
of these public Bills. <lb/></p> 

<p>Sir HECTOR LANGEVIN. I meant this to <lb/>
take effect after Thursday next. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. LAURIER. I would suggest that the hon. <lb/>
gentleman might renew his motion next Monday, <lb/>
but I think it is altogether premature for the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to make the motion now. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. MITCHELL. The Government have, for <lb/>
a number of Sessions, compelled me to take the <lb/>
very objection which the leader of the Opposition <lb/>
has now taken. I am glad to see that he is resist<lb break="no"/>ing this motion. There is great difficulty in get<lb break="no"/>ting any private legislation done, when the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment come in and practically take all the time <lb/>
of the House for their own business. I have <lb/>
always protested against this, and I renew the pro<lb break="no"/>test, and endorse the statement of the leader of <lb/></p>-->
