   <p>NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES ACT.</p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCARTHY. I beg to move that Bill (No.<lb/>
      27) further to amend the Act respectin gthe North-<lb/>
      West Territories Act be set down for second reading<lb/>
      on Monday next. I desire to explain, after the<lb/>
      vote taken last night, why I make the motion. I<lb/>
      had intended, at some stage of teh debate, to speak<lb/>
      on teh question, and I understood, in fact I was in-<lb/>
      formed by many hon. gentlement, that other hon.<lb/>
      members also desired to speak on it as well. My<lb/>
      principal object in moving this motion, however, is<lb/>
      to direct attention to the practice which prevails in<lb/>
      this House, without in the slightest degree intend-<lb/>
      ing to cast any imputation on you, Mr. Speaker, as<lb/>
      to the manner in which the question was put on<lb/>
      this occasion, and indeed on other occasions. One<lb/>
      side of the House cried "carried" and the other<lb/>
      side "lost," and you, Mr. Speaker, announced from<lb/>
      yiour place, without putting the question, and calling<lb/>
      for the yeas and nays, that the nays had it. That,<lb/>
      of course, properly speaking, put an end to all op-<lb/>
      portunity for debate. That being done, in order<lb/>
      that the yeas and nays might be recorded, I called<lb/>
      for the yeas and nays. I think the proper prac-<lb/>
      tice, and it is the English practice, that the<lb/>
      question being put by you, Mr. Speaker, from the<lb/>
      Chair, you should call for the yeas and then call<lb/>
      for the nays, and then declare whether the years or<lb/>
      the nays had it, and it is on appeal from that decision<lb/>
      that the yeas and nays are called for. The House<lb/>
      woudl then have the fullest opportunity of knowing<lb/>
      when the question was being put, and not, as last<lb/>
      night, be taken by surprise.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir JOHN THOMPSON. For one, I am not able<lb/>
      to concur in the adoption of this motion, to-day. I<lb/>
      think teh House fully understood, when the ques-<lb/>
      tion was put last night, tha tthe principle of the<lb/>
      Bill was being voted on, and in relation to a public<lb/>
      measure, as this is, it is a very unusual course to<lb/>
      adopt such a motion. As regards what took place<lb/>
      last night, I feel boudn to say that, to my mind,<lb/>
      the Chair showed unusual deliberation in putting<lb/>
      the question. It struck me when the question<lb/>
      was called for, and when both sides of the House<lb/>
      called either "carried" or "lost," that you, Mr.<lb/>
      Speaker, must have been under the imrpession that<lb/>
      a discussion would take place, otherwise you would<lb/>
      not have deliberated so long as you did in announc-<lb/>
      ing what you thought was the result of the division.<lb/>
      I, therefore, feel bound to say that I think the<lb/>
      Chair cannot rest under any charge of undue ex-<lb/>
      pedition.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. DENISON. I intended to have said a few<lb/>
      words last night, but, as many hon. members will<lb/>
      recollect, there is one hour allowed for private<lb/>
      Bills, and as the question was called not more than<lb/>
      15 or 20 minutes after eight o'clock, I and many<lb/>
      other hon. members were taken by surprise.
    </p><lb/>
    <p>
      Mr. McMULLEN. Since the hon. member for<lb/>
      North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) placed the Bill on<lb/>
      the Order Paper it has been called in this House<lb/>
      not less than three or four time. It was called<lb/>
      when he was present, it was allowed to stand, I<lb/>
      presume at his request, from time to time, and<lb/>
      eventualy, at the eleventh hour last night, the<lb/>
      Bill was called. We are now reachign teh last<lb/>
      stages of the session. It ws a question that will<lb/>
      cause considerable discussion, and for my part I<lb/>
      am not disposed to vote to reinstate it this session.
    </p><lb/>
    <cb/>
    <p>
      Mr. McCARTHY. My particular object, as I<lb/>
      stated, was to have an understanding, and I think<lb/>
      it is well we shoudl ahve it as to how questions are<lb/>
      to be put from the Chair. As it seems to be against<lb/>
      the general feeling of the House, I do not desire to<lb/>
      press this motion. I quite realize now, that it<lb/>
      woudl be the occasion of very great inconvenience<lb/>
      to have a discussion upon thi squestion this session,<lb/>
      but I thought it only due to my friends who desire<lb/>
      to speak on eitherside, and also to myself, to draw<lb/>
      attention to the fact that we were taken by sur-<lb/>
      prise. I do not desire at all to impute any want<lb/>
      of courtesy to you, Mr. Speaker, or to say that you<lb/>
      did not give us time. There was plenty of oppor-<lb/>
      tunity, that is quite certain, for any gentleman<lb/>
      here who desired to speak. At the same time I<lb/>
      think I am quite within the mark when I say, as<lb/>
      I do say, that I for one was taken by surprise<lb/>
      when you declared that the "nays" had it, and I<lb/>
      think other gentlemen were in the same position.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir JOHN THOMPSON. Just allow me to<lb/>
      mention one circumstance which took place when<lb/>
      the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy<lb/>
      wasnot in the House ; as completely meeting, I<lb/>
      think, the hon. gentleman's impression ithat the<lb/>
      advocates of the Bill were taken by surprise. The<lb/>
      Bill ws called at a quarter to six, before recess,<lb/>
      and the hon. member for Muskoka (Mr. O'Brien)<lb/>
      rose to discuss it ; but at his request we all agreed<lb/>
      to call it six o'clock, in order that any gentleman<lb/>
      wishing to speak in favour of the Bill might get a<lb/>
      full hearing, and might know that the Bill was<lb/>
      to come up at eight o'clock.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. LAURIER. I woudl remind teh hon. mem-<lb/>
      ber for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) that on this<lb/>
      occasion it was exactly as it was two years ago,<lb/>
      when he introduced his Bill with regard to the<lb/>
      French language. At that time, he expounded his<lb/>
      Bill on the first reading, and on the second read-<lb/>
      ing he moved it without speech, exactly as he did<lb/>
      yesterday. Mr. Speaker gave ample opportunity<lb/>
      last night to any one who desired to speak on the<lb/>
      Bill.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCARTHY. No doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. LAURIER. I think two or three minutes<lb/>
      elapsed at least before the Speaker said : "Call in<lb/>
      the members."<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. BECHARD. Mr. Speaker, I think the<lb/>
      ho. member for NOrth Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy)<lb/>
      was wrong in saying that he was takenby surprise.<lb/>
      I was in my seat when the Bill ws called, and<lb/>
      when the motion fo rthe second reading was put<lb/>
      everybody was looking for the hon. member to<lb/>
      rise and make a speech, but he was one of the first<lb/>
      to call "yeas" and "nays." It was after that,<lb/>
      that hon. gentlement said "call in the members," and<lb/>
      you, Mr. Speaker, gave the order to call in the<lb/>
      members after a few minutes had elapsed.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). I understand the rule<lb/>
      to be that where a Bill is voted down, and not<lb/>
      postponed to any future date, that it can be put<lb/>
      on the Order Paper again by teh hon. gentleman<lb/>
      who has charge of it if he sees proper  and it is<lb/>
      not a question of order at all. If the hon. gentle-<lb/>
      man wishes to put his Bill on teh Order Paper, I<lb/>
      suppose there is nothing in the rule to prevent<lb/>
      him. There is no doubt whatever, it seems to me,<lb/>
      that there was ample opportunity given for hon.<lb/>
      gentlemen who wished to speak. Mr. Speaker<lb/>
    </p>
