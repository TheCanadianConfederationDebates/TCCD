     <persName ref="pers:MART1">Mr. MARTIN</persName> moved for leave to introduce 
     <lb/>
     Bill (No. 22) further to amend chapter seven 
     <lb/>
     of the Revised Statutes of Canada, being 
     <lb/>
     the " North-west Territories Representation 
     <lb/>
     Act." He said: In introducing this Bill I 
     <lb/>
     desire to make a few remarks, as the sub<lb break="no"/>ject is one of very great importance indeed 
     <lb/>
     to the Liberals of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. The Bill proposes to undo the legis<lb break="no"/>lation enacted by the House in 1894, which 
     <lb/>
     altered the North-west Territories Repre<lb break="no"/>sentation Actâ€”that is, to undo it so far as it 
     <lb/>
     elects a change in regard to the voters' 
     <lb/>
     lists. It will be remembered that in 1894 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Minister of the Interior introduced 
     <lb/>
     a Bill for the purpose of establishing vote 
     <lb/>
     by ballot in the North-west Territories in 
     <lb/>
     the coming general election. These pro<lb break="no"/>visions were, of course, supported on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House. There had been a good 
     <lb/>
     deal of agitation in the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories in favour of the ballot, and, of 
     <lb/>
     course, the Liberals were very strongly in 
     <lb/>
    favour of extending to the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>

     ritories the law that was in force in other 
     <lb/>
     parts of Canada. During the discussion of 
     <lb/>
     that Bill the question of the voters' lists 
     <lb/>
     came up in this chamber and the condition 
     <lb/>
     of affairs in the North-west Territories was 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly explained. The Bill did not seek 
     <lb/>
     to alter matters at all with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     voters' lists. The Bill was passed by this 
     <lb/>
     House and sent to the Senate, and the 
     <lb/>
     Senate did a very unusual thing, it under<lb break="no"/>took to make a most material change in the 
     <lb/>
     law with regard to elections for this House. 
     <lb/>
    I suppose that never before since Confede<lb break="no"/>ration did the Senate assume to do such a 
     <lb/>thing as change the law with regard to 
     <lb/>elections for members of the House of 
     <lb/>Commons. But in this case they made a 
     <lb/>most vital change, a change which simply 
     <lb/>means that, at the coming general elections 
     <lb/>the Government of the day have the power 
     <lb/>to nominate and elect representatives of 
     <lb/>the four constituencies in the North-west 
     <lb/>Territories. That is to say, this amendment 
     <lb/>makes it impossible for any opponent of the 
     <lb/>Government to get his name upon the 
     <lb/>voters' lists unless the officer appointed by 
     <lb/>the Government is willing that his name 
     <lb/>should be there. There is no opportunity 
     <lb/>for the voter to learn whether his name is 
     <lb/>upon the list or not unless it appears upon 
     <lb/>the first preliminary list that is made up. 
     <lb/>The amendments came back to the House 
     <lb/>of Commons and were passed in this House 
     <lb/>without any discussion or any explanation 
     <lb/>whatever ; they were passed through in such 
     <lb/>a silent and secret way that even the " Han<lb break="no"/>sard " reporters did not discover that they 
     <lb/>had been before the House for considera<lb break="no"/>tion. I find that, according to the journals, 
     <lb/>the Senate amendments to this Bill came 
     <lb/>up for consideration on the 26th June, 1894, 
     <lb/>and were agreed to without any amend<lb break="no"/>ment. In the "Hansard" of 26th June, 
     <lb/>1894, there is no reference whatever to the 
     <lb/>North-west Territories Representation Act, 
     <lb/>and while, no doubt. the hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>the Interior must have moved that the 
     <lb/>House go into committee on these amend<lb break="no"/>ments, there is no record of it whatever.<lb/>As I say, the thing was done in such a way<lb/>that there was not single member of the 
     <lb/>House, unless he had some notice of it from 
     <lb/>the Government, who knew anything of this 
     <lb/>most vital, this most momentous change 
     <lb/>having been made. I must say that I was 
     <lb/>entirely ignorant of it, and I fancy that 
     <lb/>no members of the House were aware of 
     <lb/>it, apart from those coming from the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories who had inspired this, and who had 
     <lb/>taken this means of having it done, of hav<lb break="no"/>ing the amendments made in the Senate, 
     <lb/>in a body that had nothing to do with this Â  
     <lb/>question, taking good care that no explana<lb break="no"/>tion should be made of the matter in this 
     <lb/>House, taking good care that no opportunity 
     <lb/>should be given to members of this House 
     <lb/>to show how outrageous the change was. 
     <lb/>They no doubt knew that this was going 
     <lb/>through the House, but I fancy, apart from 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <cb/>
      
      
     those few interested ones, and apart from 
     <lb/>
     the members (if the Government, no mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this House had any idea that any 
     <lb/>
     such change had been made. I myself 
     <lb/>
     heard of it during the dying hours of last 
     <lb/>
     session. It appeared that in making the 
     <lb/>
     changes, the hon. Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     had overlooked some minor matters which 
     <lb/>
     also required to be changed, and in 1895 he 
     <lb/>
     brought in a Bill to correct those minor de<lb break="no"/>fects, and it was upon the discussion of that 
     <lb/>
     Bill, and in fact only after that Bill had pass<lb break="no"/>ed its second reading, had gone through com<lb break="no"/>mittee, and was ready for the third read<lb break="no"/>ing, that some members on this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House discovered, upon looking into the 
     <lb/>
     matter, that this vital change had been 
     <lb/>
     made. A very strong appeal was made to 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior not to force the 
     <lb/>
     amendments through, but he paid no atten<lb break="no"/>tion to that appeal, and he placed on the 
     <lb/>
     statute-book the most outrageous piece of 
     <lb/>
     legislation. Mr. Speaker, that has ever been 
     <lb/>
     enacted by this House of Commons, and 
     <lb/>
     I think in saying that I am saying a good 
     <lb/>
     deal. However, I intend to prove every 
     <lb/>
     word of it, because I say that the legisla<lb break="no"/>tion is not any clearer or more definite than 
     <lb/>
     if the House had passed a section and 
     <lb/>
     added it to the Northwest Territories Re<lb break="no"/>presentation Act, providing that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the day should have the power 
     <lb/>
     to nominate and elect for the four consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies in the Territories, such men as they 
     <lb/>
     thought proper to represent those four con<lb break="no"/>stituencies. Now. in order to justify that 
     <lb/>
     statement it will be necessary for me to 
     <lb/>
     show, and I shall do so as briefly as I can, 
     <lb/>
     just what the law was prior to 1894, and 
     <lb/>
     what the law is to-day in regard to this 
     <lb/>
     matter. Prior to 1894. there was a voters' 
     <lb/>
     list in the Territories. But that voters' list 
     <lb/>
     was really of no account, because on elec<lb break="no"/>tion day it was possible for any person 
     <lb/>
     otherwise entitled to vote, to get his name 
     <lb/>
     added to the voters' list by the deputy re<lb break="no"/>turning officer; and the only object as ex<lb break="no"/>plained by the hon. member for West As<lb break="no"/>siniboia (Mr. Davin) when we were dis<lb break="no"/>cussing that Bill in 1894, of having a 
     <lb/>
     voters' list at all, was to save time, by pre<lb break="no"/>venting the necessity of swearing every one 
     <lb/>
     that came up, and to make it possible to 
     <lb/>
     poll all the votes at a particular polling 
     <lb/>
     division. Apart from that, the voters' list 
     <lb/>
     was of no use whatever. I myself believed, 
     <lb/>
     at that time that it did not matter at that 
     <lb/>
     time particularly, because there was always 
     <lb/>
     the right for a voter whose name had been 
     <lb/>
     omitted from that list, to have his name 
     <lb/>
     added to the list by the deputy returning 
     <lb/>
     officer. Now, that list is prepared in this 
     <lb/>
     way: Section 28 of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories Representation Act, as amended by 
     <lb/>chapter 10 of the Statutes of 1888, provides 
     <lb/>that the Governor General in Council may 
     <lb/>appoint enumerators for each polling 
     <lb/>division, and if hedoes not do so, the re<lb break="no"/>turning otficer, with the assistance of any 
     <lb/>

     justice of the peace. or notary public, and 
     <lb/>
     two electors, is obliged to appoint these 
     <lb/>
     enumerators. That is, instead of having, as 
     <lb/>
     we have in the Dominion Franchise Act, 
     <lb/>
     a revising officer for the whole constituency, 
     <lb/>
     an enumerator is appointed for each polling 
     <lb/>
     division when an election comes on. These 
     <lb/>
     enumerators, of course. are only appointed 
     <lb/>
     in case of an election, and they proceed to 
     <lb/>
     their duties as soon as the proclamation is 
     <lb/>
     issued for the election. Section 20 provides 
     <lb/>
     that the enumerator, as soon as he is ap<lb break="no"/>pointed, shall take an oath of office and 
     <lb/>
     proceed to make the list. The enumerator 
     <lb/>
    is appointed by the Government, and in 
     <lb/>default of an appointment by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. the returning officer is obliged, 
     <lb/>with the assistance of a justice of 
     <lb/>the peace and two electors, to make the 
     <lb/>appointment, so that there must be an 
     <lb/>enumerator for every polling division. It 
     <lb/>may be that an enumerator may act for 
     <lb/>more than one polling division. Then he 
     <lb/>goes on, by section 29, as amended in 1888, 
     <lb/>and compiles the list. Then by section 30:

     <lb/>
     completes the list eight days before polling 
     <lb/>
     day. and posts up two of these lists in two 
     <lb/>
     of the most public places. Then section 31 
     <lb/>
     is the section which provides for revision, 
     <lb/>
     and I shall read that section to the House, 
     <lb/>
     and ask what protection there is to any

     one in a revision conducted under the pro<lb break="no"/>vision of this section :

     If any enumerator, at any time after posting

     <lb/>
     is fully satisfied, from representations made to

     Now, Mr. Speaker, in this voters' list, that 
     <lb/>
    is all the protection there is. Eight days. 
     <lb/>before the election day this man completes Â  Â Â  Â  
     <lb/>a list. he posts it up in two places, and 
     <lb/>then, by the Senate amendment, if at any 
     <lb/>time up to within two days of the polling 
     <lb/>day, that is six days after it is posted up. 
     <lb/>and during those six days, he gets any 
     <lb/>credible person to tell him that there is 
     <lb/>a name that ought to be on the list, he 
     <lb/>may put it on : and if any credible person 
     <lb/>informs him that there is some name on 
     <lb/>the list that ought to be struck off, he may 
     <lb/>
   
   
            <cb/>
        
        
     strike it off. That. Mr. Speaker, is all the 
     <lb/>
     protection there is to the opponents of the 
     <lb/>
     Government in these four constituencies, in 
     <lb/>
     the case of an election. Eight days before 
     <lb/>
     the election day the list is made, made by 
     <lb/>
     a man appointed by the (Government. Any<lb break="no"/>body, Tom, Dick and Harry. the most disre<lb break="no"/>putable man in the community, if they like, 
     <lb/>
     they can appoint. There is no restriction 
     <lb/>
     as to whom they may appoint. They may 
     <lb/>
     send in non-residents. the hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior may take Some of the charac<lb break="no"/>ters that the party keep down hereâ€”I do 
     <lb/>
     not know that they have got so many up 
     <lb/>
     thereâ€”they may send them into the, Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, one for each polling division. and 
     <lb/>
     ask them to make a list eight days before 
     <lb/>
     election. That list may have four names 
     <lb/>
     on it, it may have one name on it. possibly 
     <lb/>
     he may not find a single Voter in the con<lb break="no"/>stituency, or it may have twenty names on 
     <lb/>
     it; there is no limit. He is obliged to take 
     <lb/>
     no application. No elector has the right 
     <lb/>
     to go and make a statutory declaration and 
     <lb/>
     have his name put upon the list. The 
     <lb/>
    agent of the Government may conduct him<lb break="no"/>self without the slightest restriction or limi<lb break="no"/>tation. He can put on every Conservative. 
     <lb/>This man goes into the polling division, and 
     <lb/>he can go to the candidate and ask him: 
     <lb/>Do you think you have any supporters in 
     <lb/>polling division No. 5 ? If so, give 
     <lb/>me the names of those supporters. 
     <lb/>And having got the names of those 
     <lb/>supporters. he puts them upon the list. 
     <lb/>Then he posts it up eight days before 
     <lb/>election day, and during six days an elector, 
     <lb/>if he could not find out where the list was 
     <lb/>posted up, because there was no means of 
     <lb/>telling where it was posted, for all the Act 
     <lb/>says is that it must be posted in two of the 
     <lb/>most prominent placesâ€”and in many of the 
     <lb/>polling divisions of the Territories there is 
     <lb/>no polling place, except possibly a post office 
     <lb/>and in some cases there is no place that 
     <lb/>you could call the most public place except, at 
     <lb/>the corner of a fence. according to the mean<lb break="no"/>ing of the Actâ€”the elector could go and ask 
     <lb/>to have his name put on the list. But the 
     <lb/>official can laugh. and say. "I will put 
     <lb/>your name on the list ,' but he need not do 
     <lb/>it. There is no means of finding out whe<lb break="no"/>ther the name has been put on the list or 
     <lb/>not until the man goes to vote on election 
     <lb/>day, and if the name is not on the list, 
     <lb/>there is no possible remedy. because after 
     <lb/>the list is completed two days before polling 
     <lb/>day, it is absolutely final. Section 46 of 
     <lb/>the Act provides that every voter shall be<lb/>entitled to vote whose name is on the voters' 
     <lb/>list, and if a man is not on the list 
     <lb/>he cannot vote. I should like to ask 
     <lb/>politicians whom I see around me on both 
     <lb/>Sides of the House if they would want 
     <lb/>anything betterâ€”if they were prepared to 
     <lb/>use it, but I do not suppose any hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this House would do so, although 
     <lb/>candidates to the next House might take 
     <lb/>advantage of itâ€”to use than a snap of that 
     <lb/>

     kind with which to carry an election. It

     simply means that the Government has the

     power to nominate and elect those four mem<lb break="no"/>bers.

     <persName ref="pers:MART1">Mr. MARTIN</persName>. On this side of the House 
     <lb/>
     the Franchise Act of the Dominion has been 
     <lb/>
     very much opposed. It has been opposed 
     <lb/>
     for this reason, that we do not believe it, 
     <lb/>
     is right for the Government to appoint an 
     <lb/>
     otiicer of their own to make up the voters 
     <lb/>
     list. But let me refer to the protection there 
     <lb/>
     is under the Franchise Act so far as get<lb break="no"/>ting names on the list is concerned. Sec<lb break="no"/>tion 15 of the Act provides that the revising 
     <lb/>
     officer shall on 1st August prepare to com<lb break="no"/>mence to make his list. He continues to 
     <lb/>
     make up that list up to 1st October. I am 
     <lb/>
     taking the Act as it is at present: it has 
     <lb/>
     been changed in regard to time, but there 
     <lb/>
     has always been an opportunity to add 
     <lb/>
     names during the two months of September 
     <lb/>
     and October, when the revising officer is 
     <lb/>
     supposed to be in his office ready to take 
     <lb/>
     applications, and in fact he is bound to take 
     <lb/>
     them if they are properly sworn to and 
     <lb/>
     placed before him. Every elector in the 
     <lb/>
     constituency has the opportunity of know<lb break="no"/>ing that, according to the law. on let August 
     <lb/>
     â€”it was in 1894 when the general list was 
     <lb/>
     made upâ€”the revising officer in each consti<lb break="no"/>tuency commences to prepare the list. On 
     <lb/>
     1st October the list is closed. It. is 
     <lb/>
     immediately printed. It is then posted 
     <lb/>
     in various places; copies are sent to the 
     <lb/>
     defeated candidate. to the sitting member. 
     <lb/>
     to the different officials throughout the 
     <lb/>
     constituency and every man can see, if he 
     <lb/>
     will take the trouble to go over the list 
     <lb/>
     and examine it, whether his name is on the 
     <lb/>
     list. If he finds that his name is not on 
     <lb/>
     that list, a reasonable delay is granted in 
     <lb/>
     order that he may get his name placed 
     <lb/>
     there, because after the list has been posted 
     <lb/>
     the revising officer holds the court of re<lb break="no"/>vision. which must be held at least five 
     <lb/>
     weeks after the closing of the list. Note 
     <lb/>
     the difference in time. Weeks and months 
     <lb/>
     in the one case; days. hours and minutes 
     <lb/>
     in the other. Then any person whose name 
     <lb/>
     is not there may put in his appeal. if he 
     <lb/>
     gets it in within two weeks before the 
     <lb/>
     day of revision. He goes there and 
     <lb/>
     gives his evidence and after all these 
     <lb/>
     proceedings have taken place the judge gives 
     <lb/>
     notice that he will make up the list finally. 
     <lb/>
     and both parties have a right to be present. 
     <lb/>
     So far as time is concerned, an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     is given, under the Dominion Franchise Act. 
     <lb/>
     for both sides to be present and to find 
     <lb/>
     out what is going on. These are not the 
     <lb/>
     objections made by the. Liberals; the main 
     <lb/>
     objection taken is to the great power ex<lb break="no"/>ercised by these revising officers and their 
     <lb/>
     appointment by the Government. But in 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
        
        
     the Territories there is no protection of the 
     <lb/>
     kind afforded by the Dominion Franchise 
     <lb/>
     Act. There is nothing done until the elec<lb break="no"/>tion almost comes on, and the first the elec<lb break="no"/>tors know what is going on is eight days 
     <lb/>
     before the day they are called on to vote. 
     <lb/>
     Many of them may be away. you can never 
     <lb/>
     count on having all the. electors in the 
     <lb/>
     constituency during the eight days preceding 
     <lb/>
     an election. But that is the only chance 
     <lb/>
     given them. If they can find those two pub<lb break="no"/>lic places where the lists are postedâ€”because 
     <lb/>
     there is no provision for sending the lists 
     <lb/>
     to any one, even to the defeated candidate, 
     <lb/>
     and the people have no means of finding out 
     <lb/>
     anything in regard to it, for the enumerator 
     <lb/>
     has no office and there is no means of find<lb break="no"/>ing himâ€”names may perhaps be added. But 
     <lb/>
     the list may be made up in Toronto, so far 
     <lb/>
     as the law is concerned. and indeed there 
     <lb/>
     is nothing in the law to prevent the prepara<lb break="no"/>tion of the whole list for the. Territories 
     <lb/>
     in an office in this building. All that is ne<lb break="no"/>cessary, so far as the Act is concerned. is to 
     <lb/>
     get some one to put up the lists in two places 
     <lb/>
     in each polling division in the Territories. 
     <lb/>
     But if that is not done, there is no penalty 
     <lb/>
     for failing, to do it. Eight days before the 
     <lb/>
     election the lists are stuck up, and then for 
     <lb/>
     six days an elector (and the House will re<lb break="no"/>member that polling divisions in the North<lb break="no"/>west are frequently larger than a county in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario), if by some chance he learns that 
     <lb/>
     the list has been posted in some place, may 
     <lb/>
     travel fifteen or twenty miles. and he may 
     <lb/>
     find that the list has been torn down in the 
     <lb/>
     meantime. In fact. the enumerator himself 
     <lb/>
     may tear it down immediately after he has 
     <lb/>
     put it up, for there is nothing in the law to 
     <lb/>
     prevent it. The list having been printed and 
     <lb/>
     published throughout the constituency, 
     <lb/>
     there is no possibility of the elector being 
     <lb/>
     able to get his name placed there. 
     <lb/>
     In this case what is the provision ? The 
     <lb/>
     provision is that he could go and ask the 
     <lb/>
     enumerator to have his name on ; that is all. 
     <lb/>
     The enumerator is not bound to put his name 
     <lb/>
     on, and if he does not put his name on the 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate elector has no means whatever 
     <lb/>
     of finding out that it has been left off; ex<lb break="no"/>cept that he goes on polling day, and after 
     <lb/>
     having driven again fifteen or twenty miles 
     <lb/>
     he finds that this enumerator has obeyed 
     <lb/>
     the instructions he received from those who 
     <lb/>
     appointed him and has not put his name on 
     <lb/>
     the list. Mr. Speaker, can it be imagined 
     <lb/>
     that a Government boasting of their strength 
     <lb/>
     as this Government has done during all 
     <lb/>
     these years, deriding the Opposition for 
     <lb/>
     their ill-success at the election, with a ma<lb break="no"/>jority in the House at the time they passed 
     <lb/>
     this Act of 55 or 60; can you imagine this 
     <lb/>
     Government being reduced to the extremity 
     <lb/>
     of passing an Act of Parliament for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of stealing from us four seats in 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories, in a part of 
     <lb/>
     Canada which has never yet returned a 
     <lb/>
     Liberal to Parliament? The Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior had been up in that country and 
     <lb/>
 
 
            <pb n="531" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1896-01-23_Page_00531.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">531</fw>
            <fw type="running">[COMMONS]</fw> <fw type="num">532</fw>
       
       
     he had driven through it. He found that the 
     <lb/>
     prestige of the Government had gone, and 
     <lb/>
     that the people there were only waiting 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity of voting against the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment representatives, and so he came to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that unless he passed some 
     <lb/>
     Act of this kind, every member from the 
     <lb/>
    North-west Territories would be a supporter 
     <lb/>of the leader of the Opposition. But even 
     <lb/>then you would have thought that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would have some honour and some 
     <lb/>decency in the matter, and that if they 
     <lb/>were prepared to pass an Act of this out<lb break="no"/>rageous character they would have had at 
     <lb/>least the decency to explain in the House 
     <lb/>in a manly, straightforward way, that they 
     <lb/>did intend to steal these constituencies and 
     <lb/>give us an opportunity of discussing and 
     <lb/>objecting to it. But, no ; the Minister intro<lb break="no"/>duces the Bill without a word. He puts it 
     <lb/>through the House and then he gets some<lb break="no"/>body in the Senate, a body which has no<lb break="no"/>thing to do with the matter, to sneak in 
     <lb/>these amendments so vital and so important, 
     <lb/>and he brings it back here and puts it 
     <lb/>through without the slightest word of ex<lb break="no"/>planation. The hon. gentleman referred in 
     <lb/>another debate to the Manitoba Act in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the elections. Let us look at the 
     <lb/>Manitoba Act and see if there is anything 
     <lb/>in it like this: That Act provides that the 
     <lb/>voters' lists shall be made up from time to 
     <lb/>time when the Government sees fit, and that 
     <lb/>when the voters' lists are to be revised a 
     <lb/>general proclamation is to issue appointing 
     <lb/>a registration clerk for each electoral dis<lb break="no"/>trict in the province. That proclamation 
     <lb/>fixes the day for the closing of the lists, 
     <lb/>which day shall be not less than four weeks 
     <lb/>from the date of the proclamation. During 
     <lb/>these four weeks every elector has an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of sending to that registration 
     <lb/>clerk. a sworn declaration showing that he 
     <lb/>is entitled to vote, and if the registration 
     <lb/>clerk does not put upon the list every one 
     <lb/>of those persons whd furnishes him with a 
     <lb/>proper declaration, he is subject to a heavy 
     <lb/>penalty. After the lists are closed they are 
     <lb/>printed and circulated. Copies are sent to 
     <lb/>defeated candidates at the previous election, 
     <lb/>to the sitting members. to every mayor, 
     <lb/>councillor, alderman and reeve in the' con<lb break="no"/>stituency and to every postmaster. They 
     <lb/>are put up in every school house, and every 
     <lb/>post office, and every municipal office, and 
     <lb/>then there is a revision. A revising officer 
     <lb/>is appointed who must be either a judge or 
     <lb/>a barrister of at least three years standing. 
     <lb/>These lists must be published and posted 
     <lb/>up at least thirty days before the day ap<lb break="no"/>pointed for the final court revision, 
     <lb/>every one has an opportunity, just as they 
     <lb/>have under the Dominion Franchise Act, 
     <lb/>of putting in their appeals. as long as they 
     <lb/>get them in five days before the day for 
     <lb/>the final revision. Then an open court is 
     <lb/>held, and after that the list is completed 
     <lb/>and is published. Twenty-five copies are 
     <lb/>sent to the defeated candidate, twenty-five 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <cb/>
       
       
     copies to the sitting member, and two copies 
     <lb/>
     to every municipal officer in the province. 
     <lb/>
     These are also posted up in the most public 
     <lb/>
     way all over the province. Therefore, under 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion Act and under the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     Act, which the hon. gentleman criticized 
     <lb/>
     in another connection, there is the most 
     <lb/>
     ample opportunity for every man to get his 
     <lb/>
     name upon the list, unless some of the 
     <lb/>
     officers commit a fraud. But, in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, I say that there is no 
     <lb/>
     opportunity, there is no possible chance of 
     <lb/>
     a man getting his name upon the list unless 
     <lb/>
     the enumerator is willing to put him 
     <lb/>
     upon the list. Now. Mr. Speaker, it is well 
     <lb/>
     known by the Government, and also, I think, 
     <lb/>
     generally in this House, that the North-west 
     <lb/>
     Assembly is composed very largely of Con<lb break="no"/>servatives. I shall, with your permission, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, read a resolution which that body pass<lb break="no"/>ed upon this vcry subject; a subject, it is 
     <lb/>
     true, that was not particularly within their 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction, but a subject in which each 
     <lb/>
     one of them was interested as a citizen of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, and one in which they felt 
     <lb/>
     there was such a strong public interest in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories that they were justified in 
     <lb/>
     passing this very forcible resolution in regard 
     <lb/>
     to the matter. The following resolution was 
     <lb/>
     moved by Mr. Insinger, and passed unani<lb break="no"/>mously :â€”

     Whereas under the " North-west Territories Re<lb break="no"/>presentation Act" the requirements for elec<lb break="no"/>tors in the territories to be allowed to vote at 
     <lb/>
     Dominion elections differ from the require<lb break="no"/>ments for electors in the provinces, inasmuch 
     <lb/>
     as they are not based on the provisions of the

     " Electoral Franchise Act ;"

     <lb/>
     are to be made by enumerators appointed either 
     <lb/>
     by the Governor in Council or by the return<lb break="no"/>ing officer, conjointly with any two justices of 
     <lb/>
     the peace, or with one justice of the peace and

     <lb/>
     1895, all electors having the qualifications of 
     <lb/>
     such were allowed to vote independently of the 
     <lb/>
     fact, if they were on such list of voters or not ;

            <p>
     And whereas in all elections in the Territories, 
     <lb/>
     both territorial and Dominion, the principle of 
     <lb/>
     allowing a voter's name to be put on the list. 
     <lb/>
     up to the moment of voting prevailed up to 
     <lb/>
     1894;Â  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And whereas such principle was reailirmed by 
     <lb/>
     the legislative assembly of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories in their "Territories Elections Ordin<lb break="no"/>ance " of 1894, in which, moreover, the assem<lb break="no"/>bly did not think it advisable to make provis<lb break="no"/>ions for either voters' lists or lists of voters ;

            <p>
     And whereas experience at the general election 
     <lb/>
     for the assembly held in the year 1894 showed 
     <lb/>
     such system to be admirably adapted to the 
     <lb/>
     needs of these sparsely-settled territories ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And whereas by the Acts to amend the North<lb break="no"/>west Representation Act, passed in the 57-58 
     <lb/>
     year and 58-59 year, Victoria, the list of voters 
     <lb/>
     made by enumerators will have the same force 
     <lb/>
     as a voters' list prepared under the provisions

     same safeguards to the rights of electors as

     <lb/>
     as 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (1) They are necessarily hurriedly prepared 
     <lb/>
     by enumerators between the time of the 
     <lb/>
     receipt of the writ for election and a week 
     <lb/>
     before the day of polling ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) The time allowed to electors or their 
     <lb/>
     agents to ascertain if their names are on 
     <lb/>
     such list is, taken in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     distances generally to be travelled in the 
     <lb/>
     territories, and with the fact that no fixed 
     <lb/>
     residences are appointed for such enumer<lb break="no"/>ators, insufficient for the purpose ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (3) The enumerator is the absolute judge of 
     <lb/>
     the right of an elector to be on such list, 
     <lb/>
     and he can put on or strike off names till 
     <lb/>
     within two days of the polling day without 
     <lb/>
     notice from or to such electors ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (4) There is no appeal from the decision of 
     <lb/>
     the enumerator either to a revising officer?

     or to a judge:

            <p>
     Therefore, in the opinion of this assembly, it is 
     <lb/>
     desirable that the " North-west Territories Re<lb break="no"/>presentation Act" be further amended so as 
     <lb/>
     to either adopt the system provided for in the 
     <lb/>
     " Territories Election Ordinances," or to bring 
     <lb/>
     into effect the provisions regarding voters' 
     <lb/>
     lists of the " Electoral Franchise Act."

            <p>
     Among the members of the assembly who 
     <lb/>
     supported that resolution, which recapitu<lb break="no"/>lates very well the different points which 
     <lb/>
     I have alleged against this outrage, is Mr. 
     <lb/>
    Haultain, who is the Premier of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, and the nominated candidate on 
     <lb/>the Government side for the constituency 
     <lb/>of Alberta at the present time. In fact, it 
     <lb/>was at his suggestion that it was proposed; 
     <lb/>that the law should be re-enacted as it was 
     <lb/>before. What the assembly ask for is one 
     <lb/>of three thingsâ€”first, that the law should 
     <lb/>be re-enacted as it was before ; second. that 
     <lb/>the Territories Franchise Act. should be 
     <lb/>adopted ; third, that the Electoral Franchise 
     <lb/>Act of the Dominion should be brought in<lb break="no"/>to force in the Territories. Of course, it; 
     <lb/>is quite out of the question to attempt, at 
     <lb/>this late day to bring into force the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Franchise Act for the coming elec<lb break="no"/>tions; so that the recommendations of the 
     <lb/>assembly narrow themselves down to thei 
     <lb/>othersâ€”either to have their own Franchise 
     <lb/>Act, or to have the old Act as it was. I 
     <lb/>understand that it is suggested as an objec<lb break="no"/>tion to the Act as it was passed that it 
     <lb/>afforded more or less opportunity for; 
     <lb/>fraudulent voting. Now, whether there was 
     <lb/>opportunity for it, or not, I can say truth<lb break="no"/>fully and I think the members from the 
     <lb/>Territories will agree with meâ€”that there 
     <lb/>has not been, to any appreciable extent, 
     <lb/>any fraud in elections there. There has 
     <lb/>been no complaint on the floor of this House, 
     <lb/>so far as I have heard, from members re<lb break="no"/>presenting constituencies in the Territories, 
     <lb/>of the law working in that direction. There 
     <lb/>is no doubt that it is a very crude law. It 
     <lb/>is certainly not a law that should be allow<lb break="no"/>ed to stand ; but the law that has been sub<lb break="no"/>
         
         
            <cb/>
        
        
        stituted for it will bear no comparison with 
     <lb/>
     it whatever. If the Government came to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that there was too much 
     <lb/>
     opportunity for persons swearing falsely 
     <lb/>
     that they were entitled to vote, they should, 
     <lb/>
     in 1894, have applied the Dominion Fran<lb break="no"/>chise Act to the Territories. Not having 
     <lb/>
     been prepared to do that, they cannot be 
     <lb/>
     allowed to use this flimsy pretext for the 
     <lb/>
     outrage they committed. I am glad to 
     <lb/>
     notice that the hon. member for West As<lb break="no"/>siniboia (Mr. Davin) apparently takes the 
     <lb/>
     same view of the Government's conduct as 
     <lb/>
     I do, because he has also introduced a Bill 
     <lb/>
     into this House, which has received its first 
     <lb/>
     reading, in exactly the same direction as 
     <lb/>
     mine. My Bill proposes to put the law back 
     <lb/>
     as it was before, that is, to re-enact section 
     <lb/>
     44 of chapter 7 -of the Revised Statutes, 
     <lb/>
     which reads as follows :â€”

     Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to know 
     <lb/>
     from the hon. Minister of the Interior whe<lb break="no"/>ther the Government committed this out<lb break="no"/>rage of their own accord, or whether they 
     <lb/>were asked to do so by any member from 
     <lb/>the Territories in the House at the present 
     <lb/>time. We may take it for granted, that the 
     <lb/>hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>Davin) did not request or advise the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to do so, because he comes here 
     <lb/>and asks to have the same changes made 
     <lb/>that I am asking for. I do not suppose 
     <lb/>that the hon. member for East Assiniboia 
     <lb/>(Mr. McDonald) would request the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to make a change in this direction, 
     <lb/>because he has been discarded by his party 
     <lb/>in his constituency, and another man sub<lb break="no"/>stituted for him as the candidate for the 
     <lb/>coming election. So far as the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Alberta (Mr. Davis) is concerned, 
     <lb/>I am sure I am-quite safe in saying that 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman would never be a party to 
     <lb/>such a disgraceful attempt to steal con<lb break="no"/>stituencies. Then, the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Saskatchewan (Mr. Macdowall) is the only 
     <lb/>member left representing a North-west con<lb break="no"/>stituency. I do not knowâ€”I should imagine 
     <lb/>that hon. gentleman would scarcely be 
     <lb/>guilty of forwarding or asking for legisla<lb break="no"/>tion the effect of which must be to give 
     <lb/>him a most unfair advantage over his 
     <lb/>opponent. The Government have always 
     <lb/>expressed themselves as being confident 
     <lb/>of the result of the elections in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, and I would ask hon. members sup<lb break="no"/>porting the Government from other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces what they think of their expres<lb break="no"/>sion of confidence when they are reduced 
     <lb/>to extremities such, as this. Will any one 
     <lb/>believe that they have any confidence what<lb break="no"/>ever in having the slightest particle of a

     chance in any one of these constituencies, 
     <lb/>
     if they are obliged to put through this 
     <lb/>
     House in such a secret way, without any 
     <lb/>
     discussion or explanation, without any 
     <lb/>
     chance of their opponents knowing what 
     <lb/>
     they were doing, a Bill of this kindâ€”an 
     <lb/>
     Act which allows men nominated by them<lb break="no"/>selves to go into a polling division and 
     <lb/>
     make up once for all a list from which 
     <lb/>
     they may exclude every likely opponent 
     <lb/>
     from being a candidate, and from which 
     <lb/>
     list there is no possible appeal. Why, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I fancy that, outside of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and outside of any member from 
     <lb/>
     the Territories, if such can be found, who 
     <lb/>
     has urged and supported legislation of this 
     <lb/>
     kind, there is not on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House a single member who will justify 
     <lb/>
     and support the Government in keeping 
     <lb/>
     upon the statute-book such an outrage as 
     <lb/>
     this. This is the last session of this House; 
     <lb/>
     it can only last a certain time ; and, so far 
     <lb/>
     as I am concerned, if my voice does not 
     <lb/>
     give out, I will certainly, so long as I am 
     <lb/>
     able to speak, stand up here day after day 
     <lb/>
      and protest against this iniquitous outrage, 
     <lb/>
     and prevent, so far as my efforts can, the

     <lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
       
       
     after the people had learnt of this amend<lb break="no"/>ment. They had no knowledge of it before 
     <lb/>
     last session. I have conversed with gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen there on both sides of politics, and 
     <lb/>
     was requested by them to ask for this 
     <lb/>
     change in the law, and I am satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Minister of the Interior has few, 
     <lb/>
     if any, supporters in the Territories who 
     <lb/>
     will justify him in this attempt to take 
     <lb/>
     away from the people their right to vote. 
     <lb/>
     If the hon. gentleman's policy is acceptable 
     <lb/>
     to the people there, let him depend upon 
     <lb/>
     that alone. Let him go before the people 
     <lb/>
     with his policy ; let him give us the op<lb break="no"/>portunity of getting our names on the list ; 
     <lb/>
     let him give us the right to voteâ€”and then 
     <lb/>
     if he is supported by the people, all right ; 
     <lb/>
     if he is condemned, let him take his con<lb break="no"/>demnation. But let him not attempt to 
     <lb/>
     get away from the votes of the people ; 
     <lb/>
     let him not attempt to hide his iniquity in 
     <lb/>
     a parliamentary election of members for 
     <lb/>
     those four constituencies. It is an outrage 
     <lb/>
     which has never been perpetrated even in 
     <lb/>
     this House of Commons, and I am satisfied 
     <lb/>
     it could not have been perpetrated here, if 
     <lb/>
     the members had known what was suggest<lb break="no"/>ed to them, and what was being enacted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. In answer to the very furi<lb break="no"/>ous attack made by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Winnipeg (Mr. Martin), it seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     it is well for the House and you, Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er, to be put in possession of the facts, and 
     <lb/>
     not take for gospel what the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has said. He has seen fit to impugn the 
     <lb/>
     honour and patriotism of this Government, 
     <lb/>
     and my own personal honour in this mat<lb break="no"/>ter, not only as a member of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but as a member of the House, be<lb break="no"/>cause he declared that I had sneaked 
     <lb/>
     through this House a clause in the Bill 
     <lb/>
     which came from the Senate. What are 
     <lb/>
     the facts ? They are that in 1894 I introduced 
     <lb/>
     into this House a Bill to amend the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories Representation Act. That 
     <lb/>
     Bill went through this House and had its 
     <lb/>
     third reading. I ask if the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     will find upon record that he took any part 
     <lb/>
     in the discussion of that Bill, during its three 
     <lb/>
     readings. He will find that he did not. 
     <lb/>
     He will find that he did not give any atten<lb break="no"/>tion to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MART1">Mr. MARTIN</persName>. It had not this clause 
     <lb/>
     in it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. Did you, or did you not read 
     <lb/>
     the Bill ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MART1">Mr. MARTIN</persName>. I did.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. So we have the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man on record that he did look at the Bill 
     <lb/>
     and knew what it was when it went through 
     <lb/>
     the Senate. The hon. gentleman has accus<lb break="no"/>ed me of going to the Senate and getting 
     <lb/>
     the members of that chamber to put in 
     <lb/>
     this clause, and conniving with them in do<lb break="no"/>ing a wrong to the North-west Territories. 
     <lb/>
     I tell the hon. gentleman and this House 
     <lb/>
     that I never spoke to a Senator, or any<lb break="no"/>

     body else, with reference to this Bill after 
     <lb/>
     it left this House and went to the Senate; 
     <lb/>
     and I was just as ignorant as the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is that the clause was put in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill by the Senate repealing clause 44 un<lb break="no"/>til the Bill came back to this House. When 
     <lb/>
     the Bill came back here, I pointed out to 
     <lb/>
     members of the North-west Territories the 
     <lb/>
     changes made by the Senate, because there 
     <lb/>
     was more than one change, and I was told 
     <lb/>
     by these gentlemen that the changes had 
     <lb/>
     been made at their solicitation.

     <lb/>
     Assiniboia (Mr. McDonald) was the gentle<lb break="no"/>man who informed me, and he told me the

     reason was that in the last elections held 
     <lb/>
     in the North-west Territories this clause 44 
     <lb/>
     gave rise to the committal of per<lb break="no"/>jury by a number of people, who had their 
     <lb/>
     names put on the list without any right.

     I should like to know if that provision does

     not admit of the statement made by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Assiniboia (Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>donald) to me that it opened the door for 
     <lb/>
     wrong-doing ? The hon. gentleman told me

     that in his own electoral division, there 
     <lb/>
     were 150 names put on the list under the 
     <lb/>
     provision of that clause, which would not

     have been there if the men whose names 
     <lb/>
     were on had not perjured themselves by 
     <lb/>
     taking the oath. The hon. gentleman went 
     <lb/>
     further. He did not only charge me with 
     <lb/>
     having connived with some one in the Sen<lb break="no"/>ate in order to have the clause added to 
     <lb/>
     the Bill, but he said that the Bill was not

     took place on that day, so that we may

     ascertain whether or not these amendments

     were sneaked through or whether there was 
     <lb/>
     anything irregular in the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     these amendments that came from the Sen<lb break="no"/>ate were put through this House. We find 
     <lb/>
     that four petitions were presented: we find 
     <lb/>
     that a Bill from the Senate, intituled " An 
     <lb/>
     Act respecting the Speaker of the Senate," 
     <lb/>
     was, according to the Orders. read a third 
     <lb/>
     time, &amp;c., and then we find that the House, 
     <lb/>
     according to order, proceeded to take into 
     <lb/>
     consideration the amendments made by the 
     <lb/>
     Senate to the Bill intituled " An Act further 
     <lb/>
     to amend the North-west Territories Repre<lb break="no"/>sentation Act," and that the same were read 
     <lb/>
     as follows. There was not one amendment 
     <lb/>
     only. but half a dozen, and these were read to 
     <lb/>
     the House in the usual way, and they were 
     <lb/>
     passed through in the usual way. I want 
     <lb/>
     to call the hon. gentleman's particular at<lb break="no"/>tention to the fact that they went through 
     <lb/>
     in the afternoon, so that there was no ex<lb break="no"/>cuse for his not knowing all about them. 
     <lb/>
     He may be frequently absent during the 
     <lb/>
     evening, but these were read in the after<lb break="no"/>noon, and, besides, they were on the Order 
     <lb/>
     paper, so that the hon. gentleman has no 
     <lb/>
     excuse for not knowing about them. And 
     <lb/>
     they were on the Orders of the Day, so 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. gentleman's attention was 
     <lb/>
     called to the matter. Moreover, those 
     <lb/>
     amendments were all spread out upon the

            <p>
     This is the amendment the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man objects to. These amendments 
     <lb/>
     were agreed to by this House. Now, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, this was done in broad 
     <lb/>
     daylight when, I presume, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man was in his seat in the House. The 
     <lb/>
     Votes and Proceedings show that during that 
     <lb/>
     afternoon or evening a division, took place, 
     <lb/>
     and the hon. gentleman's name is recorded 
     <lb/>
     in the division. So the hon. gentleman was 
     <lb/>
     in the House or within the precincts of the 
     <lb/>
     House when these proceedings took place. 
     <lb/>
     Had the hon. gentleman paid the attention 
     <lb/>
     to his legislative duties that he ought to 
     <lb/>
     have paid, he would have known of these 
     <lb/>
     amendments, for he had the same notice of 
     <lb/>
     the amendments that I had. When these 
     <lb/>
     amendments were made I went into them 
     <lb/>
     to ascertain the eiifect of them, because, as 
     <lb/>
     I said before, they were made without my 
     <lb/>
     knowledge. When my attention was called 
     <lb/>
     to the fact that section 44 was amended, 
     <lb/>
     I went to the hon. member for East Assini<lb break="no"/>boia (Mr. McDonald), who, I think, was the 
     <lb/>
     only representative from the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories about at the time, to ascertain what 
     <lb/>
     the facts were, and he explained to me why 
     <lb/>
     the amendment was made in the Senate. 
     <lb/>
     So the hon. gentleman's charge that I was 
     <lb/>
     responsible for that amendment falls to the 
     <lb/>
     ground. That amendment was made by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman in charge of the Bill in the 
     <lb/>
     Senate on the advice of the representatives 
     <lb/>
     in that chamber from the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. I would be quite willing to leave 
     <lb/>
     the matter there but the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     goes further. He seems to wish to make 
     <lb/>
     a little cheap popularity by frequent clap<lb break="no"/>trap discussions of this matter. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman would give the members of this 
     <lb/>
     House to understand that by that simple 
     <lb/>
     amendment we have changed the position of 
     <lb/>
     voters in the North-west Territories and 
     <lb/>
     that the provisions he has read were new. 
     <lb/>
     He seeks to impress the people with 
     <lb/>
     same idea, for in an interview with the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman in the Winnipeg " Tribune," 
     <lb/>
     which was sent to me, the impression is 
     <lb/>
     conveyed that there is something new about 
     <lb/>
     it. Why, Sir, the Act the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has quoted is one of the Acts of 49 Victoria. 
     <lb/>
     Ten years ago thatAct was passed in this 
     <lb/>
     House. So if any injustice was inflicted 
     <lb/>
     upon the people of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, it was inflicted upon them by the 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
 
 
     House of Parliament of which many hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen still in the House were members.

     looked up the debates of the House of that

     time. At all events this is the law. Since 
     <lb/>
     then two elections have been held, and I 
     <lb/>
     fail to find that any of the charges made by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman have been borne out. 
     <lb/>
     I fail to find that either the newspapers or 
     <lb/>
     candidates in the elections have complained 
     <lb/>
     about the way the enumerations were made 
     <lb/>
     up. I was through that country in an elec<lb break="no"/>tion campaign in 1887. 1 saw those lists 
     <lb/>
     there, prepared, as they were, under the 
     <lb/>
     statute and I never heard any complaints, 
     <lb/>
     and we were associated day after day with 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen representing the Opposition. No 
     <lb/>
     discussion at all took place in reference to 
     <lb/>
     the way the lists were being made up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). They were made 
     <lb/>
     up to the day of the election, which cannot 
     <lb/>
     be done now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. The hon. gentleman is mis<lb break="no"/>taken. The hon. member for Winnipeg says 
     <lb/>
     that under the amendment, if names are not 
     <lb/>
     on the list two days before the election they 
     <lb/>
     cannot be got on at all. Under the old law 
     <lb/>
     persons could swear in their names on the 
     <lb/>
     day of the election. That is the real charge. 
     <lb/>
     If he rested the charge there, I would be 
     <lb/>
     satisfied. But he goes further and makes 
     <lb/>
     the charge against the Government that we 
     <lb/>
     are seeking to disfranchise the electors of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Territories by a law that 
     <lb/>
     he would give us to understand was passed 
     <lb/>
     in 1894 or 1895. But the enumeration lists 
     <lb/>
     are made up under a law passed ten years 
     <lb/>
     ago. What are its provisions ? They were 
     <lb/>
     made to suit the peculiar conditions and 
     <lb/>
     requirements of the North-west Territories. 
     <lb/>
     It was well understood by Parliament that 
     <lb/>
     it would not do to apply the provisions of 
     <lb/>
     the Franchise Act to the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. The most suitable law under the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances was passed. In discussing 
     <lb/>
    the provisions of the Act the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>sneers at the idea of the Governor General 
     <lb/>appointing the enumerators, and says that 
     <lb/>disreputable men might be appointed, that 
     <lb/>disreputable men might be sent up from 
     <lb/>here. I think the hon. gentleman reflects 
     <lb/>severely upon the people of the North-west 
     <lb/>Territories. Does the hon. gentleman give 
     <lb/>us to understand by the charge he makes 
     <lb/>that disreputable men prepared the lists 
     <lb/>for the late local elections in Manitoba, I 
     <lb/>do not think that the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>would like to admit that the men who 
     <lb/>prepared the lists in North Winnipeg and 
     <lb/>Brandon City and North Brandon were 
     <lb/>disreputable men. Yet I produced evi<lb break="no"/>dence the other day to show that hundreds 
     <lb/>of men were disfranchised by their names 
     <lb/>being left off the lists. In this case the 
     <lb/>Governor General will do just as he has 
     <lb/>done in the pastsâ€”he will appoint men fit 
     <lb/>for the position.

     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. Who advises the Attorney

     General at Winnipeg to appoint the enu<lb break="no"/>merators under the Manitoba Franchise 
     <lb/>
     Act ? Do they appoint any person opposed

     to the Government or do they appoint their 
     <lb/>
     own friends ? I do not wish the House to 
     <lb/>
     understand that we are going to appoint 
     <lb/>
     Grit enumerators; I do not think the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman expects us to do so. But we 
     <lb/>
     will appoint men capable of performing the 
     <lb/>
     duties assigned to them. I wish to call at<lb break="no"/>tention to the fact that these enumerators 
     <lb/>
     have to take an oath and have to prepare 
     <lb/>
     their lists under the sanction of that oath. 
     <lb/>
     If the hon. gentleman could produce evi<lb break="no"/>dence that, in the elections of 1887 and 1891 
     <lb/>
     enumerators were appointed who proved de<lb break="no"/>relict in their duty, if he could show that 
     <lb/>
     people were disfranchised as he has given 
     <lb/>
     the House to understand, there might be 
     <lb/>
     something in his argument. But I defy 
     <lb/>
     him to produce the slightest proof that any 
     <lb/>
     person has complained, directly or indirectly. 
     <lb/>
     of the preparation of the lists in 1887 and 
     <lb/>
     and 1891. The hon. gentleman does not 
     <lb/>
     give the same credit that I do to his poli<lb break="no"/>tical allies in the North-west Territories. 
     <lb/>
     He has had no experience of those gentle<lb break="no"/>men. I want him to understand that they 
     <lb/>
     are alive and that they have their organiza<lb break="no"/>tions. I speak of what I know.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MART1">Mr. MARTIN</persName>. It did not make the slight<lb break="no"/>est difference in 1887 and 1891, because they 
     <lb/>
     could get their names on the lists on elec<lb break="no"/>tion day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. Why, Sir, I have been engaged 
     <lb/>
     in contests up there, and I do not think 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman took part inthem. and 
     <lb/>
     it seems to me that no man ever fought hard<lb break="no"/>er to get their names upon the list and to 
     <lb/>
     elect their candidate than did our Grit 
     <lb/>
     friends in Eastern and Western Assiniboia, 
     <lb/>
     and the other constituencies. This Act. as 
     <lb/>
     it is now amended. does not give any ad<lb break="no"/>vantage to the supporters of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment as against those who are opposed to 
     <lb/>
     the Government, because the enumerator is 
     <lb/>
     bound to take their names. The only conclu<lb break="no"/>sion I can arrive at. when hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     say, "Oh, oh" is that they have a differ<lb break="no"/>ent experience in preparing the lists to what 
     <lb/>
     I have. Are we to understand that those 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen know about how those lists are 
     <lb/>
     prepared, and that they do not do the square 
     <lb/>
     thing when. they prepare the lists ?â€”because 
     <lb/>
     that is the inference I draw from the re<lb break="no"/>marks made by the hon. gentleman. I take 
     <lb/>
     it that a man who is sworn to do his duty, 
     <lb/>
     will do it, and any opponent of this Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, has under the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     Act, the very some chance of getting his 
     <lb/>
     name upon the list as does any person who 
     <lb/>
     is a supporter of this Government. Now, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman sneered at the enumera<lb break="no"/>tors that would be appointed by the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor General in Council, and shortly after<lb break="no"/>
       
       
            <cb/>
       
       wards he came round and said that of 
     <lb/>
     course he could not object to the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General appointing the friends of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Well, all that the Act presumes 
     <lb/>
     is that the Governor General shall appoint 
     <lb/>
     men who are fit to make up those. lists. 
     <lb/>
     Now what does all this amount to ? It 
     <lb/>
     amounts simply to this, as I said be<lb break="no"/>fore, that the conditions of that country are 
     <lb/>
     not such as to admit of our extending to it 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the Franchise Act. In 
     <lb/>
     1894 I introduced a Bill into this House for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of extending the ballot to the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories, and in that Bill cer<lb break="no"/>tain changes had to be made in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories Representation Act, but 
     <lb/>
     those changes did not affect materially the 
     <lb/>
     mode of the preparation of those lists, other 
     <lb/>
     than the amendment which was made in 
     <lb/>
     the Senate in repealing clause 44. I think 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman will have to make out 
     <lb/>
     a considerably stronger case than he has 
     <lb/>
     made to-day to prove to this House that 
     <lb/>
     any electors in that country will be affect<lb break="no"/>ed in the slightest degree by the changes 
     <lb/>
     that have been made in the Act, because 
     <lb/>
     so far as the appointment of enumerators 
     <lb/>
     is concerned, and so far as the preparation 
     <lb/>
     of the lists is concerned, they will be pre<lb break="no"/>pared as they were in 1887, and as they 
     <lb/>
     were in 1891, and prepared under legislation 
     <lb/>
     that was passed in this House some ten 
     <lb/>
     years ago. So how could the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man. or how can the legislative assembly. 
     <lb/>
     in the petition.the hon. gentleman read, 
     <lb/>
     say that by the Act that was passed last ses<lb break="no"/>sion or the session before, we seek to disfran<lb break="no"/>chise by wholesale the electors of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories ? Sir, the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     threatened, but he had to withdraw the 
     <lb/>
     threat, that he was going to keep this House 
     <lb/>
     here until such time as he accomplished his 
     <lb/>
     purpose. I want to say to the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman that we do not fear his threats. 
     <lb/>
     We are just as desirous of giving to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-west Territories a full 
     <lb/>
     franchise as he is. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     says that I went through that country and 
     <lb/>
     saw the people, and in consequence of my 
     <lb/>
     visit I came to the conclusion that if the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the law remained as they were 
     <lb/>
     we could not expect to get the same re<lb break="no"/>presentation. I want to tell the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman that I do not fear the verdict of 
     <lb/>
     the electors of the North-west Territories.

     it'in the slightest degree. I want to say to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman that remarks such. as 
     <lb/>
     his are very stale. We heard in 1887 that 
     <lb/>
     the whole North-west representation was 
     <lb/>
     going to be opposed to this Government ; we 
     <lb/>
     heard in 1891 that the whole North-west 
     <lb/>
     representation would go against this Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. But as the North-west people did 
     <lb/>
     in 1887, and as they did in 1891, the North<lb break="no"/>west people will do in 1896, and the hon.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. Well, for the Government of 
     <lb/>
     the grand old Conservative party, not a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the hon. gentlemen opposite, 
     <lb/>
     because I am sure the hon. gentleman will 
     <lb/>
     be a considerable number of years older 
     <lb/>
     before he sits upon the Treasury benches, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding his own inclination to get 
     <lb/>
     there. Now, Sir, I say to the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man that the charge he made against me 
     <lb/>
     that this amendment was made by my con<lb break="no"/>niving with the Senate, I have proved to 
     <lb/>
     be untrue. More than that, I had no thought 
     <lb/>
     or idea, when agreeing to the amendment 
     <lb/>
     that was made in the Senate, that it would 
     <lb/>
     affect in the slightest degree the franchise 
     <lb/>
     of the electors of the North-west Territories ; 
     <lb/>
     more than that, the thought never occurred to 
     <lb/>
     me, and has never occurred to me, nor will 
     <lb/>
     it ever occur to me, until the last ballot is 
     <lb/>
     cast, that the North-west Territories will 
     <lb/>
     give any different verdict from the one 
     <lb/>
     they gave in the elections in 1887 and 1891.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Winnipeg (Mr. Martin) has pointed out, 
     <lb/>
     in the speech which he addressed to the 
     <lb/>
     House, the very serious objections that lie 
     <lb/>
     against the law as it stands at this moment. 
     <lb/>
     He has also pointed out the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     disfranchising a very large number of the 
     <lb/>
     electors of the North-west Territories under 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the law as it is. What de<lb break="no"/>fence or answer has the Minister made to 
     <lb/>
     that ? Why, the hon. Minister says that 
     <lb/>
     the law as it stood before these objection<lb break="no"/>able amendments were made, worked satis<lb break="no"/>factorily, and he gives that statement as an 
     <lb/>
     answer to the argument of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     that the law was changed for the worse. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. I said with the one exception. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). Well, the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman did not say that he was prepared 
     <lb/>
    to take away that exception, the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman did not say that he was prepared to 
     <lb/>remove any of the objections which the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Winnipeg made to the law 
     <lb/>as it at present stands. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>did not say one word that can be regarded 
     <lb/>as an argument in defence of the amend<lb break="no"/>ments that were made in 1894 in the Senate, 
     <lb/>and which were allowed to stand in his 
     <lb/>measure of last session. Sir, if he looks at 
     <lb/>the facts as they are stated, what do they 
     <lb/>disclose ? In the first place, the very objec<lb break="no"/>tionable condition of things exists, which 
     <lb/>the hon. gentleman says is to continue, that 
     <lb/>the Government, who stand as one of the 
     <lb/>parties on trial at an election, are to be 
     <lb/>the persons who are to appoint all the offi<lb break="no"/>cers, who are to create the machinery under 
     <lb/>which their trial is to take place. Sir, 
     <lb/>
           
           
            <cb/>
      
      
     there is no analogy between the condition 
     <lb/>
     of things that exists in Ontario and the con<lb break="no"/>dition of things that exists in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. The hon. gentleman said 
     <lb/>
     that we appointed Grits to office where an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity occurs. Why, Sir, has the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Ontarioâ€”and I take that as an 
     <lb/>
     illustrationâ€”provided for the appointment 
     <lb/>
    of their own friends under the Fran<lb break="no"/>chise Act for the preparation of the 
     <lb/>voters' list ? Has the Government of On<lb break="no"/>tario provided for the appointment of the 
     <lb/>returning officers who are to hold the elec<lb break="no"/>tions, when those elections take place 
     <lb/>in that province ? No, Sir, the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Ontario provided by statute that 
     <lb/>certain officers, some of whom may be their 
     <lb/>friends and some of whom may be their 
     <lb/>opponents, are the persons under whose 
     <lb/>authority and responsibility the elections 
     <lb/>are to be held ; but they also provided that 
     <lb/>the preparation of the voters' lists shall be 
     <lb/>in the hands of the municipality, the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of which are elected by the peopIe 
     <lb/>who represent both parties, and the final 
     <lb/>appeal is to the county judge, that is, when 
     <lb/>a new appointment takes place. by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment who sit here. Now, look at the 
     <lb/>condition of things in the North-west. The 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman says that they take care to 
     <lb/>appoint no Grits, and he says His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency makes the appointments, and therefore 
     <lb/>they will be proper appointments. Sir, the 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman might as well refer to the 
     <lb/>Lieutenant-Governor as a conclusive answer 
     <lb/>to the character of appointments every<lb break="no"/>where. His Excellency, it is true, makes 
     <lb/>those appointments, but he does not choose 
     <lb/>the men. The men are chosen by the hon. 
     <lb/>gentlemen ; they are named by the hon. 
     <lb/>gentlemen, and it is upon their responsi<lb break="no"/>bility thatthe appoinnments are made. The 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman may appoint in the North<lb break="no"/>west, as he or his friends have done else<lb break="no"/>where, bankrupts to office in elections, where 
     <lb/>it is known that if improper conduct takes 
     <lb/>place, no prosecution can be successfully 
     <lb/>had against them. That is the position 
     <lb/>which the hon. gentleman and his friends 
     <lb/>have practically taken, and he has referred 
     <lb/>us to His Excellency, whose name ought 
     <lb/>never to have ben dragged into a discussion 
     <lb/>in this House, as a guarantee that the ap<lb break="no"/>pointments will be all right and proper.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. I rise to an explanation. I do 
     <lb/>
     not see why the hon. gentleman should state 
     <lb/>
     that I brought His Excellency's name into 
     <lb/>
     this discussion. I mentioned the name of 
     <lb/>
     the Governor General as given in the Act, 
     <lb/>
     and a child understands that it means the 
     <lb/>
     Governor General in Council. I never men<lb break="no"/>tioned the name of His Excellency.

     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man will see, when he reads the report of 
     <lb/>
     his speech, that I am not misrepresenting 
     <lb/>
     him, and that I am not stating what he

     that by the alteration of the law it placed 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of the enumerator or revising 
     <lb/>
     officer, where there is one, power to disfran<lb break="no"/>chise a portion of the population. Under the 
     <lb/>
     law, as cited, if a man's name is excised 
     <lb/>
    improperly, he could, go before the enumera<lb break="no"/>tor on the day of polling, he could swear 
     <lb/>that he was entitled to have his name on 
     <lb/>the list, he could have it placed on the list 
     <lb/>by the enumerator, and he could there<lb break="no"/>after record his vote. Can he do that<lb/>to-day ? If his name is left off the list, or 
     <lb/>struck off the list, can he go and vote ? 
     <lb/>Everybody knows that he  cannot do so. 
     <lb/>And the hon. gentlemen, by changes made 
     <lb/>by the Senate in a law affecting this House, 
     <lb/>know the position of the matter is this : 
     <lb/>that the party stands in a wholly different 
     <lb/>position from that which he occupied before. 
     <lb/>Why, an unscrupulous enumerator or an un<lb break="no"/>scrupulous revising officer would not under<lb break="no"/>take to excise a name from the list, or leave  
     <lb/>it out after promising to place it there, if 
     <lb/>he thought that the party on the day of 
     <lb/>election would find a fraud had been prac<lb break="no"/>tised, and he could still have his name 
     <lb/>placed on the list and still record his vote. 
     <lb/>There would be no motive under that pro<lb break="no"/>vision of the Act for improper and fraud<lb break="no"/>ulent conduct. But does it stand so to<lb break="no"/>day ; is that the position of the question at<lb/>this moment? No. If a revising officer 
     <lb/>or an enumerator leaves a name off the list,  
     <lb/>and tells the party that he is entitled to 
     <lb/>vote, and that he will place his name on the  
     <lb/>list, and the man goes to the poll and finds 
     <lb/>his name not there, is he entitled to have 
     <lb/>his name on the list and have it then and 
     <lb/>there recorded ? No. He will be told that 
     <lb/>he should have come and had his name add<lb break="no"/>ed two days before. The opportunity is taken  
     <lb/>away ; the temptation to fraud is created for  
     <lb/>the first time, and the list will be not only 
     <lb/>improperly made but it will be full of  
     <lb/>defects, and errors, and omissions, which 
     <lb/>cannot be corrected. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>(Mr. Daly)  has said the position of the 
     <lb/>North-west is peculiar, and that he cannot 
     <lb/>apply there the law as it exists in the older 
     <lb/>provinces of the Dominion. I do not dis<lb break="no"/>pute that such may be the case. It may 
     <lb/>be necessary to make special provision for 
     <lb/>the conditions existing in the Territories ; 
     <lb/>but those should be rational conditions. and 
     <lb/>they should be such as to secure the rights 
     <lb/>and privileges of the electors, and not be 
     <lb/>framed for the purpose of taking them away. 
     <lb/>That is the condition of things now exist<lb break="no"/>ing. Men will lose their right to voteâ€”the 
     <lb/>number of voters will be diminished. On 
     <lb/>whose representation are enumerators or 
     <lb/>revising officers appointed ? Upon the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of the candidates which support 
     <lb/>the Administration, upon the representation 
     <lb/>of gentlemen who for the time being are 
     <lb/>sitting in this House, in so far as they be<lb break="no"/>come candidates again. Is not every officer 
     <lb/>so appointed friendly to them, and though 
     <lb/>the emolument may be small, nevertheless in 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
    

        
        
     that country it may be important, and be 
     <lb/>
     sufficient to place these officers under obliga<lb break="no"/>tions to these men. Will they not undertake 
     <lb/>
     to promote their interest ? Will they not feel 
     <lb/>
     that in looking after friends of the candi<lb break="no"/>dates and neglecting applications made by 
     <lb/>
     opponents, they are not doing an improper 
     <lb/>
     act ? They may feel it is none of their busi<lb break="no"/>ness to see that names of persons hostile 
     <lb/>
     to the Administration are placed on the list. 
     <lb/>
     Was the condition of things such that 
     <lb/>
     the list would be full and fair, and 
     <lb/>
     the election an honest and free ex<lb break="no"/>pression of public opinion ? At all 
     <lb/>
     events, the evil has been enormously 
     <lb/>
     aggravated. Under the pretense of having 
     <lb/>
     an innocent provision added to the law, 
     <lb/>
     serious injustice has been done to a large 
     <lb/>
      section of the population, and power is given 
     <lb/>
     to effect serious frauds against which no 
     <lb/>
     remedy can be applied. You may prosecute 
     <lb/>
     a man elsewhere, if he has property which  
     <lb/>
     you can seize or reach, for the misconduct, 
     <lb/>
     but where you require no security of any 
     <lb/>
     kind, where you attach no penalties of any 
     <lb/>
     sort, the House should be specially careful 
     <lb/>
     to guard the interests, rights and privileges  
     <lb/>
     of the electors of the North-west ; but you 
     <lb/>
     destroy every guard, you throw down every 
     <lb/>
     barrier that stands as an obstacle to fraud 
     <lb/>
     and wrong-doing, and the result is that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite have created a state 
     <lb/>
     of things under the law that will prevent a 
     <lb/>
     free and full expression of the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the electors in that country. That is a con<lb break="no"/>dition that should not exist. It is not credit<lb break="no"/>able to this House if it permits it to stand ; 
     <lb/>
     and it was an indignity to this House, that 
     <lb/>
     such matters which specially concerned its 
     <lb/>
     own rights and privileges and the represen<lb break="no"/>tation of the people there should have been 
     <lb/>
     dealt with primarily in the Senate and not 
     <lb/>
     in this House of Commons. It is clear to 
     <lb/>
     any one who takes the trouble to look at  
     <lb/>
     the law that the law is seriously defective, 
     <lb/>
     that the amendment suggested by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Winnipeg (Mr. Martin) should 
     <lb/>
     be made, and that full opportunity should 
     <lb/>
     be given to have as full and complete a 
     <lb/>
     voters' list in that country as can be pre<lb break="no"/>pared under the circumstances, and that an 
     <lb/>
      honest and fair opportunity should be given 
     <lb/>
      to the people to elect those candidates whom 
     <lb/>
     they prefer.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. DAVIES</persName> (P.E.I.) I think the import<lb break="no"/>ance of the subject is such as to justify me 
     <lb/>
     in calling the attention of the House to it 
     <lb/>
    for a few moments longer, although I am 
     <lb/>free to admit that the hon. gentleman who 
     <lb/>has just preceded me (Mr. Mills) has pre<lb break="no"/>sented it quite as forcibly as I can hope to 
     <lb/>do, and I only plead as an excuse for my 
     <lb/>observations the great importance and se<lb break="no"/>rious character of the Bill before the House. 
     <lb/>I am absolutely certain in my own mind 
     <lb/>that if hon. gentlemen on both sides of the  
     <lb/>House would give time and attention to the  
     <lb/>question before it for a few moments, they

     would all agree that injustice has been done. 
     <lb/>
     I am not going to discuss the ancillary point, 
     <lb/>
     as to whether the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
      was or was not responsible for the change 
     <lb/>
     made. He said he was not, and we accept 
     <lb/>
     his denial. We start out with the fact that 
     <lb/>
     an Act was passed ten years ago for the 
     <lb/>
     preparation of voters' lists in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. The circumstances of the 
     <lb/>
     country are exceptional, and every hon. 
     <lb/>
     member will at once recognize that it was 
     <lb/>
     rather a crude scheme which was proposed 
     <lb/>
     and suggested, but still it was one which 
     <lb/>
     practically worked pretty well. The Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior pledges his own ex<lb break="no"/>perience in the House and his responsibility 
     <lb/>
     as a Minister, that the Act passed ten years 
     <lb/>
     ago worked passably well in two elections 
     <lb/>
     and that he for one never heard any com<lb break="no"/>plaint about it.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. DAVIES</persName> (P.E.I.) The House will 
     <lb/>
     understand that my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
    Martin) is simply seeking to put the Act in 
     <lb/>the same position as it was when the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior said it worked so well. 
     <lb/>The Act vests arbitrary and extraordinary 
     <lb/>powers in the enumerators. An opportunity 
     <lb/>is given to those persons whose names are 
     <lb/>omitted, or to those who think names are 
     <lb/>improperly on, to go to that enumerator 
     <lb/>and to have the omitted names put on or the 
     <lb/>wrong names taken eoff. There is large room 
     <lb/>even there for arbitrary and improper con<lb break="no"/>duct on the part of the enumerator. There 
     <lb/>is large room for partiality and bias and 
     <lb/>prejudices to exhibit themselves. There is 
     <lb/>room there to make a list which may favour 
     <lb/>one side much more than the other. But, 
     <lb/>there was a clause inserted in the Act as 
     <lb/>it existed before the amendment which was 
     <lb/>intended to prevent, if possible, and to over<lb break="no"/>come that evil. That clause was, that if any<lb break="no"/>body was improperly struck off the list 
     <lb/>who was a duly qualified voter he could 
     <lb/>on election day take the oath that he was 
     <lb/>qualified, and be entitled to vote, even if 
     <lb/>a partisan enumerator left him off.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. DAVIES</persName> (P.E.I.) My hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule) is right, but the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     will see that the Electoral Franchise Act 
     <lb/>
     of the rest of Canada was not applied to the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, that a special law was made 
     <lb/>
     for these Territories alone, and that that 
     <lb/>
     law as it formerly existed, while vesting 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary powers in the enumerator, 
     <lb/>
     had one security to the qualified voter, 
     <lb/>
     namely, that if his name was by accident 
     <lb/>
     or design omitted he could on election day 
     <lb/>
    vote on taking the oath. Now, why was 
     <lb/>that provision struck out ? The Government 
     <lb/> did not advise that it should be struck out ; 
     <lb/> nor did the Government bring a Bill to this 
     <lb/>House and ask that it should be struck out.

     It was not discussed in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons, but an amendmentâ€”not setting out 
     <lb/>
     what the object of the amendment wasâ€”but 
     <lb/>
     simply mentioning among the clauses that 
     <lb/>
     were to be repealed " clause 4 " was insert<lb break="no"/>ed by the Senate. No human being unless 
     <lb/>
     he followed the legislation of this House 
     <lb/>
     most closely, would ever discover what the 
     <lb/>
     object of that was. He would have to get 
     <lb/>
     the original North-west Territories Repre<lb break="no"/>sentation Act, and the amendment, and read 
     <lb/>
     over section 44 to see what the clause was, 
     <lb/>
      which they were seeking to eliminate from 
     <lb/>
     the Act. Who asked the Senate to do that ? 
     <lb/>
     Was there a petition from any one in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories ; there was  none pre<lb break="no"/>sented to this House. What right has the 
     <lb/>
     Senateâ€”legal and technical right it may 
     <lb/>
     have hadâ€”to amend Bills passed by this 
     <lb/>
     House providing for the representation of 
     <lb/>
     members here ? I submit it is not fair that 
     <lb/>
     Bills which pass this House providing for 
     <lb/>
     representation in this House, should be 
     <lb/>
     amended in the Senate ; unless it is on oc<lb break="no"/>casions where some important omissions 
     <lb/>
     have been made and they are solicited to do 
     <lb/>
     so by the Government or by some person 
     <lb/>
     promoting the Bill. This amendment was 
     <lb/>
     slid in and no one knew anything about it. 
     <lb/>
     But we need not discuss bygones here 
     <lb/>
     to-day. The question is: That a great evil 
     <lb/>
     having been committed are we prepared to 
     <lb/>
     remedy it ? The hon. gentleman (Mr. Daly) 
     <lb/>
     asks us to assume that all the enumerators 
     <lb/>
     will do even-handed justice. He knows 
     <lb/>
     well, and every member of this House 
     <lb/>
     knows, that of the two or three hundred 
     <lb/>
     revisers appointed to revise the lists 
     <lb/>
     throughout Canada, with all the security 
     <lb/>
     given by the fact that many of them are 
     <lb/>
     judges and lawyers, it takes an immense 
     <lb/>
     deal of time and money to make even an 
     <lb/>
     approximately accurate list. In the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories you have no revision at all, 
     <lb/>
     but suddenly, after the writ is out the 
     <lb/>
     enumerator is asked to make a list. He 
     <lb/>
     posts that list. One of his friends goes to 
     <lb/>
     him and asks that his name should be put 
     <lb/>
     on, and he can arbitrarily refuse to do it 
     <lb/>
     if he likes, or he may tell the man he will 
     <lb/>
     do it and when the man turns his back, 
     <lb/>
     he does not do it. There is no security to 
     <lb/>
     the voter. There is no court held, no means 
     <lb/>
     of compelling the enumerator to put it on. 
     <lb/>
     The one and only safeguard the electors 
     <lb/>
     had was, that if their names were omitted 
     <lb/>
     by the enumerator, they could go to the polls 
     <lb/>
     on election day and by pledging their oaths 
     <lb/>
     exercise their right to vote. The Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior says that that provision 
     <lb/>
     worked admirably well, and he challenges 
     <lb/>
     criticism upon the practical working of that 
     <lb/>
     Act. I am willing to accept his statement 
     <lb/>
     that the Act as it did stand worked practi<lb break="no"/>cally fairly well, but what we are seeking 
     <lb/>
     to do now is to put back that safeguard 
     <lb/>
     and put the Act where it was before the 
     <lb/>
     Senate foolishly amended it, we propose to 
     <lb/>
     restore the security to the electors which they

     formerly had, and which they are now 
     <lb/>
     deprived of. If hon. gentlemen find that the 
     <lb/>
      Bill proposed by my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Martin) has the unanimous endorsement of 
     <lb/>
     the North-west Assembly, then I say the 
     <lb/>
     last vestige of opposition to the proposal 
     <lb/>
     should vanish. Why, Sir, I hold in my 
     <lb/>
     hands a resolution which was moved in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Assembly by Mr. lnsinger, 
     <lb/>
     which after reciting all the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     calls attention to the fact that this Act. 
     <lb/>
     passed in 1894, practically made the voters' 
     <lb/>
    lists final as fixed by the enumerators and 
     <lb/>excluded from the right of the franchise 
     <lb/>every man whose name was not on that 
     <lb/>list two days before the election. The re<lb break="no"/>solution gives the following reasons why the  
     <lb/>Act as it now stands does not offer 
     <lb/>same safeguard to the rights of electors, 
     <lb/>as the voters' lists in the provinces do. It 
     <lb/>says :

     <lb/>the voters in the provinces, inasmuch<lb/>as,-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>(1) They are necessarily hurriedly prepared

     <lb/>before the day of polling ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     (2) The time allowed to electors or their 
     <lb/>
     agents to ascertain if their names are on 
     <lb/>
     such list is, taken in cennection with the 
     <lb/>
     distances generally to be travelled in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, and with the fact that no fixed 
     <lb/>
    residences are appointed for such enumer<lb break="no"/>ators, insufficient for the purpose ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     (3) The enumerator is absolute judge of the 
     <lb/>
     right of an elector to be on such list, and 
     <lb/>
     he can put on or strike off names till with<lb break="no"/>in two days of the polling day, without 
     <lb/>
     notice from or to such electors ;

            </p>

     made by the Senate is an unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     amendment which should be rectified at the 
     <lb/>
     earliest possible moment, the resolution 
     <lb/>
     winds up with the following :â€”

     Therefore, in the opinion of this assembly it is 
     <lb/>
     desirable that the " North-west Territories Re<lb break="no"/>presentation Act " be further amended so as to 
     <lb/>
     either adopt the system provided for in the 
     <lb/>
     "Territories Election Ordinances," or to bring 
     <lb/>
     into effect the provisions regarding voters' lists 
     <lb/>

     That system of enabling a man to vote on 
     <lb/>
     election day by pledging his oath when his 
     <lb/>
     right to vote is challenged prevails in other 
     <lb/>
     provinces outside of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tory. In the province from which I come, 
     <lb/>
     in all the local elections, if the right to vote 
     <lb/>
     of any duly qualified elector is challenged, 
     <lb/>
     he can, by taking the necessary oath, poll 
     <lb/>
     his vote, and it has been found to work 
     <lb/>
     practically very well. The neighbours all 
     <lb/>
     around know whether the man is qualified 
     <lb/>
     or not and if he perjures himself he can be 
     <lb/>
     punished. In this case, Sir, you have the 
     <lb/>
     whole North-west Assembly, irrespective of 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
    

         
         
      politics, invoking the aid of this House to 
     <lb/>
      restore to the electors of the North-west the 
     <lb/>
     rights and privileges which they possessed 
     <lb/>
     before the Senate amendments took them 
     <lb/>
     away. My hon. friend (Mr. Martin) has 
     <lb/>
     proposed a Bill to carry out that wish. I 
     <lb/>
     was glad to hear from the remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior, that he has not 
     <lb/>
     yet made up his mind to oppose the Bill of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend (Mr. Martin), that he has 
     <lb/>
     not made up his mind yet. that he will 
     <lb/>
     not restore to the electors the privileges 
     <lb/>
     and rights which they possessed before. 
     <lb/>
     It boots not, Sir, to cite the fact that in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, as the hon. gentleman said, or 
     <lb/>
     in Nova Scotia, as another hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     said, there are evils existing in the electoral 
     <lb/>
     laws. We have nothing to do with that. 
     <lb/>
     If wrong was done elsewhere, it does not 
     <lb/>
     justify wrong being done here ; two wrongs 
     <lb/>
     do not make a right. We are dealing with 
     <lb/>
     the fact that a grievous wrong has been 
     <lb/>
     committed- wrong capable of being used 
     <lb/>
     by improper officers to such an extent as 
     <lb/>
     to almost disfranchise a majority of the 
     <lb/>
      electors in any one district. It is a wrong 
     <lb/>
      that would not be tolerated in any part of 
     <lb/>
     Canada outside of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, and, if I know the men there, from 
     <lb/>
      what I have seen of them, they are not the 
     <lb/>
     men to tolerate it, either ; and when we 
     <lb/>
     have the whole North-west Assembly  en<lb break="no"/>tering a public protest against that wrong, 
     <lb/>
     and asking Parliament to remedy it, I say 
     <lb/>
     that it is time that we should rise to the 
     <lb/>
     occasion, irrespective of party feeling or 
     <lb/>
     party affiliation, and determine that the 
     <lb/>
     wrong shall be rectified at the first oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity. My hon. friend from Winnipeg (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Martin) was called to order for threatening 
     <lb/>
     to obstruct the business of this House un<lb break="no"/>less this were done. His words were 
     <lb/>
     stronger than the rules of the House justi<lb break="no"/>fied, but nobody doubts that the action he 
     <lb/>
     proposed to take would have been justified 
     <lb/>
     by the facts. Is it not absolutely intoler<lb break="no"/>able that four districts which send members 
     <lb/>
     to this House should be absolutely and 
     <lb/>
     entirely in the hands of the nominees of 
     <lb/>
     the Government ? Why, Sir, the fact only 
     <lb/>
     needs to be mentioned to excite horror, 
     <lb/>
     surprise and indignation ; and I am satis<lb break="no"/>fied that hon. members, if they calmly and 
     <lb/>
     coolly consider the matter, will repeal the 
     <lb/>
     ill-advised action of the Senate, and place 
     <lb/>
     the electors of the North-west in exactly 
     <lb/>
     the same position they were in before the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1894 was passed.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. Mr. Speaker, some days be<lb break="no"/>fore the hon. member for Winnipeg (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Martin) arrived here, and before I had any 
     <lb/>
     knowledge that he intended to move in this 
     <lb/>
     matter, I went to the Clerk and gave him a 
     <lb/>
     sketch of a Bill dealing with this matter ; 
     <lb/>
     and as soon as he told me that the Bill 
     <lb/>
     was prepared, I gave notice that, I would 
     <lb/>
     move for leave to introduce it. I think, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, that a great deal more has been made 
     <lb/>
     of this than there was any reason for.

            <p><persName ref="pers:MULO1">Mr. MULOCK</persName>. What direction does your<lb/>Bill move in ?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. It moves in the direction of<lb/>repealing the legislation of 1894 and 1895,<lb/>and reviving the legislation of 1886. My<lb/>hon. friend from Winnipeg was most unjust<lb/>in the strong attack, as it seems to me it<lb/>may be called, which he made on my hon.<lb/>friend the Minister of the Interior. If ever<lb/>a man was innocent, my hon. friend the<lb/>Minister of the Interior was innocent of<lb/>introducing this clause. After I have<lb/>calmly laid before the House what the law<lb/>was, and how the change came about, I<lb/>rather think the House will see that a great<lb/>deal more has been made of this matter<lb/>than was necessary. My hon. friend the<lb/>Minister of the Interior was quite right in<lb/>saying that in 1887 and in 1891, the law,<lb/>as it was passed in 1886, worked well. In<lb/>my own constituency I did not hear a<lb/>single complaint against the working of<lb/>that law. But that was not the case in<lb/>some other constituencies. In the constitu<lb break="no"/>ency of my hon. friend from Eastern As<lb break="no"/>siniboia (Mr. McDonald), I have been told<lb/>by him and by others, 107 names were<lb/>sworn on the list improperly. In 1894 cer<lb break="no"/>tain gentlemen from the North-west who<lb/>took an interest in politics, and were<lb/>strongly impressed that a wrong had been<lb/>done by those unscrupulous persons swear<lb break="no"/>ing themselves on the list, urged that a<lb/>change should be made in the direction<lb/>which the reform of the law took in 1894 ;<lb/>and an amendment to that effect was placed<lb/>in my hands when the Bill of 1894 was pass<lb break="no"/>ing through the House. I read the amend<lb break="no"/>ment at that time, and while I did not take<lb/>such a strong view of it as is taken by<lb/>hon. gentlemen who have spoken to-day, I<lb/>came to the conclusion that it was undesir<lb break="no"/>able to make such a change, and I did not<lb/>move in the matter. I know I never<lb/>brought it to the attention of the Minister<lb/>of the Interior. That is all I know about<lb/>it. When the Bill came down, it appeared<lb/>that those gentlemen who were interested<lb/>in the matter had moved in it in the Sen<lb break="no"/>ate, and the change had been made there.<lb/>Now, Sir, the change that was made is simply<lb/>thisâ€”that instead of a man having the<lb/>power to go on the day of election and make<lb/>an affidavit that he has the qualification en<lb break="no"/>titling him to vote, he can have his name<lb/>put on that list up to two days before the<lb/>election, by appealing to the enumerator,<lb/>should it prove not to be there.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MART1">Mr. MARTIN</persName>. I beg pardon. There isÂ <lb/>no such provision. It is quite impossible<lb/>to get his name on the list unless the enum<lb break="no"/>erator is willing to put it there.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. I think my hon. friend is<lb/>wrong. Up to two days before the election<lb/>he can appeal to the enumerator, and have<lb/>his name put on the list.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MART1">Mr. MARTIN</persName>. Suppose the enumerator<lb/>refuses ?<lb/>
            </p>
          
          
            <cb/>
           
            
            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI8">Mr. DAVIN</persName>. My hon. friend does not un<lb break="no"/>derstand the men in the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. No enumerator there would behave<lb/>in that manner. I quite agree that a critic,<lb/>looking at the legislation as it is, might<lb/>very properly see ground for alarm ; but,<lb/>knowing as I do the districts and the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and the public criticism under which<lb/>the enumerators would act, I do not ap<lb break="no"/>prehend any such dangers as the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Queen's (Mr. Davies) and the hon.<lb/>member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) antici<lb break="no"/>pate ; if I did, I would have moved in this<lb/>matter before. But, Sir, there are persons<lb/>in the Territories who do think there is some<lb/>danger, and I grant you that a check on<lb/>the enumerator has been taken away. Un<lb break="no"/>der the circumstances, I am inclined to<lb/>think that it is not worth debating in this<lb/>House for five minutes. I do not believe<lb/>that the change which my Bill and that of<lb/>the hon. member for Winnipeg contemplate<lb/>will affect a single vote in any constituency.<lb/>But if there is any feeling on the eve of<lb/>election amongst any portion of the com<lb break="no"/>munityâ€”I do not care what side of poli<lb break="no"/>tics they belong toâ€”that a check on the<lb/>enumerator had been taken away and that<lb/>somehow the elector was put in a worse posi<lb break="no"/>tion than he was in before it is not a mat<lb break="no"/>ter we should quarrel about in this House,<lb/>and the best way is to get rid of all cause<lb/>for alarm.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MULO1">Mr. MULOCK</persName>. I congratulate the hon.<lb/>member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin)<lb/>on the tone of his remarks, and I only rise<lb/>now to supplement something that fell from<lb/>the lips of the hon. member for Queen's,<lb/>P.E.I. (Mr. Davies), and I would ask the<lb/>attention of the Hon. Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior for one minute. It appears that the<lb/>Bill complained of was passed through this<lb/>House without much, if any, publicity. I<lb/>think we may admit that its conditions<lb/>were not known to the public intended to<lb/>be affected.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. Is the hon. gentleman re<lb break="no"/>ferring to the Bill or to the Senate amend<lb break="no"/>ments ?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MULO1">Mr. MULOCK</persName>. I am speaking of what<lb/>became of the Senate amendments.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. They came down in the day<lb/>time and were discussed in the day time.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MULO1">Mr. MULOCK</persName>. I am not referring to<lb/>anything which occurred in the House.<lb/>What I say is that the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories learned nothing of this pro<lb break="no"/>position until it was incorporated in the<lb/>statutes, and we have evidence now that<lb/>the people of the Territories are in favour<lb/>of a return to the old law, or, at all event,<lb/>against the continuance of the present<lb/>law. The opinion in the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories is against the law of 1895. That is<lb/>proved by the unanimous resolution of the<lb/>North-west Territories legislature, and also<lb/>by the remarks of my hon. friend from<lb/>

     West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin). It is prob<lb break="no"/>able also that if other hon. gentlemen re<lb break="no"/>presenting the Territories were to give the<lb/>results of their knowledge of public opin<lb break="no"/>ion, they would corroborate what has been<lb/>said by the hon. member for Winnipeg. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend from Queen's has suggest<lb break="no"/>ed that. under the circumstances, it is the 
     <lb/>
     duty of the Minister of the Interior to place 
     <lb/>
     no opposition in the way of the measure 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the hon. member for Winni<lb break="no"/>peg. I go further. I think it is his positive 
     <lb/>
     dutyâ€”not a merely negative oneâ€”to make 
     <lb/>
     this a Government Bill. It was through 
     <lb/>
     the Bill which the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     introduced that the law get tangled up as 
     <lb/>
     it is, and it is his duty, as a member of 
     <lb/>
     the Government, to adopt this proposed leg<lb break="no"/>islation with the view of having the law 
     <lb/>
     framed so as to meet public opinion in the 
     <lb/>
     North-west Territories. We all know that 
     <lb/>
     a private member can scarcely expect to 
     <lb/>
     get a public Bill through this House, and 
     <lb/>
     I would venture to say that despite all a; 
     <lb/>
     member can do. there is not the slightest; 
     <lb/>
     chance of a public measure introduced by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Winnipeg, or, for the 
     <lb/>
     matter of that, by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia. becoming law. The only 
     <lb/>
     way by which this wrong can be redressed 
     <lb/>
    is by action on the part of the Government, 
     <lb/>and I therefore rise to suggest to the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the interior that it is the duty of 
     <lb/>the Government to undo their mistake by 
     <lb/>seeing that the proper safeguards are secur<lb break="no"/>ed to the electorate before the election of 
     <lb/>1896 comes on. If they do less than that, 
     <lb/>they will fail to do an imperative duty de<lb break="no"/>volving on them. This discussion, this 
     <lb/>waste of public time, occasioned by hasty 
     <lb/>legislation, is an illustration of the manner 
     <lb/>in which, of late years, important measures 
     <lb/>affecting Parliament and affecting the pub<lb break="no"/>lic has been allowed to go through this 
     <lb/>House. We have seen, every session, im<lb break="no"/>portant legislation put through at the last 
     <lb/>days of the session when there was scarce<lb break="no"/>ly a quorum present. We have seen millions 
     <lb/>of dollars voted away on bonuses. We have 
     <lb/>seen most impor ant pieces of legislatioug 
     <lb/>put on the statute-book when but a small 
     <lb/>percentage of the people's representatives 
     <lb/>were here in Parliament.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MULO1">Mr. MULOCK</persName>. I admit that, but the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances are such that many hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men find it impossible to remain there. I 
     <lb/>
     was not one of the absent, because I took 
     <lb/>
     exception, in 1895, to the very clause which 
     <lb/>
     has been the subject of discussion to-day.

     <lb/>
     from any responsibility on their part, 
     <lb/>
    through absence from the House. These 
     <lb/>amendments were agreed to one month be<lb break="no"/>fore the session closed. The session did<lb/>not close until the latter portion of July,<lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
       
       
     and these amendments were agreed to in<lb/>June, one month before the session expired,<lb/>and, according to the records of the House,<lb/>every member of the Opposition must have<lb/>been present, because they all voted on a<lb/>division. There was, therefore, no snap

     was in the House and took part in putting 
     <lb/>
     through the amendments from the Senate. 
     <lb/>
     This House prorogued on the 22nd July, 
     <lb/>
    and the Bill was put through on the 26th 
     <lb/>June, that is twenty-three days before pro<lb break="no"/>rogation. The hon. gentleman will remem<lb break="no"/>ber that the session of last year was called 
     <lb/>at probably the most inconvenient period 
     <lb/>that could have been selected. It was call<lb break="no"/>ed at a time when we should have been 
     <lb/>preroguing instead of convening. In the 
     <lb/>month of June, the attendance was slim, 
     <lb/>and the early part of July there were many 
     <lb/>days when scarcely a quorum was present. 
     <lb/>Towards the close, there were times when 
     <lb/>there were not over twenty members pre<lb break="no"/>sent out of the two hundred. While there 
     <lb/>was not such a limited attendance when 
     <lb/>these amendments were passed, still, the 
     <lb/>attendance was very small, indeed, and the 
     <lb/>law which got embodied on the statute- 
     <lb break="yes"/>book had not the sanction of the majority 
     <lb/>of the people's representatives in Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. It was unknown to the people who 
     <lb/>were to be affected. and certainly a most 
     <lb/>irresistible case has been made out for the 
     <lb/>repeal of this measure.

    words in reply to what has fallen from the

     <lb/>resents the suggestion which I made that 
     <lb/>he is to blame for the law as it now stands. 
     <lb/>If only such matters as occurred in 1894 
     <lb/>were in issue. I would be quite prepared to 
     <lb/>accept his statement ; but my charges 
     <lb/>against him were not based on wnat hap<lb break="no"/>pened in 1894 alone, but upon the fact that 
     <lb/>this amendment was brought to his atten<lb break="no"/>tion last session, in 1895, when he was ask<lb break="no"/>ed to make this wrong right. He himself 
     <lb/>was then obliged to introduce a second Bill<lb/>to this House in order to correct some trifl<lb break="no"/>ing errors in his Bill of 1894, because,<lb/>

     strange to say, the Bill of 1894, while pro<lb break="no"/>viding that no one could get his name upon 
     <lb/>
     the list on election day, provided that 
     <lb/>
     notices should be stuck up in the polling 
     <lb/>
     division notifying the electors that they 
     <lb/>
     could apply to have their names put upon 
     <lb/>
     the voters' lists, even on the last day, so 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. gentleman was obliged, on 
     <lb/>
     account of this inconsistency and error 
     <lb/>
     in his 1894 Act, to come again in 1895 
     <lb/>
     and ask to have the change made. 
     <lb/>
     It was only when the Bill came up for 
     <lb/>
     discussion, and only upon the third reading 
     <lb/>
     of it, that members on this side learned of 
     <lb/>
     the change that was made in 1894. And a 
     <lb/>
     very strong appeal was then made by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) to 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior to right the out<lb break="no"/>rage that had been perpetrated. More than 
     <lb/>
     that, I went to the hon. Minister in his seat 
     <lb/>
     and discussed the matter with him and urged 
     <lb/>
     him very strongly, as a matter of fair-play 
     <lb/>
     to the Liberals in the Territories, not to in<lb break="no"/>sist upon this change in the old law. But he 
     <lb/>
     took a firm stand, and said it was the policy 
     <lb/>
     of the Government to insist upon the Act 
     <lb/>
     as it had been amended. So I think the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Davin) was not justified in finding fault 
     <lb/>
     with me for putting the case against the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister as I did. The hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     assumed the responsibility of the change at 
     <lb/>
     that time, and he defends it today. And 
     <lb/>
     for what purpose ? What other purpose can 
     <lb/>
     there be than that I suggest ? It is ad<lb break="no"/>mitted, it must be admitted by everybody 
     <lb/>
     who considers the matter, that, under the 
     <lb/>
     law as it is at present, it is possible for the 
     <lb/>
     most gigantic frauds to be perpetrated in 
     <lb/>
     these elections. As I have said, it is pos<lb break="no"/>sible for the Government to elect every mem<lb break="no"/>ber for the North-west: Territories in the 
     <lb/>
     next general election, through the operation 
     <lb/>
     of this changed law. The hon. Minister, of 
     <lb/>
     course. repudiates the suggestion that he in<lb break="no"/>tends to do any such thing. If he has no 
     <lb/>
     such intention, why, then, does he take the 
     <lb/>
     power to do it ? He offers only one reason 
     <lb/>
     and that is that, in 1891, under the old law, 
     <lb/>
     certain frauds were perpetrated. If that is 
     <lb/>
     all, let him make some change which will 
     <lb/>
     right the wrong he speaks of, without taking 
     <lb/>
     the power to inflict this great wrong upon 
     <lb/>
     us. Surely, he can remedy one without 
     <lb/>
     causing the other. Let the hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     take any course he likes, but I am going to 
     <lb/>
     protest, as I said before, against the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment taking into their hands the power they 
     <lb/>
     have under this Act. And I hold the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior wholly responsible 
     <lb/>
     for it. I think I was quite justified, after 
     <lb/>
     the stand he took in 1895, in assuming, as l 
     <lb/>
     did, that his action in 1894 was taken ad<lb break="no"/>visedly, so that the House would not un<lb break="no"/>derstand the change proposed. He says that 
     <lb/>
     the amendments were made in the Senate 
     <lb/>
     without his knowledge. I accept his word 
     <lb/>
     upon that point. But, when those amend<lb break="no"/>ments came before the House, surely, as a 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
    
    
     matter of fair-play, he should have ex<lb break="no"/>plained to the House what the changes 
     <lb/>
     were. He stated that he had explained 
     <lb/>
     the changes to members from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, but, when I pressed him 
     <lb/>
     for the name of any hon. member to whom 
     <lb/>
     he had explained these changes. the only 
     <lb/>
     name he could give was that of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Assinobia (Mr. McDon<lb break="no"/>ald), who has not had a word to say in de<lb break="no"/>fence of the changes then made. I could 
     <lb/>
     not believe that the hon. member for East As<lb break="no"/>siniboia would suggest this change. For 
     <lb/>
     what interest could he have in the elections? 
     <lb/>
     As I said before, he has been discarded by 
     <lb/>
     his party, he is of no further use to them. 
     <lb/>
     He made a very vigorous fight for the nom<lb break="no"/>ination, but he failed. Now, if it be true 
     <lb/>
     that, before these changes, outrages in the 
     <lb/>
    way of men falsely swearing their names 
     <lb/>upon the lists. is it not an astonishing fact 
     <lb/>to find that the legislative assembly of the 
     <lb/>North-west Territories, in their local elec<lb break="no"/>tions adhere to the system we have aban<lb break="no"/>doned? Under the law of the Territories any 
     <lb/>person can get his name on the list by going 
     <lb/>on election day and swearing that he is a 
     <lb/>British subject and is otherwise entitled to 
     <lb/>vote, just as, prior to 1894, a person could do 
     <lb/>in Dominion elections. It is hardly neces<lb break="no"/>sary for me to refer again to the absurd and 
     <lb/>childish argument of the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior in support of his plea that this change 
     <lb/>would do no harm. His argument was that 
     <lb/>the old law worked well, and. therefore. the 
     <lb/>new law would work well. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man must surely think there is neither sense 
     <lb/>nor reason in this House. In effect. he says 
     <lb/>that there is no difference between a list 
     <lb/>that means nothing and a list that is final 
     <lb/>and binding. When a list is made up which 
     <lb/>binds nobody, who cares what becomes of 
     <lb/>it or how it is made up. But if in the mean<lb break="no"/>time, you change the law so that the list, 
     <lb/>instead of being, as the hon. member for 
     <lb/>West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) says, a mere 
     <lb/>list for convenience, to save time on elec<lb break="no"/>tion day, and make that list final and bind<lb break="no"/>ing, surely you effect a complete change. 
     <lb/>You could perpetrate any fraud you liked in 
     <lb/>1887 or 1891 in keeping men's names off the 
     <lb/>prepared lists. and we did not need to care, 
     <lb/>because we had privileges under the Act 
     <lb/>which countervailed all that wrong. But, if 
     <lb/>you attempt to perpetrate a fraud in 1896 
     <lb/>which the Act gives you the power to per<lb break="no"/>petrate, we have no protection. The only 
     <lb/>course of safety is to have this vile iniquity 
     <lb/>purged from the statute-book. The hon. 
     <lb/>member for North York (Mr. Mulock) says 
     <lb/>this Bill cannot pass. Well, Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>hope it will pass. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>North York appeals to the Government in 
     <lb/>favour of the Bill. We tried that in 1895. 
     <lb/>But in 1895, unfortunately, when we first 
     <lb/>learned of this wrong, the Government busi<lb break="no"/>ness was done, and we had no chance of 
     <lb/>emphasizing our appeal effectually. We are 
     <lb/>in a different position at this time, Mr. 
     <lb/>

         Speaker. I do not care whether my hon. Â Â Â  Â  
     <lb/>friend's (Mr. Davin's) Bill passes or whether 
     <lb/>my Bill passes; but I ask and demand of 
     <lb/>the Government of the day the righting of 
     <lb/>this wrong. As I have already said, if they 
     <lb/>have no intention of doing us this wrong, 
     <lb/>let them relinquish the power to do it. I 
     <lb/>make the demand at the instance of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the North-west Territories. They are 
     <lb/>alarmed about this matter, and they have 
     <lb/>shown their alarm in the clearest possible 
     <lb/>way by a resolution passed by an assembly 
     <lb/>which, as I said before, is composed largely 
     <lb/>of Conservatives. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>West Assiniboia will agree with me in that. 
     <lb/>It is true that, among the members of that 
     <lb/>assembly, are the Liberal candidate for 
     <lb/>Alberta and some other Liberals. But 
     <lb/>I know a great many of them, and I 
     <lb/>think I am quite correct in saying that there 
     <lb/>is a considerable majority who are sup<lb break="no"/>porters of the present Government. Mr. 
     <lb/>Haultain, as I said before, the Premier, is 
     <lb/>the Government candidate in Alberta; and 
     <lb/>these gentlemen with. one voice have con<lb break="no"/>demned this outrage in language as strong 
     <lb/>and as clear as any that I have used to-day. 
     <lb/>They have pointed out the possibility of 
     <lb/>great wrong being done. and they have 
     <lb/>asked to have the law changed back into 
     <lb/>its old form, or else into their local Fran<lb break="no"/>'chise Act, but it makes no difference for the 
     <lb/>purpose of the people which is done. I may 
     <lb/>say that I got a letter this day from a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the legislative assembly urging me 
     <lb/>not to overlook this matter, to be sure and 
     <lb/>bring it up, and endeavour if possible to 
     <lb/>have the wrong made right. I again say 
     <lb/>that if this House does not at this session 
     <lb/>change that law, the prediction of the hon. 
     <lb/>Minister of the Interior will, no doubt, be 
     <lb/>fulfilled. in the elections which will take 
     <lb/>place in 1896, and there will. no doubt. be 
     <lb/>four members returned supporting the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party in the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. I have no doubt about it, it is too 
     <lb/>clear for argument. I do not think that the 
     <lb/>Liberals would put up candidates, I do not 
     <lb/>think we will be able to find four men 
     <lb/>foolish enough to risk $200 under circum<lb break="no"/>stances such as these. The Conservatives 
     <lb/>will get every seat, and possibly by accla<lb break="no"/>mation. But, Mr. Speaker, if they will give 
     <lb/>us a fair chance up there, if they will re<lb break="no"/>peal this iniquity and give us an equal 
     <lb/>chance with them in the election, I think 
     <lb/>the issue will be different. I may be right 
     <lb/>in my prediction that we will get the four 
     <lb/>seats, or the Minister of the Interior may 
     <lb/>beright in his. But there will be some equal 
     <lb/>chance for us, there will be some Oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity for a fight; whereas under this Act 
     <lb/>we have no chance and no opportunity. 
     <lb/>As I said before, it will be entirely useless 
     <lb/>for us to attempt to fight under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances. Therefore, it is my duty, as the 
     <lb/>only representative of Liberal opinions, or 
     <lb/>the nearest representative to the Territories 
     <lb/>of Liberal opinions, to demand in this House 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
        
        
     that a change be made. While the hon.<lb/>Minister of the Interior may take thestand, 
     <lb/>
     and his colleagues may support him in it, 
     <lb/>
     that he is going to take into his hands this 
     <lb/>
     enormous power for fraud, I doubt very 
     <lb/>
     much whether the members in this House 
     <lb/>
     supporting the Government on their general 
     <lb/>
     policy, will support them in any such out<lb break="no"/>rageous proceeding as this. If there is any 
     <lb/>
     possibility, under the rules of the House, of 
     <lb/>
     bringing the matter to a vote, I shall cer<lb break="no"/>tainly obtain a vote of the members upon 
     <lb/>
     this question. I hope when the occasion 
     <lb/>
     comes hon. members will see that the people 
     <lb/>
     of these four constituencies in the Territories 
     <lb/>
     have a fair chance to go to the polls and 
     <lb/>
     deposit their ballots, whether they happen 
     <lb/>
     to be in favour of or against the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:CART3">Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT</persName>. I am 
     <lb/>
     not going to prolong the discussion which 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Winnipeg (Mr. Martin) 
     <lb/>
     has initiated, although I feel bound to say 
     <lb/>
     that I have failed to hear one single argu<lb break="no"/>ment from the other side of the House in 
     <lb/>
     the slightest degree justifying the assump<lb break="no"/>tion of the monstrous powerâ€”and I use the 
     <lb/>
     word advisedlyâ€”which the Government 
     <lb/>
     have, without the real knowledge of the 
     <lb/>
     House, taken to themselves. The thing 
     <lb/>
     smacks of fraud of the grossest possible 
     <lb/>
     description. But what I want chiefly to 
     <lb/>
     call the attention of the House to, is this: 
     <lb/>
     As I understand it, this confusion has arisen, 
     <lb/>
     or the ignorance of the House has been 
     <lb/>
     caused, in no small degree, by the very 
     <lb/>
     mischievous practice which prevails in our 
     <lb/>
     legislation of repealing a clause by number, 
     <lb/>
     without giving full details of the clause that 
     <lb/>
     is repealed. I have over and over again 
     <lb/>
     protested against that practice in this House. 
     <lb/>
     I hold that it is the most slovenly possible 
     <lb/>
     legislation, when we are dealing with im<lb break="no"/>portant subjects like this, to say you repeal 
     <lb/>
     such and such a clause, number so and so, 
     <lb/>
     of such and such an Act. Not one man out 
     <lb/>
     of fifty in the House knows anything about 
     <lb/>
     the matter in general when; it is introduced 
     <lb/>
     in that fashion, still less, when it is intro<lb break="no"/>duced in the shape of an amendment from 
     <lb/>
     the Senate. Such a practice ought to be 
     <lb/>
     prohibited. I think, by a rule of this House ; 
     <lb/>
     at any rate, the Government in particular 
     <lb/>
     ought to be exceedingly cautious not to allow 
     <lb/>
     any legislation which passes through their 
     <lb/>
     hands, to be conducted in such an exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly slipshod fashion. I hope and trust that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friends will get an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     testing the sense of the House on this 
     <lb/>
     question, because I myself am of the opin<lb break="no"/>ion that if this thing had been fairly pre<lb break="no"/>sented to the House, the members on both 
     <lb/>
     sides would have refused to accord to the 
     <lb/>
     nominees of the Government any such power 
     <lb/>
     as that which appears to be given to them; 
     <lb/>
     and I trust that my hon. friend will take 
     <lb/>
     exceedingly good care that a test vote be 
     <lb/>
