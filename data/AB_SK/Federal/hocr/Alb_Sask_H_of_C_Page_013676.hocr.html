               four of these gentlemen taken from pro-

               pends upon the terms, as the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Alberta (Mr. Oliver) states, whether 
               <br />
               local autonomy will be accepted or not. 
               <br />
               This parliament can well afford to deal, not 
               <br />
               only justly, but liberally with the people of 
               <br />
               the North-west ; and, in doing so, as I say, 
               <br />
               they will take the very best step to encour- 
               <br />

               We are to-day spending upwards of half a

               <br />
               duty of parliament rather to try to provide 
               <br />

               <br />
               by the present territory. The result was un-

               from eastern Canada as well, to have this 
               <br />
               question disposed of once for all, and in a 
               <br />
               manner satisfactory to the people of the 
               <br />
               west. And that desire can be expressed 
               <br />
               by voting for the amendment of the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition, which calls for immediate 
               <br />
               action to add to the powers of the terri- 
               <br />
               torial legislature, and to have terms decided 
               <br />
               upon which must be referred to the terri- 
               <br />
               tories to see if they are satisfactory before 
               <br />
               they are agreed upon.

               It is to me, as it was to my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Alberta (Mr. Oliver) a matter of regret that 
               <br />
