    <!-- tion if the Government appointed some other 
     <lb/>
     one than the senior judge. Suppose it should 
     <lb/>
     appoint Judge Loranger, Judge Gill or Judge 
     <lb/>
     Davidson as acting chief justice. The judge 
     <lb/>
     thus appointed would receive the additional 
     <lb/>
     salary of $1,000, but he would not possess the 
     <lb/>
     authority of the acting chief justice. We 
     <lb/>
     would have an acting chief justice, but at the 
     <lb/>
     same time he would not have the power 
     <lb/>
     to draw the additional allowance of $1,000 
     <lb/>
     provided by this resolution. Under these 
     <lb/>
     circumstances the Government should not 
     <lb/>
     pass the resolution submitted, or continue 
     <lb/>
     to press it. It would be better to make no 
     <lb/>
     change in the law in order that the senior 
     <lb/>
     judge should be acting chief justice, and 
     <lb/>
     should receive the salary. The change the 
     <lb/>
     Government propose is this : to change the 
     <lb/>
     words " senior judge " to the words " the 
     <lb/>
     judge appointed by a competent authority." 
     <lb/>
     That is to say, that the Government wishes 
     <lb/>
     to secure the appointment of the acting chief 
     <lb/>
     justice. Is there any reason to change the 
     <lb/>
     law ? Why not allow the senior judge to 
     <lb/>
     perform the duties of acting chief justice ? I 
     <lb/>
     see no reason why this resolution should be 
     <lb/>
     passed, and I hope the Government will not 
     <lb/>
     press it 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BAKER. I do not deem it necessary 
     <lb/>
     in considering this question to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     relative merits or demerits of the judges of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. They are all hon- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     curable men, and are all able, upright 
     <lb/>
     and impartial judges. But my learned 
     <lb/>
     confrere, the member for Rouville (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Brodeur), has fallen into an error in 
     <lb/>
     the discussion of this question. It is 
     <lb/>
     true that the law as originally passed by 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature of Quebec provided that the 
     <lb/>
     functions of acting chief justice should 
     <lb/>
     be exercised by the senior judge who resided 
     <lb/>
     in the city of Montreal when the chief justice 
     <lb/>
     resided in Quebec, and vice versa. In the 
     <lb/>
     course of time the hon gentleman's leader 
     <lb/>
     came into power in the province of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     and it did not suit him to travel on the 
     <lb/>
     highway that had been travelled by the 
     <lb/>
     previous Legislature, and it was Mr. Mercier, 
     <lb/>
     whom the hon. gentleman followed with such 
     <lb/>
     devotion while he reigned in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, who introduced the new law. 
     <lb/>
     It was he who, animated by the hope of 
     <lb/>
     having patronage to be dispensed to his 
     <lb/>
     friends, thought it was not best that the 
     <lb/>
     senior judge should exercise the functions 
     <lb/>
     of acting chief justice, and it was he who 
     <lb/>
     introduced and carried through the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature the law which provided that one of 
     <lb/>
     the judges of the Superior Court might be 
     <lb/>
     appointed by competent authority to ex<lb break="no"/>ercise the functions of acting chief justice. 
     <lb/>
     This law was enacted under the regime 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Mercier, and it was duly pro<lb break="no"/>claimed. The proclamation will be found 
     <lb/>
     on pages 1146 and 1147 of the official 
     <lb/>
     ' Gazette ' for the year 1887. I re<lb break="no"/>peat that it was Mr. Mercier who passed 
     <lb/>
     that law, and the Dominion statue provid- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     ing that an extra amount of $1, 000 annually 
     <lb/>
     should be paid the senior judge was neces<lb break="no"/>sary in order to make it square with the 
     <lb/>
     law as it existed at the time the provision 
     <lb/>
     was made for the extra salary. It now be<lb break="no"/>comes necessary, in order to harmonize the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial and Dominion Statutes and make 
     <lb/>
     the salary go with the appointment, to 
     <lb/>
     amend the Consolidated Statutes, and to pro<lb break="no"/>vide that the extra salary of $1,000 shall be 
     <lb/>
     given to that one of the judges of the Superi<lb break="no"/>or Court who may be appointed by com<lb break="no"/>petent authority to exercise the functions of 
     <lb/>
     a chief justice. If this law were not passed, 
     <lb/>
     and an acting chief justice were appointed 
     <lb/>
     by competent authority, as he is bound to be 
     <lb/>
     appointed now, the senior judge would get 
     <lb/>
     the extra salary, while one of the judges who 
     <lb/>
     might be appointed by competent authority 
     <lb/>
     would exercise the functions. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is entirely under a misapprehension 
     <lb/>
     in supposing that the law was not proclaimed. 
     <lb/>
     It was proclaimed in due course, and is in 
     <lb/>
     force ; and this Bill is necessary to make 
     <lb/>
     the salary go with the appointment. If any 
     <lb/>
     blame attaches to any one for changing the 
     <lb/>
     law, it must be laid at the door of the late 
     <lb/>
     leader of my hon. friend.

     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. Yes. The only change in the

     power to legislate with respect to the remu<lb break="no"/>neration, by fees or otherwise, of sheriffs

     that restriction of three years' residence in

     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. At the time of the passing of 
     <lb/>
     that North-west Territories Act the prohibi<lb break="no"/>tory liquor law was in force, and there was 
     <lb/>
     no recourse in the case of a debt due for 
     <lb/>
     intoxicating liquor. Since then a license law 
     <lb/>
     has been passed, and this is to permit the 
     <lb/>
     authorizing of wholesale dealers and others 
     <lb/>
     to recover debts due for the sale of liquor, 
     <lb/>
     which they cannot do now.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. Section 5 in the Act of 1888 
     <lb/>
     related to proceedings at elecrions, and sub<lb break="no"/>section 4 to the payment of members. We 
     <lb/>
     are providing that they may provide for 
     <lb/>
     their compensation themselves, and also have 
     <lb/>
     the right to enact laws respecting proceed<lb break="no"/>ings at elections.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is still deferring the day when respon<lb break="no"/>sible government will be introduced into the 
     <lb/>
      Territories. When you confer upon them the 
     <lb/>
     power of electing a Legislature, I do not 
     <lb/>
     see why the principle of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, to the extent of their authority, how<lb break="no"/>ever little that may he, should not be in<lb break="no"/>troduced. 'By section 17 the Legislative As<lb break="no"/>sembly may from time to time appoint a 
     <lb/>
     committee of four persons from among its 
     <lb/>
     members to advise the Lieutenant-Governor 
     <lb/>
     in relation to the expenditure of territorial 
     <lb/>
     funds and of any moneys appropriated by 
     <lb/>
      Parliament for the Territories. To what ex<lb break="no"/>tent is the Lieutenant-Governor bound by 
     <lb/>
     the advice of these four persons ? Is he at 
     <lb/>
     liberty to disregard it ? There is no reserva<lb break="no"/>tion, no indication of any respon<lb break="no"/>sibility resting upon the parties. I 
     <lb/>do not see any ground of responsibility 
     <lb/>here or any theory or principle upon which 
     <lb/>the work of government is to proceed. I 
     <lb/>have looked over some of the expenditure 
     <lb/>of the Territories, and it seemed to me they 
     <lb/>were very extraordinary ; but there has been 
     <lb/>no opportunity of bringing them under the 
     <lb/>attention of Parliament. I think we ought 
     <lb/>to adopt some intelligible rule or principle 
     <lb/>and establish real responsibility.

            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:THOM21">Sir JOHN THOMPSON</persName> Does not this 
     <lb/>
     enactment really cover the whole ground 
     <lb/>
     when we read it in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     other enactment in force ? We have author<lb break="no"/>ity to send instructions to the Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Governor : so have the Executive in the <lb/>mother country power to send instructions<lb/>when a Governor General is sent here. So<lb/>far the provisions are parallel. Then there<lb/>is an enactment that the committee shall ad<lb break="no"/>vise the Government on all matters of ex<lb break="no"/>penditure.

     priation necessary to carry on government 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories. It then enacts that the 
     <lb/>
     Governor shall be advised by the Executive 
     <lb/>
     Committee as to these expenditures. There 
     <lb/>
     is no enactment that the Governor shall take 
     <lb/>
     their advice, nor is there any enactment 
     <lb/>
     that the Governor General shall take ours. 
     <lb/>
     But the constitution proceeds on the assump<lb break="no"/>tion that when it is the will of Parliament 
     <lb/>
     that the Government is to be advised. it is 
     <lb/>
     the will of Parliament that he shall follow 
     <lb/>
     the advice. As to the other matters gov<lb break="no"/>erned by ordinances. such as appointments. 
     <lb/>
     it is enacted that they shall be made and 
     <lb/>
     other things done by the Governor in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil. which is defined by the interpretation 
     <lb/>
     ordinance to mean the Lieutenant-Governor 
     <lb/>
     and the Executive Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man knows that under our constitutional 
     <lb/>
     system the law distinguishes—or. at all 
     <lb/>
     events, the conventions of the constitution 
     <lb/>
     distinguish—between the royal will and the 
     <lb/>
     personal will of the sovereign. But I do 
     <lb/>
     not see any provision by which that rule 
     <lb/>
     or principle would be applied in this case. 
     <lb/>
     Under our constitutional system the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor chooses his officers. The royal will 
     <lb/>
     is that they shall be chosen from the party 
     <lb/>
     having the majority in power. I apprehend 
     <lb/>
     that here the majority would make the 
     <lb/>
     choice. You do not leave the Governor any 
     <lb/>
     discretion at all as to who his advisers shall 
     <lb/>
     be. You put the whole discretion in the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, which. it seems to me. is not 
     <lb/>
     the most convenient or most satisfactory sys<lb break="no"/>tem. because there may be personal and 
     <lb/>
     active canvass amongst members of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature as to the appointments. which 
     <lb/>
     could not exist if the will of the Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor or his discretion were allowed 
     <lb/>
     some play. But, if their will or advice 
     <lb/>
     is not followed. under a constimtional sys<lb break="no"/>tem, they would tender their resignation. 
     <lb/>
     What would be the effect here ? The 
     <lb/>
     Legislature is chosen by the people, not by 
     <lb/>
     the Governor. and the Legislature might in<lb break="no"/>sist that they should continue to be his 
     <lb/>
     advisers. I do not see. myself. how this 
     <lb/>
     system could be practically worked out. If 
     <lb/>
     it has not produced friction. it must be be— 
     <lb/>
     cause there has been either a great deal or 
     <lb/>
     indifference or a great deal of forbearance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:THOM21">Sir JOHN THOMPSON</persName>. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     that any friction has been caused. This is 
     <lb/>
     the system they have been working under. 
     <lb/>
     It a difference of opinion occurred between 
     <lb/>
     the Governor and his advisers, the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture might insist that .he should have the 
     <lb/>
     same set of advisers. and in that case we 
     <lb/>
     would give them greater latitude. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell); You do not give 
     <lb/>
     them the power of dissolution.

            <p>
                   <persName ref="pers:THOM21">Sir JOHN THOMPSON</persName>. No; the power 
     <lb/>
     of dissolution remains here. But they would 
     <lb/>
     apply to the Federal authorities to ask the 
     <lb/>
     Lieutenant-Governor to act on their advice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Under our present system. and especially 
     <lb/>
     under the system as it would be under this 
     <lb/>
     Bill, the expenditures are practically under 
     <lb/>
     the control of the Legislature. It only me 
     <lb/>
     tends so far as the Legislature may please 
     <lb/>
     to give them the discretion in matters of 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. In all other matters, as I 
     <lb/>
     said. their ordinances provide practically 
     <lb/>
     that he shall take their advice, because he 
     <lb/>
     has to act upon the advice of the Executive 
     <lb/>
     Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. MILLS</persName> (Bothwell). It seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that what we ought to do with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     public moneys expended in the Territories 
     <lb/>
     under the supervision of the Territorial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment is to give them a lump sum and 
     <lb/>
     let them decide how these moneys shall be 
     <lb/>
     distributed and for what purposes they shall 
     <lb/>
     be employed. I am quite sure that any 
     <lb/>
     member of the House who will take the 
     <lb/>
     trouble to look over the appropriation for 
     <lb/>
     schools will see that it is out of all pro<lb break="no"/>portion to similar expenditures in any other 
     <lb/>
     province in the Dominion. There cannot be 
     <lb/>
     the same interest in the use of the money 
     <lb/>
     that there would be if a larger sum were 
     <lb/>
     appropriated by direct taxation or in some 
     <lb/>
     other way by the people themselves. As 
     <lb/>
     long as we say for what purpose the money 
     <lb/>
     shall be employed. we are practically keep<lb break="no"/>ing the Legislature in leading strings and 
     <lb/>
     preventing responsible government from de<lb break="no"/>veloping.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DALY1">Mr. DALY</persName>. It seems to me the feeling 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the present Council, as well as 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislature, is that the present sys<lb break="no"/>tem is preferable. that they do not want 
     <lb/>
     responsible government So far as the lump 
     <lb/>
     sum appropriation is concerned, they prac<lb break="no"/>tically have it now, because in the Supply 
     <lb/>
     Bill it was enacted that no vote for the 
     <lb/>
     fiscal year 1893-94 should lapse, consequently 
     <lb/>
     they can expend whatever is left of any 
     <lb/>
     vote this year without any other authority 
     <lb/>
     than the Supply Bill. I may say for the 
     <lb/>
     information of the hon. gentleman that this 
     <lb/>
     clause is adopted word for word from Ordin<lb break="no"/>ance No. 1 of 1892. Subsection 2 must not 
     <lb/>
     be overlooked. It provides :

     And so on. Action has always been taken

     <lb/>
     that is adulterated with chicory ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. WOOD (Brockville). No, it does not 
     <lb/>
     interfere with a compound article of food. 
     <lb/>
     The only change this section makes to the 
     <lb/>
     law as it now stands, is in adding the words, 
     <lb/>
     " exposed for sale."

     Mr. CHARLTON. Might not a penalty

     of $100 in some cases be excessive ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. WOOD (Brockvilie). This is the law

     at present. We are merely re-enacting the

     law here.

     Mr. CHARLTON. Even if we are, if 
     <lb/>
     anything in the old law was liable to criti<lb break="no"/>cism, it may be criticised now. It strikes 
     <lb/>
     me that a retail dealer selling an inconsider<lb break="no"/>able quantity of some article that may be 
     <lb/>
     impure or have been adulterated, if made 
     <lb/>
     to pay a fine of $100, would be treated rather

            <p>
     Sir JOHN THOMPSON. I have given 
     <lb/>
     notice of some amendments. I do not, how<lb break="no"/>ever, propose to take them up today, but 
     <lb/>
     simply to consider the Bill as submitted by 
     <lb/>
     the committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Committee rose and reported progress.

     House resolved itself into committee on 
     <lb/>
     resolution (page 4889) respecting drawbacks 
     <lb/>
     on certain goods. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. LAURIER. Is there any departure 
     <lb/>
     proposed from the existing law ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr WOOD (Brockville). No. What we 
     <lb/>
     have to do now is to go to the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     Board to grant drawbacks in certain cases, 
     <lb/>
     such as when there is a batch of sour beer 
     <lb/>
     made. The hon. gentleman who was Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the department of which I am Con<lb break="no"/>troller, will know what that means. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. LAURIER. What do you propose to 
     <lb/>
     do ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. WOOD (Brockville). To give it by 
     <lb/>
     departmental order instead of going to the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury Board. Where alcohol is purchased 
     <lb/>
     and used as part of the raw material in the 
     <lb/>
     manufacture of patent medicines, we pro<lb break="no"/>pose to allow a drawback to the extent on 
     <lb/>
     the medicine that is exported. Where there 
     <lb/>
     is malt used and the beer turns sour it is 
     <lb/>
     destroyed under the supervision of one of 
     <lb/>
     our officers, and we propose to allow a. draw<lb break="no"/>back on that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
