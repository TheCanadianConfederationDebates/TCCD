<p><persName ref="pers:MCCA5">Mr. McCARTHY</persName> moved for leave to introduce <lb/>
Bill (No. 33) to amend the North-West Territories <lb/>
Act. He said: The Bill needs but little explana<lb break="no"/>tion, at least one portion of it, when one remem<lb break="no"/>bers the long discussion which took place with <lb/>
reference to this subject at the last session of the <lb/>
last Parliament. I would only say now, that the <lb/>
object I have in view is to repeal the clause with <lb/>
reference to the dual language in the North-West <lb/>
Territories, and I do so because I am convinced <lb/>
that the direction in the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories Act that there shall be two official lan<lb break="no"/>guages in the country is calculated to perpetuate <lb/>
race distinctions which it ought to be, and which <lb/>
I hope it is, the object of this House to do away <lb/>
with. I believe I was able to show that, however <lb/>

some hon. gentlemen thought the measure was <lb/>
a harsh one, it was at all events in the right <lb/>
direction so far was these North-West Territories <lb/>
are concerned. It is, of course, well to remember <lb/>
that this Bill merely deals with the North-West <lb/>
Territories and that the right to the dual language <lb/>
is one based upon the British North America Act, <lb/>
and is to be found in that enactment alone. It is <lb/>
not a right conferred upon our French Canadian <lb/>
subjects at the time of the cession of the old Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec to the British Crown, and is <lb/>
not to be found earlier than the date of the <lb/>
British North America Act, and in that it is <lb/>
limited to the proceedings of this House, the <lb/>
proceedings of the Senate, and the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings of the Assembly of the Province of <lb/>
Quebec. No one who has given any attention to <lb/>
this subject can be otherwise than convinced that <lb/>
the perpetuation of these race distinctions is not <lb/>
in the public interest, and that nothing is more <lb/>
calculated to prevent the growth of the common <lb/>
nationality of the people of the Dominion than the <lb/>
encouragement of the additional language in the <lb/>
French tongue. I do not desire to interfere with <lb/>
the right which everyone has to speak in any <lb/>
language which seems right to him, but I desire to <lb/>
prevent anything which will foster race distinctions <lb/>
in our North-West without warrant, and, as I <lb/>
believe, without public object or public benefit. <lb/>
This Bill, however, goes further than that of last <lb/>
Session, in that it purports to deal with the school <lb/>
question. According to the genius of our con<lb break="no"/>stitution, as destined in the British North America <lb/>
Act, the subject of education is one belonging <lb/>
exclusively to the Provinces, is one of local concern <lb/>
to be dealt with by the Provinces. It is truth that, <lb/>
owing to difficulties which existed in the old <lb/>
Province of Canada, there are certain limitations <lb/>
and restrictions in regard to school matters <lb/>
imposed upon the Provinces of Ontatio and <lb/>
Quebec, but these restrictions end there, and <lb/>
I know no good reason why the people in <lb/>
the North-West Territories should be limited <lb/>
or restricted in the matter of education. As <lb/>
the law now stands, separate schools are made <lb/>
imperative. Wherever there are two religious <lb/>
communities, there is the right to have separate <lb/>
schools. I propose not to interfere with that, but <lb/>
simply to give to the people of the North-West the <lb/>
right to deal with the question of education as to <lb/>
them seems fit. My Bill is, perhaps, not so objec<lb break="no"/>tionable in another respect as the one of last year, <lb/>
because I omit the preamble, which to some of my <lb/>
friends, was a stumbling block. I have found that <lb/>
hon. gentlemen who were quite willing to adopt <lb/>
the enacting part of the Bill, hesitated somewhat <lb/>
at the wide terms of the preamble. That preamble, <lb/>
of course, was unnecessary for the purposes of the <lb/>
enacting cleanse, and as I have no desire to increase <lb/>
the difficulties, already sufficiently great, that I <lb/>
have before me in order to repead this particular <lb/>
clause, I have left out the preamble in the short <lb/>
Bill. <lb/></p> 

<p>Motion agreed to, and Bill read the first time. <lb/></p> 
<cb/>
<p>[...]Lawrence, in the County of Soulanges, Province <lb/>
of Quebec: and if so, at what date has said Order <lb/>
been passed? Has a survey been made? How <lb/>
much has been already paid for survey and other <lb/>
expenses connected therewith: the probable esti<lb break="no"/>mated cost of said canal: and whether it is the <lb/>
intention of the Government to proceed at an <lb/>
early date with its construction? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LANG1">Sir HECTOR LANGEVIN</persName>. An order in <lb/>
Council was passed on the 7th February, 1891. A <lb/>
survey has been made, and there has been paid for <lb/>
the survey and other expenses connected with <lb/>
it. $28,151. The probable cost of the canal is <lb/>
$4,800,000. It is the intention of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to proceed at an early date with its con<lb break="no"/>truction. <lb/></p>
