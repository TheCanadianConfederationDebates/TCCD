     <fw>DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> <fw type="num">81</fw> 
  

<!-- GL, 2018-03-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

            
            <!--<p>they would sound a tocsin that would lead<lb/>ultimately to independence. These<lb/>were his honest sentiments.<lb/>
            </p>
             referred to Mr. Card-<lb break="yes"/>well's despatch, and asked if it was not<lb/>a strong intimation that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment desired Confederation under the<lb/>Quebec Scheme. Looks at the position<lb/>of the Government and then let them<lb/>say if they could have answered that<lb/>despatch in any other terms than they<lb/>did. The Government were formed on<lb/>an anti-Confederate basis, directly op<lb break="no"/>posed to that scheme. When he went<lb/>through the contest at the general elec<lb break="no"/>tion he was opposed to that Quebec<lb/>Scheme, and had shewn up its defects<lb/>to the best of his ability. But half of<lb/>its iniquity had not been told. He<lb/>would tell the House some things con<lb break="no"/>cerning it that would amaze them. If<lb/>there was ever a sell perpetrated against<lb/>any country it was that Quebec Scheme.<lb/>He would not only show, but prove it,<lb/>before he was done. Mr. Cardwell<lb/>might be a very nice man, (so they were<lb/>all very nice men) but he must not at<lb break="no"/>tempt to coerce this Province. He<lb/>thought, perchance, that they were a<lb/>small people here—only some 250,000<lb/>men and women—that to his mind<lb/>might be a very small number, only the<lb/>population of some third rate town in<lb/>England. But he forgot there was a<lb/>difference between man and man. But<lb/>where would he find in England 250,000<lb/>that were equal to the 250,000 of New<lb/>Brunswick. There could not be found<lb/>in Europe or Asia, 250,000 with equal<lb/>general intelligence, ability, and equal<lb/>administrative talent. They in New<lb/>Brunswick breated from their birth the<lb/>pure bracing air of freedom. They were<lb/>accustomed to self-government, and<lb/>would yield to none their civil and po<lb break="no"/>litical rights. Every man born in New<lb/>Brunswick felt himself to be a man, and<lb/>every woman felt herself to be a wo<lb break="no"/>man. The mind was the standard of<lb/>the man. When the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment invested this country with the<lb/>right of self-government had they any<lb/>right to take it away again ? (Here the<lb/>hon. member at great length showed<lb/>that it was the intention of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, and had settled at the Conference,<lb/>that the scheme was to be put through<lb/>the various legislatures without any<lb/>appeal to the people. He had been<lb/>present, he said, in Woodstock, when<lb/>Mr. Fisher made the first grand devel<lb break="no"/>opment of the scheme ; when he spoke<lb/>of the Union of the Colonies, the found<lb break="no"/>ing of a grand nationality, as a theme<lb/>demanding the power of a Demos<lb break="no"/>thenes ; when he compared the dele<lb break="no"/>gates who met at Quebec to the men<lb/>of the first American Revolution who<lb/>sealed the independence of the United<lb/>States. Those latter where very great<lb/>men. Mr. N. proceeded to say, they<lb/>did not meet and finish up their consti<lb break="no"/>tution in seventeen days, and afterwards<lb/>sign it on a Sunday ; but they took years<lb/>before they finished their work, and it<lb/>was a constitution that had stood the<lb/>political turmoil and the battle shock of<lb/>seventy-four years, and would last for<lb/>ages. When he heard his hon. colleague<lb/>say, that the steamer that took the dele<lb break="no"/>gates to Quebec reminded him of the<lb/>Mayflower freighted with the pious pil<lb break="no"/>grims who landed on Plymouth rock ;<lb/>he could not help thinking if the May<lb break="no"/>flower, instead of being freighted with<lb/>pious pilgrims, had such a band on<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>board as those men who played such a<lb/>part at the Conference at Quebec, she<lb/>would have sunk before she got half<lb/>way on her passage to this continent.<lb/>With regard to the Quebec Scheme,<lb/>its supporters said that it was the best<lb/>scheme they had got, or would ever get.<lb/>Why, while he was speaking he wou;d<lb/>check out a better and more honest<lb/>measure. He would never consent that<lb/>the scheme should be inflicted upon the<lb/>country. He gave the Government a<lb/>perfectly independent support. Let the<lb/>Government tell the House if Needham<lb/>had ever asked them for anything, or<lb/>solicited any favor. He felt above that ;<lb/>true friendship was unbought, and<lb/>friendship was best displayed when<lb/>needed. What had the leadership of<lb/>the Government said—" rather than sub<lb break="no"/>mit to the Quebec Scheme he would go<lb/>down with the ship." So would he ;<lb/>he would stick to the ship and go down<lb/>with it, if go down he must. It was<lb/>said by several hon. members that Con<lb break="no"/>federation was foreshadowed in the<lb/>Speech, but he said it was not. With<lb/>regard to the question of Union, he was<lb/>not going to tell the House whether he<lb/>was in favor of it or not. He was not<lb/>going to tell his enemies his ideas con<lb break="no"/>cerning it, and give them the benefit of <lb/>his brains.<lb/>
            </p>
             then said, that he would<lb/>now come down to the despatches. His<lb/>hon. colleague said that those despatches<lb/>ought to have been published. Why<lb/>did he not, when in Government in<lb/>1850, publish the dispatches of<lb/>Sir Edmund Head. When they did come<lb/>before the House it was in a mutilated<lb/>form, rows of asterisks between gaping<lb/>paragraphs. There was a great dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction, and a resolution was moved in<lb/>the House calling on the Government to<lb/>submit them whole. He would ask his<lb/>hon colleague if any Government had<lb/>ever published despatches before they<lb/>were submitted to the House. Let hon.<lb/>members judge how absurd it was for<lb/>his colleague (Mr. F.) to charge this<lb/>Government with not doing what his<lb/>Government had not done.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>(The hon. member here quoted from<lb/>the " political primer" to show the in<lb break="no"/>consistency of Mr. Fisher, and contrast<lb break="no"/>ed the position he held when in the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment in 1850, with regard to the<lb/>Colonial Office, and his disregard then<lb/>for despatches emanating from the Col<lb break="no"/>onial Office, and the position he took<lb/>against the present Government on these<lb/>points.<lb/>
            </p>
             then branched into a<lb/>history of the struggle for Responsible<lb/>Government. He knew all the men who<lb/>had taken part in that great contest. He<lb/>revered the memories of those who had<lb/>passed away. Some were still upon the<lb/>stage of life, and some had taken to them<lb break="no"/>selves all the glory of the measure. Je<lb/>though that the glory should be given to<lb/>who the glory was due—the plume of<lb/>victory to those who had really fought the<lb/>battle. It had been said that Judge Wil-<lb break="maybe"/>mot and Mr. Fisher had fought the fight, <lb/>and certainly they had enjoyed all the<lb/>honor and credit of the victory. But who<lb/>were the men who did the work—who<lb/>went into the back settlements of the<lb/>country and fought the battle side by side<lb/>by night and by day—who were they ?<lb/>John Pickard and others, whose services<lb/>have never been acknowledged. It was<lb/>accident often that caused men to be he<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>roes. If Wilmot and Fisher had not had<lb/>such men as those fighting the hard fight,<lb/>they would never have enjoyed the glory<lb/>gave it to an opponent of Responsible<lb/>Government had not been won for the<lb/>people. Was it Wellington that won the<lb/>victory of Waterloo, and freed Europe<lb/>from the thraldom of Napoleon ? Was<lb/>it not rather the brave fellows who fought,<lb/>bled and died without due meed of honor<lb/>What he blamed Wilmot and Fisher for<lb/>was, that they had not given equal credit.<lb/>to those who had fought the battle with them.<lb/>There was a man now living than whom<lb/>no man had done more for the cause by<lb/>his pen and his word. He referred to<lb/>Dr. Livingstone of St. John—a man true,<lb/>faithful, honest, sincere—a man of great<lb/>sagacity and indomitable energy, who<lb/>had done more to give the people Re<lb break="no"/>sponsible Government than any man who<lb/>had engaged in the contest—more<lb/>than those who had gained all the<lb/>honor had done combined, and how<lb/>had he been rewarded for his ser<lb break="no"/>vices ? And what did Wilmot and<lb/>Fisher do ? They, alarmed by the<lb/>strength of a great principle, went into a<lb/>coalition Government. When an appoint<lb break="no"/>ment was made that would have been of<lb/>some service to Dr. Livingstone—who<lb/>they knew had worked so hard—they<lb/>gave it to an opponent of Responsible<lb/>Government. The proper place for the<lb/>Doctor would have been in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council. They ought to have put<lb/>him in the Upper House, but though they<lb/>had the opportunity, they neglected to<lb/>give honor to whom honor was due. They<lb/>were afraid to put him there, more shame<lb/>to them. He thought they should not<lb/>have been so anxious to get into Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. They would have done them<lb break="no"/>selves more honor if they had waited.<lb/>However, they had received pay for all<lb/>they ever did. His friend got the Puisne<lb/>Judgeship, and he left his (Mr. N) hon.<lb/>colleague in the Government to fight the<lb/>battles all alone.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>He would wind up with a few words<lb/>about the despatch—he meant the glo<lb break="no"/>rious despatch of 15th July. The hon.<lb/>member of Albert (McClellan) called it<lb/>the immortal despatch. The Attorney<lb/>General said, when he read it in the Col<lb break="no"/>onial Office in London, he was proud of<lb/>it, and endorsed it every word. He had<lb/>never had doubt about it himself, and he<lb/>thought the people would endorse it also.<lb/>He was delighted to have an opportunity<lb/>to express his opinion upon it ; when he<lb/>first saw it and read it, his heart leapt<lb/>for joy. He thought that it had made<lb/>Mr. Cardwell understand, when he dealt<lb/>with the people of New Brunswick,<lb/>he dealt with a people who knew the right<lb/>and privileges of Responsible Govern-<lb break="yes"/>men, and were determined to maintain<lb/>them.<lb/>

     After a number of Bills had been 
     <lb/>
     brought in, the House, on motion of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Caie, went into Committee to take into 
     <lb/>
     consideration " A Bill to provide for the 
     <lb/>
     more effectual repair of roads and bridges 
     <lb/>
     in the Parishes of Carleton and Welford, 
     <lb/>
     in the County of Kent." MR. CAIE, in 
     <lb/>
     explaining the object of the Bill, said that 
     <lb/>
     it was  similar to one that was in opera<lb break="no"/>tion in the Parish of Richibucto, where it 
     <lb/>
     had worked very well ; and the inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     of the Parish in which he resided, were

     anxious to have the same privilege, for 
     <lb/>
     they thought a much larger amount of re<lb break="no"/>pairs would be put upon the roads under 
     <lb/>
     this Bill than is now done.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DESB2">MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY</persName> said he 
     <lb/>
     had not been instructed by his constitu<lb break="no"/>ents in regard to this Bill. He thought 
     <lb/>
     the people should have some voice in the 
     <lb/>
     matter. It should not be made impera<lb break="no"/>tive that they should pay money instead<lb/>of labor, without having a clause intro<lb break="no"/>duced that the Bill should not come into<lb/>operation without a two-third's majority<lb/>of the inhabitants of the Parish were in<lb/>favor of it. He thought they were not<lb/>aware in the Parish of Welford that a Bill<lb/>of this kind was to be submitted to the<lb/>Legislature.<lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAIE1">MR. CAIE</persName> explained that be had taken

      <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> said it was rather an 
     <lb/>
    arbitrary Bill, for its design was to com<lb break="no"/>pel the people of two Parishes to support 
     <lb/>their roads by the payment of money, 
     <lb/>whereas now it was optional with them 
     <lb/>whether they would do so or not. In the 
     <lb/>absence of any petition in favor of the 
     <lb/>Bill, and the hon. members disagreeing 
     <lb/>upon it, he would vote against it.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WILL1">MR. WILLISTON</persName> said the people of       
     <lb/>
    these Parishes had every opportunity of 
     <lb/>knowing that such a Bill was to be pre<lb break="no"/>sented, for it had been published in the 
     <lb/>local newspapers, and there being no 
     <lb/>petition against it, it was one of the strong<lb break="no"/>est arguments in its faver. The princi<lb break="no"/>ple of this Bill had been adopted in 
     <lb/>Chatham and other Parishes, and he 
     <lb/>would like to see the same principle 
     <lb/>adopted throughout the Province, as it 
     <lb/>would be a great improvement upon the 
     <lb/>presents system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:OTTY1">MR. OTTY</persName> also supported the Bill as 
     <lb/>it had been found to work well in other<lb/>Parishes.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KERR1">MR. KERR</persName> said this Bill was a step in 
     <lb/>
     the right direction, and the principle of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill should become the law of the 
     <lb/>
    Province.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEWI1">MR. LEWIS</persName> was of the same opinion ; 
     <lb/>
    by the payment of twenty-five cents for 
     <lb/>each day's work, the roads would be kept 
     <lb/>in a better state than they now are under 
     <lb/>the present system. He would give the

     <persName ref="pers:DESB2">MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY</persName> said they 
     <lb/>
     had better report progress in order that

     ADJOURNED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S 
     <lb/>
       AMENDMENT. 
     <lb/>
            </head>

       <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">MR. NEEDHAM</persName> resumed : I shall <lb/> request the
                  indulgence of the House, in <lb/> order that I may fully and fairly explain <lb/>
                  my views, and the reasons that induce <lb/> me to vote as I shall vote on this
                  ques<lb break="no"/>tion. I was asked by persons outside of <lb/>this House why I
                  did not stick to the <lb/>point when speaking on this question on <lb/>Saturday
                  evening. I began to think <lb/>where the point was. I called to mind <lb/>the
                  various speeches on this question, <lb/>and found they had taken such a dis<lb
                  break="no"/>cursive range that it would be unfair not <lb/>to allow me the same
                  latitude. I shall <lb/>take up the different points, and endea<lb break="no"/>vour
                  to make myself so plain that I can<lb break="no"/>not be misunderstood either in
                  the posi<lb break="no"/>tion I assume or the principles I advo<lb break="no"
                  />cate. Before I go on to the main points, <lb/>I will refer to what I passed over
                  on <lb/>Saturday, on account of my not having <lb/>any notes before me, as I did
                  not expect <lb/>to speak that evening until a few mo<lb break="no"/>ments before I
                  arose for that purpose. <lb/>The few remarks which I will now make <lb/>on that
                  subject is for the purpose of dis<lb break="no"/>abusing the minds of hon. members
                  of a <lb/>wrong impression regarding the York <lb/>election and its results. That
                  election <lb/>was no evidence of a change of public <lb/>opinion in the County of
                  York regarding <lb/>Confederation. True, says one hon. <lb/>member, it was no
                  change of opinion on <lb/>Confederation, yet it was an absolute de<lb break="no"
                  />nouncement nftho present Government. <lb/>This I deny, and I shall show
                  conclusive<lb break="no"/>ly that the York election was no de<lb break="no"
                  />nouncement of the Government as a <lb/>whole. The Attorney General, at the last
                  <lb/>session of the Legislature introduced a <lb/>Bill to Abolish the office of
                  political Post<lb break="no"/>master General. That Bill, as I under<lb break="no"
                  />stand it, contemplated nothing more <lb/>than the mere doing away with that
                  <lb/>political office, and contemplated no ar<lb break="no"/> <cb/> rangements for
                  removing that or any <lb/> other office. But the impression got <lb/> abroad that
                  it was the intention of the <lb/> leader of the Government to remove that <lb/>
                  office to St. John, which rendered him <lb/>very unpopular in this County. I voted
                  <lb/>against abolishing that office, not because <lb/>I was a member for York, but
                  because <lb/>the measure did not accord with my <lb/>views of Responsible and
                  Departmental <lb/>Government. I considered the idea of <lb/>having Responsible
                  without Departmental <lb/>Government as absurd. The very mo<lb break="no"/>ment
                  the impression got abroad in the <lb/>County of York that it was the intention
                  <lb/>to remove that office to St. John, which <lb/>had caused the expenditure of
                  twelve or <lb/>fifteen hundred pounds a year in the city <lb/>of Fredericton, it
                  created a feeling of <lb/>hostility to the man who tried to carry <lb/>that
                  measure. It was easy to get up this <lb/>impression, and it was made a handle of
                  <lb/>at the York election. The question was <lb/>a popular one in a majority of
                  the Coun<lb break="no"/>ties outside of the County of York ; but <lb/>it was
                  unpopular there, and the election <lb/>was not based upon hostility to the Gov<lb
                  break="no"/>ernment, but upon hostility to Mr. Smith, <lb/>the leader of the
                  Government, and he <lb/>alone was brought into the contest. <lb/>There was another
                  influence brought to <lb/>bear in this election ; that was the ex<lb break="no"
                  />citement got up about Fenianism. I do <lb/>now assert—and there are thousands
                  <lb/>who will bear witness to the truth of what <lb/>I say—that this cry of
                  Fenianism was <lb/>got up for an especial purpose on an <lb/>especial occasion, to
                  raise the worst feel<lb break="no"/>ings of our common nature. It was got <lb/>up
                  to carry the election against Mr. <lb/>Pickard. This cry of Fenianism, and the
                  <lb/>opposition to the leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, was the cause of
                  a member being <lb/>returned in opposition to the Governtment. <lb/>Confederation
                  had nothing to do with it, <lb/>for not only the candidate ignored it, <lb/>but
                  almost every canvasser ; for I went <lb/>through the County and heard the can<lb
                  break="no"/>vassers speak, and almost every one put <lb/>forth the same cry :
                  Timothy Anglin has <lb/>challenged the Protestants, and will you <lb/>succumb to
                  him ? A more infamous <lb/>falsehood never was perpetrated. How<lb break="no"
                  />ever unfortunate was the challenge, Mr. <lb/>Anglin never challenged the
                  Protestants <lb/>of York. His challenge was to the con<lb break="no"/>federates of
                  York. He asked them would <lb/>they bring out a Confederation of York <lb/>in
                  opposition to on anti Confederate. <lb/>They did not, and they dare not. They
                  <lb/>brought an anti-Confederate to opposo an <lb/>anti-Confederate. They brought
                  a strong<lb break="no"/>er anti-Confederate than I am myself, <lb/>and this is an
                  undeniable fact. The mo<lb break="no"/>ment this challenge was explained, it
                  <lb/>was seen at once that this was not a reli<lb break="no"/>gious challenge at
                  all, but was one any <lb/>man might have made. I stated that <lb/>most all the
                  canvassers for my colleague <lb/>on that occasion enunciated the same
                  <lb/>doctrine. There was one honorable ex<lb break="no"/>ception ; that was Mr.
                  Hartley, Deputy <lb/>Surveyor in Carleton. He put the ques<lb break="no"/>tion
                  fairly on Confederation. Honor to <lb/>whom honor is due. I respect my politi<lb
                  break="no"/>cal opponent who will meet me on fair <lb/>political grounds. Then we
                  can make <lb/>use of the assertion, " free stage and no <lb/>favor." Then if we
                  are beaten, we are <lb/>beaten honorably. But it was not honor<lb break="no"/>able
                  to get up this cry that religion was <lb/>in danger. If it was, would it be saved
                  by <lb/>holding an election in the County. No ! <lb/>If it stands on that basis it
                  is not worth <lb/>having or promulgating in the world. <lb/>The very moment this
                  cry of Fenianism <lb/> <pb n="83"
                  facs="final/images/NB_LA_1866-04-02_Page_083.jpg"/> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF
                  THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> <fw type="num">83</fw> had done its work, and
                  the election was<lb/>over, the sensation telegrams ceased to<lb/>arrive from
                  Canada, New York, and other<lb/>places. My hon. friend Mr. McClelan read<lb/>a
                  squib here which was published some<lb/>days before the York election. I
                  tried<lb/>to get one but could not, so they could<lb/>not have been very numerous
                  in the <lb/>County of York. He must have had it<lb/>salted down. There were plenty
                  of<lb/>squibs in circulation on the other side,<lb/>one of them speaks of Needham,
                  Anglin<lb/>and Co. I never knew of any such com<lb break="no"/>pany. Talk about a
                  " hidden hand," or<lb/>slander. Was that a hit at Anglin ?<lb/>No ! It was a hit
                  at Needham. They  <lb/>were not satisfied with asserting that<lb/>Anglin had
                  challenged the Protestants<lb/>of York ; but they say Needham is going<lb/>over to
                  the Catholic Church, and chal<lb break="no"/>lenges them too. A more able
                  politi<lb break="no"/>cian, or a more able, honest, consistent<lb/>journalist
                  never put pen to paper than<lb/>Mr. Anglin, for he is honest to the core,<lb/>and
                  despises a mean, low act as much<lb/>as any man. True, he has his own<lb/>opinion
                  in regard to the worship of his<lb/>God, and where is the man that does<lb/>not.
                  Toleration is obliterated from the<lb/>dictionary. I ask toleration from
                  no<lb/>man, and I give it to no man, for it<lb/>comes from the source of our
                  existence.<lb/>I never was ashamed to let everybody<lb/>know just what I believed.
                  They<lb/>know whether I am an Orangeman or a <lb/>Catholic, for I never was what I
                  would<lb/>be ashamed to acknowledge. I do not<lb/>mean to say that I am always
                  right, or<lb/>that I am the man pointed out in Scrip<lb break="no"/>ture as the
                  man that has a right to cast<lb/>the first stone ; but I say, when I believe<lb/>a
                  thing to be right I am not ashamed to<lb/>assert it. My hon. colleague stated
                  on<lb/>nomination day, that at the last election<lb/>a great many lies were thrown
                  broad<lb break="no"/>cast over the County of York. I said<lb/>more about
                  Confederation before that<lb/>election than any of my colleages, and<lb/>I
                  challenge any one to produce one soli<lb break="no"/>tary false statement made by
                  me, or one<lb/>single bit of exaggeration. Can you do <lb/>it ? Why then did you
                  say it ? I never<lb/>did on any one occasion make one as<lb break="no"/>sertion
                  that was untrue, neither did I<lb/>exaggerate. I did not even make the<lb/>case as
                  bad as it was. The good old<lb/>Apostle Paul said he had been
                  beaten,<lb/>stricken, ship-wrecked and in prison, &amp;c.<lb/>In this respect I
                  think he and I resem<lb break="no"/>ble each other. While I have not re<lb
                  break="no"/>ceived forty stripes save one, I have<lb/>been injured in a more
                  tender part than<lb/>the back, for I am, to use an expression<lb/>made use of by
                  the late Hon. J. R.<lb/>Partelow, in St. John, the best abused<lb/>man in the
                  country. I take it and fight<lb/>it off ; yet, whenever maligned, I feel
                  this<lb/>consolation, that there is one woe pro<lb break="no"/>nounced in
                  Scripture which I have never<lb/>felt, that is the woe pronounced when<lb/>every
                  man speaks well of you. It is<lb/>said that everything is fair in war, poli<lb
                  break="no"/>tics and love. I do not believe that<lb/>doctrine. I do not believe my
                  hon. col<lb break="no"/>league did right in telling the people of<lb/>Keswick that
                  the railroad would go<lb/>down by the Keswick valley, and tell<lb break="no"/>ing
                  the people of Stanley that it would<lb/>go right by there. Another
                  point<lb/>against the Government was, that they<lb/>did not call the House
                  together before<lb/>they did. This, of itself, shows the<lb/>weakness of the
                  Opposition, when they<lb/>are compelled to take up a point like<lb/>that. Then
                  regarding the non-appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of the Auditor General. The Sur<lb
                  break="no"/> <cb/> veyor General read you the law, which<lb/>says, an Auditor
                  General shall be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed, or some other person. Some<lb/>other
                  person was appointed and the law<lb/>was fulfilled ; then that being the
                  case,<lb/>this charge also falls to the ground.<lb/>Ah, says my hon. friend, the
                  office of<lb/>Auditor General is ministerial, and they<lb/>can summon witnesses
                  from any part of<lb/>the country. Was it ever done ? I <lb/>never knew it to be
                  done, neither has<lb/>my hon. friend (Mr. F.) ever known it<lb/>to be done. Then
                  why all this prevari<lb break="no"/>cation. It was a mighty charge to
                  bring<lb/>against the Government, that they ought<lb/>to have appointed an officer
                  to do what<lb/>never was done and never will be.<lb/>They have appointed an
                  officer to do<lb/>what was essentially necessary, and I<lb/>do not know but what
                  the power in<lb break="no"/>vested in the Auditor General,<lb/>would, by
                  implication, be invest-<lb break="yes"/>in the person nominated to be
                  his<lb/>deputy, he would have a right to travel<lb/>and take this evidence as much
                  as the At<lb break="no"/>torney General would. Another point in<lb/>the indictment
                  is in regard to the sale of<lb/>public lands. This point my hon. col<lb break="no"
                  />league touched very lightly upon. I<lb/>know he does not like to hear much
                  about<lb/>it, and I do not wonder at it. I do not<lb/>blame him for speculating in
                  public lands.<lb/>When the Government turned him out<lb/>for this, I believe they
                  were cowardly.<lb/>Some gentlemen in that Government<lb/>were deeper in the mud
                  than he was in<lb/>the mire. I heard of one member of the<lb/>Government who
                  applied for one hundred<lb/>acres of land under the Labor Act, decla<lb break="no"
                  />ring he had no land in the country. Why<lb/>was not that man turned out of
                  the<lb/>Government ? They pronounced upon<lb/>my hon. colleague and threw him
                  over<lb break="no"/>board. They supposed that a human<lb/>sacrifice would atone
                  for the wrong done,<lb/>but York County took him up and re<lb break="no"/>turned
                  him at the head of the poll. I<lb/>voted for him, and I did it because
                  I<lb/>thought they wronged him. I did it,<lb/>because I expected that when he
                  came<lb/>here he would act a man. I did not ex<lb break="no"/>pect he would come
                  here and truckle to the<lb/>Governmant and cry yes, yea, for them.<lb/>I believe
                  no wrong was done in the<lb/>Crown Land transaction at all. The<lb/>same
                  transactions had been done time<lb/>after time by members of the House and<lb/>the
                  Government, and when the example<lb/>was set, why should subordinates
                  suffer<lb/>for it. The only way the Government<lb/>can do justice to Mr. Inches is
                  to give<lb/>him the salary which he ought to have—<lb/>that is $1000 a year. It
                  was wrong to<lb/>condemn my hon. colleage and Mr. In<lb break="no"/>ches, as if
                  they had been guilty of some<lb/>moral wrong, while members of the House<lb/>and
                  Government had perpetrated the same<lb/>thing, and yet went scot free,
                  because<lb/>they did not do it while members of the<lb/>Government. There was a
                  charge made<lb/>against the Crown Land Office that they<lb/>had sold a piece of
                  land without putting<lb/>it up to public competition, but the Sur<lb break="no"
                  />veyor cleared that up to the satisfaction<lb/>of the country. What did the late
                  Til-<lb break="yes"/>ley Government do in reference to sel<lb break="no"/>ling
                  lands without putting them up to<lb/>public auction ? Hear, mark, learn
                  and<lb/>inwardly digest it. On the 22d of May,<lb/>1857, James Buchanan prays
                  repayment<lb/>of £23 1s. 3d. expenses incurreed in at<lb break="no"/>tempting to
                  make a survey of Crown<lb/>Land under the late Deputy Mahood's<lb/>order. To
                  reimburse him, he was granted<lb/>192 acres of Crown Land without bring<lb
                  break="no"/>ing it to public sale, and from this land<lb/> <cb/> $900 was received
                  as stumpage for lum<lb break="no"/>ber. This is a fact which stands
                  recorded<lb/>in the Secretary's Office, and cannot be<lb/>gainsayed. Here is
                  another case : 200,000<lb/>logs were cut by a trespasser, and notice<lb/>was given
                  to the office, and a seizing offi<lb break="no"/>cer was directed to seize them.
                  Did he<lb/>put them up to public competition. No !<lb/>They were bought in at a
                  private house<lb/>for $1.50 per thousand. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was
                  requested to prosecute the tres<lb break="no"/>passer, but declined to do so. If
                  you<lb/>want any more of these operations, you<lb/>can get them to any extent at
                  the office.<lb/>I only searched over a dozen to get<lb/>these. I will not come
                  back to the squib<lb/>read by Mr. McClellan, in which it was<lb/>stated that our
                  taxes would increase un<lb break="no"/>der Confederation. I said I endorsed
                  it,<lb/>and I ask hon. members if they do not<lb/>know that taxes would increase.
                  I know<lb/>who wrote it, though I did not know<lb/>it at the time, and I am
                  authorized by<lb/>the gentleman who wrote it to say that<lb/>not one member in
                  York knew one<lb/>word about it. What was the offence?<lb/>Was it because the
                  delegates were<lb/>charged with violating the Sabbath,<lb/>and signing the
                  document on Sunday.<lb/>They denied it. Was it not true ? There<lb/>is a delegate
                  here, and his silence gives<lb/>consent. According to all correct theo<lb
                  break="no"/>logical views, it was not a work of ne<lb break="no"/>cessity, and God
                  knows it was not a<lb/>work of charity. Then they must have<lb/>been guilty of
                  violating the moral law,<lb/>and according to the doctrine laid down<lb/>in
                  Scripture, he that offendeth in one<lb/>point is guilty of all, therefore
                  they<lb/>should be the last men to preach moral<lb break="no"/>ity. I opposed this
                  Confederation<lb/>Scheme because I thought it would be<lb/>injurious to New
                  Brunswick. I urged<lb/>my colleague to explain the Scheme to<lb/>the people. I
                  called a meeting and put<lb/>forth my views, and the cry was, Need<lb break="no"
                  />ham wants to go to the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly. I said some others not
                  only<lb/>wanted to come here, but they wanted<lb/>to go to the far off Ottawa. I
                  told the<lb/>ani-Confederates, when they were ma<lb break="no"/>king up their
                  ticket, to leave me<lb/>out, and I would go through the<lb/>Country, and do as
                  much for the<lb/>party as I possibly could. I did not<lb/>know I was on the ticket
                  until I was sent<lb/>for. I attended none of the caucuses,<lb/>but I was in
                  earnest and sincere in my<lb/>endeavors to kill the monster, and I did<lb/>not
                  care who aided and helped me so long<lb/>as I did kill him. If I did not kill
                  him,<lb/>I wounded him, and he is bleeding and<lb/>will bleed to death, for die he
                  must and<lb/>die he shall. We may talk about Con<lb break="no"/>federation or not
                  as we like, but we may<lb/>be assured that Confederation under the<lb/>Quebec
                  Scheme will never take place ;<lb/>this may be strong language, but it
                  is<lb/>true. We are told that we anti-Con<lb break="no"/>federates are all
                  disloyal men—that we<lb/>oppose the Queen. We are told this by<lb/>the men who bow
                  the knee to the image<lb/>—not of Baal—but to Mr. Cardwell. This<lb/>is a new
                  image set up in 1865 whom men<lb/>bow down to and worship when they hear<lb/>the
                  sound of the sacbut, &amp;c. What did <lb/>Lord Derby say about Mr. Cardwell
                  in<lb/>the House of Lords ? He said he feared<lb/>that that hon. gentleman had got
                  the<lb/>colonies, which he controls, into trouble,<lb/>equivalent to the same
                  troubles which he<lb/>got Ireland into when he was secreatry of<lb/>that country.
                  Is it treason to attack Mr.<lb/>Cardwell or Her Majesty's Ministers ?<lb/>It is
                  not. When the Queen asks the<lb/>people of New Brunswick to do anything,<lb/> <pb

                  unless it is to give up our<lb/> birthright, we will do it, but in these <lb/>
                  despatches we have nothing to do with <lb/> the Queen, we only have to do with Her
                  <lb/> Majesty's Ministers, and I will handle <lb/> them as I please. I would only
                  like to <lb/> have the Colonial Secretary to face me on <lb/> the floors of the
                  House, and I would soon <lb/> show him that the sooner he got out of <lb/> the
                  office he now holds the better for him<lb break="no"/>self. News has arrived that
                  he is going <lb/> out of the Colonial Secretary's office. <lb/> " Thank the Lord
                  for all his mercies." <lb/> He is going to be Speaker in the House <lb/> of
                  Commons, and may he never come <lb/> back to his present oflice again, and when
                  <lb/> you write to him again tell him Needham <lb/> said so. These Confederates of
                  York, who <lb/> boast so much of their loyalty, made out <lb/>their Confederate
                  ticket at the general elec<lb break="no"/>tion. Who did they have on it? First was
                  <lb/>my hon. colleague (Mr. F.) whose loyalty I <lb/>do not dispute, so far as his
                  pluck will al<lb break="no"/>low him. I do not know about his being <lb/>a
                  descendant of the Loyalists, for I never <lb/>could find the name of Fisher in any
                  his<lb break="no"/>tory of those times. The next is John A. <lb/>Beckwith, then
                  Dr. Dow, can any one <lb/>dispute his loyalty. Do you remember <lb/>the Trent
                  affair, when Dr. Dow said he <lb/>never would take up arms against the land
                  <lb/>of his birth. They denounce me for being <lb/>disloyal, and call this man
                  loyal who <lb/>would not raise his arm against his native <lb/>country, when that
                  country was insuling <lb/>the flag we love. These charges of loy<lb break="no"
                  />alty and disloyalty should not be put <lb/>forth because we entertain these
                  opinions, <lb/>for I consider them altogether wrong. <lb/>My hon. colleague (Mr.
                  F.) has stated in <lb/>regard to the Fenian excitement, that it <lb/>was not right
                  to send Her Majesty's <lb/>troops to the frontier because they would <lb/>desert.
                  This was a wrong expression at <lb/>a wrong time. The British troops, when
                  <lb/>facing the foe, do not desert. They are <lb/>sent here to defend us and our
                  homes, and <lb/>it is not for us to turn round and tell <lb/>them they would
                  desert when they were <lb/>sent to meet the common enemy of our <lb/>common land.
                  Then in regard to the <lb/>despatches. There may be men of larger <lb/>talents,
                  more gigantic minds, and more <lb/>towering intellects then I am, but as to
                  <lb/>more manhood or more independence I <lb/>yield to no man, and no man on the
                  other <lb/>side of the water knows more of what will <lb/>do my country good than
                  I do myself. <lb/>I could teach the whole British Cabinet, <lb/>so far as the
                  interests of New Brunswick <lb/>are concerned. When the Imperial Par<lb break="no"
                  />liament was called together, the answer to <lb/>the speech was moved by the late
                  Gover<lb break="no"/>nor of Nova Scotia, the Marquis of Nor<lb break="no"/>mandy,
                  and he touched upon every point <lb/>in Her Majesty's speech but one, that was
                  <lb/>the federation of the North American <lb/>Colonies. We know he was here and
                  <lb/>knew about confederation, but while he <lb/>commented upon every other
                  sentence in <lb/>the speech, he wisely and justly held his <lb/>peace when he came
                  to confederation. <lb/>Does not that mean an absolute condem<lb break="no"/>nation
                  of the scheme. Lord Normanby <lb/>was a man of talent, and a man that under<lb
                  break="no"/>stood his position, and his silence on that <lb/>point conveys this
                  idea. (Mr. Needham <lb/>then quoted from a speech by Lord Cav<lb break="no"
                  />endish, commenting upon it and charac<lb break="no"/>terising it as mere
                  nonsense.) The hon. <lb/> mover of the amendment said that this <lb/>Government
                  was unworthy of the confi<lb break="no"/>dence of the people of this country,
                  be<lb break="no"/>cause they made him feel humiliated <lb/>when they sent home
                  that dispatch to <lb/>which allusion has been made. I say I <lb/> <cb/> approve of
                  it, and feel glad that we have <lb/> men in this country who would write such
                  <lb/> a dispatch. Hear what Mr. Cartier, the <lb/> Attorney General of Canada,
                  said, and <lb/> this was before we sent that delegation to <lb/> England. He says
                  : " Our whole inten<lb break="no"/>tion is to lay before the Government of <lb/>
                  the mother country our position as it <lb/> now is, in consequence of the breaking
                  <lb/> of the treaty by the Maritime Provinces, <lb/> in order that they may bring
                  some pres<lb break="no"/>sure to bear on them to bring about the <lb/> Federal
                  Union which was designed." <lb/> And again: " It is of consequence, I say, <lb/>
                  that we should show the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment that Canada, which
                  contains <lb/> more than three-fourths of the population <lb/> of all the
                  Provinces on this Continent, has <lb/> not failed to fulfil her part in the
                  compro<lb break="no"/>mise, but that the Maritime Provinces it <lb/> is who have
                  broken their sworn engage<lb break="no"/>ment." It is exceedingly strange that
                  <lb/> the Governor of Nova Scotia, in his Ad<lb break="no"/>dress to Parliament,
                  never refers to <lb/> Confederation. Are Her Majesty's com<lb break="no"/>mands
                  not to be obeyed in that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince ? If Her Majesty sent out
                  certain <lb/>dispatches that one Government thought<lb/>would be a benefit to the
                  country,<lb/>would they dare withhold them from<lb/>the Legislature of the country
                  ? If they<lb/>did, they would soon be hurled from<lb/>power. Is it not our glory
                  and pride<lb/>that, though Colonies, and dependent<lb/>upon the British Empire, we
                  are part<lb/>and parcel of that mighty nation, and<lb/>are as much bound by the
                  constitutional<lb/> usages, laws and customs of that na<lb break="no"/>tion as if
                  we were in London or Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh, for we have the same claim
                  to<lb/>British nationality as they have. But<lb/>were a Legislature or Government
                  to<lb/>refuse to receive a message from Her<lb/>Majesty, it would be open
                  rebellion.<lb/>Let it not, then, be said that we are<lb/>truckling to the Home
                  Government<lb/>because we, having received Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's commands
                  to lay before the<lb/>House certain dispatches, we have done<lb/>so. This dispatch
                  comes out here with<lb/>Her Majesty's name appended to it.<lb/>She expresses no
                  opinion about Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, but commands the Governor to<lb/>lay
                  before the Legislature certain cor<lb break="no"/>respondence between Lord Monck
                  and<lb/>the Colonial Secretary. This done ; <lb/>and I see no truckling to the
                  British<lb/>Government in the Speech. If there<lb/>was, I would not sustain them.
                  In<lb/>speaking of this glorious Confederation<lb/>scheme, I am reminded of an
                  anecdote<lb/>my hon. friend (Mr. Wetmore) got be<lb break="no"/>fore the people at
                  the last election. He<lb/>says : " Suppose my son was to come<lb/>here and ask me,
                  " Father, where is<lb/>your country ?" I should say I had no<lb/>country ; Mr.
                  Tilley sold it on the 4th<lb/>of October, 1864." You see he enter<lb break="no"
                  />tains the same opinion that I do. I<lb/>could not let Tilley, Cardwell or
                  the<lb/>British Government sell my country. I<lb/>dissent from the opinion
                  expressed by<lb/>my hon. friend (Mr. Williston) that this<lb/>is an Imperial
                  question which they have<lb/>a right to legislate upon. I say they<lb/>have not,
                  and I want them to hear it on<lb/>the other side of the water. After they<lb/>gave
                  us a Constitution, no power on<lb/>earth can legislate it away without
                  our<lb/>consent, and it is a wrong doctrine to<lb/>propound on the floors of this
                  free<lb/>Assembly. She can only legislate for<lb/>her own Imperial interest, and
                  when<lb/>she comes to interfere with our inde<lb break="no"/>pendent rights, it is
                  an act of usurpation<lb/>and tyranny that free men never will<lb/> <cb/> submit
                  to. A voice once went from this <lb/> great North American Continent when <lb/>
                  tyranny was exercised by the British <lb/> Ministry at home over a then free
                  peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and we see the results. When they <lb/> sought to tax the
                  North American Colo<lb break="no"/>nies without giving them representa<lb
                  break="no"/>tion in the British Parliament, the peo<lb break="no"/>ple rose as one
                  man, and wrested, by <lb/> rebellion, or, as it is now termed, by <lb/>
                  revolution, one of the brightest <lb/> jewels from the Crown of Great <lb/>
                  Britain. Let Mr. Cardwell beware, <lb/> for the spirit of those men is here,
                  <lb/>and the power is here. Let him <lb/>beware how he attempts to infringe
                  <lb/>upon our constitutional rights, for we <lb/>would be unworthy of the name of
                  be<lb break="no"/>ing the descendants of the Anglo-Sax<lb break="no"/>ons were we
                  to submit to such infringe<lb break="no"/>ment of our rights. That delegation
                  <lb/>was sent home to England not only be<lb break="no"/>cause that despatch was
                  sent out here <lb/>by Mr. Cardwell, but because the Can<lb break="no"/>adian
                  Government had sent delegates <lb/>home in order that they might induce <lb/>the
                  British Government to bring a pres<lb break="no"/>sure to bear here. The Maritime
                  Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are accused of having broken<lb/>their sworn
                  engagements. I will ask<lb/>my hon. colleague (Mr. F.) for the ho<lb break="no"
                  />nor of York and for the benefit of the<lb/>country, did these thirty-three
                  dele<lb break="no"/>gates, when they met in Canada, swear<lb/>to fulfil the terms
                  of that engagement.<lb/>( <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName>.—I
                  never heard of an oath.)<lb/>You never heard of it—perhaps you<lb/>were at church.
                  Mr. Cartier says we<lb/>have broken our sworn engagements. I<lb/>do not know what
                  oath they took, or<lb/>whether he virtually means an oath,<lb/>but it is
                  exceedingly strange language.<lb/>I was called to account, because I said<lb/>at
                  the last election, that politically Ca<lb break="no"/>nada was corrupt. Mr.
                  Cartier says<lb/>some of the members of the House<lb/>  and all our delegates have
                  violated<lb/>their solemn oath and broken the trea<lb break="no"/>ty, and was he
                  called to account ? Our<lb/>delegates could make but one treaty<lb/>that would be
                  binding : that was to<lb/>call their Legislature together when<lb/>they got home,
                  and make their Scheme<lb/>law without appealing to the people.<lb/>That was what
                  they violated, and it<lb/>was well for them that they did violate<lb/>it. Another
                  count in the indictment<lb/>is, the Government have not taken<lb/>proper
                  precautionary measures in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the defence of the
                  Province.<lb/>My hon. colleague (Mr. F.) said it was<lb/>wrong to expend that
                  $30,000 in the<lb/>city of Fredericton. ( <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr.
                  Fisher</persName>.—I <lb/>gave no opinion about the expenditure<lb/>of last year
                  at all. I said the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment could have had the thirty
                  days<lb/>drill in the month of March on the bor<lb break="no"/>ders of the
                  Province, and thus complied<lb/>with all the law requires, without add<lb
                  break="no"/>ing to the public expenditure.) It is a <lb/>bad time to drill a man
                  just as you<lb/>want to use him. Drill your men<lb/>when you have the time. (

                  not bark." Men <lb/> don't make such boasts in order to ena<lb break="no"/>ble
                  their opponents to be prepared. I <lb/> do not believe that Roberts or O'Maho<lb
                  break="no"/>ney ever dreamed of crossing the bor<lb break="no"/>der line of these
                  Provinces. If they <lb/> did, I have faith in the integrity of that <lb/> great
                  nation alongside of us to know <lb/> that whatever wrong she may have <lb/>
                  suffered at the hand of other nations, <lb/> in their opinions and sympathies, she
                  <lb/> has too high an opinion ol her dig<lb break="no"/>nity as a nation, and of
                  her stand<lb break="no"/>ing among the family of nations on the <lb/> earth, to
                  allow any fillibustering expedi<lb break="no"/>tion to cross her land to go to
                  another <lb/> country and raise the flag ot rebellion to <lb/> overthrow the
                  government of that coun<lb break="no"/>try. So long as that power stands, so long
                  <lb/> will she, in her own integrity and digni<lb break="no"/>ty, maintain that
                  international law which <lb/> is the life of the world. I do not believe <lb/> in
                  the doctrine of Fenianism, but I en<lb break="no"/>tertain my views in regard to
                  the wrongs <lb/> of Ireland. My hon. friend (Mr. Kerr) <lb/> spoke of the Union of
                  Scotland with Eng<lb break="no"/>land. It is a matter of history that the <lb/>
                  purse of Queen Anne was drained to the <lb/> dregs to purchase the members of the
                  <lb/> Parliament of Scotland to sell their coun<lb break="no"/>try, and the names
                  of the men who sold <lb/> it are this day in eternal infamy. Scot<lb break="no"
                  />land at that time was crippled, for she <lb/> had just come out of the great
                  Darien <lb/> expedition, and her ships and commerce <lb/> were not protected by
                  the British flag, <lb/> but the moment she came into that union <lb/> her commerce
                  was extended and her ships <lb/> protected by the Union Jack of old Eng<lb
                  break="no"/>land. How was the Union with lreland <lb/> effected ? By fraud and
                  rapine. We are <lb/> told this in history, and it cannot be ob<lb break="no"
                  />literated. Men in Ireland sold their par<lb break="no"/>liament for Lords,
                  Earls, Dukes, and pal<lb break="no"/>try pelf. I do not say it was a natural <lb/>
                  consequence, but it stands as a beaccu <lb/> light that scarely any one of them
                  died a <lb/> natural death. Scotland has benefitted <lb/> by that Union, but let
                  Scotland have what <lb/> we now have here, a Parliament of our <lb/> own, with an
                  independent local self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and you would see where she
                  would <lb/> be now. <lb/> </p>

     The Debate was now adjourned, Mr.

     The House in Committee agreed to an

     Act to aid the construction of the Wood<lb break="no"/>stock Railway. After which the order 
     <lb/>

     ADJOUENED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S 
     <lb/>
     ' AMENDMENT. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
             resumed. I shall 
     <lb/>
     now quote my hon. colleague's (Mr.F:) 
     <lb/>
     Speech on a Want of Confidence mo<lb break="no"/>tion in 1854. which was published in 
     <lb/>
     what is called the " political primer," in 
     <lb/>
     which he gives his opinion of the Col<lb break="no"/>onial office, and despatches from that, 
     <lb/>
     office, I shall make very few comments. 
     <lb/>
     This speech was delivered when the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. John, A. Street was Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral. He (Mr. F.) said, "a despatch, in his 
     <lb/>
     (the Attorney General's) estimation, was 
     <lb/>
     more of political value than the action of 
     <lb/>
     the Local Legislature," and again, " he 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. F ) would like to see an attempt 
     <lb/>
     to carry the despatch into effect ; he told 
     <lb/>
    Mr. Brown last spring, to pay no at<lb break="no"/>tention to it, and to come to the House 
     <lb/>if he wished. The Executive had al<lb break="no"/>lowed this to pass without remark or 
     <lb/>remonstrance, though it was a direct 
     <lb/>attempt to restrict them in the right to 
     <lb/>self-government." My hon. friend is 
     <lb/>not consistent here with the opinions he 
     <lb/>now expresses. He charges the seven 
     <lb/>with using strong language in their re<lb break="no"/>ply to Mr. Cardwell's despatches, and 
     <lb/>in 1854 he accuses  the Government of 
     <lb/>bowing down to the Colonial Office. 
     <lb/>Here was a despatch come out from 
     <lb/>home stating that a Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cillor could not leave unless his resigna<lb break="no"/>tion was accepted by Her Majesty, and 
     <lb/>that the Governor had no power to ac<lb break="no"/>cept it. This was not only in reference 
     <lb/>to a despatch from the Colonial Office, 
     <lb/>but it involved one of the Crown preroga<lb break="no"/>tives, which every man is supposed to 
     <lb/>submit to. But says my hon. colleague, 
     <lb/>though it be a royal prerogative, I say 
     <lb/>to you, Mr. Brown, pay no attention to 
     <lb/>the Queen's prerogative. Pay no atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the Colonial Office, but come to 
     <lb/>the House when you like. I hold he is 
     <lb/>bound in duty to his and my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, and to the people of this Province, 
     <lb/>to show why, after having made such a 
     <lb/>treasonable expression, he now turns 
     <lb/>round and charges this Government 
     <lb/>with truckling to the Colonial Office. 
     <lb/>Then again, he says, " by allowing Sir 
     <lb/>Edmund Head to appoint Judge Cartier 
     <lb/>Chief Justice, the Council had quailed 
     <lb/>before him." It seems to he his idea 
     <lb/>that any Government in which he is not, 
     <lb/>quails before the British Government. 
     <lb/>He goes on. " They had allowed the 
     <lb/>Province to be governed by despatches, 
     <lb/>and inroad after inroad to be made upon 
     <lb/>the principles ot self-government. " 
     <lb/>If these were then his views, has he 
     <lb/>abandoned Responsible Government 
     <lb/>now ? If we were to form our opinion 
     <lb/>of Responsible Government from its 
     <lb/>action in this country, and from the ac<lb break="no"/>tion of its supporters in this House, then 
     <lb/>in truth and verity is Responsible Go<lb break="no"/>vernment a humbug, while in reality it 
     <lb/>is not so. But I hold that if my hon.<lb/>colleague meant what he said on that<lb/>occasion, then his charges against this<lb/>Government, in respect to those des-<lb break="maybe"/>patches, are utterly valuless. He con<lb break="no"/>tinues : " This discussion would put an<lb/>end to government by despatches."<lb/>Who revived the ghost and brought it<lb/>from the shades below ? My hon. friend,<lb/>he is the man who put him down, and<lb/>now he blows his trumpet and the ghost<lb/>appears. Then again he goes on : " It<lb/>would teach all future Governments to<lb/>act like men of spirit and independence<lb/>and not truckle to any Governor or<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     
     Colonial Secretary." But now he says, 
     <lb/>
     how dare you do as l told  you ten years 
     <lb/>
     ago. That despatch, written by the im<lb break="no"/>mortal seven as they are called. is an 
     <lb/>
     evidence that they do not truckle to the 
     <lb/>
     Colonial Secretary. No man need be 
     <lb/>
     ashamed to sign that despatch, and the 
     <lb/>
     only regret that I have—if it is ever 
     <lb/>
     connected with the history of the coun<lb break="no"/>try as it ought to be—is, that I cannot 
     <lb/>
     constitutionally append my name to it. 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. Mr. Ritchie, who supported 
     <lb/>
     my hon. colleague in that debate, and 
     <lb/>
     assisted him to overthrow the then Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, says : " On the 28th April, 
     <lb/>
     1851. he (Mr. R.)moved the following! 
     <lb/>
     resolution :—  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     " Resolved, That. while this House 
     <lb/>
     should always receive 'ivitli respect, the 
     <lb/>
     
     House cannot but look on the extract of  
     <lb/>
     the despatch of Earl Grey, dated the 
     <lb/>
     25th day of November, l850, submitted 
     <lb/>
     by His Excellency, by message of the 
     <lb/>
     13th day of February last, as a dictation 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent, not only with the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the country, but in direct opposition 
     <lb/>
     to the principles of self-government, 
     <lb/>
     heretofore conceded, and which, if suc<lb break="no"/>cessfully persisted in , makes Responsi<lb break="no"/>ble Government a mere mockery and 
     <lb/>
    delusion. "   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Dame rumor said, that when that Go<lb break="no"/>vernment was formed my hon. colleague 
     <lb/>
     agreed with Judge Ritchie that he was 
     <lb/>
     to have the Judgeship, and my hon. col<lb break="no"/>league, the Attorney General—(Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fisher—No such agreement) —there 
     <lb/>
     were many ways of coming to an un<lb break="no"/>derstanding and yet enabling the con<lb break="no"/>tractors to say it was not so. But, at 
     <lb/>
     all events, so the day happened Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ritchie did get the Judgeship. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     colleague, the Attorney Generalship, 
     <lb/>
     just as Dame Rumor reported, in this 
     <lb/>
     instance, " common rumor was not a 
     <lb/>
     common liar." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I came into the House in 1851 to op<lb break="no"/>pose the then existing Government. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. colleague and Judge Wilmot were 
     <lb/>
     in the Government, and I was sent here 
     <lb/>
     by the Liberals of St. John, who believed 
     <lb/>
     in the doctrine of Responsible Govern- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment—to oppose them because they had 
     <lb/>
     forfeited their right to be called Liberals, 
     <lb/>
     by abandoning Responsible Government, 
     <lb/>
     by shelving themselves in with parties 
     <lb/>
     who were their opponents, and having 
     <lb/>
     done so they could not say they did it 
     <lb/>
     with their eyes shut, because they knew 
     <lb/>
     that after Responsible Government was 
     <lb/>
     adopted in Nova Scotia, through the hard 
     <lb/>
     work of the Hon. Joseph Howe, they 
     <lb/>
     formed a coalaiion with the so-called 
     <lb/>
    Tory Government, and the result was 
     <lb/>that they smashed to pieces. When they 
     <lb/>attempted to do the same thing here, they 
     <lb/>must have known they would have fallen 
     <lb/>into the same dilemma. Messrs. Gray, 
     <lb/>Wilmot, Titley and myself were sent here 
     <lb/>to oppose that Government. I did it to 
     <lb/>the best of my ability. I opposed them 
     <lb/>right or wrong, and that is the way I like 
     <lb/>to see a Government opposed.I do not 
     <lb/>mean to say they should do this on ordi<lb break="no"/>nary measures, but they should oppose 
     <lb/>them on measures introduced as Govern<lb break="no"/>ment measures. lt is well known that I 
     <lb/>did it when I came to the House on that 
     <lb/>occasion, but for some reason or other we 
     <lb/>could not beat them. The next year 
     <lb/>Messrs. Wilmot and Gray joined that 
     <lb/>Government, and Messrs. Ritchie, Si- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>monds and T liey resigned, and they call<lb break="no"/>
