     <fw>DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> <fw type="num">81</fw> 
  

<!-- GL, 2018-03-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

            
            <!--<p>they would sound a tocsin that would lead<lb/>ultimately to independence. These<lb/>were his honest sentiments.<lb/>
            </p>
             referred to Mr. Card-<lb break="yes"/>well's despatch, and asked if it was not<lb/>a strong intimation that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment desired Confederation under the<lb/>Quebec Scheme. Looks at the position<lb/>of the Government and then let them<lb/>say if they could have answered that<lb/>despatch in any other terms than they<lb/>did. The Government were formed on<lb/>an anti-Confederate basis, directly op<lb break="no"/>posed to that scheme. When he went<lb/>through the contest at the general elec<lb break="no"/>tion he was opposed to that Quebec<lb/>Scheme, and had shewn up its defects<lb/>to the best of his ability. But half of<lb/>its iniquity had not been told. He<lb/>would tell the House some things con<lb break="no"/>cerning it that would amaze them. If<lb/>there was ever a sell perpetrated against<lb/>any country it was that Quebec Scheme.<lb/>He would not only show, but prove it,<lb/>before he was done. Mr. Cardwell<lb/>might be a very nice man, (so they were<lb/>all very nice men) but he must not at<lb break="no"/>tempt to coerce this Province. He<lb/>thought, perchance, that they were a<lb/>small people here—only some 250,000<lb/>men and women—that to his mind<lb/>might be a very small number, only the<lb/>population of some third rate town in<lb/>England. But he forgot there was a<lb/>difference between man and man. But<lb/>where would he find in England 250,000<lb/>that were equal to the 250,000 of New<lb/>Brunswick. There could not be found<lb/>in Europe or Asia, 250,000 with equal<lb/>general intelligence, ability, and equal<lb/>administrative talent. They in New<lb/>Brunswick breated from their birth the<lb/>pure bracing air of freedom. They were<lb/>accustomed to self-government, and<lb/>would yield to none their civil and po<lb break="no"/>litical rights. Every man born in New<lb/>Brunswick felt himself to be a man, and<lb/>every woman felt herself to be a wo<lb break="no"/>man. The mind was the standard of<lb/>the man. When the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment invested this country with the<lb/>right of self-government had they any<lb/>right to take it away again ? (Here the<lb/>hon. member at great length showed<lb/>that it was the intention of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, and had settled at the Conference,<lb/>that the scheme was to be put through<lb/>the various legislatures without any<lb/>appeal to the people. He had been<lb/>present, he said, in Woodstock, when<lb/>Mr. Fisher made the first grand devel<lb break="no"/>opment of the scheme ; when he spoke<lb/>of the Union of the Colonies, the found<lb break="no"/>ing of a grand nationality, as a theme<lb/>demanding the power of a Demos<lb break="no"/>thenes ; when he compared the dele<lb break="no"/>gates who met at Quebec to the men<lb/>of the first American Revolution who<lb/>sealed the independence of the United<lb/>States. Those latter where very great<lb/>men. Mr. N. proceeded to say, they<lb/>did not meet and finish up their consti<lb break="no"/>tution in seventeen days, and afterwards<lb/>sign it on a Sunday ; but they took years<lb/>before they finished their work, and it<lb/>was a constitution that had stood the<lb/>political turmoil and the battle shock of<lb/>seventy-four years, and would last for<lb/>ages. When he heard his hon. colleague<lb/>say, that the steamer that took the dele<lb break="no"/>gates to Quebec reminded him of the<lb/>Mayflower freighted with the pious pil<lb break="no"/>grims who landed on Plymouth rock ;<lb/>he could not help thinking if the May<lb break="no"/>flower, instead of being freighted with<lb/>pious pilgrims, had such a band on<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>board as those men who played such a<lb/>part at the Conference at Quebec, she<lb/>would have sunk before she got half<lb/>way on her passage to this continent.<lb/>With regard to the Quebec Scheme,<lb/>its supporters said that it was the best<lb/>scheme they had got, or would ever get.<lb/>Why, while he was speaking he wou;d<lb/>check out a better and more honest<lb/>measure. He would never consent that<lb/>the scheme should be inflicted upon the<lb/>country. He gave the Government a<lb/>perfectly independent support. Let the<lb/>Government tell the House if Needham<lb/>had ever asked them for anything, or<lb/>solicited any favor. He felt above that ;<lb/>true friendship was unbought, and<lb/>friendship was best displayed when<lb/>needed. What had the leadership of<lb/>the Government said—" rather than sub<lb break="no"/>mit to the Quebec Scheme he would go<lb/>down with the ship." So would he ;<lb/>he would stick to the ship and go down<lb/>with it, if go down he must. It was<lb/>said by several hon. members that Con<lb break="no"/>federation was foreshadowed in the<lb/>Speech, but he said it was not. With<lb/>regard to the question of Union, he was<lb/>not going to tell the House whether he<lb/>was in favor of it or not. He was not<lb/>going to tell his enemies his ideas con<lb break="no"/>cerning it, and give them the benefit of <lb/>his brains.<lb/>
            </p>
             then said, that he would<lb/>now come down to the despatches. His<lb/>hon. colleague said that those despatches<lb/>ought to have been published. Why<lb/>did he not, when in Government in<lb/>1850, publish the dispatches of<lb/>Sir Edmund Head. When they did come<lb/>before the House it was in a mutilated<lb/>form, rows of asterisks between gaping<lb/>paragraphs. There was a great dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction, and a resolution was moved in<lb/>the House calling on the Government to<lb/>submit them whole. He would ask his<lb/>hon colleague if any Government had<lb/>ever published despatches before they<lb/>were submitted to the House. Let hon.<lb/>members judge how absurd it was for<lb/>his colleague (Mr. F.) to charge this<lb/>Government with not doing what his<lb/>Government had not done.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>(The hon. member here quoted from<lb/>the " political primer" to show the in<lb break="no"/>consistency of Mr. Fisher, and contrast<lb break="no"/>ed the position he held when in the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment in 1850, with regard to the<lb/>Colonial Office, and his disregard then<lb/>for despatches emanating from the Col<lb break="no"/>onial Office, and the position he took<lb/>against the present Government on these<lb/>points.<lb/>
            </p>
             then branched into a<lb/>history of the struggle for Responsible<lb/>Government. He knew all the men who<lb/>had taken part in that great contest. He<lb/>revered the memories of those who had<lb/>passed away. Some were still upon the<lb/>stage of life, and some had taken to them<lb break="no"/>selves all the glory of the measure. Je<lb/>though that the glory should be given to<lb/>who the glory was due—the plume of<lb/>victory to those who had really fought the<lb/>battle. It had been said that Judge Wil-<lb break="maybe"/>mot and Mr. Fisher had fought the fight, <lb/>and certainly they had enjoyed all the<lb/>honor and credit of the victory. But who<lb/>were the men who did the work—who<lb/>went into the back settlements of the<lb/>country and fought the battle side by side<lb/>by night and by day—who were they ?<lb/>John Pickard and others, whose services<lb/>have never been acknowledged. It was<lb/>accident often that caused men to be he<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>roes. If Wilmot and Fisher had not had<lb/>such men as those fighting the hard fight,<lb/>they would never have enjoyed the glory<lb/>gave it to an opponent of Responsible<lb/>Government had not been won for the<lb/>people. Was it Wellington that won the<lb/>victory of Waterloo, and freed Europe<lb/>from the thraldom of Napoleon ? Was<lb/>it not rather the brave fellows who fought,<lb/>bled and died without due meed of honor<lb/>What he blamed Wilmot and Fisher for<lb/>was, that they had not given equal credit.<lb/>to those who had fought the battle with them.<lb/>There was a man now living than whom<lb/>no man had done more for the cause by<lb/>his pen and his word. He referred to<lb/>Dr. Livingstone of St. John—a man true,<lb/>faithful, honest, sincere—a man of great<lb/>sagacity and indomitable energy, who<lb/>had done more to give the people Re<lb break="no"/>sponsible Government than any man who<lb/>had engaged in the contest—more<lb/>than those who had gained all the<lb/>honor had done combined, and how<lb/>had he been rewarded for his ser<lb break="no"/>vices ? And what did Wilmot and<lb/>Fisher do ? They, alarmed by the<lb/>strength of a great principle, went into a<lb/>coalition Government. When an appoint<lb break="no"/>ment was made that would have been of<lb/>some service to Dr. Livingstone—who<lb/>they knew had worked so hard—they<lb/>gave it to an opponent of Responsible<lb/>Government. The proper place for the<lb/>Doctor would have been in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council. They ought to have put<lb/>him in the Upper House, but though they<lb/>had the opportunity, they neglected to<lb/>give honor to whom honor was due. They<lb/>were afraid to put him there, more shame<lb/>to them. He thought they should not<lb/>have been so anxious to get into Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. They would have done them<lb break="no"/>selves more honor if they had waited.<lb/>However, they had received pay for all<lb/>they ever did. His friend got the Puisne<lb/>Judgeship, and he left his (Mr. N) hon.<lb/>colleague in the Government to fight the<lb/>battles all alone.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>He would wind up with a few words<lb/>about the despatch—he meant the glo<lb break="no"/>rious despatch of 15th July. The hon.<lb/>member of Albert (McClellan) called it<lb/>the immortal despatch. The Attorney<lb/>General said, when he read it in the Col<lb break="no"/>onial Office in London, he was proud of<lb/>it, and endorsed it every word. He had<lb/>never had doubt about it himself, and he<lb/>thought the people would endorse it also.<lb/>He was delighted to have an opportunity<lb/>to express his opinion upon it ; when he<lb/>first saw it and read it, his heart leapt<lb/>for joy. He thought that it had made<lb/>Mr. Cardwell understand, when he dealt<lb/>with the people of New Brunswick,<lb/>he dealt with a people who knew the right<lb/>and privileges of Responsible Govern-<lb break="yes"/>men, and were determined to maintain<lb/>them.<lb/>

     After a number of Bills had been 
     <lb/>
     brought in, the House, on motion of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Caie, went into Committee to take into 
     <lb/>
     consideration " A Bill to provide for the 
     <lb/>
     more effectual repair of roads and bridges 
     <lb/>
     in the Parishes of Carleton and Welford, 
     <lb/>
     in the County of Kent." MR. CAIE, in 
     <lb/>
     explaining the object of the Bill, said that 
     <lb/>
     it was  similar to one that was in opera<lb break="no"/>tion in the Parish of Richibucto, where it 
     <lb/>
     had worked very well ; and the inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     of the Parish in which he resided, were

     anxious to have the same privilege, for 
     <lb/>
     they thought a much larger amount of re<lb break="no"/>pairs would be put upon the roads under 
     <lb/>
     this Bill than is now done.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DESB2">MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY</persName> said he 
     <lb/>
     had not been instructed by his constitu<lb break="no"/>ents in regard to this Bill. He thought 
     <lb/>
     the people should have some voice in the 
     <lb/>
     matter. It should not be made impera<lb break="no"/>tive that they should pay money instead<lb/>of labor, without having a clause intro<lb break="no"/>duced that the Bill should not come into<lb/>operation without a two-third's majority<lb/>of the inhabitants of the Parish were in<lb/>favor of it. He thought they were not<lb/>aware in the Parish of Welford that a Bill<lb/>of this kind was to be submitted to the<lb/>Legislature.<lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAIE1">MR. CAIE</persName> explained that be had taken

      <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> said it was rather an 
     <lb/>
    arbitrary Bill, for its design was to com<lb break="no"/>pel the people of two Parishes to support 
     <lb/>their roads by the payment of money, 
     <lb/>whereas now it was optional with them 
     <lb/>whether they would do so or not. In the 
     <lb/>absence of any petition in favor of the 
     <lb/>Bill, and the hon. members disagreeing 
     <lb/>upon it, he would vote against it.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WILL1">MR. WILLISTON</persName> said the people of       
     <lb/>
    these Parishes had every opportunity of 
     <lb/>knowing that such a Bill was to be pre<lb break="no"/>sented, for it had been published in the 
     <lb/>local newspapers, and there being no 
     <lb/>petition against it, it was one of the strong<lb break="no"/>est arguments in its faver. The princi<lb break="no"/>ple of this Bill had been adopted in 
     <lb/>Chatham and other Parishes, and he 
     <lb/>would like to see the same principle 
     <lb/>adopted throughout the Province, as it 
     <lb/>would be a great improvement upon the 
     <lb/>presents system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:OTTY1">MR. OTTY</persName> also supported the Bill as 
     <lb/>it had been found to work well in other<lb/>Parishes.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KERR1">MR. KERR</persName> said this Bill was a step in 
     <lb/>
     the right direction, and the principle of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill should become the law of the 
     <lb/>
    Province.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEWI1">MR. LEWIS</persName> was of the same opinion ; 
     <lb/>
    by the payment of twenty-five cents for 
     <lb/>each day's work, the roads would be kept 
     <lb/>in a better state than they now are under 
     <lb/>the present system. He would give the

     <persName ref="pers:DESB2">MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY</persName> said they 
     <lb/>
     had better report progress in order that

     ADJOURNED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S 
     <lb/>
       AMENDMENT. 
     <lb/>
            </head>

       <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">MR. NEEDHAM</persName> resumed : I shall 
     <lb/>
     request the indulgence of the House, in 
     <lb/>
     order that I may fully and fairly explain 
     <lb/>
     my views, and the reasons that induce 
     <lb/>
    me to vote as I shall vote on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. I was asked by persons outside  of 
     <lb/>this House why I did not stick to the 
     <lb/>point when speaking on this question on 
     <lb/>Saturday evening. I began to think 
     <lb/>where the point was. I called to mind 
     <lb/>the various speeches on this question, 
     <lb/>and found they had taken such a dis<lb break="no"/>cursive range that it would be unfair not 
     <lb/>to allow me the same latitude. I shall 
     <lb/>take up the different points, and endea<lb break="no"/>vour to make myself so plain that I can<lb break="no"/>not be misunderstood either in the posi<lb break="no"/>tion I assume or the principles I advo<lb break="no"/>cate. Before I go on to the main points, 
     <lb/>I will refer to what I passed over on 
     <lb/>Saturday, on account of my not having 
     <lb/>any notes before me, as I did not expect 
     <lb/>to speak that evening until a few mo<lb break="no"/>ments before I arose for that purpose. 
     <lb/>The few remarks which I will now make 
     <lb/>on that subject is for the purpose of dis<lb break="no"/>abusing the minds of hon. members of a 
     <lb/>wrong impression regarding the York 
     <lb/>election and its results. That election 
     <lb/>was no evidence of a change of public 
     <lb/>opinion in the County of York regarding 
     <lb/>Confederation. True, says one hon. 
     <lb/>member, it was no change of opinion on 
     <lb/>Confederation, yet it was an absolute de<lb break="no"/>nouncement nftho present Government. 
     <lb/>This I deny, and I shall show conclusive<lb break="no"/>ly that the York election was no de<lb break="no"/>nouncement of the Government as  a 
     <lb/>whole. The Attorney General, at the last 
     <lb/>session of the Legislature introduced a 
     <lb/>Bill to Abolish the office of political Post<lb break="no"/>master General. That Bill, as I under<lb break="no"/>stand it, contemplated nothing more 
     <lb/>than the mere doing away with that 
     <lb/>political office, and contemplated no ar<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
           
rangements for removing that or any 
     <lb/>
     other office. But the impression got 
     <lb/>
     abroad that it was the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the Government to remove that 
     <lb/>
    office to St. John, which rendered him 
     <lb/>very unpopular in this County. I voted 
     <lb/>against abolishing that office, not because  
     <lb/>I was a member for York, but because 
     <lb/>the measure did not accord with my 
     <lb/>views of Responsible and Departmental 
     <lb/>Government. I considered the idea of 
     <lb/>having Responsible without Departmental 
     <lb/>Government as absurd. The very mo<lb break="no"/>ment the impression got abroad in the 
     <lb/>County of York that it was the intention 
     <lb/>to remove that office to St. John, which 
     <lb/>had caused the expenditure of twelve or 
     <lb/>fifteen hundred pounds a year in the city  
     <lb/>of Fredericton, it created a feeling of 
     <lb/>hostility to the man who tried to carry 
     <lb/>that measure. It was easy to get up this 
     <lb/>impression, and it was made a handle of 
     <lb/>at the York election. The question was 
     <lb/>a popular one in a majority of the Coun<lb break="no"/>ties outside of the County of York ; but 
     <lb/>it was unpopular there, and the election 
     <lb/>was not based upon hostility to the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, but upon hostility to Mr. Smith, 
     <lb/>the leader of the Government, and he 
     <lb/>alone was brought into the contest. 
     <lb/>There was another influence brought to 
     <lb/>bear in this election ; that was the ex<lb break="no"/>citement got up about Fenianism. I do 
     <lb/>now assert—and there are thousands 
     <lb/>who will bear witness to the truth of what 
     <lb/>I say—that this cry of Fenianism was 
     <lb/>got up for an especial purpose on an 
     <lb/>especial occasion, to raise the worst feel<lb break="no"/>ings of our common nature. It was got 
     <lb/>up to carry the election against Mr. 
     <lb/>Pickard.  This cry of Fenianism, and the 
     <lb/>opposition to the leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, was the cause of a member being 
     <lb/>returned in opposition to the Governtment. 
     <lb/>Confederation had nothing to do with it, 
     <lb/>for not only the candidate ignored it, 
     <lb/>but almost every canvasser ; for I went 
     <lb/>through the County and heard the can<lb break="no"/>vassers speak, and almost every one put 
     <lb/>forth the same cry : Timothy Anglin has 
     <lb/>challenged the Protestants, and will you 
     <lb/>succumb to him ?  A more infamous 
     <lb/>falsehood never was perpetrated. How<lb break="no"/>ever unfortunate was the challenge, Mr. 
     <lb/>Anglin never challenged the Protestants 
     <lb/>of York. His challenge was to the con<lb break="no"/>federates of York. He asked them would 
     <lb/>they bring out a Confederation of York 
     <lb/>in opposition to on anti Confederate. 
     <lb/>They did not, and they dare not. They  
     <lb/>brought an anti-Confederate to opposo an 
     <lb/>anti-Confederate. They brought a strong<lb break="no"/>er anti-Confederate than I am myself, 
     <lb/>and this is an undeniable fact. The mo<lb break="no"/>ment this challenge was explained, it 
     <lb/>was seen at once that this was not a reli<lb break="no"/>gious challenge at all, but was one any 
     <lb/>man might have made. I stated that 
     <lb/>most all the canvassers for my colleague 
     <lb/>on that occasion enunciated the same 
     <lb/>doctrine. There was one honorable ex<lb break="no"/>ception ; that was Mr. Hartley, Deputy 
     <lb/>Surveyor in Carleton. He put the ques<lb break="no"/>tion fairly on Confederation. Honor to 
     <lb/>whom honor is due. I respect my politi<lb break="no"/>cal opponent who will meet me on fair 
     <lb/>political grounds. Then we can make 
     <lb/>use of the assertion, " free stage and no 
     <lb/>favor." Then if we are beaten, we are  
     <lb/>beaten honorably. But it was not honor<lb break="no"/>able to get up this cry that religion was 
     <lb/>in danger.  If it was, would it be saved by 
     <lb/>holding an election in the  County. No ! 
     <lb/>If it stands on that basis it is not worth 
     <lb/>having or promulgating in the world. 
     <lb/>The very moment this cry of Fenianism

had done its work, and the election was<lb/>over, the sensation telegrams ceased to<lb/>arrive from Canada, New York, and other<lb/>places. My hon. friend Mr. McClelan read<lb/>a squib here which was published some<lb/>days before the York election. I tried<lb/>to get one but could not, so they could<lb/>not have been very numerous in the <lb/>County of York. He must have had it<lb/>salted down. There were plenty of<lb/>squibs in circulation on the other side,<lb/>one of them speaks of Needham, Anglin<lb/>and Co. I never knew of any such com<lb break="no"/>pany. Talk about a " hidden hand," or<lb/>slander. Was that a hit at Anglin ?<lb/>No ! It was a hit at Needham. They  <lb/>were not satisfied with asserting that<lb/>Anglin had challenged the Protestants<lb/>of York ; but they say Needham is going<lb/>over to the Catholic Church, and chal<lb break="no"/>lenges them too. A more able politi<lb break="no"/>cian, or a more able, honest, consistent<lb/>journalist never put pen to paper than<lb/>Mr. Anglin, for he is honest to the core,<lb/>and despises a mean, low act as much<lb/>as any man. True, he has his own<lb/>opinion in regard to the worship of his<lb/>God, and where is the man that does<lb/>not. Toleration is obliterated from the<lb/>dictionary. I ask toleration from no<lb/>man, and I give it to no man, for it<lb/>comes from the source of our existence.<lb/>I never was ashamed to let everybody<lb/>know just what I believed. They<lb/>know whether I am an Orangeman or a <lb/>Catholic, for I never was what I would<lb/>be ashamed to acknowledge. I do not<lb/>mean to say that I am always right, or<lb/>that I am the man pointed out in Scrip<lb break="no"/>ture as the man that has a right to cast<lb/>the first stone ; but I say, when I believe<lb/>a thing to be right I am not ashamed to<lb/>assert it. My hon. colleague stated on<lb/>nomination day, that at the last election<lb/>a great many lies were thrown broad<lb break="no"/>cast over the County of York. I said<lb/>more about Confederation before that<lb/>election than any of my colleages, and<lb/>I challenge any one to produce one soli<lb break="no"/>tary false statement made by me, or one<lb/>single bit of exaggeration. Can you do <lb/>it ?  Why then did you say it ? I never<lb/>did on any one occasion make one as<lb break="no"/>sertion that was untrue, neither did I<lb/>exaggerate. I did not even make the<lb/>case as bad as it was. The good old<lb/>Apostle Paul said he had been beaten,<lb/>stricken, ship-wrecked and in prison, &amp;c.<lb/>In this respect I think he and I resem<lb break="no"/>ble each other. While I have not re<lb break="no"/>ceived forty stripes save one, I have<lb/>been injured in a more tender part than<lb/>the back, for I am, to use an expression<lb/>made use of by the late Hon. J. R.<lb/>Partelow, in St. John, the best abused<lb/>man in the country. I take it and fight<lb/>it off ; yet, whenever maligned, I feel this<lb/>consolation, that there is one woe pro<lb break="no"/>nounced in Scripture which I have never<lb/>felt, that is the woe pronounced when<lb/>every man speaks well of you. It is<lb/>said that everything is fair in war, poli<lb break="no"/>tics and love. I do not believe that<lb/>doctrine. I do not believe my hon. col<lb break="no"/>league did right in telling the people of<lb/>Keswick that the railroad would go<lb/>down by the Keswick valley, and tell<lb break="no"/>ing the people of Stanley that it would<lb/>go right by there. Another point<lb/>against the Government was, that they<lb/>did not call the House together before<lb/>they did. This, of itself, shows the<lb/>weakness of the Opposition, when they<lb/>are compelled to take up a point like<lb/>that. Then regarding the non-appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of the Auditor General. The Sur<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
        
veyor General read you the law, which<lb/>says, an Auditor General shall be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed, or some other person. Some<lb/>other person was appointed and the law<lb/>was fulfilled ; then that being the case,<lb/>this charge also falls to the ground.<lb/>Ah, says my hon. friend, the office of<lb/>Auditor General is ministerial, and they<lb/>can summon witnesses from any part of<lb/>the country. Was it ever done ? I <lb/>never knew it to be done, neither has<lb/>my hon. friend (Mr. F.) ever known it<lb/>to be done. Then why all this prevari<lb break="no"/>cation. It was a mighty charge to bring<lb/>against the Government, that they ought<lb/>to have appointed an officer to do what<lb/>never was done and never will be.<lb/>They have appointed an officer to do<lb/>what was essentially necessary, and I<lb/>do not know but what the power in<lb break="no"/>vested in the Auditor General,<lb/>would, by implication, be invest-<lb break="yes"/>in the person nominated to be his<lb/>deputy, he would have a right to travel<lb/>and take this evidence as much as the At<lb break="no"/>torney General would. Another point in<lb/>the indictment is in regard to the sale of<lb/>public lands. This point my hon. col<lb break="no"/>league touched very lightly upon. I<lb/>know he does not like to hear much about<lb/>it, and I do not wonder at it. I do not<lb/>blame him for speculating in public lands.<lb/>When the Government turned him out<lb/>for this, I believe they were cowardly.<lb/>Some gentlemen in that Government<lb/>were deeper in the mud than he was in<lb/>the mire. I heard of one member of the<lb/>Government who applied for one hundred<lb/>acres of land under the Labor Act, decla<lb break="no"/>ring he had no land in the country. Why<lb/>was not that man turned out of the<lb/>Government ? They pronounced upon<lb/>my hon. colleague and threw him over<lb break="no"/>board. They supposed that a human<lb/>sacrifice would atone for the wrong done,<lb/>but York County took him up and re<lb break="no"/>turned him at the head of the poll. I<lb/>voted for him, and I did it because I<lb/>thought they wronged him. I did it,<lb/>because I expected that when he came<lb/>here he would act a man. I did not ex<lb break="no"/>pect he would come here and truckle to the<lb/>Governmant and cry yes, yea, for them.<lb/>I believe no wrong was done in the<lb/>Crown Land transaction at all. The<lb/>same transactions had been done time<lb/>after time by members of the House and<lb/>the Government, and when the example<lb/>was set, why should subordinates suffer<lb/>for it. The only way the Government<lb/>can do justice to Mr. Inches is to give<lb/>him the salary which he ought to have—<lb/>that is $1000 a year. It was wrong to<lb/>condemn my hon. colleage and Mr. In<lb break="no"/>ches, as if they had been guilty of some<lb/>moral wrong, while members of the House<lb/>and Government had perpetrated the same<lb/>thing, and yet went scot free, because<lb/>they did not do it while members of the<lb/>Government. There was a charge made<lb/>against the Crown Land Office that they<lb/>had sold a piece of land without putting<lb/>it up to public competition, but the Sur<lb break="no"/>veyor cleared that up to the satisfaction<lb/>of the country. What did the late Til-<lb break="yes"/>ley Government do in reference to sel<lb break="no"/>ling lands without putting them up to<lb/>public auction ? Hear, mark, learn and<lb/>inwardly digest it. On the 22d of May,<lb/>1857, James Buchanan prays repayment<lb/>of £23 1s. 3d. expenses incurreed in at<lb break="no"/>tempting to make a survey of Crown<lb/>Land under the late Deputy Mahood's<lb/>order. To reimburse him, he was granted<lb/>192 acres of Crown Land without bring<lb break="no"/>ing it to public sale, and from this land<lb/>
      
            <cb/>
           
$900 was received as stumpage for lum<lb break="no"/>ber. This is a fact which stands recorded<lb/>in the Secretary's Office, and cannot be<lb/>gainsayed. Here is another case : 200,000<lb/>logs were cut by a trespasser, and notice<lb/>was given to the office, and a seizing offi<lb break="no"/>cer was directed to seize them. Did he<lb/>put them up to public competition. No !<lb/>They were bought in at a private house<lb/>for $1.50 per thousand. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was requested to prosecute the tres<lb break="no"/>passer, but declined to do so. If you<lb/>want any more of these operations, you<lb/>can get them to any extent at the office.<lb/>I only searched over a dozen to get<lb/>these. I will not come back to the squib<lb/>read by Mr. McClellan, in which it was<lb/>stated that our taxes would increase un<lb break="no"/>der Confederation. I said I endorsed it,<lb/>and I ask hon. members if they do not<lb/>know that taxes would increase. I know<lb/>who wrote it, though I did not know<lb/>it at the time, and I am authorized by<lb/>the gentleman who wrote it to say that<lb/>not one member in York knew one<lb/>word about it. What was the offence?<lb/>Was it because the delegates were<lb/>charged with violating the Sabbath,<lb/>and signing the document on Sunday.<lb/>They denied it. Was it not true ? There<lb/>is a delegate here, and his silence gives<lb/>consent. According to all correct theo<lb break="no"/>logical views, it was not a work of ne<lb break="no"/>cessity, and God knows it was not a<lb/>work of charity. Then they must have<lb/>been guilty of violating the moral law,<lb/>and according to the doctrine laid down<lb/>in Scripture, he that offendeth in one<lb/>point is guilty of all, therefore they<lb/>should be the last men to preach moral<lb break="no"/>ity. I opposed this Confederation<lb/>Scheme because I thought it would be<lb/>injurious to New Brunswick. I urged<lb/>my colleague to explain the Scheme to<lb/>the people. I called a meeting and put<lb/>forth my views, and the cry was, Need<lb break="no"/>ham wants to go to the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly. I said some others not only<lb/>wanted to come here, but they wanted<lb/>to go to the far off Ottawa. I told the<lb/>ani-Confederates, when they were ma<lb break="no"/>king up their ticket, to leave me<lb/>out, and I would go through the<lb/>Country, and do as much for the<lb/>party as I possibly could. I did not<lb/>know I was on the ticket until I was sent<lb/>for. I attended none of the caucuses,<lb/>but I was in earnest and sincere in my<lb/>endeavors to kill the monster, and I did<lb/>not care who aided and helped me so long<lb/>as I did kill him. If I did not kill him,<lb/>I wounded him, and he is bleeding and<lb/>will bleed to death, for die he must and<lb/>die he shall. We may talk about Con<lb break="no"/>federation or not as we like, but we may<lb/>be assured that Confederation under the<lb/>Quebec Scheme will never take place ;<lb/>this may be strong language, but it is<lb/>true. We are told that we anti-Con<lb break="no"/>federates are all disloyal men—that we<lb/>oppose the Queen. We are told this by<lb/>the men who bow the knee to the image<lb/>—not of Baal—but to Mr. Cardwell. This<lb/>is a new image set up in 1865 whom men<lb/>bow down to and worship when they hear<lb/>the sound of the sacbut, &amp;c. What did <lb/>Lord Derby say about Mr. Cardwell in<lb/>the House of Lords ? He said he feared<lb/>that that hon. gentleman had got the<lb/>colonies, which he controls, into trouble,<lb/>equivalent to the same troubles which he<lb/>got Ireland into when he was secreatry of<lb/>that country. Is it treason to attack Mr.<lb/>Cardwell or Her Majesty's Ministers ?<lb/>It is not. When the Queen asks the<lb/>people of New Brunswick to do anything,<lb/>

<fw type="num">84</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw>

     

     no matter what, unless it is to give up our<lb/> birthright, we will do it, but in these 
     <lb/>
     despatches we have nothing to do with 
     <lb/>
     the Queen, we only have to do with Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Ministers, and I will handle 
     <lb/>
     them as I please. I would only like to 
     <lb/>
     have the Colonial Secretary to face me on 
     <lb/>
     the floors of the House, and I would soon 
     <lb/>
     show him that the sooner he got out of 
     <lb/>
     the office he now holds the better for him<lb break="no"/>self. News has arrived that he is going 
     <lb/>
     out of the Colonial Secretary's office. 
     <lb/>
     " Thank the Lord for all his mercies." 
     <lb/>
     He is going to be Speaker in the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons,  and may he never come 
     <lb/>
     back to his present oflice again, and when 
     <lb/>
     you write to him again tell him Needham 
     <lb/>
     said so. These Confederates of York, who 
     <lb/>
     boast so much of their loyalty, made out 
     <lb/>their Confederate ticket at the general elec<lb break="no"/>tion. Who did they have on it? First was 
     <lb/>my hon. colleague (Mr. F.) whose loyalty I 
     <lb/>do not dispute, so far as his pluck will al<lb break="no"/>low him. I do not know about his being 
     <lb/>a descendant of the Loyalists, for I never 
     <lb/>could find the name of Fisher in any his<lb break="no"/>tory of those times. The next is John A. 
     <lb/>Beckwith, then Dr. Dow, can any one  
     <lb/>dispute his loyalty. Do you remember 
     <lb/>the Trent affair, when Dr. Dow said he 
     <lb/>never would take up arms against the land 
     <lb/>of his birth. They denounce me for being  
     <lb/>disloyal, and call this man loyal who 
     <lb/>would not raise his arm against his native 
     <lb/>country, when that country was insuling 
     <lb/>the flag we love. These charges of loy<lb break="no"/>alty and disloyalty should not be put 
     <lb/>forth because we entertain these opinions, 
     <lb/>for I consider them altogether wrong. 
     <lb/>My hon. colleague (Mr. F.) has stated in 
     <lb/>regard to the Fenian excitement, that it 
     <lb/>was not right to send Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>troops to the frontier because they would 
     <lb/>desert. This was a wrong expression at 
     <lb/>a wrong time. The British troops, when 
     <lb/>facing the foe, do not desert. They are 
     <lb/>sent here to defend us and our homes, and 
     <lb/>it is not for us to turn round and tell 
     <lb/>them they would desert when they were 
     <lb/>sent to meet the common enemy of our 
     <lb/>common land. Then in regard to the 
     <lb/>despatches. There may be men of larger 
     <lb/>talents, more gigantic minds, and more 
     <lb/>towering intellects then I am, but as to 
     <lb/>more manhood or more independence I 
     <lb/>yield to no man, and no man on the other 
     <lb/>side of the water knows more of what will 
     <lb/>do my country good than I do myself. 
     <lb/>I could teach the whole British Cabinet, 
     <lb/>so far as the interests of New Brunswick 
     <lb/>are concerned. When the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament was called together,  the answer to 
     <lb/>the speech was moved by the late Gover<lb break="no"/>nor of Nova Scotia, the Marquis of Nor<lb break="no"/>mandy, and he touched upon every point 
     <lb/>in Her Majesty's speech but one, that was 
     <lb/>the federation of the North American 
     <lb/>Colonies. We know he was here and 
     <lb/>knew about confederation, but while he 
     <lb/>commented upon every other sentence in 
     <lb/>the speech, he wisely and justly held his 
     <lb/>peace when he came to confederation. 
     <lb/>Does not that mean an absolute condem<lb break="no"/>nation of the scheme. Lord Normanby 
     <lb/>was a man of talent, and a man that under<lb break="no"/>stood his position, and his silence on that 
     <lb/>point conveys this idea. (Mr. Needham 
     <lb/>then quoted from a speech by Lord Cav<lb break="no"/>endish, commenting upon it and charac<lb break="no"/>terising it as mere nonsense.) The hon. 
     <lb/> mover of the amendment said that this 
     <lb/>Government was unworthy of the confi<lb break="no"/>dence of the people of this country, be<lb break="no"/>cause they made him feel humiliated 
     <lb/>when they sent home that dispatch to 
     <lb/>which allusion has been made. I say I 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
     

     approve of it, and feel glad that we have 
     <lb/>
     men in this country who would write such 
     <lb/>
     a dispatch. Hear what Mr. Cartier, the 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General of Canada, said, and 
     <lb/>
     this was before we sent that delegation to 
     <lb/>
     England. He says : " Our whole inten<lb break="no"/>tion is to lay before the Government of 
     <lb/>
     the mother country our position as it 
     <lb/>
     now is, in consequence  of the breaking 
     <lb/>
     of the treaty by the Maritime Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     in order that they may bring some pres<lb break="no"/>sure to bear on them to bring about the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Union which was designed." 
     <lb/>
     And again: " It is of consequence, I say, 
     <lb/>
     that we should show the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment that Canada, which contains 
     <lb/>
     more than three-fourths of the population 
     <lb/>
     of all the Provinces on this Continent, has 
     <lb/>
     not failed to fulfil her part in the compro<lb break="no"/>mise, but that the Maritime Provinces it 
     <lb/>
     is who have broken their sworn engage<lb break="no"/>ment." It is exceedingly strange  that 
     <lb/>
     the Governor of Nova Scotia, in his Ad<lb break="no"/>dress to Parliament, never refers to 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. Are Her Majesty's com<lb break="no"/>mands not to be obeyed in that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince ? If Her Majesty sent out certain 
     <lb/>dispatches that one Government thought<lb/>would be a benefit to the country,<lb/>would they dare withhold them from<lb/>the Legislature of the country ? If they<lb/>did, they would soon be hurled from<lb/>power. Is it not our glory and pride<lb/>that, though Colonies, and dependent<lb/>upon the British Empire, we are part<lb/>and parcel of that mighty nation, and<lb/>are as much bound by the constitutional<lb/>
usages, laws and customs of that na<lb break="no"/>tion as if we were in London or Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh, for we have the same claim to<lb/>British nationality as they have. But<lb/>were a Legislature or Government to<lb/>refuse to receive a message from Her<lb/>Majesty, it would be open rebellion.<lb/>Let it not, then, be said that we are<lb/>truckling to the Home Government<lb/>because we, having received Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's commands to lay before the<lb/>House certain dispatches, we have done<lb/>so. This dispatch comes out here with<lb/>Her Majesty's name appended to it.<lb/>She expresses no opinion about Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, but commands the Governor to<lb/>lay before the Legislature certain cor<lb break="no"/>respondence between Lord Monck and<lb/>the Colonial Secretary. This done ; <lb/>and I see no truckling to the British<lb/>Government in the Speech. If there<lb/>was, I would not sustain them. In<lb/>speaking of this glorious Confederation<lb/>scheme, I am reminded of an anecdote<lb/>my hon. friend (Mr. Wetmore) got be<lb break="no"/>fore the people at the last election. He<lb/>says : " Suppose my son was to come<lb/>here and ask me, " Father, where is<lb/>your country ?" I should say I had no<lb/>country ; Mr. Tilley sold it on the 4th<lb/>of October, 1864." You see he enter<lb break="no"/>tains the same opinion that I do. I<lb/>could not let Tilley, Cardwell or the<lb/>British Government sell my country. I<lb/>dissent from the opinion expressed by<lb/>my hon. friend (Mr. Williston) that this<lb/>is an Imperial question which they have<lb/>a right to legislate upon. I say they<lb/>have not, and I want them to hear it on<lb/>the other side of the water. After they<lb/>gave us a Constitution, no power on<lb/>earth can legislate it away without our<lb/>consent, and it is a wrong doctrine to<lb/>propound on the floors of this free<lb/>Assembly. She can only legislate for<lb/>her own Imperial interest, and when<lb/>she comes to interfere with our inde<lb break="no"/>pendent rights, it is an act of usurpation<lb/>and tyranny that free men never will<lb/>


<cb/>


     submit to. A voice once went from this 
     <lb/>
     great North American Continent when 
     <lb/>
     tyranny was exercised by the British 
     <lb/>
     Ministry at home over a then free peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and we see the results. When they 
     <lb/>
     sought to tax the North American Colo<lb break="no"/>nies without giving them representa<lb break="no"/>tion in the British Parliament, the peo<lb break="no"/>ple rose as one man, and wrested, by 
     <lb/>
     rebellion, or, as it is now termed, by 
     <lb/>
     revolution, one of the brightest 
     <lb/>
     jewels from the Crown of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain. Let Mr. Cardwell beware, 
     <lb/>
    for the spirit of those men is here, 
     <lb/>and the power is here. Let him 
     <lb/>beware how he attempts  to infringe 
     <lb/>upon our constitutional rights, for we 
     <lb/>would be unworthy of the name of be<lb break="no"/>ing the descendants of the Anglo-Sax<lb break="no"/>ons were we to submit to such infringe<lb break="no"/>ment of our rights. That delegation 
     <lb/>was sent home to England not only be<lb break="no"/>cause that despatch was sent out here 
     <lb/>by Mr. Cardwell,  but because the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Government  had sent delegates 
     <lb/>home in order that they might  induce 
     <lb/>the British Government to bring a pres<lb break="no"/>sure to bear here. The Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are accused of having broken<lb/>their sworn engagements. I will ask<lb/>my hon. colleague (Mr. F.) for the ho<lb break="no"/>nor of York and for the benefit of the<lb/>country, did these thirty-three dele<lb break="no"/>gates, when they met in Canada, swear<lb/>to fulfil the terms of that engagement.<lb/>( <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName>.—I never heard of an oath.)<lb/>You never heard of it—perhaps you<lb/>were at church. Mr. Cartier says we<lb/>have broken our sworn engagements. I<lb/>do not know what oath they took, or<lb/>whether he virtually means an oath,<lb/>but it is exceedingly strange language.<lb/>I was called to account, because I said<lb/>at the last election, that politically Ca<lb break="no"/>nada was corrupt. Mr. Cartier says<lb/>some of the members of the House<lb/> 
and all our delegates have violated<lb/>their solemn oath and broken the trea<lb break="no"/>ty, and was he called to account ? Our<lb/>delegates could make but one treaty<lb/>that would be binding : that was to<lb/>call their Legislature together when<lb/>they got home, and make their Scheme<lb/>law without appealing to the people.<lb/>That was what they violated, and it<lb/>was well for them that they did violate<lb/>it. Another count in the indictment<lb/>is, the Government have not taken<lb/>proper precautionary measures in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the defence of the Province.<lb/>My hon. colleague (Mr. F.) said it was<lb/>wrong to expend that $30,000 in the<lb/>city of Fredericton. ( <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName>.—I<lb/>gave no opinion about the expenditure<lb/>of last year at all. I said the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment could have had the thirty days<lb/>drill in the month of March on the bor<lb break="no"/>ders of the Province, and thus complied<lb/>with all the law requires, without add<lb break="no"/>ing to the public expenditure.) It is a <lb/>bad time to drill a man just as you<lb/>want to use him. Drill your men<lb/>when you have the time. ( <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. Gla<lb break="no"/>zier</persName>.—Half of those who drilled last<lb/>summer have gone out of the coun<lb break="no"/>try.) Name me a dozen. It is just <lb/>like the cry got up that the young men<lb/>were leaving the country because we<lb/>have not got Confederation. Young<lb/>men leave every country at all times ;<lb/>therefore it was nonsense to get up this<lb/>cry. My hon. colleague says he holds<lb/>the Government responsible for every<lb/>act of the Commander-in-Chief. I do<lb/>not agree with him in this. (Mr. Need<lb break="no"/>ham then referred to the law concern<lb break="no"/>

     ing the Commander-in-Chief passed in 
     <lb/>
     1862, and endeavored to prove that the 
     <lb/>
     Governor in Council was only responsi<lb break="no"/>ble for the money which was expended 
     <lb/>
     for military purposes, an the Com<lb break="no"/>mander-in-Chief was alone responsible 
     <lb/>
     for any act of mis-feasance, mal-feas<lb break="no"/>ance or the disposition of the troops ) In 
     <lb/>
     regard to Fenianism. I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     there is one native Fenian in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince connected with any Circle or any 
     <lb/>
     Head Centre, aud I do not believe there 
     <lb/>
     everwill be one in this country. I do 
     <lb/>
     not believe it ever was the intention of 
     <lb/>
     any fillibusters in the United States to 
     <lb/>
     make raids upon any of the British 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. It is an old saying that "the 
     <lb/>
      dog that bites does not bark." Men 
     <lb/>
     don't make such boasts in order to ena<lb break="no"/>ble their opponents to be prepared. I 
     <lb/>
     do not believe that Roberts or O'Maho<lb break="no"/>ney ever dreamed of crossing the bor<lb break="no"/>der line of these Provinces. If they 
     <lb/>
     did, I have faith in the integrity of that 
     <lb/>
     great nation alongside of us to know 
     <lb/>
     that whatever wrong  she may have 
     <lb/>
     suffered at the hand of other nations, 
     <lb/>
     in their opinions and sympathies, she 
     <lb/>
     has too high an opinion ol her dig<lb break="no"/>nity as a nation, and of her stand<lb break="no"/>ing among the family of nations on the 
     <lb/>
     earth, to allow any fillibustering expedi<lb break="no"/>tion to cross her land to go to another 
     <lb/>
     country and raise the flag ot rebellion to 
     <lb/>
     overthrow the government of that coun<lb break="no"/>try. So long as that power stands, so long 
     <lb/>
     will she, in her own integrity and digni<lb break="no"/>ty, maintain that international law which 
     <lb/>
     is the life of the world. I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     in the doctrine of Fenianism, but I en<lb break="no"/>tertain my views in regard to the wrongs 
     <lb/>
     of Ireland. My hon. friend (Mr. Kerr) 
     <lb/>
     spoke of the Union of Scotland with Eng<lb break="no"/>land. It is a matter of history that the 
     <lb/>
     purse of Queen Anne was drained to the 
     <lb/>
     dregs to purchase the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament of Scotland to sell their coun<lb break="no"/>try, and the names of the men who sold 
     <lb/>
     it are this day in eternal infamy. Scot<lb break="no"/>land at that time was crippled, for she 
     <lb/>
     had just come out of the great Darien 
     <lb/>
     expedition, and her ships and commerce 
     <lb/>
     were not protected by the British flag, 
     <lb/>
     but the moment she came into that union 
     <lb/>
     her commerce was extended and her ships 
     <lb/>
      protected by the Union Jack of old Eng<lb break="no"/>land. How was the Union with lreland 
     <lb/>
       effected ? By fraud and rapine. We are 
     <lb/>
     told this in history, and it cannot be ob<lb break="no"/>literated. Men in Ireland sold their par<lb break="no"/>liament for Lords, Earls, Dukes, and pal<lb break="no"/>try pelf. I do not say it was a natural 
     <lb/>
     consequence, but it stands as a beaccu 
     <lb/>
     light that scarely any one of them died a 
     <lb/>
     natural death. Scotland has benefitted 
     <lb/>
     by that Union, but let Scotland have what 
     <lb/>
     we now have here, a Parliament of our 
     <lb/>
     own, with an independent local self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and you would see where she would 
     <lb/>
     be now.

     ADJOUENED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S 
     <lb/>
     ' AMENDMENT. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
             resumed. I shall 
     <lb/>
     now quote my hon. colleague's (Mr.F:) 
     <lb/>
     Speech on a Want of Confidence mo<lb break="no"/>tion in 1854. which was published in 
     <lb/>
     what is called the " political primer," in 
     <lb/>
     which he gives his opinion of the Col<lb break="no"/>onial office, and despatches from that, 
     <lb/>
     office, I shall make very few comments. 
     <lb/>
     This speech was delivered when the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. John, A. Street was Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral. He (Mr. F.) said, "a despatch, in his 
     <lb/>
     (the Attorney General's) estimation, was 
     <lb/>
     more of political value than the action of 
     <lb/>
     the Local Legislature," and again, " he 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. F ) would like to see an attempt 
     <lb/>
     to carry the despatch into effect ; he told 
     <lb/>
    Mr. Brown last spring, to pay no at<lb break="no"/>tention to it, and to come to the House 
     <lb/>if he wished. The Executive had al<lb break="no"/>lowed this to pass without remark or 
     <lb/>remonstrance, though it was a direct 
     <lb/>attempt to restrict them in the right to 
     <lb/>self-government." My hon. friend is 
     <lb/>not consistent here with the opinions he 
     <lb/>now expresses. He charges the seven 
     <lb/>with using strong language in their re<lb break="no"/>ply to Mr. Cardwell's despatches, and 
     <lb/>in 1854 he accuses  the Government of 
     <lb/>bowing down to the Colonial Office. 
     <lb/>Here was a despatch come out from 
     <lb/>home stating that a Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cillor could not leave unless his resigna<lb break="no"/>tion was accepted by Her Majesty, and 
     <lb/>that the Governor had no power to ac<lb break="no"/>cept it. This was not only in reference 
     <lb/>to a despatch from the Colonial Office, 
     <lb/>but it involved one of the Crown preroga<lb break="no"/>tives, which every man is supposed to 
     <lb/>submit to. But says my hon. colleague, 
     <lb/>though it be a royal prerogative, I say 
     <lb/>to you, Mr. Brown, pay no attention to 
     <lb/>the Queen's prerogative. Pay no atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the Colonial Office, but come to 
     <lb/>the House when you like. I hold he is 
     <lb/>bound in duty to his and my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, and to the people of this Province, 
     <lb/>to show why, after having made such a 
     <lb/>treasonable expression, he now turns 
     <lb/>round and charges this Government 
     <lb/>with truckling to the Colonial Office. 
     <lb/>Then again, he says, " by allowing Sir 
     <lb/>Edmund Head to appoint Judge Cartier 
     <lb/>Chief Justice, the Council had quailed 
     <lb/>before him." It seems to he his idea 
     <lb/>that any Government in which he is not, 
     <lb/>quails before the British Government. 
     <lb/>He goes on. " They had allowed the 
     <lb/>Province to be governed by despatches, 
     <lb/>and inroad after inroad to be made upon 
     <lb/>the principles ot self-government. " 
     <lb/>If these were then his views, has he 
     <lb/>abandoned Responsible Government 
     <lb/>now ? If we were to form our opinion 
     <lb/>of Responsible Government from its 
     <lb/>action in this country, and from the ac<lb break="no"/>tion of its supporters in this House, then 
     <lb/>in truth and verity is Responsible Go<lb break="no"/>vernment a humbug, while in reality it 
     <lb/>is not so. But I hold that if my hon.<lb/>colleague meant what he said on that<lb/>occasion, then his charges against this<lb/>Government, in respect to those des-<lb break="maybe"/>patches, are utterly valuless. He con<lb break="no"/>tinues : " This discussion would put an<lb/>end to government by despatches."<lb/>Who revived the ghost and brought it<lb/>from the shades below ? My hon. friend,<lb/>he is the man who put him down, and<lb/>now he blows his trumpet and the ghost<lb/>appears. Then again he goes on : " It<lb/>would teach all future Governments to<lb/>act like men of spirit and independence<lb/>and not truckle to any Governor or<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     
     Colonial Secretary." But now he says, 
     <lb/>
     how dare you do as l told  you ten years 
     <lb/>
     ago. That despatch, written by the im<lb break="no"/>mortal seven as they are called. is an 
     <lb/>
     evidence that they do not truckle to the 
     <lb/>
     Colonial Secretary. No man need be 
     <lb/>
     ashamed to sign that despatch, and the 
     <lb/>
     only regret that I have—if it is ever 
     <lb/>
     connected with the history of the coun<lb break="no"/>try as it ought to be—is, that I cannot 
     <lb/>
     constitutionally append my name to it. 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. Mr. Ritchie, who supported 
     <lb/>
     my hon. colleague in that debate, and 
     <lb/>
     assisted him to overthrow the then Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, says : " On the 28th April, 
     <lb/>
     1851. he (Mr. R.)moved the following! 
     <lb/>
     resolution :—  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     " Resolved, That. while this House 
     <lb/>
     should always receive 'ivitli respect, the 
     <lb/>
     
     House cannot but look on the extract of  
     <lb/>
     the despatch of Earl Grey, dated the 
     <lb/>
     25th day of November, l850, submitted 
     <lb/>
     by His Excellency, by message of the 
     <lb/>
     13th day of February last, as a dictation 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent, not only with the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the country, but in direct opposition 
     <lb/>
     to the principles of self-government, 
     <lb/>
     heretofore conceded, and which, if suc<lb break="no"/>cessfully persisted in , makes Responsi<lb break="no"/>ble Government a mere mockery and 
     <lb/>
    delusion. "   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Dame rumor said, that when that Go<lb break="no"/>vernment was formed my hon. colleague 
     <lb/>
     agreed with Judge Ritchie that he was 
     <lb/>
     to have the Judgeship, and my hon. col<lb break="no"/>league, the Attorney General—(Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fisher—No such agreement) —there 
     <lb/>
     were many ways of coming to an un<lb break="no"/>derstanding and yet enabling the con<lb break="no"/>tractors to say it was not so. But, at 
     <lb/>
     all events, so the day happened Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ritchie did get the Judgeship. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     colleague, the Attorney Generalship, 
     <lb/>
     just as Dame Rumor reported, in this 
     <lb/>
     instance, " common rumor was not a 
     <lb/>
     common liar." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I came into the House in 1851 to op<lb break="no"/>pose the then existing Government. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. colleague and Judge Wilmot were 
     <lb/>
     in the Government, and I was sent here 
     <lb/>
     by the Liberals of St. John, who believed 
     <lb/>
     in the doctrine of Responsible Govern- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment—to oppose them because they had 
     <lb/>
     forfeited their right to be called Liberals, 
     <lb/>
     by abandoning Responsible Government, 
     <lb/>
     by shelving themselves in with parties 
     <lb/>
     who were their opponents, and having 
     <lb/>
     done so they could not say they did it 
     <lb/>
     with their eyes shut, because they knew 
     <lb/>
     that after Responsible Government was 
     <lb/>
     adopted in Nova Scotia, through the hard 
     <lb/>
     work of the Hon. Joseph Howe, they 
     <lb/>
     formed a coalaiion with the so-called 
     <lb/>
    Tory Government, and the result was 
     <lb/>that they smashed to pieces. When they 
     <lb/>attempted to do the same thing here, they 
     <lb/>must have known they would have fallen
