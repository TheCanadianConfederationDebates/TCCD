<!-- GL, 2018-02-28, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
   
            <!--<p>
     occurred, although I have no doubt that 
     <lb/>a great majority of the men that took ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of thatAct were honest men, for <lb/>it does not follow that because a man<lb/>went through that Bankrupt Court that<lb/>he was a rogue. It is one thing to charge<lb/>a man with being dishonest, and another<lb/>thing to prove him a rogue.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" Who steals my purse, steals trash ; 'tis<lb/>something, nothing,<lb/>'Twas mine, 'tis his ; has been slave to<lb/>thousands!<lb/>But he that filches from me my good name<lb/>Robs me of that which not enriches him,<lb/>And makes me poor indeed."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    It is a very easy matter to give a<lb/>debtor a bad name, which he will find it<lb/>a hard matter to get rid of, when he does<lb/>not deserve it. We should protect the<lb/>poor unfortunate honest man, even if<lb/>some rogues get the benefit of it. You<lb/>hear judges, lawyers and ministers quote :<lb/>" It is better that ninety-nine guilty per<lb break="no"/>sons should escape, than that one inno<lb break="no"/>cent person should be punished." The<lb/>Judges, in laying down the principles of<lb/>the law, in addressing the Jury, say : " If<lb/>you have a reasonable doubt concerning<lb/>the guilt of the prisoner, give him the<lb/>benefit of that doubt." There are forty-<lb break="yes"/>one of us here, and we say in our own<lb/>strength, we are the assembled wisdom<lb/>of New Brunswick. The law says so,<lb/>when it commands the Sheriff to return<lb/>wise and discreet men, and they have<lb/>returned those men who sit here. There<lb break="no"/>fore, if we are the assembled wisdom,<lb/>let us show our wisdom, not only by our<lb/>conduct as men while here, but by our<lb/>acts as legislators, which will prove to the<lb/>people of this Province that we have not<lb/>been sent here in vain. Let us legislate<lb/>for the poor as well as for the rich. If<lb/>we cannot feel for the poor, some of us<lb/>cannot feel for ourselves. This Bill has<lb/>long been called for, and somebody had<lb/>to take what is called in Parliamentary<lb/>language, the initiative. I have done it,<lb/>but I am perfectly willing for any other <lb/>member who has a better Bill, to strike<lb/>out this Bill from the beginning to the<lb/>end, and introduce other sections in lieu<lb/>thereof. I would not care if it was cut<lb/>up so I would not know it, so long as it<lb/>contained the principles of this Bill. I<lb/>should rejoice to think that though my<lb/>Bill should sink, I had been the means of<lb/>bringing forth a Bill that would have the<lb/>desired effect. But if you have no bet<lb break="no"/>ter, don't go against this because it is a<lb/>new thing. You have tried Bankrupt<lb/>Bills, and they have proved a failure.<lb/>Try this, and you will never repeal it.<lb/>Is it a new principle ? We came here to<lb/>legislate on new principles. What is the<lb/>use of men sitting down here and origi<lb break="no"/>nating no new thing at all ? When the <lb/>Sheriff returned " Mr. Needham" as the<lb/>most wise in all York, why should he tell<lb/>the Sheriff by his acts that he told an<lb/>untruth ? I want to show them they did<lb/>not make a mistake. Are you afraid of<lb/>all new things ? If so, the world would<lb/>soon come to an end. It is a new thing<lb/>for a man to get married, and if all men<lb/>were afraid of new things, men would<lb/>never get married. It is because people<lb/>are afraid of new things that makes so<lb/>many bachelors. The same thing might<lb/>be said regarding the Canadian volun<lb break="no"/>teers, who were dragged from under the<lb/>beds, and brought up to the mark at the<lb/>point of the bayonet. It is no wonder<lb/>

     they wanted to get the Bluenoses to fight<lb/>for them.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. FRASER said that, under this<lb/>Bill, a creditor could attach nine-tenths<lb/>of his debtors' property, not allowing<lb/>the other creditors to share in it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. NEEDHAM. My impression<lb/>was, that when the whole of a man's<lb/>property was taken, it was an act of<lb/>bankruptcy, but if a less amount was<lb/>required to constitute such an act, I<lb/>would have no objection. My object<lb/>in guarding the Bill in this way was,<lb/>that I did not want to give the debtor a<lb/>chance to become bankrupt until he<lb/>ought to be. Therefore, I put in that<lb/>all his property must be attached before<lb/>he could take advantage of the act.<lb/>There never was a time in the history<lb/>of the country, when it was more ne<lb break="no"/>cessary and essential that something of<lb/>this kind should be done. We have had<lb/>seasons of depression in consequence of<lb/>the war across the border, which has<lb/>caused our trade to be depressed, but<lb/>now we are looking up a little. The<lb/>little cloud which, when it commenced,<lb/>was about the size of a man's hand, has<lb/>rained the last drop upon the top of<lb/>Mount Ararat, and times of great pros<lb break="no"/>perity are coming. I do not prophecy<lb/>it ; but any man looking at the past, and<lb/>from the past, judging the future, will<lb/>say, there are seasons of prosperity<lb/>coming over this little spot called New<lb/>Brunswick. Commerce is going to rise,<lb/>business is increasing, deals are up,<lb/>and it is only when men are enjoying<lb/>prosperity, that they will go into large<lb/>operations, expecting large returns ; but<lb/>all at once a crash comes, and then the<lb/>honest man is bowed down to the dust.<lb/>Therefore, let us prepare for the unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate time to come afterwards ; and in<lb/>our prosperity make a law which will<lb/>not only benefit the debtor but the credi<lb break="no"/>tor, and, by so doing, show to the world<lb/>that our aim and object is to make such<lb/>laws as shall reflect credit upon our<lb break="no"/>selves and do our duty to the men who<lb/>sent us here.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Dr. THOMPSON said he could not<lb/>agree with the principle of abolishing<lb/>imprisonment for debt. If they wanted<lb/>to keep men honest, they must make<lb/>them amenable for every dishonest act. If a<lb/>man does not pay his debs, and has no<lb/>wish to pay them, he ought to be punish<lb break="no"/>ed, and under the present law we have<lb/>the power over him to punish him. Un<lb break="no"/>der the proposed law a poor man could<lb/>not get along ; if he could not get his wages<lb/>people would not trust him, for by abol<lb break="no"/>ishing imprisonment for debt, they would<lb/>have no power over him. There was no<lb/>great quantity of debtors put in jail, not<lb/>more than one out of a hundred. They<lb/>had better let the 99 excape as heretofore<lb/>and let this law alone. If a man who<lb/>gets into difficulty is an honest and civil<lb/>man, they would not find one man out of<lb/>ten thousand who would incarcerate him.<lb/>He was going to vote against the bill, for<lb/>they had had too many bankrupt laws alrea<lb break="no"/>dy ; by one of them he had already lost thir<lb break="no"/>teen hundred and some odd pounds. " A<lb/>burnt child dreads the fire." They had <lb/>better not put temptation in the debtor's<lb/>way. We pray to be delivered from<lb/>temptation, and he would add, deliver<lb/>us from this Bill.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Col. BOYD thought a Bill of this kind<lb/>was very desirable. If a man owed them<lb/>sum of money, they had a chance by<lb/>this attachment to secure themselves ; and<lb/>if the man owed more than his property<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>was worth, the creditors all shared alike.<lb/>He had sued a man a few days ago who<lb/>gave him notice that he would swear out.<lb/>He had property, but he swore he had<lb/>none. The Justice had almost come to<lb/>the conclusion that he must discharge<lb/>him. He (Mr. Boyd) offered him one dol<lb break="no"/>lar a day to work for him, and would<lb/>pay him half his wages every Saturday<lb/>night, the other half to go to his credit ;<lb/>but he would not work. If there had<lb/>been an attachment law, he would have<lb/>paid himself out of that man's pro<lb break="no"/>perty.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. WILMOT said he differed from<lb/>his hon. friend who said that an honest<lb/>man never would be sued. As far as he<lb/>had watched the course of events in St.<lb/>John, the only plan for an honest debtor<lb/>was to run the country. The idea of lock<lb break="no"/>ing a man up in jail, he looked upon as one<lb/>of the relics of barbarism. He knew an<lb/>honest man in St. John who had given all<lb/>his property up to trustees, but had been<lb/>kept on the limits for four years by<lb/>one man, and that was not the only case<lb/>of the kind. The only way for them at<lb/>present is to run the country. He did<lb/>not think it was desirable to drive men<lb/>out of the country because they met with<lb/>losses over which they had no control.<lb/>In England they had abolished all bank<lb break="no"/>rupt laws and imprisonment for debt, and<lb/>had some very simple law instead. Im<lb break="no"/>prisonment for debt was also abolished in<lb/>the United States. Whatever would do<lb/>away with the credit system would be be<lb break="no"/>neficial to the country. There is plenty<lb/>of property in the country, but there is a <lb/>want of a circulating medium. When<lb/>times get bad, there is no money to re<lb break="no"/>present the property, and in consequence<lb/>property becomes depressed in value,<lb/>therefore difficulties will arise. What we<lb/>want is less credit and more cash, and<lb/>then we would have less debt.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. NEEDHAM thought it advisable<lb/>that the Bill should be referred to a Select<lb/>Committee, to take into consideration the<lb/>suggestions thrown out by hon. members<lb/>for its improvement. He would there<lb break="no"/>fore move that they report progress.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    A conversational debate then took place<lb/>concerning how the bill should be im<lb break="no"/>proved in the hands of the Committee,<lb/>and progress was reported.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    House adjourned until 10 A.M. to-mor-<lb break="maybe"/>row.<lb/>

            <p>    The House went into Committee of<lb/>the Whole (Mr. Young in the Chair)<lb/>on a Bill " to make better provisions for<lb/>the naval defence of the Province."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    The <persName ref="pers:GILL1">PROVINCIAL SECRETARY</persName> <lb/>said, the Bill explained itself. The<lb/>House had already given the Lieutenant<lb/>Governor and Council authority to make<lb/>such provisions for the defence of the<lb/>Province as the exigencies of the time<lb/>might require, and the present Bill<lb/>asked no further authority than had<lb/>been given, further, than it gave special<lb/>legislative power to provide for naval<lb/>defence.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. WETMORE remarked, when the<lb/>Provincial Secretary said the Bill ex<lb break="no"/>plained itself, he did not understand<lb/>him, for the Bill did not explain itself<lb/>at all. He was not opposed to it, but<lb/>he thought that the House had a right<lb/>to expect some further information.<lb/>

 <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> <fw type="num">33</fw>

 Let them consider how dangerous it<lb/>
was to give up power without knowing<lb/>
fully what was the necessity of granting<lb/>
it, and for what purpose it would be<lb/>
used! The House had a right to infor<lb break="no"/>mation, and, as a matter of common<lb/>
decency, the Government ought to<lb/>
give it.</p>
            <p>The <persName ref="pers:GILL1">PROVINCIAL SECRETARY</persName>.<lb/>
The Government were not disposed to<lb/>
withhold information. He had stated<lb/>
that the Bill only carried out the reso<lb break="no"/>lution passed by the House. It gave<lb/>
the Governor and Council authority to<lb/>
make use of every means to defend the<lb/>
Province by employing armed vessels.<lb/>
If any attack was made, it would likely<lb/>
be by sea. In Nova Scotia, it had been<lb/>
though necessary to pass a similar Bill.<lb/>
It might not be necessary to use the <lb/>
power granted in the Bill, but it was<lb/>
necessary to give the power. The time<lb/>
was unprecedented in the Province, and<lb/>
they must take every precautionary<lb/>
measure to meet any danger. If any<lb/>
expense for naval defence was called<lb/>
for, he was disposed to be as prudent<lb/>
as possible in expenditure from the <lb/>
general revenue, and to use all proper, <lb/>
economy. He assured the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for St. John (Mr. Wetmore) that <lb/>
the Government did not refuse and were<lb/>
always willing to give the most ample <lb/>
information.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCL1">MR. McCLELAN</persName> quite agreed with <lb/>
the remarks of the Provincial Secretary ;<lb/>
the House had already given the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment full authority to take every<lb/>
precautionary measure for the defence<lb/>
of the Province, but he hoped, that in<lb/>
the execution of their trust, they would<lb/>
exercise the most rigid economy. There<lb/>
was a danger, at this time, that the re<lb break="no"/>sources of the Province would be drawn<lb/>
upon too largely.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CONN1">MR. CONNELL</persName> said he was going to <lb/>
vote for every Bill regarding the army<lb/>
and navy. It was time to give the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment all the authority and all the <lb/>
means they required, and to show that<lb/>
they were determined to defend their <lb/>
homes and firesides. But when he said<lb/>
that the Government should have the <lb/>
fullest authority, he wished to be under<lb break="no"/>stood they must exercise proper eco<lb break="no"/>nomy, for they would be held strictly<lb/>
responsible for the expenditure of every<lb/>
dollar. If there was great alarm in the <lb/>
country, he though that it had been <lb/>
created, in a great measure, by the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. It was reported that the <lb/>
Government were taking active mea<lb break="no"/>sures for the protection of St. John, that<lb/>
the militia were called out there. That <lb/>
was right; but why all these prepara<lb break="no"/>tions at St. John, when the country of <lb/>
the Upper River was most exposed to<lb/>
danger? As he had said before he did <lb/>
not fear an invasion from a large force, <lb/>
but from incursions from call bands<lb/>
of marauders upon the border ; and the <lb/>
Government had fallen very far short of <lb/>
their duty when they neglected to pro<lb break="no"/>tect the frontier.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LEWI1">MR. LEWIS</persName> said, that the Bill ought <lb/>
to be passed unanimously. He felt that <lb/>
the country was in great alarm about<lb/>
the Fenian movement. He hoped the<lb/>
Government would take every precau<lb break="no"/>tionary measure for its defence, and<lb/>
that the country would sustain them.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BOYD1">MR. BOYD</persName> said, that this was the first <lb/>
time when such a Bill had been intro<lb break="no"/>duced in the House. He did not fear<lb/>
that the Government would expend a <lb/>
great deal of money for naval defence,<lb/>
  
<cb/>

and he had every confidence in them. <lb/>
The Bill was necessary, if for no other<lb/>
purpose than the protection of the<lb/>
Fisheries. He did not doubt that the<lb/>
Imperial Government would order here<lb/>
armed vessels to protect the Fisheries,<lb/>
but the country ought to show that it<lb/>
was willing to do something.</p>






            <p><persName ref="pers:MCMI1">MR. McMILLAN</persName>, quoting the first<lb/>
section of the Bill, wished to have infor<lb break="no"/>mation how the Government were going<lb/>
to make use of the power when they got<lb/>
hold of it. Did they intend to purchase<lb/>
or build gun vessels for the defence of<lb/>
the country and the Fisheries?</p>






            <p><persName ref="pers:GILL1">PROVINCIAL SECRETARY</persName>.—The<lb/>
member of Restigouche knew that it <lb/>
could not be the intention of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to purchase or build armed vessels<lb/>
of war. It was not the object to employ<lb/>
the vessels in the protection of the Fish<lb break="no"/>eries.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">MR. NEEDHAM</persName> spoke of the cause<lb/>
that had produced all the alarm and ex<lb break="no"/>citement. As regarded the alarm, he<lb/>
confessed it had made no impression upon<lb/>
him. It appeared to him mere nonsense;<lb/>
and he would prophesy that at the end of <lb/>
this time next year, it would be found<lb/>
that there had been a great deal more<lb/>
smoke than fire about the Fenian alarm. <lb/>
The House had already given the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment all the resources the Province, and<lb/>
authority to take every measure for its <lb/>
defence. Then whay was the use of ask<lb break="no"/>ing them to explain a part? The mem<lb break="no"/>ber of Carleton (Mr. Connell) said that<lb/>
the Government has credited the alarm ; <lb/>
but if he could believe his ears, that hon.<lb/>
member had done more to create alarm<lb/>
than any one else, and had been himself<lb/>
most frightened of any, Mr. Connell said<lb/>
that Woodstock was absolutely undefend<lb break="no"/>ed ; but he (Mr. N.) (here the hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber gave the details of the information he<lb/>
had received from an individual from that <lb/>
part of the country,) knew that in Wood<lb break="no"/>stock, Florenceville, Hardscrabble,
&amp;c.,<lb/>
there were seven or eight companies, <lb/>
and a home guard fully armed and equip<lb break="no"/>ped. As to the Bill, it was all nonsence<lb/>
to suppose that the Government were<lb/>
going to build or purchase war vessels.<lb/>
All they asked power to do was to hire<lb/>
them if necessary. The Bill gave the<lb/>
Government no more authority than the<lb/>
Imperial Act. If the Government thought<lb/>
is absolutely necessary to have a portion<lb/>
of a navy, they ought to have the power.<lb/>
The moment the Bill was passed the<lb/>
Government must go to work and show<lb/>
that they were determined to do some<lb break="no"/>thing. With regard to economy, that<lb/>
was all very fine ; but were he in a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, he would do what was right,<lb/>
irrespective of what might be said, no<lb/>
matter whether he might be kicked out<lb/>
or kicked in. He was perfectly willing<lb/>
to vote, for the Bill, and had every faith
<lb/>
that the Government would exercise <lb/>
economy. He had great faith in the <lb/>
Government. Let the hon. members take<lb/>
up the public accounts now published,<lb/>
and examine for themselves, and see if<lb/>
from first to last the most rigid economy<lb/>
had not been exercised. Never, until<lb/>
this year, had the public accounts been <lb/>
put forth in such a simple manner of Dr.<lb/>
and Cr., showing what was received, ex<lb break="no"/>pended, and what was owed, so that every<lb/>
man, of whatever capacity, in the country<lb/>
could understand them. Very different<lb/>
from the old hugger-mugger system, that<lb/>
only made multiplication more mystified.<lb/>
Economy, he went on to say, was all very<lb/>
well ; but he did not like cheese-paring.<lb/>
           

            <cb/>
          
He would not support a paltry, cheese<lb break="no"/>paring Government. When he supported<lb/>
a Government, he must be sure when they<lb/>
were born somebody must have died.<lb/>
With regard to the BIll, if there was an<lb/>
expectation of serious trouble, he was<lb/>
prepared to give the Government all the<lb/>
power that was necessary, and would put<lb/>
the country in a proper state of defence.<lb/>
If Carleton and Woodstock, were unpro<lb break="no"/>tected, he would protect them ; and if St.<lb/>
Stephen and St. Andrews were unpro<lb break="no"/>tected, he would also protect them. If<lb/>
they were not now protected, they ought<lb/>
to be. Mr. Needham then proceeded to <lb/>
to read an extract concerning Fenianism<lb/>
and the comtempt in which it was held in<lb/>
the States, from the New York Times, <lb/>
copied into the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName>.—The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> is no<lb/>
authority.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">MR. NEEDHAM</persName>.—The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> was<lb/>
good authority. It had never been bought<lb/>
and sold. He read the whole of the ex<lb break="no"/>tract from it, and commented upon it.<lb/>
He quoted with particular emphasis the<lb/>
following passage:</p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>"But shou'd the necessity arise for the<lb/>
United States Government to assery the<lb/>
supremacy of the municipal law of the <lb/>
country, that duty will be loyally perform<lb break="no"/>ed, even if our lately neutral friends are <lb/>
the first to profit thereby."</p></quote>


            <p>He said he had read that sentiment<lb/>
with an immence amount of pleasure.<lb/>
Those words ought to be engraven in<lb/>
gold, and hung up in the most conspicu<lb break="no"/>ous places in the halls of every Provin<lb break="no"/>cial Legislature, and in the House of <lb/>
Commons in England ; and they ought<lb/>
to be engraven in the heart of every true<lb/>
man. Here was a great nation that had<lb/>
been deluged in blood, and been over<lb break="no"/>whelmed with taxation, and all this to<lb/>
work out and prove to the world that<lb/>
glorious principle of self-government ; <lb/>
and in that mighty struggle to stay re<lb break="no"/>bellion, he must say that they received<lb/>
anything by sympathy from these Colo<lb break="no"/>nies. Here was that great nation pro<lb break="no"/>claiming that, though its "neutral<lb/>
friends" would be the first to share the<lb/>
benefit, it was determined to addert the<lb/>
supremacy of its municipal law, and pro<lb break="no"/>tect these Colonies from any raid from<lb/>
American territory. He rejoiced that he<lb/>
was here to pay to the men of that great<lb/>
nation a just tribute to their noblemess. <lb/>
This great Northern American Continent<lb/>
had the salvation of many a crown head <lb/>
in Europe. Many of them would have been<lb/>
tottered to the centre long before this, <lb/>
had not this great Continent received<lb/>
their disaffected subjects as free men,<lb/>
who otherwise would, by rebellion, have<lb/>
obtained the glorious privilege of freedom.<lb/>
These men looked across the broad At<lb break="no"/>lantic to this great, glorious and free<lb/>
land, and when they landed on North<lb/>
American soil they breathed the air of <lb/>
pure and unalloyed freedom. It had been<lb/>
said that the Antis were disloyal, but he<lb/>
flung back the charge with contempt. <lb/>
He was loyal to his Queen ; he was loyal <lb/>
to his country ; he loved the British law<lb/>
and he loved the British Constitution.<lb/>
These were the honest sentiments of his <lb/>
heart.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName> said that this Bill was<lb/>
working out one thing. One of the great<lb break="no"/>est bugbears held up by the Antis was if<lb/>
the Province went into Confederation we<lb/>
would have to support a navy. It ap<lb break="no"/>peared by the Bill that we were going to<lb/>

 get one by degrees. The member of<lb/>
York had highly enlogised the United<lb/>
States, and had quoted from a New York<lb/>
paper to the effect that Government would<lb/>
protect the Colonies from invasion. He<lb/>
had also flung back the charge that the<lb/>
Antis were disloyal. Now he questioned<lb/>
the obeience of that child that would<lb/>
not obey its parent—loyalty was of the<lb/>
heart and not of the pocket, and no men<lb/>
could be loyal unless they obeyed the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. He would quote also from a<lb/>
New York paper. (The hon. member<lb/>
read extract.) Here we found that they<lb/>
were opposed in the United States to the<lb/>
Union of the Colonies and the Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway, and the Antis were opposed<lb/>
to them also. He thought that there was<lb/>
some connection between disloyalty and<lb/>
anti-Confederation. Mr. Lindsay went<lb/>
on to quote from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Freeman</hi>,
and extract<lb/>
from a letter signed A I, and commented<lb/>
upon it, denying that he was there charged,<lb/>
had ever said that the Fenians belonged<lb/>
to one denomination. He had never tried<lb/>
to set denomination against denomination,<lb/>
or class against class ; be believed every<lb/>
man was entitled to equal privileges and<lb/>
freedom. He then went on to deny the<lb/>
truth of the statement made to the hon.<lb/>
member of York (Mr. Needham) that<lb/>
there were six or seven comapnies in<lb/>
Woodstock well armed and equipped ; <lb/>
there was only one company. He thought<lb/>
something should be done for the defence<lb/>
of Carleton and the frontier. If the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of the raiders was plunder, they were<lb/>
more likely to attack small towns and vi<lb break="no"/>lages than cities. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> asked, was the country<lb/>
prepared to go into an army and navy,<lb/>
and support them out of the ordinary re<lb break="no"/>venue P He thought the Government<lb/>
ought to tell the House what steps they<lb/>
were prepared to take to raise the ways<lb/>
and means. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> supposed the object of <lb/>
the Bill was to meet the present emer<lb break="no"/>gency. As the House had already given<lb/>
the Government all power necessary to<lb/>
meet it, he could not see how they could<lb/>
refuse to pass the Bill. He was not dis<lb break="no"/>posed to let his hon. colleague (Mr. N.)<lb/>
laugh this matter off. He believed that<lb/>
there was ground for serious danger. The<lb/>
time had arrived that had been looked<lb/>
forward to with apprehension for years.<lb/>
When the war of the Union over, the dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty would arise when a lawless mo , ac<lb break="no"/>customed to the use of arms, and indis<lb break="no"/>posed to industry, would be thrown out<lb/>
upon the country, ready to engage in any<lb/>
raid or desperate undertaking, and enlist<lb/>
in any cause so that they could indulge<lb/>
their taste for rapine and plunder. This<lb/>
Bill did not refer at all to the Fisheries<lb/>
We had, for that protection, flung over<lb/>
us the powerful arm of the British Em<lb break="no"/>pire—an Empire, before whose power the<lb/>
grandeur of Rome in its palmiest days<lb/>
paled. Mr. Fisher then quoted from the<lb/>
Memorandum from His Excellency re<lb break="no"/>garding the defence of the Province, to<lb/>
prove that this alarm in te country was<lb/>
not a mere matter of moonshine. It lay<lb/>
not in the mouth of any man to laugh this <lb/>
thing away.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">MR. WETMORE</persName> said he had looked<lb/>
over the Bill, and he had found in it a <lb/>
great number of blanks. It was evident <lb/>
the Government were determined that<lb/>
the House should get no information on<lb/>
this or any other subject. He thought it<lb/>
was his right that he should get the infor<lb break="no"/>mation he wanted. It was extraordinary<lb/>
that the Attorney General was not found<lb/>
      

            <cb/>
       
 in his
place now. All the available re<lb break="no"/>sources of the Province had gone for mil<lb break="no"/>itary purposes, and now the country wait<lb break="no"/>ed the mercy of the Government. If the<lb/>
Government expected to retain the confi<lb break="no"/>dence of the country, they must in their<lb/>
turn, be more confiding. Mr. Wetmore<lb/>
then read the Bill, and commented upon<lb/>
it, and said he found it a prefect blank. <lb/>
He did not intend to oppose the Bill, but<lb/>
called upon the Provincial Secretary to <lb/>
give some information respecting it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILL1">PROVINCIAL SECRETARY</persName>. The<lb/>
hon. member did not intend to oppose<lb/>
the Bill, but he caught at every opportu<lb break="no"/>nity to say something derogatory of the<lb/>
Government. He had told them he asked <lb/>
the House to pass the Bill, that the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment might have full authority to<lb/>
take the necessary steps for the defence<lb/>
of the country. He had told them that<lb/>
there was reaseon to fear that some danger<lb/>
would approach the Province by the sea<lb/>
The Bill explained itself and it did ask<lb/>
for more money than had already been<lb/>
granted. The hon. member of St. JOhn<lb/>
(Mr. Wetmore) had made allusions to <lb/>
the Attorney General being away. It<lb/>
was no proof of talent to say these saucy<lb/>
things. He could say them if he liked, <lb/>
but he was better bred. If the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber intended to pursue the course he had<lb/>
taken it would be necessary to meet him<lb/>
in his own manner. He would assure<lb/>
him (Mr. W.) that the country saw through<lb/>
the low, mean insinuations he was conti<lb break="no"/>nually making against the Government.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>. Where are the ways<lb/>
and means to come from? That was a <lb/>
political quesion at any rate.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">MR. WETMORE</persName>. One would think<lb/>
from the ferocious manner in which<lb/>
the Provincial Secretary attacked him<lb/>
(Mr. W.) that he was sufficient<lb/>
in himself to drive out all the ma<lb break="no"/>rauders that would ever attempt to<lb/>
come into the Province. He could<lb/>
thoroughly understand why the Provincial<lb/>
Secretary was so sensitive about any re<lb break="no"/>flection upon the Government. With<lb/>
regard to the Government, the existing<lb/>
opinion in the country was, that they had<lb/>
no mind of their own. They had not<lb/>
even power to appoint to office and, it<lb/>
was said, that the chief head was not a <lb/>
member of the Council at all. He would<lb/>
like to get the information he asked for,<lb/>
if the Provincial Secretary was permitted<lb/>
to give it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill was then passed.</p>

            TO THE ADDRESS.</head>
          

            <p>
<persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> said, he was now called <lb/>
         upon to explain the position in which he<lb/>
stood with regard to the present. He had<lb/>
received permission from His Excellency to<lb/>
use anything where his colleagues and<lb/>
himself had been in conflict. It appeared<lb/>
that he had been charged as being en<lb break="no"/>tirely in error, when he had said he was<lb/>
in favour of the abstract principle of union.<lb/>
There was a distinct difference of opinion<lb/>
between them with regard to the Minute<lb/>
of Council ; and, when the gentlemen<lb/>
who signed that memorandum, said, that<lb/>
he never expressed an opinion in favor of<lb/>
union, he had the authority of Judge<lb/>
Allen to say, that he repeatedly heard<lb/>
him state an opinion in favor of union ; <lb/>
and he was allowed by His Excellency to<lb/>
        

            <cb/>



say, when
that celebrated Minute was<lb/>
before the
Council, that His Excellency<lb/>
referred to
him (Mr. W.) as not opposed<lb/>
to the
abstract principle. When those<lb/>
gentlemen
who signed the Minute said,<lb/>
that he
expressed no such opinion, he<lb/>
said, it
was not the fact. He saw Mr.<lb/>
Fraser in
his place. He happened to be<lb/>
in his (Mr.
W.'s) house when the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was
talked of, and he (Mr. R.) knew<lb/>
whether he
was in favor of the abstract<lb/>
principle
or not. (Mr. Fraser. There<lb/>
was not the
slightest doubt about it.)<lb/>
He had
expressed the same opinion to<lb/>
hundreds of
persons. He had the satis<lb break="no"/>faction of
knowing that when he was<lb/>
called a
traitor to the cause of anti-Con<lb break="no"/>federation,
that the Governor had en<lb break="no"/>dorsed his
opinion. He would ask the<lb/>
Government
if they were opposed to<lb/>
union?
What did the paragraph in the<lb/>
Speech mean? [The hon. member here<lb/>
quoted from the Speech] If these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen were still disposed to union, he<lb/>
would ask again, how was it they agreed<lb/>
to put that paragraph in His Excellency's<lb/>
Speech? [The hon. member quoted the<lb/>
paragraph relating to union in the Reply<lb/>
to the Address.] He would like to know<lb/>
if he was entirely wrong—if the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were entirely right? When he<lb/>
stated his opinion in Toronto, it was in<lb/>
reply to a speech made by Mr. McDou<lb break="no"/>gall, who said, that not only the people of<lb/>
Canada, but the people of the Lower <lb/>
Provinces, were in favor of the Quebec<lb/>
Scheme. In reply, he (Mr. W.) stated,<lb/>
that, certainly, the Quebec Scheme had<lb/>
been put before the people at the polls<lb/>
and they had condemned it. But though<lb/>
they had condemned that scheme, there<lb/>
was a vast number in favor of the abstract<lb/>
principle of union, and that it was only a<lb/>
question of time when a union would be<lb/>
carried—why, it was carried now. He<lb/>
had, he supposed, had more foresight<lb/>
than his former colleagues in this ques<lb break="no"/>tion.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">Mr. Wilmot</persName> then went on to say, that<lb/>
the paragraph in the Speech certain y<lb/>
foreshadowed some Scheme of Union,<lb/>
and he thought the Government ought to<lb/>
come down with it. But he would tell<lb/>
them that any Scheme of Confederation<lb/>
they might submit must involve those<lb/>
two principles :—one, the Federal princi<lb break="no"/>ple, the other, Representation by Popu<lb break="no"/>lation. Lower Canada would insist upon<lb/>
the first, in order to protect her rights,
and<lb/>
Upper Canada must have Represenation <lb/>
by Population. [Attorney General. That<lb/>
was unfair.] Fair, or unfair, no Scheme<lb/>
could be carried that did not involve those<lb/>
two abstract principles. He had strong<lb/>
feelings against these two principles be<lb break="no"/>fore he went to Canada. But when he<lb/>
attended the Convention there, and heard<lb/>
the whole question of trade opened up<lb/>
and discussed, he came to the conclusion<lb/>
that Union must take place. He foresaw<lb/>
also, that the Reciprocity Treaty would<lb/>
be repealed. There was one subject<lb/>
brought forward at that Convention that<lb/>
impressed his mind with the necessity of<lb/>
Union—the Mother Country was prepared<lb/>
to give those Colonies the right to make<lb/>
Commercial Treaties. When he consi<lb break="no"/>dered that there were six different Go<lb break="no"/>vernments, and six different tariffs, and<lb/>
all the difficulties in the way, he con<lb break="no"/>cluded there must be one General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to carry them out.</p>
            <p>It was stated in the papers, that it was<lb/>
because he could not get the Audi or<lb/>
Generalship, or some office, that he left<lb/>
the Government. He would require to<lb/>

enter into some details. After the late<lb/>
election, when the late Government was<lb/>
thrown out, he was called upon in con<lb break="no"/>junction with the Attorney General (hon. <lb/>
A. J. Smith) to form an Administration.<lb/>
He thought they were then in a position<lb/>
to form a strong and stable Government.<lb/>
When he met the Attorney General, he<lb/>
(Attorney General) proposed that he<lb/>
(Mr. W.) should be Provincial Secretary.<lb/>
He had been Provincial Secretary before,<lb/>
and he said that if they could not get a <lb/>
better man, he was willing to take the<lb/>
office. He asked if he could not have<lb/>
had the office of he had chose? Differ<lb break="no"/>ences of opinion arose betwixt them as to<lb/>
the gentlemen who should hold the De<lb break="no"/>partmental Offices. He thought that the <lb/>
Government should have a Solicitor Ge<lb break="no"/>neral, that there should be a responsible<lb/>
law officer to whom questions of impor<lb break="no"/>tance should be referred ; but the Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General opposed any apointment. <lb/>
(Attorney General here objected to Mr. <lb/>
Wilmot entering into these detail.) He<lb/>
was charged with falsehood, and further<lb/>
charged with being bought in Canada<lb/>
and he was bound to defend his own char<lb break="no"/>acter. (Mr. Wilmot then quoted from<lb/>
his tender of resignation, Jan. 4, in<lb/>
which he expressed an opinion in favor<lb/>
of the principle of Union, and the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment's reply thereto) When those gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen that signed that memorandum<lb/>
stated, "that they were not aware that he<lb/>
was in favour of Union up to the time of<lb/>
his mission to Canada," they stated what <lb/>
was untrue. They knew the Government<lb/>
referred to his opinion in Council when<lb/>
they went on to state, "what induced a<lb/>
change of his mind while there, the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil have no means of knowning." What <lb/>
induced him? It was not office that in<lb break="no"/>duced him ; he could have taken the Sec<lb break="no"/>retaryship if he had chose. That was<lb/>
one of the best offices in the country.<lb/>
The leader of the Government said, he<lb/>
(Mr. W.) had no right to expose matters<lb/>
in Council, but hoped, when he was<lb/>
charged with falsehood and with being<lb/>
bought, he had a right.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> though that<lb/>
he (Mr. W.) had a right to explain all<lb/>
matters that touched on his resignation ; <lb/>
but what took place in Council was as<lb/>
binding upon him as himself (Att'y Gen.)<lb/>
They were both called upon to form the<lb/>
Government. They had worked together<lb/>
for months, and he was now as much<lb/>
bound to preserve silence as to what took<lb/>
place in the Government as any member <lb/>
of it.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName>—If his conduct was im<lb break="no"/>pugned, had he not a right to explain?<lb/>
Most certainly he had.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> proceeded to quote<lb/>
from his letter of resignation, February<lb/>
21st, concerning the differences between<lb/>
himself and the leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment as to the composition of the COuncil<lb/>
at its formation. He could have taken<lb/>
the Provincial Secretaryship if he had <lb/>
chosen. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">MR. WETMORE</persName>.—Why did he not <lb/>
take it?</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>.—Because he was not<lb/>
disposed to be a more jack in the box, to<lb/>
move as the strings were pulled. When<lb/>
he saw the course the leader was pursu<lb break="no"/>ing, he came to the conclusion that the<lb/>
Government would not last long, and he<lb/>
would tell him (Att'y Gen.) to-day, if he<lb/>
could not carry his man. Such was the<lb/>
difference of opinion on the first forma<lb break="no"/>tion, that he came to the conclusion not to<lb/>
          

            <cb/>
       
 go into
the Government at all, and return<lb break="no"/>ed home, when a messenger came to<lb/>
him in his house at Belmont, sum<lb break="no"/>moning him to Saint John. It was<lb/>
then that he should return at the close of the <lb/>
session, and take the Audit Office. After<lb/>
having been so long in different Govern<lb/>
ments as Provincial Secretary and Sur<lb break="no"/>veyor General, he thought, if a death<lb/>
vacancy occurred in the Audit Office, he<lb/>
had as much right to it as any other man.</p>
            <p>After it was agreed that he should have<lb/>
the Audit Office, a resolution was moved<lb/>
in the House last Session to reduce the <lb/>
salary, and it was agreed that the matter<lb/>
should be referred to the Executive Coun<lb break="no"/>cil to deal with. After that, Mr. McClel<lb break="no"/>an, a member of the Opposition, moved<lb/>
that the salary should be reduced from<lb/>
£500 to£100, and then the leader of the <lb/>
Government got up and said the House<lb/>
had a right to fix the salary. When he<lb/>
saw the leader of the Government take<lb/>
that course, and vote for the reduction of<lb/>
the salary after the question had, by pre<lb break="no"/>vious resolution, been referred to the Ex<lb break="no"/>ecutive Council, he was very much <choice><sic>aston<lb break="no"/>shed</sic><corr>astonished</corr></choice>.</p>
            

<p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY
GENERAL</persName>.—Did he<lb/>
not, in conversation with him (Mr. W.)<lb/>
about the Audit Office, say that he<lb/>
thought the salary of £300 was too high,<lb/>
and the £400 was sufficient, that it was<lb/>
competent for the House to fix the<lb/>
amount.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> had no doubt about the<lb/>
right of the House to fix the salary, but<lb/>
what he objected to as that the leader<lb/>
of the Government should, after the re<lb break="no"/>solution was passed referring the matter<lb/>
to the Executive Council, have taken the <lb/>
course he did. If the leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment chose to arrogate to himself the<lb/>
whole Government, he was not disposed<lb/>
to submit.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. He had<lb/>
put a plain question to him (Mr. W.)—<lb/>
did he not tell him that the salary was too <lb/>
much.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>. The question ought<lb/>
to have been referred to the Executive<lb/>
Council. That was not the only cause of<lb/>
his dissatisfaction with the leader of the <lb/>
Government. What had caused his friend<lb/>
Mr. Anglin to resign but the fact that<lb/>
the Attorney General took upon himself<lb/>
the authority of the whole Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the Lieutenant Governor when <lb/>
he signed the agreement about Western<lb/>
Extension. He (Mr. W.) did not, under<lb/>
the circumstances, care to take office, as he<lb/>
was no prepared to live under a despo<lb break="no"/>tism, and he certainly thought that an act<lb/>
of despotism.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. He thought<lb/>
the Government would see the unfairness<lb/>
of the course the hon. member was tak<lb break="no"/>ing. He (Mr. W.) was as much respon<lb break="no"/>sible for the acts that took place in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil as he (Attorney General) was. He<lb/>
would ask did Mr. Wilmot ever complain<lb/>
in Council that he had noted despotically <lb/>
in this matter.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>. When the action that<lb/>
led to the resignantion of Mr. Anglin took<lb/>
place he was in Canada, but he reserved <lb/>
his right to protest.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. Did he<lb/>
(Mr. W.) protest when he explained the<lb/>
transaction. Did he not approve of the <lb/>
course he (Attorney General) had taken.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>. He did not approve.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> explained<lb/>
that he had written the paper of agree<lb break="no"/>ment regarding Western Extension,<lb/>
           

            <cb/>
         
knowing
the minds of all his colleagues,<lb/>
and it was necessary to do it imme<lb break="no"/>diately, as Mr. Parks and Mr. Skinner<lb/>
were obliged to go to Boston.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>.
He was in Canada<lb/>
at the time. When he returned and<lb/>
heard of the transaction, he expressed<lb/>
his opinion to Mr. Anglin, and he then<lb/>
reserved his right to protest against the<lb/>
whole affair.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY
GENERAL</persName>. Answer<lb/>
this
question. Did he (Mr. W.) express<lb/>
to him
(Attorney General) when they<lb/>
met, any
dissatisfaction?</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>.
He expressed his opin<lb break="no"/>ion of the matter in Mr. Troop's office, and<lb/>
he certainly did not approve of the ac<lb break="no"/>tion of the leader of the Government.</p>
          
  <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY
GENERAL</persName>. Did he<lb/>
(Mr. W.) disapprove of it to him.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>.
He most unques<lb break="no"/>tionably did not approve.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">MR.
WETMORE</persName>. He recollected,<lb/>
when the outrage committed by the At<lb break="no"/>torney General occurred, meeting Mr. <lb/>
Wilmot, when he spoke in terms of en<lb break="no"/>tire disapprobation of the conduct of<lb/>
the Attorney General in taking charge<lb/>
of the country.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. He wanted <lb/>
to know when he told Mr. Wilmot the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances under which he gave the<lb/>
paper to Mr. Skinner if he did not ap<lb break="no"/>prove of it.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>. Certainly not.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. Did he<lb/>
disapprove of it.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> was certainly not in the <lb/>
habit of approving of what he did not<lb/>
know. The leader of the Government<lb/>
and himself, in fact, never could agree.<lb/>
He never could even get a local matter<lb/>
passed through Council without a fight,<lb/>
and he now felt perfectly satisfied to be<lb/>
out of the Government. Mr. Wilmot<lb/>
proceeded to speak of the Union of the <lb/>
Colonies. In Canada he had expressed<lb/>
his opinion that some Union must take<lb/>
place. He saw many reasons that made<lb/>
him come to that conclusion. He saw<lb/>
the United States were determined to<lb/>
abolish the Reciprocity Treaty and that<lb/>
there would be an opportunity of opening<lb/>
up a large trade between the Provinces.<lb/>
He also saw that in consequence of the<lb/>
unsettled condition of the United States,<lb/>
and the high taxation there, the Maritime<lb/>
Provinces would be a better field for emi<lb break="no"/>gation, and they would have the advan<lb break="no"/>tage in the shipping trade. His view at <lb/>
first was that the Lower Provinces had<lb/>
nothing to send to Canada ; but now,<lb/>
that they had a right to make treaties<lb/>
with other British Colonies and with for<lb break="no"/>eign nations, a large and profitable trade<lb/>
would spring up.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">Mr. Wilmot</persName> proceeded to say that the<lb/>
Government were now a Confederation<lb/>
Government. Their conversation had been<lb/>
very sudden. It had taken place between<lb/>
the 19th of February, when his resigna<lb break="no"/>tion was accepted, and the 8th of March,<lb/>
when the House opened. In his last con<lb break="no"/>versation with the leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, that gentleman said ; rather than<lb/>
consent to the Quebec Scheme, he was<lb/>
determined to go down with the ship. He<lb/>
could not understand what influences had<lb/>
been at work to bring about so sudden a<lb/>
change of opinion.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCMI1">MR. McMILLAN</persName>.—What ship did he<lb/>
mean?  The Anti ship?</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>.—Yes. He would <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>

            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>.—Canada would never<lb/>

he understood the leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to say that he would never go for<lb/>
any scheme with representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation?</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> thought the House ought<lb/>
to know how the Government stood with<lb/>
regard to the two principles—Federal<lb/>
Union and Representation by Population.<lb/>
The hon. member of St. John (Mr. Wil<lb break="no"/>mot,) in arguing on the position of the <lb/>
Government on the question of union, had<lb/>
said that in any scheme that was submit<lb break="no"/>ted, these two principles must be includ<lb break="no"/>ed. It was as well for the House to <lb/>
understand where they were.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—What he<lb/>
had said was, he would never consent to<lb/>
representation by population under the <lb/>
Quebec Scheme. He would go down with<lb/>
the ship before he would do so. In any <lb/>
scheme he would support, there must be <lb/>
something to neutralize the effect of that <lb/>
principle.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>.—These two principles<lb/>
must be included in whatever scheme<lb/>
was submitted. When he was in Canada <lb/>
he was told that the Canadian Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were prepared to meet that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of New Brunswick on those two<lb/>
points. He was informed by Mr. George<lb/>
Brown that he was willing to do so. <lb/>
When he returned to New Brunswick, he <lb/>
told his late colleagues of the willingness<lb/>
of the Canadian Government to confer<lb/>
with them. He did not do it by writing,<lb/>
but he did so in conversation.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>.—The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were willing to meet Mr. Brown<lb/>
at any conference.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName>.—He understood the<lb/>
Government had come to a very different<lb/>
conclusion. He would now wish to read<lb/>
the sixth and seventh resolutions passed<lb/>
by the Confederate Council of Trade, held<lb/>
in Quebec:—</p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>6th. "That in the event of negotiations<lb/>
for a new Treaty of Reciprocity with the<lb/>

            <p>7th. "That Her Majesty's Government<lb/>

Washington in the event of negotiations<lb/>
being opened for the renewal of the Reci<lb break="no"/>procity Treaty, in order to confer with<lb/>
the British Minister there, and afford him<lb/>
information with respect to the interests <lb/>
of the British North American Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces."</p></quote>


            <p>These resolutions were passed at the<lb/>
Confederate Council, sent off to Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Government, sent back to the<lb/>
Government in New Brunswick ; and his<lb/>
report was read in Council, approved of <lb/>
and adopted. What was done there was<lb/>
approved here.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">Mr. Wilmot</persName> proceeded to say that he<lb/>
was in Frederiction, where he met the<lb/>
Government after they received a telegram<lb/>
from Sir N. Belleau, communicating the <lb/>
fact that the Government of Canada pro<lb break="no"/>posed sending delegates to Washington,<lb/>
 
<cb/>


               but he was not told of the fact. he<lb/>
would have been quite willing to forego<lb/>
his right to proceed as a delegate to<lb/>
Washington, but he was not willing to<lb/>
be superceded without even bring referred<lb/>
to. (Here followed some conversation<lb/>
between Mr. Wilmot and the Attorney<lb/>
General, Provincial Secretary, and Hon.<lb/>
Mr. Hatheway, on the subject of the<lb/>
meeting of Council in Saint John, at<lb/>
which the Attorney General was appoint<lb break="no"/>ed delegate to Washington.) Mr. Wil<lb break="no"/>mot then concluded by saying that he had<lb/>
now explained the position in which he<lb/>
stood with regard to the Government.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HATH1">HON. MR. HATHEWAY</persName> said he would<lb/>
in all probability address the House long<lb break="no"/>er on the present occasion than he had<lb/>
been in the habit of doing, and he would<lb/>
ask the indulgence of the hon. members<lb/>
for the remarks he would make. It might<lb/>
be that his hon. friend, Mr. Wilmot, in<lb/>
going out of the Government had taken a <lb/>
leaf out of his (Mr. H.'s) book. It might<lb/>
be that his hon. friend saw the clouds<lb/>
gathering, and a storm coming, and made<lb/>
haste to escape. It was said that he (Mr. <lb/>
H.) saw last year which way the tide of<lb/>
popular opinion was running, and that he<lb/>
saw a crash was coming, and that he left<lb/>
the Government just in time to save him<lb break="no"/>self. It might be that his hon. friend saw<lb/>
further into futurity than his late col<lb break="no"/>leagues, and had resigned because he<lb/>
thought another change in the variable<lb/>
tide of popular opinion would turn the<lb/>
Government out. His hon. friend said<lb/>
he had not been anxious to get into the <lb/>
Government, but he (Mr. H.) thought<lb/>
that he (Mr. W.) had been dissatisfied to<lb/>
remain in the Government because he<lb/>
could not get his own way ; and he be<lb break="no"/>lieved that it would have been much bet<lb break="no"/>ter for his late colleagues if that hon<lb/>
member had never entered it, if the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had had him in the Opposition<lb/>
from the very commencement. No mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Executive Council could carry<lb/>
every measure he desired. Difficulties<lb/>
arose at the first formation of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and he knew well that he and<lb/>
the present Judge Allen differed in opi<lb break="no"/>nion upon a certain question. But were<lb/>
the whole Council bound to take his<lb/>
hon. friend's opinion. He had (Mr. H.)<lb/>
permission, he would like very much to <lb/>
tell the House the reason his hon. friend<lb/>
would not take the office of Provincial<lb/>
Secretary, but he could not, and he would<lb/>
tell him (Mr. W.) that having from the <lb/>
first formation worked with his late col<lb break="no"/>leagues of the Government, their acts<lb/>
were his, and the oath of secrecy was as<lb/>
obligatory on him ; he was as much bound<lb/>
to preserve silence as to what had tran<lb break="no"/>spired in Council as himself or any other<lb/>
member of it. But what were his col<lb break="no"/>league's real reason for resigning? Be<lb break="no"/>cause he had been refused the trip to<lb/>
Washington! Perhaps if he (Mr. W.)<lb/>
had been present at the Council he would<lb/>
have urged the appointment. If he had<lb/>
been sent to Washington he was satisfied<lb/>
they never would have heard of this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of his resignation  Mr. H. proceed<lb break="no"/>ed to say, that he had a great mind to<lb/>
tell the House what had taken place in<lb/>
Council when the Hon. George Brown<lb/>
was present when the question of Con<lb break="no"/>federation was discussed. His hon. friend<lb/>
Mr. W. had said, that Mr. Brown, when<lb/>
he saw him in Canada, expressed his<lb/>
opinion that the Government of Canada<lb/>
were prepared to meet the Government<lb/>
of New Brunswick on the details of the <lb/>
Scheme. But he (Mr. H.) would say<lb/>


<cb/>


               that Mr. <choice><sic>Browe</sic><corr>Howe</corr></choice> in Canada and Mr. Brown<lb/>
in New Brunswick, were two very differ<lb break="no"/>ent men. He (Mr. H.) had seen Mr.<lb/>
Brown in Canada. He was then quite<lb/>
willing and prepared to open up the ques<lb break="no"/>tion ; but how did the Government find<lb/>
Mr. Brown in New Brunswick after he<lb/>
had been subjected to two days influences<lb/>
from certain quarters, and had been cram<lb break="no"/>med with stories of the change of opinion<lb/>
upon the Quebec Scheme—the country<lb/>
then being excited about the York elec<lb break="no"/>tion—they found him holding off an<lb/>
saying the Canadian Government cannot<lb/>
consent to any change, "you must take<lb/>
it as it is." His hon. friend said the<lb/>
Governement agreed to give him the office<lb/>
of Auditor General. No one disputed<lb/>
his right to go into the office. But he was<lb/>
offended because the salary had been re<lb break="no"/>duced. It was considered that 
               £500 was <lb/>
too high a salary for the Auditor General<lb/>
—and he thought
               £400 a year in that <lb/>
office was a far better salary than £600<lb/>
a year in any of the Government Depart<lb break="no"/>ments. [Mr. Wilmot—had he refused<lb/>
£400?] It was perfectly well known<lb/>
that, if the hon. gentleman had chosen to<lb/>
accept the office, the Government were<lb/>
prepared to give it to him at the time.<lb/>
He (Mr. Wilmot) had accused the Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General of assuming the whole Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment upon his shoulders, and said he<lb/>
was not prepared to live under a despot<lb break="no"/>ism. [Here Mr. H. enetered into some<lb/>
detail concerning the franchise of the <lb/>
Government.] But it was entirely out<lb/>
of his mouth to accuse the Leader of the <lb/>
Government of having acted despotically.</p>
            <p>The Government, he proceeded to say, <lb/>
had been arraigned on four charged.<lb/>
To one of the counts in the indictment<lb/>
they had plead guilty. In trying them on<lb/>
the other three the Government would<lb/>
throw themselves on the justice of the<lb/>
House. Thought the Government had array<lb break="no"/>ed against them a grwat deal of talent, and<lb/>
though a great deal of recrimination had<lb/>
taken a place he trusted that calm judg<lb break="no"/>ment would prevail, and he had no doubt<lb/>
that the Government would satisfactorily<lb/>
show that they were guiltless of the<lb/>
charges preferred against them, and that<lb/>
at the end of their trial they would come<lb/>
off conquerors and more than conquerors.<lb/>
The mover of the amendment (Mr. F.)<lb/>
spoke of the wheels of popular opinion ; <lb/>
that they were rumbling and rolling<lb/>
through the country against the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Public opinion, they all knew,<lb/>
was liable to very sudden changes, as no<lb/>
one should know better than that hon.<lb/>
member himself. He (Mr. H) could remem<lb break="no"/>ber well when the wheels of public opinion<lb/>
rolled him (Mr. F.) in 1851 out. He<lb/>
could remember when they rolled him out<lb/>
again in 1854. Mr. Fisher said that po<lb break="no"/>pular opinion had changed in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince with regard to the Quebec Scheme.<lb/>
What was all this clamor raised about<lb/>
this change of opinion. Was it not<lb/>
raised and kept up by a few restless and<lb/>
unscrupulous politicians, who made the<lb/>
Quebec Scheme subserve their own ends<lb/>
of personal aggrandizement? Rumblings<lb/>
of popular opinion ! How were the wheels<lb/>
that produced the rumblings set in mo<lb break="no"/>tion at the time of the York election. He<lb/>
challenged his colleague (Mr. F.) to show<lb/>
one requisition from the electors of the <lb/>
County that had not emanted from the <lb/>
office of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Colonial Farmer</hi>, of the of<lb break="no"/>fice of the Fredericton <hi rendition="simple:italic">Reporter</hi>. How<lb/>
was popular opinion influenced against<lb/>
the Government. Bills an placards were<lb/>
printed and thrown broad cast over the<lb/>

Province, throwing out poisonous insinua<lb break="no"/>tions against the Government. It was<lb/>
proclaimed all over the country that the<lb/>
Government was under Roman Catholic<lb/>
influencedthat Anglin, the traitor, was<lb/>
its dictator. It was said that if the elec<lb break="no"/>tors would save the country, and tear the<lb/>
reins of power out of the hands of dis<lb break="no"/>loyal men, they must vote for Fisher, the<lb/>
staunch loyalists, the old boy—vote for<lb/>
Fisher and save the country—vote for<lb/>
Fisher and the British Constitution, Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Law, British Nationality, and British<lb/>
Christianity! He would not tell how<lb/>
many men during the excitement of the<lb/>
election were fed in the back settlements,<lb/>
or what other influences were brought to<lb/>
bear. Every effort was made to preju<lb break="no"/>dice him (Mr. H.) in the mind of the<lb/>
country. . It was said that Smith ruled the<lb/>
Government, and the Smith was hostile<lb/>
to York, and Hatheway was powerless—<lb/>
the interests of the Country was suffering<lb/>
in his hands. He had not the ability el<lb/>
his hon. and learned friend (Attorney <lb/>
General), but he was quite able to face<lb/>
him whenever the interests of his Country<lb/>
were concerned. One of the canvasses<lb/>
during the election was that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment intended to remove the Post Office<lb/>
Department from Fredericton, and that<lb/>
was the first step towards the removal of<lb/>
the seat of Government ; and the cry
was<lb/>
raised, if the Country was to be saved,
and <lb/>
the Seat of Government secured, they <lb/>
must elect Fisher, for he was the only<lb/>
man that could face Smith on the floors<lb/>
of the House. He thought the hon.<lb/>
member for Restigouche had handled the <lb/>
sale of the Gibson lands very cautiously ;
<lb/>
he did not wonder that his colleague (Mr.<lb/>
F.) had done so. But they did not dare<lb/>
to condemn the Government for that<lb/>
transaction : they knew the Government<lb/>
were only carrying out the acts of their<lb/>
predecessers. The member of Resti<lb break="no"/>gouche knew that, had the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment remained in power, they would have<lb/>
rescinded the regulation. He thought<lb/>
that was what the hon. member said.<lb/>
(Mr. McMillan.—He said, if there was no<lb/>
prospect of the Inter-Colonial Railway,<lb/>
there would be no need of the regula<lb break="no"/>tion) Just so. Mr. Hatheway then<lb/>
proceeded to speak of the influences that<lb/>
had been brought to hear during the first<lb/>
election in York? What were the argu<lb break="no"/>ments that his colleague, (Mr. F.) when<lb/>
he went lecturing through the back settle<lb break="no"/>ments had put forth in his canvas?<lb/>
First, if York would secure the seat of<lb/>
Government, it must go for Confederation ;
<lb/>
and secondly, if York wanted to set the<lb/>
Inter-Colonial Railway by the Valley of<lb/>
the Keswick, it must go for the Quebec<lb/>
Scheme At one of these meetings he<lb/>
had met his hon. colleqgue, (Mr. F.) and<lb/>
put to him the question, would he go for<lb/>
Confederation if the Railway went<lb/>
by the North Shore. well, he said he<lb/>
would not. He (Mr. F) told the peo<lb break="no"/>ple that the Railway would go by the<lb/>
Keswick Valley, and Mr. Fleming, the<lb/>
Canadian Surveyor's Report would<lb/>
soon be out, confirming his statement. <lb/>
Let them refer to the law and the testi<lb break="no"/>mony, let them refer to Fleming's re<lb break="no"/>port [here the hon. member referred at<lb/>
great length to Fleming's report, read<lb break="no"/>ing several extracts concerning the va<lb break="no"/>rious routes to show that the Central<lb/>
line fixed upon by the members of York<lb/>
(Mr. F.) was the longest and would be<lb/>
the most expensive in construction, and<lb/>
would cost £600,000 more than other <lb/>
routes.] would the hon. member after<lb/>
    

            <cb/>
       
what Mr.
Fleming said about the Cen<lb break="no"/>tral line succeed in gulling the people<lb/>
as he had done, that the Railway would<lb/>
go by it. The hon. member (Mr. Fish<lb break="no"/>er) had during the time of the election<lb/>
the line absolutely staked out, and he<lb/>
told the electors that he had induced<lb/>
the Canadian Government to order that <lb/>
the survey to be made along the Kes<lb break="no"/>wick Valley. </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> said he had written to<lb/>
the Canadian Government asking them<lb/>
to order a survey of the Central route,<lb/>
and he had no doubt that it was through<lb/>
his urgent endeavours that the survey<lb/>
came to be made.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HATH1">HON. MR. HATHEWAY</persName> proceeded<lb/>
to say that it was astonishing that with<lb/>
all his knowledge, all his reputation as<lb/>
a constitutional lawyer that the name<lb/>
of Fisher was never mentioned in Cana<lb break="no"/>da, while the names of Smith, and Til-<lb break="yes"/>
ley and Gray were familiar was never <lb/>
heard. He was astonished when he<lb/>
looked over the map accompanying<lb/>
Fleming's report to find that whilst there<lb/>
was a line laid down that was deno<lb break="no"/>minated the Mitchell line, it show<lb break="no"/>ed no Fisher line. The inter-colonial<lb/>
railway had always been held forth as<lb/>
the great boon New Brunswick would<lb/>
get by Confederation, but he doubted if <lb/>
it was looked upon with much favor in<lb/>
Canada. Would any one tell him that<lb/>
Galt the great finance minister of Cana<lb break="no"/>da who possessed immense property in<lb/>
the City of Portland, and had held a<lb/>
large amount of stock in the Railway,<lb/>
was in favor of a Railway through New<lb/>
Brunswick ! They might try to delude<lb/>
the people that he was in favor of it,<lb/>
but that would not go down with him.<lb/>
In fact that there was little feeling in<lb/>
Canada in favor of the Intercolonial,<lb/>
and he was opinion that the feeling<lb/>
on the whole was decidedly against it.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HATH1">Hon. Mr. Hatheway</persName> proceeded to <lb/>
speak to another charge against the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment with reference to the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of Judge Ritchie over Judge Wil<lb break="no"/>mot. He would say very little about it. <lb/>
But he well remembered at the opening<lb/>
of the Court in Fredericton, seeing<lb/>
Judge Wilmot occupying the seat of his<lb/>
honor his speaker. Never in his life had<lb/>
ho seen the hall where the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers were now assembled so crowded<lb/>
as on that occasion, for it was well<lb/>
known in Fredericton, that the Judge<lb/>
would deliver a harangue. He doubted <lb/>
much the right of a Judge to deliver<lb/>
from the bench at a time when polittcal<lb/>
feeling was rising high, such an address<lb/>
as Judge Wilmot did. It might be said<lb/>
by some that he (Judge W.) had a right<lb/>
to speak on a subject that was agitating<lb/>
the minds of the people ; but when the<lb/>
words caught his ears that if it was ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to carry the scheme, he would<lb/>
come down from the bench, he thought<lb/>
that statement Judge Wilmot had no<lb/>
right to make, and he justified the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of Judge Ritchie on the <lb/>
ground of the same harangue. When<lb/>
they heard the opinion of Chief Justice<lb/>
Robert Parker, and knew that he advis<lb break="no"/>ed the Government to appoint Judge<lb/>
Ritchie, the mouths of those who had <lb/>
murmured because they thought Judge<lb/>
Wilmot had been superseded ought to be<lb/>
closed.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CONN1">MR. CONNELL</persName> he would like to hear <lb/>
the letter of Chief Justice Parker read.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FRAS1">MR. FRASER</persName>—The hon. member of<lb/>
Carleton had better apply to the hon.<lb/>
  
<cb/>

 member of

He (Mr. F.)
gave him as an authority.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">MR. WETMORE</persName>—What
did his hon.<lb/>
friend (Mr. Fraser) say.</p>







            <p><persName ref="pers:FRAS1">MR. FRASER</persName>—He said he gave the <lb/>
hon. member of St. JOhn, (Mr. Wet<lb break="no"/>more) as his authority for the statement<lb/>
that Judge Robery Parker would not<lb/>
have accepted the office of Chief Justice,<lb/>
if he had not known Judge Ritchie<lb/>
would succeed him.</p>



            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">MR. WETMORE</persName>—What could his<lb/>
hon. friend (Mr. F) mean? He most<lb/>
positively and distinctly denied that he<lb/>
ever made such statement.</p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:HATH1">HON. MR. HATHEWAY</persName> proceeded to<lb/>
speak of the course his colleague, Mr.
Fisher,<lb/>
had pursued against him during the elec<lb break="no"/>tion of York. He called to his recollec<lb break="no"/>tion the many occasions he had befriended<lb/>
him in his political trouble ; he had always<lb/>
been his friend ; he well knew his friend=<lb/>
ship for him ; he knew the position he<lb/>
(Mr. Hatheway) was placed in about the <lb/>
time of the election—lying sick in bed at<lb break="no"/>tended to by two medical men, and he knew<lb/>
that $300 were offered to one of these<lb/>
medical men to keep him lying on the <lb/>
broad of his back. (Mr. Fisher.—He <lb/>
knew nothing of the kind.) One would<lb/>
think he (Mr. Fisher) did know ; when he<lb/>
was lying in this condition, he made a<lb/>
public speech in the Temperance Hall, in<lb/>
Frederiction, that was calculated to harrow<lb/>
up the innermost feelings of those most <lb/>
nearly related to him, and it was a <lb/>
most remarkable fact that two copies of<lb/>
the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Reporter</hi>, containing the report of the<lb/>
speech, were directed to his wife. He<lb/>
charged it home to him that he knew<lb/>
that ; hon. members knew that Mr. Fisher<lb/>
was in the habit of saying that after poli<lb break="no"/>tical discussion he went home to his fami<lb break="no"/>ly, and forgot all the angry feelings that<lb/>
had been engendered, and he prayed upon<lb/>
his knees for forgeiveness to his enemies.<lb/>
But when he though of that, the words<lb/>
of his supplication ought to have been<lb/>
in the words of the fine prayer in the<lb/>
Litany : "From all blindness of heart, <lb/>
from pride, vain glory and hypocrisy, from<lb/>
envy, hatred, and malice, and all unchari<lb break="no"/>tableness, deliver me." (Mr. Fisher.—<lb/>
He denied that he knew the papers to <lb/>
have been sent and said that the lan<lb break="no"/>guage he had used in his speech was<lb/>
justified by the strong language uttered<lb/>
by Mr. Hatheway against himself.)<lb/>
The least Mr. Fisher ought to have<lb/>
done was, after the excitement of the oc<lb break="no"/>casion, to have gone to the office of the<lb/>
paper, and asked the editor not to put in<lb/>
the report of the speech of the offensive<lb/>
statements. To send the paper with that<lb/>
speech into private family, was a low, <lb/>
mean, cowardly act, unworthy of the cha<lb break="no"/>racter of a man. Every influence had <lb/>
been brought to bear against him ; heed<lb break="no"/>less expression in casual conversation<lb/>
had been caught up and turned against<lb/>
him. When in St. John he met that in<lb break="no"/>flated little animal, Johnny Boyd, (he <lb/>
knew he was not here to defend himself)<lb/>
Boyd said to him, "You cannot resist <lb/>
the British Government ; they will oblige<lb/>
you to take the Quebec Scheme," (or<lb/>
words to that effect) and he answered<lb/>
hastily, "The British Government may<lb/>
go to the devil, or some hotter place,"<lb/>
and on the strength of that heedless ex<lb break="no"/>pression, he had been accused of disloy<lb break="no"/>alty. He respected the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but he though that on a question<lb/>
that so nearly affected their own interests,<lb/>
the people of the Provinces were the best<lb/>
judges. <lb/>

<!-- GL, 2018-02-28, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

            <!--<p>WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21.</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> said he had only dis<lb break="no"/>covered yesterday, that the practice in<lb/>
this House had been not to send Bills<lb/>
to the Legislative Council until after<lb/>
the Address had passed. He could see<lb/>
no reason why they should not go to<lb/>
get on with the business, so that there <lb/>
should not be a rush of business at the <lb/>
close of the Session. He would, there<lb break="no"/>fore, move that the Bill to incorporate <lb/>
the Fredericton Railway Company be<lb/>
read a third time, in order that it could<lb/>
be sent to the Council.</p>
            <p>Several other hon. members expressed<lb/>
themselves in favor of the motion, <lb/>
which was carried.</p>
            <p>The House then went into Committee<lb/>
on a Bill to facilitate the construction of<lb/>
a Railway to Fredericton, which was<lb/>
agreed to. </p>
            <p>The time for taking up the order of<lb/>
the day having arrived, it was proposed<lb/>
to adjourn the debate until two o'clock,<lb/>
as Mr. McClellan—who, it was under<lb break="no"/>stood, was to be the next speaker upon<lb/>
the question—was not prepared to speak<lb/>
in consequence of being unwell.</p>
            <p>The HON. MR. SMITH and others<lb/>
urged, because the members of the<lb/>
House would not give the other business<lb/>
proper attention while a question of so<lb/>
much importance to the coutnry was<lb/>
not decided. Some of the members of <lb/>
the Opposition ought to be prepared to <lb/>
go on with the debate, or have the vote<lb/>
taken. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName> expressed his willing<lb break="no"/>ness to make a few remarks in the after<lb break="no"/>noon, but was not prepares at present.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">MR. WETMORE</persName> thought the same<lb/>
courtesy should be extended to the hon. <lb/>
Surveyor General—the debate having<lb/>
been adjourned on Saturday in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of his being unwell.</p>
            <p>HON. MR. CUDLIP though, if they <lb/>
had less speaking, the country would<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p> be better off. He had always made up<lb/>
his mind on the great questions of the <lb/>
day before he came to the House. They<lb/>
had better have the division, so they<lb/>
could attend to the business of the <lb/>
country.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>A BILL RELATING TO THE SETTLEMENT<lb/>
AND SUPPORT OF THE POOR IN THIS <lb/>
PROVINCE.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName> moved the House<lb/>
into Committee on the above Bill, and<lb/>
said, that it was a copy of a Bill intro<lb break="no"/>duced by his hon. friend from Northum<lb break="no"/>berland, some years ago, which had <lb/>
passed through the House, but had<lb/>
been rejected in the Upper House. Its<lb/>
object was to define where the poor<lb/>
legally belonged.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>COL. BOYD was in favour of the Bill,<lb/>
for such a law was very much needed.<lb/>
In St. Andrews, and on the borders,<lb/>
numbers of poor persons come from<lb/>
the United States and get relief from<lb/>
the Parish. This Bill provides that a<lb/>
person shall be a resident of the Parish<lb/>
for twelve months before he can claim<lb/>
relief. He thought one Parish should<lb/>
not support the poor of the neighboring<lb/>
Parishes.</p>
            <p>MR. ANGLIN was inclined to support<lb/>
the Bill. He believed that, although<lb/>
the City members supported it, several<lb/>
members of the country districts opposed<lb/>
it ; and though it was not right to pro<lb break="no"/>tract matters, yet the Bill should not be<lb/>
pressed on when so many members<lb/>
were absent, for he would like to give<lb/>
any member who opposed it a fair<lb/>
chance.</p>
            <p>MR. YOUNG though it was an im<lb break="no"/>portant Bill, and advised the mover to<lb/>
report progress on the Bill, for he would<lb/>
like to know more about it before he<lb/>
agreed to it.</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName> said, the Bill was <lb/>
well known to the members of the <lb/>
House—it having passed the House<lb/>
nce or twice, and the Legislative<lb/>
Council had it published in the Royal<lb/>
Gazette. If a pauper came from one <lb/>
Parish into another, there would be no<lb/>
injustice in sending him to the Parish<lb/>
from which he came.</p>
            <p>MR. HILL had no objection to that<lb/>
section of the Bill, but he had great ob<lb break="no"/>jection to the manner in which the Bill<lb/>
was passing through this House. With<lb/>
one or two exceptions, there was not a<lb/>
member who had heard it read, and not<lb/>
half a dozen members knew the provi<lb break="no"/>sions of the Bill. If this was their sys<lb break="no"/>tem of passing Bills, any Bill could be<lb/>
got through the House. It was an un<lb break="no"/>safe method of legislating, although the<lb/>
Bill may be all right.</p>
            <p>MR. KERR said this Bill was a copy of <lb/>
a Bill which he had taken a considerable<lb/>
amount of the pains to frame, and which had<lb/>
passed the House unanimously. The<lb/>
Council thought it a Bill of importantce,<lb/>
and published it in the Royal Gazette.
It<lb/>
comprehends the principles of the State <lb/>
of Maine and the State of New York<lb/>
poor laws. He was glad to see it dis<lb/>
cussed, and thought it would be a great<lb/>
imporvement upon the existing state of<lb/>
things, for they now had no law for the re<lb break="no"/>moval of the poor to their own parish.</p>
            <p>HON. MR. SMITH said there was no <lb/>
law for the poor at all at present. A gen<lb break="no"/>tleman in Prince Edward Island had<lb/>
written to him for a copy of this Bill,<lb/>
which he supposed was the law. He had<lb/>
written back that we had no law : we on-</p>

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>ly had some custom which had been taken<lb/>
from an English law. They should un<lb break="no"/>derstand what the law was relating to <lb/>
this subject. He thought that Bill was<lb/>
well adapted to this country, therefore<lb/>
he should support it.</p>
            <p>Progress was then reported. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>AFTERNOON SESSION.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>ADJOURNED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S<lb/>
AMENDMENT.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName>. As the hon. member<lb/>
from the County of Albert (Mr. McCle<lb/>
lan) is not in his place, I will make a few<lb/>
remarks, but I will not occupy much <lb/>
time. The people take a great interest in <lb/>
this question, for they attend here anxious<lb/>
to know what is going on. I am pleased<lb/>
to see them, for I think it is the duty of<lb/>
the constituency to keep their eye on the<lb/>
Government, and to see that the men who<lb/>
come here to represent them do not mis<lb break="no"/>represent them. I think that public men<lb/>
are public property, and we have a right<lb/>
to refer to their public acts as long as we<lb/>
do not misrepresent them. When a ques<lb break="no"/>tion was asked a few days ago about the<lb/>
defence of the Province, I stated there <lb/>
was something in common between Antis<lb/>
and Fenians. The Attorney General<lb/>
thought I insinuated that the Anti-<lb break="yes"/>
Confederate member of the Legislature<lb/>
sympathized with the Fenians. I did not <lb/>
mean any such thing. I will call atten<lb break="no"/>tion to why I consider Antic and Fenains<lb/>
agree. I will read an extract from the<lb/>
New York Irish People, a
Fenian organ,<lb/>
dated Feb. 17, which refers to the Reci-<lb break="maybe"/>
porcity Treaty, and gives a reason why<lb/>
the American Government should not ne<lb break="no"/>gotiate a treaty :</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>"Another reason which should have its<lb/>
weight with every well-wisher of Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca is this? Why should be negotiate
a trea<lb break="no"/>ty with the very men who are to-day con<lb break="no"/>cocting the plan of a Confederation of the <lb/>
British Colonies, in order to erect a bar-<lb break="maybe"/>
ier against the expansion of the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can nation, to transplant a viceeregal<lb/>
court nroth of us, where the admirers<lb/>
and the flatterers of the aristocratic re<lb break="no"/>gime may go and parage their pretentious<lb/>
individuality? No, let there be no trea<lb break="no"/>ty whatever!"</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>That was to prevent the Confederate<lb/>
Union that would raise a barrier to the<lb/>
further extension of the American Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Another paper takes the same<lb/>
view of it :</p>
            <p>"It will
be dangerous to given encourage<lb break="no"/>ment, even temporarilty, to
the inter-Colo-<lb break="maybe"/>
nial feeling which certain influential men,<lb/>
both in Britain and in Canada, are
doing<lb/>
all in their power to cultivate. The sus<lb break="no"/>pension of reciprocal trade will be a co<lb break="no"/>gent argument with the Canadians in <lb/>
favor of the building of the inter Colonial<lb/>
Railway, WHICH EVERY INHABITANT OF<lb/>
NEW ENGLAND SHOULD SEEK TO PREVENT<lb/>
BY ALL PROPER MEANS, and which, with<lb/>
the continuance of reciprocity, and the<lb/>
prosecution of the international line,<lb/>
will, in our opinion, never be built.<lb/>
Closely allied to his is the political Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the Provinces, which can<lb/>
never be brought to pass unless an un<lb break="no"/>friendly policy on the part of the United <lb/>
States shall force them, for their
mutual<lb/>
protection and prosperity, into a closer<lb/>
compact and alliance than now exists."<lb/>
