    <!-- he ran his first election upon the Quebec 
     <lb/>Scheme, and his second election upon the<lb/>proposition made by the Government.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SKIN1">Mr. SKINNER</persName> -\- The first election, 
     <lb/>was said to be run upon the Quebec<lb/>Scheme as it stood. At a meeting held<lb/>at the Institute previous to the election,<lb/>Mr. Tilley stated to the people that if<lb/>they did not like the Quebec Scheme in<lb/>its entirety not to reject it, but to sustain<lb/>Union although they might not believe in<lb/>every letter and sentence of the Scheme.<lb/>So I claim to have run the election and<lb/>yet have my own judgment about the<lb/>Scheme. The Confederate paty when<lb/>they come here have still the right to<lb/>exercise their judgement as to whether<lb/>they would suggest any amendments.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Hon. Mr. FISHER</persName> -\- I supposed the 
     <lb/>elections were generally run on the pro<lb break="no"/>position made by the Government. I<lb/>
     think the whole representation of our    
     <lb/>country will go for the Quebec Scheme if<lb/>they cannot get a better. They talk about<lb/>Nova Scotia not coming in to this Union.<lb/>Would it not be a good think for us if<lb/>she did not come in for a year or two.<lb/>Look at the advantage we will derive<lb/>from the construction of this Inter-colo-<lb break="maybe"/>nial Railroad, two-thirds of the money<lb/>expended to build it will be circulated in<lb/>our Province, and all our young men in<lb/>every station in life will be employed. It<lb/>will open up our country and develop our<lb/>resources. I believe if a vote was taken<lb/>to-morrow to build the road under the<lb/>arrangement of 1862 the pople would<lb/>decide to have it built. Under that ar<lb break="no"/>rangement we were to build 3 1/2-twelfths<lb/>but now we have to contribute but one-<lb break="yes"/>thirteenth. They say we will have to<lb/>pay for the canals in Canada. I say if I<lb/>went to Ottawa I would vote for the<lb/>canals at once, for I beliee they would be<lb/>beneficial to us. I was astonished when<lb/>I was there, at the progress of that coun<lb break="no"/>try, and if those canals give us the trade<lb/>of that vast west -\- if the teeming welath<lb/>of the soil come down to this country,<lb/>and St. John is made the vast emporium,<lb/>who can conceive the greatness and<lb/>power of that city. The Erie Canal has<lb/>made New York the Empire City, and like<lb/>means produces like effect. If the Union<lb/>alone was subject to all the objections<lb/>made by my hon. friends, I believe this<lb/>Inter-colonial Railway would be an answer<lb/>to the whole of them, for it will cause<lb/>towns and villages to be built along its<lb/>course, and continuous benefits will be<lb/>

     derived therefrom. There has been a de<lb break="no"/>sire for many years to make a railway from<lb/>the Atlantic to the Pacific, and it is only<lb/>through British Territory that favourable<lb/>passes can be found. Explorers were not<lb/>aware that they had passed the rocky<lb/>mountains till they found the decending<lb/>waters on the other side. I want to carry<lb/>this Confederation to the Pacific Ocean.<lb/>There are Iron, Gold and other Minerals<lb/>at the Red River Settlement, and the<lb/>Americans are ready to go in there and<lb/>settle and organize a Government. The<lb/>reason the people of England take such<lb/>an interest in this question is this: they<lb/>see by our constitution that we admire<lb/>the institutions of the mother country, and<lb/>that we are going to form a nation which<lb/>is to be part of themselves; and they<lb/>further say, if we wish to separate from<lb/>them they do not wish to retain us; but<lb/>if we wish to remain, all the power of the<lb/>nation will be put forth to sustain us. A<lb/>member of the British Government in<lb/>speaking of the Fenians said: "the mur<lb break="no"/>derers have attacked these Provinces.<lb/>What harm have these Provinces done<lb/>them that they should be attacked. I<lb/>have no doubt but that the Provinces will<lb/>be able to defend themselves, but come<lb/>what will the whole power of the Empire<lb/>will be put forth to defend them." We<lb/>find the old feeling is there yet, let us<lb/>then form one great country and depend<lb/>upon it they will respect us. Let us<lb/>unite, and we will become a powerful<lb/>nation, our resources will be developed,<lb/>our condition improved, our railroads<lb/>built, and our prosperity increased be<lb break="no"/>yond any thing we at present anticipate.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The question was then taken whether<lb/>the amendment should be added to the<lb/>Resolution, when there appeared. <lb break="no"/>
            </p>

            <p>There had been an increase made in<lb/>this amount. The Roman Catholic School<lb/>at Newcastle was put down at $300, and<lb/>a Classical School in St. John $200.<lb/>These were the only changes made from<lb/>last year.<lb/>

They formerly received a grant,<lb/>but for some time it was withdrawn, but<lb/>now it was really a capital institution,<lb/>and they should get a grant of $600 as<lb/>originally.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon.

If the money was to be ap<lb break="no"/>propriated in proportion to efficiency and<lb/>the number of pupils, he though, as some<lb/>schools, with sixty or seventy, only got<lb/>three hundred dollars, for a school with<lb/>eight-five pupils four hundred dollars<lb/>would be sufficient.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. KERR</persName> thought that returns should be<lb/>handed in by the schools showing their<lb/>state, and that they should also show how<lb/>many free scholars received instruc<lb break="no"/>tion, before the grant should issue. The<lb/>Chatham Academy instructs some twelve<lb/>poor children free of expense.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName> said the returns<lb/>were handed in much more regularly now<lb/>than formerly and these were compared<lb/>with the reports of the Inspectors. He<lb/>thought the idea of hon. member for<lb/>Northumberland with regard to free chil<lb break="no"/>dren a good one.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. KERR</persName> asked if these schools get<lb/>Provincial grants as well as these special<lb/>amounts.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName> replied that a few<lb/>do, but in these cases the amount granted<lb/>was very small.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName> again appealed to the<lb/>House to have the grant increased<lb/>$200, and if not complied with he should<lb/>move for the papers relating to the mat<lb break="no"/>ter to be laid before the House.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Some other members expressed their<lb/>opinions on the subject, after which the<lb/>original sum of $400 was granted.<lb/>

            <p>5th Resolution. That a sum of $200<lb/>be granted for the encouragement of the<lb/>Fisheries.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>6th. That a sum of $6500 be granted<lb/>for Provincial Penitentiary.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>This was the same amount as he found<lb/>in the estimates prepared by Mr. Gilmore,<lb/>and he knew that this Establishment<lb/>could not be carried on at so low a rate<lb/>as formerly. There was a large number<lb/>of inmates and provisions were very<lb/>much higher in price. There was a defi<lb break="no"/>ciency and debentures had to be issued<lb/>for $3500. He thought it best to have<lb/>the amount required put in the estimates<lb/>at once, than to have to provide for it af<lb break="no"/>terwards.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. KERR</persName> thought this one of the<lb/>most unsatisfactory grants made.

     <lb/>Then a large number of cases were sent<lb/>from the Police Court of Saint John, and<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon.

Just as they had<lb/>got ready to do something a fire broke<lb/>out and destroyed the work shops and<lb/>machinery, and for a long time nothing<lb/>was done. The machinery could not be<lb/>got from the States. Cornbroom too was<lb/>high, but with that they did a little bet<lb break="no"/>ter. Everything, however, appeared to be<lb/>all right now, and hopes were entertained<lb/>that matters would work more satisfacto<lb break="no"/>ry. The reason why the debt was not<lb/>reduced when gold was high was that at<lb/>that time there was a large expenditure<lb/>for machinery, and now they would have<lb/>to do the best they could. He agreed<lb/>with the hon. member from Northumber<lb break="no"/>land that there are offenders sent there<lb/>who should not be. Men and boys sent<lb/>for 40 or 60 days who have to mingle with<lb/>old offenders, and besides this it is almost<lb/>impossible to make their labor very pro<lb break="no"/>fitable.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName> thought the prodecessors

Mr. Cruikshank was giving<lb/>his notes to raise money and these were<lb/>floating about the City.

     The sum had previously been $16,000,   
     <lb/>but taking into consideration the increas<lb break="no"/>ed number of inmates and the high price<lb/>of provisions it was found it could not<lb/>be done for less than the sum he had put<lb/>down. There were now 209 attendants<lb/>and the building was quite free.<lb/>

     CONNECTION OF RAILWAY LINES 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Select Committee appionted to 
     <lb/>take into consideration "A Bill to<lb/>authorize the connectino of Railway<lb/>lines, and to provide for the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of connecting lines of Railway in<lb/>this Province," having reccommended<lb/>the passing of the same ; the House re<lb break="no"/>solved itself into a Committee of the<lb/>Whole (Mr. BECKWITH in the chair)<lb/>to take the Bill into consideration.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. STEVENS said he had derived<lb/>his information in preparing this Bil<lb/>from similar Acts which had passed<lb/>in Canada and in the State of Main. He<lb/>had submitted the Bill to the Attorney<lb/>of the St. Andrew's and Woodstock<lb/>Railway Company, and he had seen<lb/>nothing in the Bill but would recom<lb break="no"/>mend itself to the judgment of the hon.<lb/>members of the House. There were<lb/>connecting lines of Railway being built<lb/>in the Province, and it was necessary<lb/>in order to the effectual working of<lb/>those lines that provision should be<lb/>made, in case any difficulty should<lb/>occur, that they should be compelled to<lb/>allow the connection to be made. It<lb/>also makes a provision to compel them<lb/>to take freight from one line to the<lb/>other without transhipment, and regu<lb break="no"/>lates the rate of charges for carrying<lb/>such freight. These are the provisions<lb/>of the Bill. He did not anticipate much<lb/>trouble, but it might arise, therefore it<lb/>it was better to have a law of this kind.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName> said he was on the<lb/>Select Committee, and had raed this<lb/>Bill over carefully, and had made some<lb/>suggestions which were adopted. He<lb/>had no dobut but that the Bill was all<lb/>right, but still he would like to restrict<lb/>the Bill to two years. During that time<lb/>the St. Stephen's line would be the<lb/>only line that would be affected by it.<lb/>If the time was extended other Railway<lb/>Companies would say, we built our lines<lb/>under certain rights then existing, and<lb/>you have no right to modify them. You<lb/>held out certain rights and we thought<lb/>we would always enjoy them in per<lb break="no"/>petuity. They had better restrict it to<lb/>two years, and then if it works well<lb/>you could continue it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. sTEVENS would agree with<lb/>that, for if the Bill was good it could be<lb/>

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>re-enacted. He then moved this addi<lb break="no"/>tional section: "That this Act shall<lb/>continue in operation for three years<lb/>from the passing of the same."<lb/>

            <p>Mr. SUTTON said if anything was<lb/>proposed that was going to benefit the<lb/>County of Northumberland hi hon.<lb/>friend (Mr. Smith) was sure to oppose<lb/>it. He was willing to support the grant<lb/>for the St. John River, but was going<lb/>to oppose the grant to Miramichi. This<lb/>he did not consider fair play, for the<lb/>grant was needed there to enable tow<lb/>boats to proceed up the river, and not<lb/>for the purpose of enabling parties to<lb/>drive logs.<lb/>
