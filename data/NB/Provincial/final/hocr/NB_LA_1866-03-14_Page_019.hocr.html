<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bers</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rural</span>
districts. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> not <br />
heard a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">single</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> complain that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> not called
together soon <br />
enough. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it is</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">called un-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">til</span> the 10th of April. In Prince
Edward's <br />
Island the 9th of April ; in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia</span> <br />
ten days or a fortnigh ago. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span>
he <br />
thought one man had stopped the whole <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span> power of the country.
I was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sent</span> to Washington by my
colleagues. <br />
Mr. Cudlip was invited to meet the dela- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gates,</span> who expected to meet <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> New <br />
York, but he could not go. I went to <br />
St. John. Mr. Wilmot was not there, and <br />
the Government agreed that I should go to<br />
Washington to meet the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span>.
<br />
We did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expect to</span> how to go
into an <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eleborate</span> discussion of the
Reciprocity <br />
Treaty at all. We we<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> a view of <br />
obtaining <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the United States
an ex- <br />
tension of the Treaty for one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span>
<br />
When we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">got</span> there we found a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treaty</span> <br />
could not be made at all, for all Treaties <br />
made between the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span>
and <br />
other Governments requires the affirma- <br />
tion of the Senate, and does not require <br />
to be sent to the House of Representa- <br />
tives, for if they have power to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">make a</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commercial</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treaty</span> they ignore the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">func-</span> <br />
tions of that body. In the interchange <br />
of commodities it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desirable</span>
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> <br />
some arrangement made of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perman-</span>
<br />
ent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">character.</span> They said
whatever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ar-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rangements</span> were made should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">car-</span> <br />
ried out by future <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> i<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">n all good</span> <br />
faith. We. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entered</span> into
negociations <br />
with them ; the proposition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span>
by us <br />
and their answer, hove been published . <br />
We felt we could not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span> to
their <br />
terms, in justice to our own people, and <br />
we therefore <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">closed</span> our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiations</span> . I <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sha</span>ll not say anything further
upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> <br />
point, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> I may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> an oportunity of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explaining exactly</span> what took
place while <br />
I was there. It has been said that the <br />
interests of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> of this
Province <br />
are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">safe</span> in calling the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> <br />
together at so late a period. It is very <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desirable</span> to call the House
together <br />
rather, later, for we know when the <br />
House breaks up before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">River</span>
opens <br />
it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">makes</span> it difﬁcult for some of
us to get <br />
home. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Was i</span>t <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever sai</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">d
by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> <br />
of a deliberative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assembly</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
<br />
a Government should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ous</span>ted
from <br />
power because <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> called the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legisla-</span> <br />
ture three weeks later <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span>
usual. There <br />
is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> substantial reason why
this <br />
Legislature should not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">called</span>
earlier. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It was </span>known that Canada was<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anxious</span>
<br />
that our Session should be called. Why <br />
did they not call their own ; they have <br />
not had a Session for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">last</span>
fifteen <br />
months, except a short Session, which <br />
was called last Spring to authorise a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loan</span> and impose an additional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tax.</span>
<br />
When treaty<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> with the United States <br />
had<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> to be made by Legislation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> it <br />
not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufficient</span> to justify the
House in not <br />
meeting at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">usual</span> period,
because, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span> we had made an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangement</span> with the <br />
United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government </span>it would re- <br />
quire to be legislated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon by this
Leg- <br />
islature. It has been brought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span>
<br />
us that we brought forward no measure s <br />
last Session <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">except</span> the Military
Bill. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Where is the Treasury Note Bill, or the<br />
</span>Post Office Bill ? which has been put<br />
forward as a first step towards the re-<br />
moval of the seat of Government, but<br />
which was not thought of at all, it<br />
being merely to abolish the head of a<br />
department. It was not expected under<br />
the circumstances, that measures would<br />
be brought forward last Session, when<br />

brought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
a Bill to abolish the office of Postmaster<br />
General, but the hon. members, fresh <br />
from their constituents, supported it<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thirty</span>
to nine. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There is</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a feeling</span> <br />
throughout the country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that the office</span>
<br />
might be abolished without detriment to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>

had discharged the duties of the office <br />
as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efficiently as </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span>
had, <br />
since its creation. When the hon. gen- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tleman</span> had told the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span>
of York <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <br />
they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to be destroye</span>d, did he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tell</span> <br />
them that when Mr. Wilmot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
myself <br />
formed the Government they had not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forgotten</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests of </span>York? In the <br />
formation of the Government, they had <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selected</span> one-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">third</span> of the members from <br />
that County,v<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iz :</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the hon. </span>Commissioner <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Board</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Works, the</span> Attorney <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General,</span> <br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Postmaster</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General, who,</span> being <br />
a member of the Upper House, ﬁlled <br />
one of the most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">important</span>
offices in the <br />
country, and being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interested</span> in
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
prosperity of the County of York. How <br />
dare they say to the people of this <br />
country that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> were not<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going to give </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">York fair play</span> ? How<br />
could they expect the seat of Govern-<br />
ment could be removed with one-third<br />
of the entire Government from the<br />
Country of York ? I believe it was the<br />
fear of this, together with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agitation</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fenianism,</span> that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had an</span> influence <br />
in the election ; for I believe the people <br />
of this country are as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> much against
the <br />
Quebec <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme</span> as ever. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If</span> you get a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> will provide for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the interests</span> <br />
of the people, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will go</span> for it
;
but it is <br />
not in the four corners of that scheme<br />
to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span>. My hon. friend says,
the <br />
Quebec Scheme is in the Speech. It is <br />
there because the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gove</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rnor</span> is com- <br />

by the despatch to submit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it to</span> <br />
