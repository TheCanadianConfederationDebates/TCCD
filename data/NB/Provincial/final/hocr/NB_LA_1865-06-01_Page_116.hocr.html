morning to the Executive Council and<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
told my colleagues that I met them for<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the last time, and went home and wrote<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
out my resignation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">; when</span> I

suaded me not to resign. I was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surprised</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
that they should have known that such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
was my intention, for I had mentioned it<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
to no one except my colleagues in the Gov-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ernment, altho' I felt I was doing injustice<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
to the Government and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myself,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yet</span> I re-<br />
mained because I felt it was a duty I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">owed</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
to my country to oppose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Scheme.
In <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Regard to the Intercolonial </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railroad.</span> <br />
prospect we may have had under the for-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mer arrangement would be swept away<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
by this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation, for</span> it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
interest of Canada, Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia</span>
and<br />
Prince Edward Island, to have it go by <br />
the North Shore route, and it was known<br />
in England <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and known</span> by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadians</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
that the line would be constructed by that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
route, and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> sooner it
would go <br />
there than to be put through <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
centre of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the country where nobody lives. Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
has a trade with the north part of the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
country already, and no party will remain<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
in power that does <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> pass the
railway<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
through by that route. Let me ask my<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
hon. friend from Restigouche, where is<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
the survey of Mr. Fleming ? Does he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
know why Mr. Fleming has not reported ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
Was it not promised that this survey<br />
should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be published</span> before the
election ? <br />
Why is it that his report is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">kept</span>
back ?<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
It is kept <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back for</span> a particular
purpose,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
hence it is necessary to move this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolu-</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
tion. It was attempted to be urged that<br />
there was no necessity for us to appoint<br />
delegates ; that there was no necessity<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
for telling the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span>
Government that<br />
we were loyal. I we find men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occupying</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
the position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> Judge
Haliburton does<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
in England, charging the men and Gov- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ernment </span>of this Province with
disloyalty ;<br />
telling the people in Halifax that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ma-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
jority against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> in
this coun-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
try is only 400, and that something should<br />
be done to bring about a reaction. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
was urged by the promoters of this <br />
Scheme, that we must go into Confedera-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
tion to defend ourselves against the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yan-</span><br />
kees who were going to gobble us up ; to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
defend ourselves against a nation who<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
have proved to the world <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that no</span>
two na-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
tions are able to compete with them, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
while the advocates of the Scheme admit<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
that Canada is the most vulnerable point,<br />
and that we were placing ourselves in a<br />
position that they could, under the Co<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">n-
<br />
script Act, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span> our young men
out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
country to ﬁght her battles. We have <br />
never shown anything else but allegiance <br />
to the Sovereign ; we hare never burnt<br />
our Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buildings,</span> or
professed any-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
thing but respect for the Queen's repre-<br />
sentative. If they have got into difficul-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ties let them protect themselves, and not<br />
call upon us to support them. If there<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
was no other Section of the Scheme that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">condemn</span> it this Section
would,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
which allows the Government of Canada<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to make any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advance</span> which they may<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
deem necessary for the Militia defence of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the country, and the debt would be as-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
sumed by the General Government. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
was amused at the remarks made here<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
that if the constituents had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span>
opportu-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
nity of speak out there would be a majori-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ty of the people of the country in favor of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation. It might be so in the <br />
County of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Albert,</span> or the County
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resti-</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<hr />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gouche,
where, I believe, one of my hon.<br />
friends was returned by 400 votes, and<br />
the other by 300. In those little counties<br />
influences are brought to work in regard<br />
to their mines and minerals, but after all<br />
they could carry but a bare majority, and<br />
this is not criterion to judge or base an<br />
opposition to this resolution. The Gov-<br />
ernment expected to come in with a ma-<br />
jority of no less than twenty-six. I say<br />
this question was not fairly tried, the<br />
Opposition had to contend with the pro-<br />
mises of nine or ten million dollars that<br />
was to be expended in the country ; these<br />
strong influences were brought to bear on<br />
the tradesman and mechanic. We, on the<br />
other side, could draw no picture of the<br />
future ; we could not go out and tell the<br />
candidates to come out in favor of Anti-<br />
Confederation, and we would secure their<br />
seats ; we could not go out and promise<br />
mean that we would do this and that for<br />
them. It, therefore, comes with a bad<br />
grace for the other party to say that these<br />
elections were carried by the side issues. I<br />
have heard it stated that the Scheme of<br />
Confederation was not tried at all at the<br />
election, but that it was rejected because<br />
the Government had made themselves<br />
obnoxious to the people. When I left<br />
that Government we were in a ma-<br />
jority, and could have carried that mea-<br />
sure</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—if Dr. Dow, Mr. Fisher and
my-<br />
self had been united</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—through the
House<br />
of Assembly by a majority of twenty-two.<br />
When I hear it put forth to the country<br />
that the dissolution was caused in con-<br />
sequence of the necessity that existed,<br />
inasmuch as Canada and Nova Scotia<br />
were going to pass the measure, and time<br />
would be lost if we waited another year.<br />
When did that occur to the Government?<br />
If that was correct, then was the Govern-<br />
ment of which I was a member guilty of<br />
an outrageous fraud upon the public in<br />
the County of Northumberland, in issu-<br />
ing a writ for the return of one member.<br />
There was no such intention or determi-<br />
nation on the part of the Government to<br />
dissolve the House. It was not dreamed<br />
of, until it was made known that I intend-<br />
ed to resign. We were told that Nova<br />
Scotia was going to carry the Scheme by<br />
an overwhelming majority ; Canada was<br />
going to carry it, and that New Bruns-<br />
wick would be left out in the cold. Why<br />
did not Nova Scotia carry it? No states-<br />
man there dare run the risk of losing his<br />
position by bringing it forward, in view<br />
of New Brunswick having rejected it.<br />
They had honesty enough to admit that<br />
they could not carry it. We were told<br />
that by the assimilation of our tariffs the<br />
people were to grow rich and that we<br />
had no field for the operations of the me-<br />
chanics, unless we went into Confedera-<br />
tion ; while the fact was, that Canada had<br />
abundance of every thing with which we<br />
could supply her ; and we would have to<br />
depend upon her for all time to come for<br />
the necessaries of life. Then it was said<br />
we would get the railway at one-<br />
twelfth of its cost ; but was it no be-<br />
hind the scenes that it could not be built<br />
without going on with the simultaneous<br />
construction of the Canal system. It had to<br />
be built with our own money, but under the<br />
direction of the Government in Canada.<br />
If we believe that there are strong repre-<br />
sentations made to the British Government<br />
which might cause them to take action<br />
against us</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—is it not our duty to
appoint<br />
a delegation to check that influence ? In<br />
the report of a speech of a leading states-<br />
man in England, that the Scheme was<br />
rejected in Prince Edward Island, in<br />
consequence of religious disaffection,<br />
every one that knows the Island, </span></p>
<hr />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knows that
it is not the case. The<br />
Government put forth all its influence<br />
to carry this Scheme. They told the<br />
people of Fredericton that in view of the<br />
Intercolonial railway coming near them,<br />
the seat of Government would be estab-<br />
lished there for all time to come, and they<br />
would derive advantages which no other<br />
County would ; they had a great portion<br />
of the talent of the country in their favor.<br />
The delegates were men of great talent,<br />
and they had within their means promises<br />
of elevation to the other branch of the<br />
Legislature. I met in my canvas, letters<br />
calling upon men to vote for Confedera-<br />
tion. If I have done no other service<br />
in opposing this Scheme than bringing<br />
out the talent of the late Surveyor Gene-<br />
ral, which, but for this Scheme, would<br />
have remained hidden ; for this I feel I<br />
am entitled to the thanks of the constitu-<br />
ency of Restigouche. In the reply made<br />
to the move of the resolution, he had<br />
evinced the ability of an able financier,<br />
and when the House knew that he had<br />
none to assist him, that his own fertile<br />
brain, they were entitled to every con-<br />
sideration. If this Confederation Scheme<br />
had been carried, it would have brought<br />
our Legislature down to a mere munici-<br />
pality, and no man of any standing would<br />
have accepted a seat in it. It may be<br />
that there is a hidden hand somewhere,<br />
and it may be that they are sincere in<br />
their motives, or it may be a desire to get<br />
back into their positions again. I would<br />
rather lose my position to-morrow than I<br />
would do an act which I believed would<br />
bring a stain upon the Legislature or a<br />
stigma upon the country which gave me<br />
birth. I am not prepared to give the<br />
people's rights to Canada, knowing their<br />
former history. We have nothing to gain<br />
by this connection, while Canada has<br />
every thing to gain ; they could come into<br />
the Province and take thirty thousand<br />
seamen to man their boats. I am not<br />
going to say that our safety consists in<br />
our helplessness ; but I believe that there<br />
is no more danger of the United States<br />
declaring war against New Brunswick<br />
than there is of our declaring war among<br />
ourselves. Heaven forbid that I should<br />
be an annexationist ; yet, in any at-<br />
tempt to force this measure upon up, I<br />
could have my own choice which of the<br />
two evils to take (Mr. Connell.</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—You<br />
would force others.) I would force you<br />
to remain where you are for the next<br />
three years, if my voice would help to<br />
keel down Confederation. I shall not<br />
take up any more time, but having made<br />
these few hurried remarks in reference to<br />
it, I shall take my seat.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. MCCLELLAN.</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—I rise to reply only<br />
to that portion of my hon. friend's speech<br />
which has referenc to the County of Al-<br />
bert. The Chief Commissioner has com-<br />
plained of the members attacking him in<br />
the House ; we have done so because he<br />
was the only organ of the late Government<br />
in the present. Although there may be a<br />
great gulf between the present and late<br />
bridge over that gulf, it must be the Chief<br />
Commissioner himself. I have not at-<br />
tacked him unjustifiably, because in my<br />
remarks that have been made he has been<br />
generally the aggressor ; he has on seve-<br />
ral occasions alluded to the influences<br />
which were at work in the County of<br />
Albert to secure my influence in favor of<br />
Confederation. At the last Session of the<br />
Legislature, a motion was made to ap-<br />
