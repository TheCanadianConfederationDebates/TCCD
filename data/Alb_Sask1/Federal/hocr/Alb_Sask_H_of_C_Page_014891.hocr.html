               question suggested by the statement just 
               <br />
               made. An Arctic expedition, that of Captain 
               <br />

               ests in the Hudson bay are increasing more 
               <br />
               and more, and I think the government 
               <br />
               should take some steps to keep that expedi-

               an extended and somewhat involved legal

               argument, which I have no intention what-

               one other accusation to make and that was 
               <br />
               a charge of unfair conduct with respect to 
               <br />
               Lord Dundonald. But what were the facts 
               <br />
               in that matter? Lord Dundonald, a servant 
               <br />
               of this government, was dismissed for in- 
               <br />
               subordination or something very nearly akin 
               <br />
               to it, our hon. friends on the other side 
               <br />
               sought to dignify this ‘incident’ into one of 
               <br />
               the chief planks in their political platform 
               <br />
               at the last election, and the result was that 
               <br />
               the people simply laughed them to scorn. 
               <br />
               When the House adjourned last night, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, or rather this morning, I was en- 
               <br />
               deavouring to call attention to the history 
               <br />
               of the legislation affecting the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, especially with regard to the 
               <br />
               subject of education, and also of the litiga- 
               <br />
               tion which arose out of that legislation and 
               <br />
               the painful agitation which was the result. 
               <br />
               1 had come to that stage of my remarks 
               <br />
               at which I had to take occasion to refer to 
               <br />
               the two conspicuous cases arising out of that 
               <br />
               legislation. The ﬁrst case is that of the 
               <br />
               city of Winnipeg vs. Barrett. That case 
               <br />
               was instituted for the simple and sole pur- 
               <br />
               pose of determining one point, namely, ‘did 
               <br />
               the School Act of Manitoba of 1890 prejudi- 
               <br />
               cially affect any right or privilege in respect 
               <br />
               of denominational schools, which any class 
               <br />
               of persons had by law or practice in Mani- 
               <br />
               toba at the union?’ There was, in my hum- 
               <br />
               ble judgment, but one answer to that ques- 
               <br />
               tion. Nobody could say that the system of 
               <br />
               schools prevailing in Manitoba at the time 
               <br />
               of its union with Canada existed by law or 
               <br />
               was protected by law, and the decision of the 
               <br />
