            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">Hon. Mr. HOLTON</persName> said
               the observations he had just heard <lb/>
               were very gratifying to him. Now they had the assurance of the <lb/>
               Government that they were going to adopt boldly the view which it <lb/>
               became his duty to express; and he had no doubt that the sum he <lb/>
               had indicated as the maximum sum for this service, to wit, half a <lb/>
               million dollars, would be found to be near the mark. He
               affirmed <lb/>
               that the investigation regarding the administration of the Militia <lb/>
               Department had had the effect of bringing the Government to adopt <lb/>
               the policy which they had announced that day. <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p> <persName ref="pers:JONE3">Mr. JONES</persName> repudiated
               the idea that the West Point Military <lb/>
               School was superior to that of Sandhurst, England, and advocated <lb/>
               the expenditure of more money. <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOWE1">Mr. BOWELL</persName> was of
               opinion that very little good resulted from <lb/>
               the annual camps, and referred to the reluctance with which <lb/>
               employers permitted employees to attend the camps. He also called <lb/>
               attention to the fact that in some of the companies there were four <lb/>
               men to each officer, while in one company there were two
               officers <lb/>
               to one man. He hoped the Minister of Militia would consider well <lb/>
               before he gave his consent to the calling out of the men into camp, <lb/>
               for the present system of camp drill was an utter and useless waste <lb/>
               of money. <lb/>

               system of drill, and he thought if the men were called out it should <lb/>
               not be until September, for in the present condition of the labour <lb/>
               market, it would be a great hardship on the employers. He thought <lb/>
               the system which it was proposed to introduce next year would <lb/>
               prove to be the proper one. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BERG2">Mr. BERGlN</persName> was also

               the present state of the labour market to call out a large body of men <lb/>
               for camp drill. <lb/>

               its approval or disapproval; but he did not know whether the <lb/>

               had been lying over for settlement for the past three years, he <lb/>
               thought the final settlement should be left over
               for another year. <lb/>
