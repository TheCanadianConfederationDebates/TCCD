     in good  faith to the Government of

     of the season to  adopt our present rate

     of duty,  speculators might import

     <lb/>
    increase the duty 40 cents above what 
     <lb/> it was, would be unfair to traders

     <lb/>saw no  course open but to adopt the

     <lb/>the  matter, they would  not, just now,

        large quantities of liquor would be im<lb break="no"/>ported  here, and it it would not take  
     <lb/> place, it would be no gain to our local

     Which was, according to his view of 
     <lb/>
     the matter, sufficient to prove that if 
     <lb/>
     so inclined this Island could keep out 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation. But what surprised 
     <lb/>
     him was to notice the change which 
     <lb/>
     had come over the hon. the junior 
     <lb/>
     member for Belfast. In the " Patriot" 
     <lb/>of the 12th September, 1867, he found<lb/>
    him thus describing the situation of 
     <lb/>Canada :—" They are at this hour in<lb break="no"/>debted for canals, railways and other 
     <lb/>political jobs, about £40 per family.<lb/>No later han last year they were beg<lb break="no"/>ging and borrowing money in England, 
     <lb/>at a heavy rate of interest. to pay the 
     <lb/>amount due on a portion of their pub<lb break="no"/>lic debt. With the help of New 
     <lb/>Brunswick and Nova Scotia they have 
     <lb/>a rickety nationality and must be pre<lb break="no"/>pared to pay its costly responsibilities." 
     <lb/>If such was the state of the public<lb/>finances of Canada in 1867, what 
     <lb/>grounds had they for supposing it was 
     <lb/>any better now? The indebtedness of 
     <lb/>the Dominion was $162,000,000 of 
     <lb/>which, if we entered into union with 
     <lb/>her, we would have to pay our full 
     <lb/>proportion—or the one-fortieth part. 
     <lb/>Besides the public works of Canada are 
     <lb/>annually increasing to an extent un<lb break="no"/>known in any new country, which is, 
     <lb/>and will be adding greatly to her in<lb break="no"/>debtedness. It is now, just one hun<lb break="no"/>dred years since we received our Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, and when he looked around<lb/>and saw both sides determined to sur<lb break="no"/>render it, he felt sorry. Our gallant 
     <lb/>little ship has bravely rode through 
     <lb/>many a storm, and he felt it was wrong 
     <lb/>to give up now.

     almost as highly taxed as they are in

     <persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. Mr. POPE</persName>.—Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     rise to move that this House do now 
     <lb/>
     resolve itself into a Committee of the 
     <lb/>
     whole House to take into consideration 
     <lb/>
     the despatches having reference to a 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada, and do hope we 
     <lb/>
     may approach the discussion of the 
     <lb/>
     subject with a due regard to its im<lb break="no"/>portance. It is, sir, one of those great 
     <lb/>
     and important questions which will 
     <lb/>
    affect us and our children after us. 
     <lb/>First, I will say a word respecting 
     <lb/>
 
 
            <cb/>
          
          
      myself in so far as I have had public<lb break="no"/>ly to do with this matter. For years 
     <lb/>
     I have been in favor of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     providing we could obtain terms just 
     <lb/>
     to this Island. The Quebec Scheme 
     <lb/>
     I did not regard as such, and saw that 
     <lb/>
     if we then admitted the principle, we 
     <lb/>
     would have had to send Delegates 
     <lb/>
     home to assist in preparing a Bill, and 
     <lb/>
     that if we did so, our Island would be 
     <lb/>
     outwitted in the arrangements which 
     <lb/>
     would be agreed to. With these cer<lb break="no"/>tain facts before us, I thought our best 
     <lb/>
     course was, to use those means best 
     <lb/>
     adapted to keep us at that time out of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion. My connection with 
     <lb/>
     what took place at the Alexandra 
     <lb/>
     Hotel, in London, has often been re<lb break="no"/>ferred to. I happened to visit that 
     <lb/>
     Hotel in London when the Delegates 
     <lb/>
     front the other Provinces were there 
     <lb/>
     consoling on matters relating to the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the other Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I was not more then twenty minutes 
     <lb/>
     there altogether, and did not as much 
     <lb/>
     as sit down. The Delegates asked 
     <lb/>
     me how it was that the people of this 
     <lb/>
     Island were so much opposed to a 
     <lb/>
     union with the other Provinces? I 
     <lb/>
     said they regarded the Terms offered 
     <lb/>
     in the Quebec Scheme as unjust and 
     <lb/>
     illiberal. Take for instance, I said, 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, the people of that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince have their crown lands, coal 
     <lb/>
     mines, gold mines, and other minerals 
     <lb/>
    as a source of local revenue, and the 
     <lb/>some is true also of the other Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ; whereas Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land has nothing but a curse entailed 
     <lb/>upon her people in the shape of the 
     <lb/>Leasehold Tenure. Give us enough 
     <lb/>to wipe that out, and the people will 
     <lb/>as readily consider the question as 
     <lb/>those of the other Provinces. Well, 
     <lb/>said they, what amount will do that? 
     <lb/>I replied that Mr. Coles said it would 
     <lb/>take a million of dollars, and without 
     <lb/>going into calculations, said perhaps 
     <lb/>that amount would do. Shortly after<lb break="no"/>wards, I received a note from them to 
     <lb/>say they came to a unanimous resolu<lb break="no"/>tion to offer $800,000. From that 
     <lb/>

     time I considered that if Canada had 
     <lb/>
    consented to it, I would have felt it to be 
     <lb/>my duty to have then submitted the 
     <lb/>question to the people at the polls for 
     <lb/>their approval or rejection. Now 
     <lb/>while I have been represented as a 
     <lb/>Confederate, my political associates 
     <lb/>have been strong Anti-Confederates, 
     <lb/>and whilst they are accused of chang<lb break="no"/>ing their views, it is due to them to 
     <lb/>say, that necessity, not choice, causes 
     <lb/>them now to look forward to a union 
     <lb/>with the Dominion. It is proper to 
     <lb/>enquire how this necessity came about. 
     <lb/>The hon. member the Leader of the 
     <lb/>Opposition said, when the Railway 
     <lb/>Bill, was passed he thought our liber<lb break="no"/>ties were gone. Now I never looked 
     <lb/>at it in that way. When the Railway 
     <lb/>Bill was carried it was also said, that 
     <lb/>it was introduced for the purpose of 
     <lb/>forcing us into Confederation. The 
     <lb/>hon. member for New London said so 
     <lb/>last year. I can assure this hon. 
     <lb/>House such was not the intention. I 
     <lb/>for one, believed it would with proper 
     <lb/>management be found to be a public 
     <lb/>benefit and believe so still. I will 
     <lb/>look for a moment at the career of the 
     <lb/>late government, and see if their con<lb break="no"/>duct was consistent with their profes<lb break="no"/>sions, and whether they sacrificed the 
     <lb/>interests of the country or their own, 
     <lb/>for the purpose of keeping themselves 
     <lb/>in power. In passing the Railway 
     <lb/>Bill I considered it a necessity. They 
     <lb/>are the best and cheapest modes of 
     <lb/>transport we can have, and when we 
     <lb/>take into account that according to our 
     <lb/>population, we produce more than 
     <lb/>they do in any similar portion of terri<lb break="no"/>tory in British North America, why 
     <lb/>should we not have those facilities of 
     <lb/>which other people avail themselves ? 
     <lb/>and I am still convinced when we shall 
     <lb/>have the road in operation we will 
     <lb/>wonder how we did so long without 
     <lb/>one. But the late government when 
     <lb/>they came into power, though profess<lb break="no"/>edly opposed to the Railway in any 
     <lb/>shape or form, yet their first act was 
     <lb/>to go in for the construction of the 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
           
           
     branch lines. Now if the country had 
     <lb/>
     as much of a debt as it could bear in 
     <lb/>
     the main line, and they were sincere 
     <lb/>
     in their professions, why should they 
     <lb/>
     have gone in for the immediate con<lb break="no"/>struction of fifty miles more? Thus 
     <lb/>
     adding £250,000 more to the debt of 
     <lb/>
     the Colony. For my part, I have 
     <lb/>
     always felt the late government had 
     <lb/>
     no just reason for doing so. During 
     <lb/>
     the session of 1871 the question was 
     <lb/>
     introduced because we felt it was only 
     <lb/>
     a question of time. I was then lead 
     <lb/>
     to propose it, because of the prosperous 
     <lb/>
     state of the country for the two previ<lb break="no"/>ous years, and felt if economy and 
     <lb/>
     ordinary prudence were observed, we 
     <lb/>
     could do so. On the 19th of June 
     <lb/>
     when the measure was before the 
     <lb/>
     House, I considered the government 
     <lb/>
     had no excuse for going on with the 
     <lb/>
     branch lines. I said so then. The 
     <lb/>
     spring was late, and every circum<lb break="no"/>stance combined to admonish us to 
     <lb/>
     prudence, as plainly as they foresha<lb break="no"/>dowed a disastrous season. I opposed 
     <lb/>
     them in every way I could. I felt the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of this, I knew the country 
     <lb/>
     required we should do so. Yet in the 
     <lb/>
     face of all reasonable retnonstrance, 
     <lb/>
     they introduced and carried the branch 
     <lb/>
     Bill and strange to say, without mak<lb break="no"/>ing any provision for raising the inter<lb break="no"/>est which the cost of their construction 
     <lb/>
     would entail upon the country. If 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for New London 
     <lb/>
     thought 2 1/2 per cent, insufficient for 
     <lb/>
     the mainline, what are we to think of 
     <lb/>
     him for passing his Bill without, mak<lb break="no"/>ing any provision for interest at all. 
     <lb/>
     I told them at the time that it would 
     <lb/>
     be attended with bad results, and that 
     <lb/>
     it might be the means of injuring the 
     <lb/>
     credit of the colony. Notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing all remonstrance, the Bill was 
     <lb/>
     passed, $250,000 was added to the 
     <lb/>
     debt of the colony without making any 
     <lb/>
     provision for paying the interest. 
     <lb/>
     Was it possible for the government to 
     <lb/>
     take a more effectual way to destroy 
     <lb/>
     the public credit of the colony? But 
     <lb/>
     they were in power, and to retain

     their positions were prepared to sacri<lb break="no"/>fice the country. We know—further,<lb/>that the late government obtained<lb/>thier position by making all kinds of<lb/>statements, statements which they<lb/>knew they were not justified in using.<lb/>Yet they circulated them throughout<lb/>thecountry, and made the people believe<lb/>that I and my associates were guilty<lb/>of the charges of corruption, thus<lb/>urged against us, so that it was very<lb/>generally believed that we had com<lb/>mitted a fraud upon the country.<lb/>That we had feathered our own nests<lb/>and had our Bank accounts set right<lb/>all of a sudden. Well they went for<lb/>the building of the branches, and ad<lb break="no"/>vertised for tenders. The contracts<lb/>had to be let on the 30th of December,<lb/>yet no Contractor saw the road. We<lb/>were accused of contracting a surface<lb/>road, but the branches are more of a<lb/>surface road than the trunk line.<lb/>They accused us of overlooking the<lb/>tender of O'Brien and others, and<lb/>thereby favoring Scarieber &amp; Burpee<lb/>at the expense of the country, yet<lb/>they virtually made a private bargain<lb/>with Schrieber &amp; Burpee, and gave<lb/>them nearly $1,000 a mile more for<lb/>the branches than the government of<lb/>which I was a member gave for build<lb break="no"/>ing the main line. The advertise<lb break="no"/>ment stated that payment for building<lb/>the branches would be made in De<lb break="no"/>bentures which were to be taken at<lb/>par. Mr. Schrieber sent in a tender<lb/>at $14,800 a mile for cash. Now a<lb/>cash tender was no tender at all, yet<lb/>they allowed Mr. Schrieber to alter<lb/>this one, while they did not give the<lb/>same opportunity to others. Some of<lb/>whom sent in much lower tenders. I<lb/>find no fault with the men they gave<lb/>the contract to, for by their own action<lb/>in the matter they have shown that<lb/>the men we let the main line to were<lb/>reliable, and that all their own previ<lb break="no"/>ous assertions respecting them were not<lb/>true. They overlooked their hero Mr.<lb/>O'Brien altogether, and as for Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Neill took no account of him or his<lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     tender. When the contact came to 
     <lb/>be signed, the Contractors very pro<lb break="no"/>perly reminded them of what I told<lb/>them, when the Bill was passing<lb/>through the House, that as no provi<lb break="no"/>sion had been made for paying the in<lb break="no"/>terest on the Debentures for the<lb/>branches, it would be impossible to<lb/>float them in the market. Well, what<lb/>were they to do ? The time had ex<lb break="no"/>pired. The contract had to be let.<lb/>They found themselves wholly in the<lb/>power of the Contractors whose offer<lb/>they had accepted. One of the stipu<lb break="no"/>lations of the contract for the main<lb/>line was, that ten per cent of all<lb/>moneys as they became due and were<lb/>to be paid to the Contractor should be<lb/>retained as a guarantee on the part of<lb/>their securities, that the conditions of<lb/>the contract would faithfully ful<lb break="no"/>filled. Hence ten dollars out of every<lb/>one hundred was retained and held<lb/>back as security. The Contractors<lb/>finding the government in this dilemma,<lb/>offered to sign the contract provided<lb/>they would pay over to them the ten<lb/>per cent. thus retained. This they<lb/>did. Now I contend we have no se<lb break="no"/>curity on the main line at all, but the<lb/>character of the men who have the<lb/>contract. I am not afraid of these<lb/>men, or that they will fail to fulfil the<lb/>conditions of their contracts, yet it was<lb/>an unbusiness and awkward position<lb/>for any government to place them<lb break="no"/>selves in. Had they done no more,<lb/>this in itself was sufficient to condemn<lb/>them. But in every act since, and in<lb/>ways which none but themselves<lb/>would have thought of, they resorted<lb/>to those means best suited to destroy<lb/>the public credit of the colony. They<lb/>saw that trade was falling off, that our<lb/>shipments would fall below the aver<lb break="no"/>age of former years, yet they launched<lb/>out more freely than ever in new ex<lb break="no"/>penditures. I wish next to show that<lb/>they did more to bring about Confed<lb break="no"/>eration in one shirt year, than we<lb/>could have done in twenty. Had they<lb/>desired to avoid that result, economy<lb/>
           
     <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">61</fw> 
    
            should have been their rule. The con<lb break="no"/>trary was their policy. Recklessness<lb/>characterised what they did. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve besides the amount voted for one<lb/>of Thompson's Road Streamers, that con<lb break="no"/>tracts have been let for the express<lb/>purpose of keeping themselves in<lb/>power. Their N. K. said to them, if<lb/>you do not give me money to build a<lb/>bridge at Victoria at a cost of $4,900,<lb/>I will not support you. The same<lb/>demand came from Clilton to the tune<lb/>of $19,000. Rustico and other places<lb/>made similar demands, which of course<lb/>could not be refused, and in addition<lb/>to those a new Steam Ferry Boat.<lb/>All these works are very well in them<lb break="no"/>selves, but when the government foun<lb/>themselves drifting into difficulties<lb/>through the channel of mismanage<lb break="no"/>ment, prudence should have been re<lb break="no"/>sorted to. They should have halted<lb/>and considered what they were doing.<lb/>Instead of this they acted as if they<lb/>hed become regardless of conseuqences<lb/>and seemed as if they were deter<lb break="no"/>mined to land the Island into a union<lb/>with Canada. Well, perhaps it may<lb/>end for the better, yet it is no reason<lb/>for justifying them in the extraordin<lb break="no"/>ary course they pursed. We know<lb/>also that the Leader of the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment said publicly that if on en<lb break="no"/>quiry it should be found that the<lb/>serious charges made against me and<lb/>my friends, should, on examination, be<lb/>found to be untrue, he would be the<lb/>first man publicly to acknowledge it.<lb/>Well, they brought their inspecting<lb/>Engineers, telegraphed to a meber<lb/>of the government to meet them, with<lb/>instructions to guard them from all<lb/>outside influence ; and I have no doubt<lb/>but the Hon. Mr. Muirdhead. and my<lb/>hon. friend, the member for New<lb/>London, faithfully observed the direc<lb break="no"/>tions of their political commander-in-<lb break="yes"/>chief. Well, this protected by their<lb/>body guard, the Engineers travelled<lb/>through the country and extamined the<lb/>road, returned to New York and sent<lb/>back their report. Instead of accept<lb break="no"/>
            <cb/>
               ing this report, as honorable men 
     <lb/>
     should have done, they wrote back to 
     <lb/>
     the Engineers to know why the line 
     <lb/>
     was 140 miles long instead of 120. 
     <lb/>
     But the Engineers plainly told them 
     <lb/>
     that their enquiries were irrevalent 
     <lb/>
     and inconsistent. I will tell the hon. 
     <lb/>
     members on the opposite side of this 
     <lb/>
     hon. House, why the road was longer 
     <lb/>
     than 120 miles. No hon. member 
     <lb/>
     knows better than the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for New London, that taking the line 
     <lb/>
     to Kensington, at his reqnest, added a 
     <lb/>
     good deal to its length, and the same 
     <lb/>
     was the case in bringing it to other 
     <lb/>
     points, in order that the country at 
     <lb/>
     large might he more generally accom<lb break="no"/>modated. The Engineers told them 
     <lb/>
     plainly that the line could not be 
     <lb/>
     shortened more than five miles, and 
     <lb/>
     not then for the rate per mile allowed 
     <lb/>
     by the Act. Then again, the amount 
     <lb/>
     paid for land damages was far in ex<lb break="no"/>cess of what was fair, and the modes 
     <lb/>
     resorted to for disposing of Debentures 
     <lb/>
     for the payment of land damage De<lb break="no"/>bentures was in itself sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     damage the public credit of any colony. 
     <lb/>
     I do not hesitate to say, that in many 
     <lb/>
     cases, the amount paid for land dam<lb break="no"/>ages was one hundred per cent. more 
     <lb/>
     than it should have been. Then in 
     <lb/>
     the manner they hawked about the 
     <lb/>
     land damage Debentures, they injured 
     <lb/>
     the credit of the colony and the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the Contractors at the same 
     <lb/>
     time. The Contractors made an ar<lb break="no"/>rangement with the Banks for dispos<lb break="no"/>ing of their Debentures. This was 
     <lb/>
     simply a legitimate Bank transaction. 
     <lb/>
     Now, surely it was due to these men 
     <lb/>
     to maintain the credit of the colony. 
     <lb/>
     Instead of doing this, they sent their 
     <lb/>
     Colonial Secretary to the Dominion to 
     <lb/>
     sell Debentures. The Halifax papers 
     <lb/>
     got hold of the affair and used the in<lb break="no"/>formation to the prejudice of our pub<lb break="no"/>lic credit. Their agent then came to 
     <lb/>
     St. John, where by giving his own 
     <lb/>
     note and leaving $28,000 worth of 
     <lb/>
     Debentures in security beside, he suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in obtaining a four months'

     loan for $55,000, at a high rate of in<lb break="no"/>terest. Why, such conduct was sim<lb break="no"/>ply disgraceful and unworthy of any 
     <lb/>
     men conducting the public affairs of a 
     <lb/>
     colony. Why, I feel ashamed to think 
     <lb/>
     our little Island should have not only 
     <lb/>
     had her credit damaged, but her name 
     <lb/>
     disgraced by such shameful conduct, 
     <lb/>
     They say when they came into power, 
     <lb/>
     they found an empty Treasury. The 
     <lb/>
     statement is not correct. There were 
     <lb/>
     but $15,000 afloat in Warrants when 
     <lb/>
     we went out of office, now we find 
     <lb/>
     that $116,000 are out. We left in 
     <lb/>
     the Treasury and Banks about $1,400 
     <lb/>
     in cash more than we found there 
     <lb/>
     when coming into power again. This 
     <lb/>
     money they should have retained for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of paying land damage 
     <lb/>
     claims. Instead of doing that, they 
     <lb/>
     paid it out for other purposes. Why, 
     <lb/>
     they could not in all they did, have 
     <lb/>
     taken any more effectual way for ruin<lb break="no"/>ing the public credit of this colony. 
     <lb/>
     Let such a state of affairs become 
     <lb/>
     known at home, and our paper would 
     <lb/>
     depreciate alarmingly in the stock ex<lb break="no"/>change in London. Although I am a 
     <lb/>
     Confederate, yet many of my political 
     <lb/>
     friends are not. But the difficulty 
     <lb/>
     now is to build up our public credit. 
     <lb/>
     There is nothing so hard to restore as 
     <lb/>
     the public credit of a colony when it 
     <lb/>
     becomes depreciated in the money 
     <lb/>
     market of the world, and hence the 
     <lb/>
     first duty of a government is to take 
     <lb/>
     care not to do anything which might 
     <lb/>
     bring about such a result. The Con<lb break="no"/>tractors have found that no one will 
     <lb/>
     touch the Debentures for the branches, 
     <lb/>
     simply because no provision is made 
     <lb/>
     for raising the interest accruing upon 
     <lb/>
     them. No one can shut his eyes to 
     <lb/>
     the fact, that influences have been 
     <lb/>
     brought to bear against our paper. 
     <lb/>
     Baring Brothers will not take one of 
     <lb/>
     our Bonds, therefore it is, that union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada will place our public 
     <lb/>
     securities on a par with those of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, and our public position will 
     <lb/>
     be better. Feeling as we all do that 
     <lb/>
     all side issues should give way in 
     <lb/>
               
           <cb/>
               
     order that the public credit may be 
     <lb/>
     maintained, and if Confederation will 
     <lb/>
     do this. I believe that in view of all 
     <lb/>
     the difficulties entailed upon the coun<lb break="no"/>try, this side of the House feels con<lb break="no"/>strained to overcome their scruples 
     <lb/>
     against Confederation, and for the 
     <lb/>
     common good, seek to obtain better 
     <lb/>
     terms with a view to unite our destinies 
     <lb/>
     with those of the people of the other 
     <lb/>
     Provinces in the Dominion. Seeing 
     <lb/>
     the position in which the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment involved the country, and the 
     <lb/>
     efforts that were put forth in some 
     <lb/>
     quarters to have men pledged against 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, I felt that it was a con<lb break="no"/>spiracy against the welfare of the 
     <lb/>
    colony, and addressed a short letter to  
     <lb/>the press wherein I stated that such 
     <lb/>were my convictions. Well, they 
     <lb/>went to Ottawa, dissolved the House, 
     <lb/>and have put the question, they say, 
     <lb/>before the people. But in so far as 
     <lb/>submitting the question to the people 
     <lb/>and the terms received goes, it is sim 
     <lb/>ply a farce. Why not have called the 
     <lb/>Legislature together in January, laid 
     <lb/>the state of the colony before the 
     <lb/>House and taken the advice of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment before presuming to adopt a 
     <lb/>course so contrary to their avowed 
     <lb/>principles. Instead of doing that, there 
     <lb/>is not much doubt but that the inten<lb break="no"/>tion was to legislate the Island into 
     <lb/>Confederation if it could have been 
     <lb/>done without an appeal to the people 
     <lb/>at the polls. Contrary to their real 
     <lb/>wish, they did dissolve the House, but 
     <lb/>what means had the people, as a whole, 
     <lb/>of knowing before election what the 
     <lb/>terms were ? They had none. Neither 
     <lb/>did they know what the financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the colony was. All such in<lb break="no"/>formation was kept from them. But 
     <lb/>while this was the case here, it ap<lb break="no"/>pears parties in St. John where not 
     <lb/>kept in ignorance of what was being 
     <lb/>done. The Delegates on their way to 
     <lb/>Ottawa crossed the Straits on Satur<lb break="no"/>day, the 17th of February, and on the 
               <lb/>Monday following, the St. John <hi rendition="simple:italic">Tele<lb break="no"/>graph</hi> came out with an article which 
     <lb/>
         
     <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw>   <fw type="num">63</fw>
     <lb/>
          
     stated that the race for Confederation  
     <lb/>
     had set in, and that it would be, Pope  
     <lb/>
     and a grant to the Catholics, or Laird  
     <lb/>
               and the Protestants. This informa<lb break="no"/>tion through the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Telegraph</hi>, came back 
     <lb/>
     to the Island, and was used to arouse 
     <lb/>
     the religious prejudices of the peeple 
     <lb/>
     from one end of the colony to the 
     <lb/>
     other, to which, in Rona and Rassa, 
     <lb/>
     were added, the complimentary speech 
     <lb/>
     of Col. Gray delivered at St. Dunstan's 
     <lb/>
     College a few years ago. Sir, were it 
     <lb/>
     not by the use of such despicable 
     <lb/>
     means as these, the Hon. Leader. of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition—the junior member for 
     <lb/>
     Belfast—would not have asset here 
     <lb/>
     to-day. This cry took the people by 
     <lb/>
     surprise. They believed if Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion was carried on the terms secured 
     <lb/>
     by the delegates, that the School Ques<lb break="no"/>tion would be settled forever, and act<lb break="no"/>ing upon that conviction and, the pre<lb break="no"/>judices it gave rise to, some of the 
     <lb/>
     strongest Anti-Confederate districts in 
     <lb/>
     the Island voted for Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     But I maintain if the matter was in<lb break="no"/>tended to have been fairly laid before 
     <lb/>
     the people, the House should have 
     <lb/>
     been called, and the question first fair<lb break="no"/>ly discussed in the Legislature. This 
     <lb/>
     was not done, but the Dash-away- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     policy of the hon. member for New 
     <lb/>
     London was substituted in its stead. 
     <lb/>
     I have no wish to abuse hon. members 
     <lb/>
     opposite, but I, nevertheless, cannot 
     <lb/>
     refrain from saying that the course 
     <lb/>
     they pursued was neither fair nor just 
     <lb/>to the country. Seeing now, however,<lb/>
    that matters have come to the crisis 
     <lb/>they have ; and knowing that the ac<lb break="no"/>tion of the late party has done so much 
     <lb/>to hasten on Confederation, I think it 
     <lb/>well becomes both sides to look the 
     <lb/>question fairly in the face. In doing 
     <lb/>so we will, I believe, all see the pro<lb break="no"/>priety of paying some deference to the 
     <lb/>wishes of the Imperial Government. 
     <lb/>It is undeniable also, that in the Do<lb break="no"/>minion we will enjoy advantages which 
     <lb/>we do not now possess, which will 
     <lb/>more than compensate for those we 
     <lb/>shall, to some extent, be called upon 
     <lb/>
          
          
            <cb/>
       
       
     to surrender. But, sir, the Delegates 
     <lb/>
     have signed the terms brought down 
     <lb/>
     and before doing so, I do not doubt, 
     <lb/>
     but that they did the best they could 
     <lb/>
     to obtain the most favorable in their 
     <lb/>
     power ; yet, notwithstanding, justice to 
     <lb/>
     the country demands me to say, that 
     <lb/>
     there were many matters which are 
     <lb/>
     not mentioned in then, that should 
     <lb/>
     have been. I believe we are entitled 
     <lb/>
     to receive from the Dominican sum 
     <lb/>
     sufficient to enable us to supply the 
     <lb/>
    calls which will be made upon our 
     <lb/>local revenue, without having to resort 
     <lb/>to local taxation, which unquestion<lb break="no"/>ably we will have very soon to come, 
     <lb/>to, if we go into Confederation under 
     <lb/>the terms brought down by Messrs 
     <lb/>Haythorne and Laird. I have already 
     <lb/>publicly stated that I did not regard 
     <lb/>them as as those of 1869, and 
     <lb/>think I can clearly show that. But 
     <lb/>oh 1 say they, the Railway is taken off 
     <lb/>your hands. Our Railway will soon 
     <lb/>be in operation and earning money 
     <lb/>while many public works of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion will for years he demanding a 
     <lb/>large outlay from which no return on 
     <lb/>come in for a long time. There is for 
     <lb/>instance the Pacific Railroad, which 
     <lb/>will cost over thirty million dollars. 
     <lb/>On this and other works they will 
     <lb/>have to pay large amounts of money 
     <lb/>before any return will come in, and 
     <lb/>for all these new in course of construc<lb break="no"/>tion or hereafter to be built, this Island 
     <lb/>will be taxed her full proportion. I 
     <lb/>will compare the terms of 1689 and 
     <lb/>1873 :—

     True they take our Railway, but that 
     <lb/>
     consideration aside, I consider it my 
     <lb/>
     duty to look at the matter fairly, and 
     <lb/>
     in doing so, do not hesitate to say. 
     <lb/>
     that this amount would be insufficient, 
     <lb/>
     Again, by the way matters have been 
     <lb/>
     managed of late it is beyond our power 
     <lb/>
     to put the credit of the colony on a 
     <lb/>
     good footing. If our public securities 
     <lb/>
     were offered in the Stock exchange, 
     <lb/>
     and the credit of the colony through 
     <lb/>
     the sale of our Debentures and War<lb break="no"/>rants brought down, we would soon 
     <lb/>
     find ourselves in a position that would 
     <lb/>
     not be very creditable to us. I do 
     <lb/>
     not charge the late government with 
     <lb/>
     doing any act for the purpose of in<lb break="no"/>juring our position. They no doubt 
     <lb/>
     did the best they knew how; but at 
     <lb/>
     the same time, it cannot be denied, but 
     <lb/>
     that they did a great deal to destroy 
     <lb/>
     the public credit. Nor do I hesitate 
     <lb/>
     frankly to affirm, that I see but one 
     <lb/>
     way to restore this, and that is through 
     <lb/>
     Confederation which on fair terms will, 
     <lb/>
     in every way, place us in a better posi<lb break="no"/>tion than we occupy at present. I 
     <lb/>
     wish now to show you, sir, the position 
     <lb/>
     have would be in if these terms were 
     <lb/>
     accepted. For my part as one, I 
     <lb/>
     would not for any consideration go to 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion Government and ask 
     <lb/>
     for terms which I regarded as unfair. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) But I would ask that this 
     <lb/>
     Island be placed in as good a position 
     <lb/>
    as the other Provinces. To arrive at 
     <lb/>a estimate I have taken down the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure for the past year and shall 
     <lb/>compare it with the Terms which I 
     <lb/>assume is a fair basis of calculation :—

            <p>
     Under Confederation we might reduce 
     <lb/>
     our Legislative expenses, as in all pro<lb break="no"/>bability we may then dispense with 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council. In that item 
     <lb/>
     we might save something, but not in 
     <lb/>
     the expenditure required for the Board 
     <lb/>
     of Works, as some hon. members seem 
     <lb/>
     to suppose. I admit that some of our 
     <lb/>
     public works such as lighthouses, 
     <lb/>
     breakwaters, &amp;c., the Dominion will, 
     <lb/>
     should we enter, have to provide for, 
     <lb/>
     and I contend as these will belong to 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion and were built since 
     <lb/>
     1869, they should pay as for them. 
     <lb/>
     The payment for all such were as<lb break="no"/>sumed under the Quebec Scheme, and 
     <lb/>
     it is our right to be placed in these 
     <lb/>
     respects on the same footing. Again 
     <lb/>
     by the terms of the North America 
     <lb/>
     Act we are placed, with regard to 
     <lb/>
     public works, in a worse position than 
     <lb/>
     they are on the mainland. In all 
     <lb/>
     time to come, on account of our isolated 
     <lb/>
     position, we cannot demand from the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion Government one cent for 
     <lb/>
     any public Works to be undertaken by 
     <lb/>
     us after we enter, no matter how much 
     <lb/>
     they may be required. Since the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Terms were announced we 
     <lb/>
     have built a number of such works, 
     <lb/>
     which will after union belong to the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, and certainly, as I have 
     <lb/>
     before stated, we should be paid for 
     <lb/>
     them. To the Dominion the amount 
     <lb/>
     would not be much, but to us it is of 
     <lb/>
    importance, besides it is our due, nor 
     <lb/>do I for a moment believe they will 
     <lb/>object to pay us for them. I there<lb break="no"/>fore do hope that when a delegation 
     <lb/>goes up, that, it will be fortified by a 
     <lb/>strong resolution from this Assembly, 
     <lb/>so that it may not be said they went 
     <lb/>up without the sanction and authority 
     <lb/>of this House. The late government 
     <lb/>called the House to meet on a certain 
     <lb/>day, then dissolved it, and in this hasty 
     <lb/>and indecent way took the country by 
     <lb/>storm on the School Question, which 
     <lb/>was unfair. Now, however, I do not 
     <lb/>see how they can fairly oppose such a 
     <lb/>proposal. They say they are Confed<lb break="no"/>erates, they will therefore see it to be

     <persName ref="pers:LAIR2">Mr. D. Laird</persName>.—I believe it is the 
     <lb/>first time we have heard the Hon.<lb/>Leader of the Government avow that<lb/>he has been, for some time, a Confed<lb break="no"/>erate ; this he does, no doubt, to suit<lb/>his purpose. I am surprised that the<lb/>self-constituted Delegate, to the Alex<lb break="no"/>andra Hotel in London, who was de<lb break="no"/>lighted with the $800,000 offer, is not<lb/>at all satisfied with the offer now be<lb break="no"/>fore the country, containing far better<lb/>
            <cb/>
     terms in every respect. He was pre<lb break="no"/>pared, when he received the $800,000<lb/>offer, to recommend the people of this 
     <lb/>
     Island to accept it. But a change has 
     <lb/>
     come over the spirit of his dream, and 
     <lb/>
     he now tells us that this question has 
     <lb/>
     been forced upon the people in an un<lb break="no"/>warrantable manner, although he, him<lb break="no"/>self, was prepared to force the question 
     <lb/>
     before them on the Alexandra Hotel 
     <lb/>
     offer. He has endeavoured to show 
     <lb/>
     that Confederation is now a matter of 
     <lb/>
     necessity, on. account of the be man<lb break="no"/>agement of the late government. It is 
     <lb/>
     an astounding announcement. The 
     <lb/>
     leader of a government that passed the 
     <lb/>
     Railway Bill, and thereby involved 
     <lb/>
     the colony so deeply in debt, now 
     <lb/>
     turns round and cooly declares that 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is forced upon the coun<lb break="no"/>try by some paltry expenditure on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the late government. Out 
     <lb/>
     upon such conduct, sir. Why did he 
     <lb/>
     not plainly admit that the construction 
     <lb/>
     of the Railway, and not the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of a small sum by the Board of 
     <lb/>
     Works in building a few small bridges, 
     <lb/>
     had forced us to seek admission into 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion?  He has only been 
     <lb/>
     making out a case for himself, and has 
     <lb/>
     no solid ground to argue upon. He 
     <lb/>
     endeavors to make out that the colony 
     <lb/>
     was well able to bear its Railway debt, 
     <lb/>
     without Confederation, if the financial 
     <lb/>
    affairs of the country had been well 
     <lb/>
     managed; but I never believed that 
     <lb/>
     such was the case. He finds fault 
     <lb/>
     with the passing of the Branch Bill. 
     <lb/>
     which added $250,000 to the public 
     <lb/>
     debt, although he, himself, promised 
     <lb/>
     in the speech at the opening of the six 
     <lb/>
     days' session, to introduce that Bill. 
     <lb/>
     A great many charges have been made 
     <lb/>
     against the late government in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the letting of the contract for 
     <lb/>
     the branch lines; but I contend that 
     <lb/>
     the sum for which that contract was 
     <lb/>
     let was the only reliable offer they re<lb break="no"/>ceived. Although the branches cost 
     <lb/>
     $1000 per mile more than the trunk. 
     <lb/>
     the country has more than full value 
     <lb/>
     for the extra cost. There are no

     spruce sleepers on the branch lines' 
     <lb/>
     no rabbit wire fence, no broomstick 
     <lb/>
     fence-posts. l blamed the coalition 
     <lb/>
     government for violating the law of. 
     <lb/>
     the land by substituting a paltry wire 
     <lb/>
    fence for the wooden one provided 
     <lb/>by the Act. When one condition of 
     <lb/>the contract was changed without the 
     <lb/>consent of the securities, the whole 
     <lb/>contract was violated, and if the con<lb break="no"/>tractors chose to avail themselves of it, 
     <lb/>they could scatter the whole thing to 
     <lb/>the four winds of heaven. If that 
     <lb/>wire fence had been a good one, they 
     <lb/>might have been excused, but it was 
     <lb/>utterly worthless, and a waste of the 
     <lb/>public money. I, myself, saw miles 
     <lb/>of that fence, every wire of which, ex<lb break="no"/>cept the tap one, was broken to the 
     <lb/>ground. It will be a disgrace and a 
     <lb/>standing reproach to them as long as 
     <lb/>they have a name in this colony. 
     <lb/>There is suflicient value in the superior 
     <lb/>fences, sleepers and bridges on the 
     <lb/>branch lines to make up far more than 
     <lb/>the $1000 extra cost, leaving out the 
     <lb/>fact that iron was 50 per cent higher 
     <lb/>when that contract was let, than at 
     <lb/>the letting of the trunk line. The 
     <lb/>branches were properly surveyed, the 
     <lb/>line marked out, and the number of 
     <lb/>square yards of earth-work, rock-work 
     <lb/>and bridging, clearly laid down before 
     <lb/>the contract was let. If there was any 
     <lb/>one act of the coalition to be condemn<lb break="no"/>ed, it was that of omitting to stake out 
     <lb/>the line which the contractors were to 
     <lb/> follow.  There is a much smaller pro<lb break="no"/>portion of curves in the branches than 
     <lb/>in the trunk line, owing to their being 
     <lb/>surveyed previous to being let. The 
     <lb/>late government were well aware that 
     <lb/>very little work could be done on the 
     <lb/>branch lines during winter, and that 
     <lb/>the present session was ample time to 
     <lb/>provide for all the expenses of those 
     <lb/>lines. They acted honestly in the 
     <lb/>whole matter, and the country did not 
     <lb/>condemn them in anything they did 
     <lb/>with reference to the branches. Those 
     <lb/>hon. members who deserted our ranks, 
     <lb/>were at the bottom of all the action 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
            
     taken on the branch lines; yet, after 
     <lb/>
     all; our constituents are not dissatisfied 
     <lb/>
     with our actions on this matter. We 
     <lb/>
     were returned to our seats in this 
     <lb/>
     House, because we did the best that 
     <lb/>
     could be done in the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     under which we were placed. I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry those hon. members for whom 
     <lb/>
    the branch lines were undertaken have 
     <lb/>showed so little thanks for all we did 
     <lb/>for them, as to desert our ranks. Sev<lb break="no"/>eral hon. members on the government 
     <lb/>side of the House, returned by the peo<lb break="no"/>ple to oppose Confederation, have given 
     <lb/>their support to a leader of a party 
     <lb/>bound to carry out Confederation, and 
     <lb/>endeavor to excuse themselves, and to 
     <lb/>apologise for their actions, by assert<lb break="no"/>ing that they now find out that the 
     <lb/>late government ruined the credit of 
     <lb/>the country, and that it can never be 
     <lb/>restored. Those hon. members have 
     <lb/>endeavored to make a scape-goat of 
     <lb/>the Opposition ; but I can assure them 
     <lb/>that we have no intention of bearing 
     <lb/>their sins ;we are willing to hear our 
     <lb/>own, but no other. The late govern<lb break="no"/>ment have been accused of building a 
     <lb/>boat for the Charlottetown Ferry, al<lb break="no"/>though the old boat was a miserablc 
     <lb/>old rattle-trap, and the districts south 
     <lb/>of the river badly neglected. It was 
     <lb/>nothing at all to pass a Railway Bill, 
     <lb/>but it was a terrible act to grant a 
     <lb/>small sum of money to benefit a part 
     <lb/>of the country through which the 
     <lb/>Railway does not pass ; and therefore 
     <lb/>the late government was a most ex<lb break="no"/>travagant one ! It is high time we 
     <lb/>had Confederation, if so small a matter 
     <lb/>as the building of a Ferry Boat ruins 
     <lb/>the credit of the country. A few 
     <lb/>bridges costing in the aggregate $20,<lb break="no"/>000 were built in neighborhoods which 
     <lb/>do not derive any advantage from the 
     <lb/>Railway ; and I contend that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of those localities were justly en<lb break="no"/>titled to them. The next matter 
     <lb/>alleged to have materially assisted in 
     <lb/>destroying the credit of the country, 
     <lb/>was the land damages. If there si

            sponsible than another for the large  
     <lb/>amount paid for land damages, it is<lb/>the Hon. Leader of the Government,<lb/>who provided for them in his Railway<lb/>Bill. As provision was made for the<lb/>payment of the land damages, the<lb/>money must be paid on the production<lb/>of the certificates given by the Rail<lb break="no"/>way Commissioners ; in fact, farmers<lb/>whose lands have been taken, could<lb/>enforce the payment of the sums<lb/>awarded by the Commissioners.<lb/>When the Appraisers give their award,<lb/>they are bound by law to direct pay<lb break="no"/>ment to be made immediately. When<lb/>the late government came into power,<lb/>the Railway Commissioners had to go<lb/>to work immediately, as a large quan<lb break="no"/>tity of land had been taken possession<lb/>of all along the line of road. During<lb/>the first part of the session, there was<lb/>no trouble in meeting the demands<lb/>upon the Treasury, as the Banks<lb/>readily cashed the ten year Deben<lb break="no"/>tures, owing to the favorable state of<lb/>our trade at that time ; but this state<lb/>of matters did not continue as the<lb/>Banks, in the course of time, either<lb/>could not or would not accept the De<lb break="no"/>bentures. The late government acted<lb/>very carefully and prudently in the<lb/>whole matter, and paid every demand<lb/>made upon them. If there was no<lb/>exchange to be obtained at home, it<lb/>was their duty to go abroad for it ;<lb/>but it happened that in the other<lb/>Provinces the money market was al<lb break="no"/>most as low as on this Island, and but<lb/>a small quantity of Debentures could<lb/>be sold at par. The very thing with<lb/>which they were charged, viz : that<lb/>of deprecating the value of our De<lb break="no"/>bentures, was what they did most to<lb/>avoid, and what Debentures they did<lb/>sell, were sold at par ; but the quan<lb break="no"/>tity was too limited to do them much<lb/>good. They, therefore, projected a<lb/>loan of £25,000, as they thought it<lb/>better to pay interest than to sell the<lb/>Debentures below par. This loan<lb/>helped our exchange, considerably,<lb/>during the past winter. The Hon.<lb/>
            
               <cb/>
               
     Leader of the Government makes       
     <lb/>more ado about that $25,000 than he<lb/>did about the whole Railway debt.<lb/>If the colony cannot pay the former<lb/>small amount how can it pay the<lb/>latter? Before the third of May<lb/>comes, more duties will be paid into<lb/>the Treasury, than will cover the<lb/>amount borrowed. In case it might<lb/>not be convenient for this colony to<lb/>pay that Bank, it was asked to renew<lb/>the note at the same rate of interest<lb/>for another three months, and pro<lb break="no"/>mised to do so. If the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment had been sustained, there would<lb/>have been no need to redeem the<lb/>Debentures deposited, as they would<lb/>have accepted Confederation upon the<lb/>terms offered, and the Debentures<lb/>would have been taken at par. It had<lb/>been stated that there was a much<lb/>larger amount of money in the Trea<lb break="no"/>sury when the coalition resigned the<lb/>reins of power, than when the late<lb/>government resigned. Taking into<lb/>account the six thousand pounds ster<lb break="no"/>ling forwarded to London to pay the<lb/>interest on the Debentures due in<lb/>July, the statement is incorrect. In<lb break="no"/>stead of showing bad management on<lb/>the part of the late government, it<lb/>showed forethought to prepare a month<lb/>or two beforehand, to meet the inter<lb break="no"/>est on the Railway Debentures. It is<lb/>to be wondered at, that when the<lb/>money market was exceedingly de<lb break="no"/>pressed, the late government could not<lb/>sell sufficient debentures to pay the<lb/>land damages, when the Hon. Leader<lb/>of the Government did not do so when<lb/>money was plenty? The late govern<lb break="no"/>ment are not answerable for the present<lb/>depression of the securities of the<lb/>Colony ; the whole trouble arose from<lb/>the passing of the Railway Bill, which<lb/>imposed a burden upon the colony<lb/>greater than it could bear. The night<lb/>the Railway Bill was passed, the<lb/>doom of this country, as an independ<lb break="no"/>ent colony, was sealed. I do not mean<lb/>to say that we were no longer free-<lb break="yes"/>men, for there is as much liberty, and<lb/>

     a great deal more in Canada, than   
     <lb/>there is, under the iron away of the<lb/>hon. members for Alberton and Sum<lb break="no"/>merside, in this colony. It is the<lb/>interest upon the Railway debt which<lb/>draws from our Banks a very large<lb/>amount of exchange, which weighs,<lb/>and will weigh heavily upon the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this Island. This is what dis<lb break="no"/>turbs our finances and injures our<lb/>credit, and the Hon. the Leader of the<lb/>Government may as well confess it at<lb/>once. But, sir, his honor, with his<lb/>great popularity, will soon be able to<lb/>restore the credit of the colony, for the<lb/>credit of the able men who compose<lb/>the present government has only to be<lb/>known in London, Paris, Berlin, &amp;c.'<lb/>and our credit will immediately rise<lb/>far above par ! The hon. Leader of<lb/>the Government, with all his boasted<lb/>wealth and popularity knows that it is<lb/>not his name or those of the members<lb/>of his government that can effect the<lb/>credit of the colony ; it is punctual<lb/>payment of the interest on our deben<lb break="no"/>tures that affects its credit. Do they<lb/>ask in England whether Hon. Mr.<lb/>Haythorne or Hon. J. C. Pope is<lb/>leader of our government, before pur<lb break="no"/>chasing our Island bebentures? No.<lb/>They ask " what is your population ?<lb/>What is your annual Revenue? What<lb/>demands come in before the payment<lb/>of the interest on those debentures?"<lb/>They look at all these things, and then<lb/>at our ability to pay our interest punc<lb break="no"/>tually, without asking a single ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to what party or government is<lb/>in power at the present time. I doubt<lb/>whether the present hon. Colonial<lb/>Secretary or even the hon. Leader of<lb/>the Government himself, would have<lb/>succeeded in disposing of one single<lb/>debenture more than Mr. Albert<lb/>Hensley did. The excuses of the<lb/>Government supporters for turning<lb/>round in favor of Confederation, are<lb/>paltry and ridiculous ; and they are<lb/>not able to put the saddle on our horse<lb/>at all, sir. The delegation to Ottawa,<lb/>to procure terms for union with Can<lb break="no"/>
            <cb/>
            ada, is denounced by the hon. Leader 
     <lb/>of the Government as a conspiracy<lb/>against the liberties of this colony. I<lb/>wonder whether his honor has a con<lb break="no"/>science at all or not, and what name<lb/>he gives to his delegation to the Alex<lb break="no"/>andra Hotel in London ; he had, as<lb/>every one knows, no authority from<lb/>any government to go there. When<lb/>he returned from England, he used all<lb/>his influence to force the $800,000<lb/>offer upon his government, but he did<lb/>not succeed. This little conspiracy<lb/>was, no doubt, to his mind, all right<lb/>and perfectly just ; but the delegation<lb/>to Ottawa was a secret plot to under<lb break="no"/>mine the liberties of the country, and<lb/>was inexcusable. The present terms<lb/>are all wrong, because they were not<lb/>brought down by himself. If one or<lb/>two little two-penny half-penny light<lb break="no"/>houses an drill sheds are to be the<lb/>only excuse for his seeking better<lb/>terms, he has not the shadow of an<lb/>argument for another delegation to<lb/>Ottawa. The very claims which he<lb/>now proposes to make on the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the Dominion were presented<lb/>by the late Delegates, and refused,<lb/>and doubtless he will find they will<lb/>be refused for him also. He tells us we<lb/>should not be placed in a worse posi<lb break="no"/>tion, financially, than any of the other<lb/>colonies, and that our acceptance of<lb/>the present terms would place us in<lb/>that position. This is, certainly, a<lb/>most extraordinary statement. Why,<lb/>sir, by accepting the terms now offered,<lb/>this Island would be placed in a vastly<lb/>superior position to any of the other<lb/>colonies that have entered the confed<lb break="no"/>eracy. The other provinces received<lb/>only $25 per head of their population,<lb/>as their assumed debt, while we would<lb/>receive $45 per head. We were al<lb break="no"/>lowed this extra sum because we, as<lb/>an island, are cut off and receive no<lb/>benefit from the public works of the<lb/>Dominion. Taking the present policy<lb/>of the Canadian Government as a<lb/>basis, we calculated the proposed ex<lb break="no"/>penditure of the Dominion for the next<lb/>

     present debt and divided the total.

     amount by their present population.   
     <lb/>
     This gave forty-five dollars per head,

     the amount allowed us.  At the end 
     <lb/>
     of ten or fifteen years,their population 
     <lb/>
     will be vastly increased, so that their

     debt will never actually reach $45 per

     increasing, as was expected, the taxa<lb break="no"/>tion of the Dominion has actually de<lb break="no"/>creased to such an extent that the

     duties at present, amount to only about

     the rate of duties collected during the

     <lb/>the case. I quote from Mr. Tilley's 
     <lb/>Speech :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     " I will now state the whole increase 
     <lb/>
     in the public debt since 1867. In 
     <lb/>
     1867 the net debt was $75,728,641, 
     <lb/>
     and in 1872 it was $82,187,072, mak<lb break="no"/>ing a net increase of the debt $6,458,<lb break="no"/>431. Now, sir, what have we had in 
     <lb/>
     return for this increase. We find that 
     <lb/>
     the increase of the debt of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion is just the same as the increase in 
     <lb/>
     population during the period mention<lb break="no"/>ed, and no more; that the net debt in 
     <lb/>
     1872, as compared with the population 
     <lb/>
     shown by the census returns, is just 
     <lb/>
     the same in proportion to the popula<lb break="no"/>tion as it was in 1867. And what 
     <lb/>
     have we done in that period? We 
     <lb/>
     have expended half the money neces<lb break="no"/>sary for the construction of the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway, and half of that 
     <lb/>
     great work has been completed.. We 
     <lb/>
     have purchased the North West Terri<lb break="no"/>tory, for which we paid three hundred 
     <lb/>
     thousand pounds sterling, and we have 
     <lb/>
     paid another three hundred thousand 
     <lb/>
    pounds sterling for opening up the 
     <lb/>country and establishing a government; 
     <lb/>(cheers), we have expended a million 
     <lb/>and a half of dollars for public works 
     <lb/>chargeable against capital—works that 
     <lb/>it was understood by this House should 
     <lb/>be chargeable against capital ; we have 
     <lb/>expended $480,000 for the survey of 
     <lb/>the Pacific Railway, which, however, 
     <lb/>will be paid back by the Company out 
     <lb/>of its subsidy, and we have assumed 
     <lb/>the debt of the Province of British 
     <lb/>Columbia, amounting to $1,666,200; 
     <lb/>and this is represented by a population 
     <lb/>equal in proportion to the populations 
     <lb/>with which the other provinces came 
     <lb/>into the Dominion. But after doing 
     <lb/>
               
               <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">71</fw>
            
     all this, after we have half constructed 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway, spent three 
     <lb/>
     hundred thousand pounds sterling for 
     <lb/>
     the purchase of the North West, 
     <lb/>
     another three hundred thousand pounds 
     <lb/>
     for the establishment of a government 
     <lb/>
     there; a million and a half of dollars 
     <lb/>
     on public works chargeable to capital; 
     <lb/>
     $480,000 for the Pacific Railway, 
     <lb/>
     and assumed the debt of British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia, the debt of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     today is not one cent greater in pro<lb break="no"/>portion to the population than. it was 
     <lb/>
     five years ago." (Cheers)

            <p>If we, therefore, accept the present 
     <lb/>offer, and enter the Dominion with an 
     <lb/>allowance of $45 per head, as our as<lb break="no"/>sumed debt, we shall have a decided 
     <lb/>advantage over the other provinces, as 
     <lb/>the public debt of Canada will never, 
     <lb/>except in case of war, reach that 
     <lb/>amount per head of her population. 
     <lb/>Indeed, there is every reason to believe 
     <lb/>that the debt of Canada will not 
     <lb/>amount to as much per head twelve 
     <lb/>years hence as it is at present. Tak<lb break="no"/>ing these facts into consideration, how 
     <lb/>can the hon. Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment make out a case and show that 
     <lb/>justice has not been done this Island 
     <lb/>in the terms at present offered, when 
     <lb/>he goes on this delegation to Ottawa to 
     <lb/> seek for better terms? I doubt 
     <lb/> whether the Privy Council of the 
     <lb/>Dominion wdl entertain his arguments 
     <lb/>at all. They will look at their allow<lb break="no"/>ance for our assumed debt. and then 
     <lb/>at the grant of $800,000 for the pur<lb break="no"/>chase of our proprietory lands, which 
     <lb/>latter was the value of the whole 
     <lb/>Island in its primitive state, when 
     <lb/>granted away by the British Crown, 
     <lb/>reckoning the land to be worth at that 
     <lb/>time 80 cents per acre. As far as the 
     <lb/>granting away of our lands is concern<lb break="no"/>ed, they have actually offered to .make 
     <lb/>good the loss we have sustained. 
     <lb/>Tben again; we are to receive the 
     <lb/> value of our new post office and steam 
     <lb/>dredge, while the other provinces 
     <lb/>never received a single cent for similar 
     <lb/>property possessed by them on enter<lb break="no"/>
           <cb/>
           ing the union. This was another 
     <lb/>
     special favor shown to this Island, as 
     <lb/>
     we had no right to any allowance 
     <lb/>
     which was not made to the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Having received payment for 
     <lb/>
     those matters, it is a paltry affair to 
     <lb/>
     ask remuneration for our little light<lb break="no"/>houses and drill sheds. When Exhi<lb break="no"/>bition day comes round, we may re<lb break="no"/>quire the latter for the display of our 
     <lb/>
     agricultural products, when our far<lb break="no"/>mers will ornament them with pump<lb break="no"/>kins, cranberries and   other vegetables, 
     <lb/>
     and I believe the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will only be too glad to grant us 
     <lb/>
     the free use of thern for such a purpose. 
     <lb/>
     In fact the terms now offered us, are 
     <lb/>
     considered by the greater number of 
     <lb/>
     intelligent men among ourselves, and 
     <lb/>
     also by the people of all the neighbor<lb break="no"/>ing Provinces, as extremely liberal to 
     <lb/>
     the people of this colony. Hear what 
     <lb/>
               the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, an Opposition news<lb break="no"/>paper, says on this matter :— 
     <lb/>

   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     "It will be seen, as we have said 
     <lb/>
     that the terms are made exceptionally 
     <lb/>
     favorable to the Island in view 'of 
     <lb/>
     the possibility of a readjustment of the

     <lb/>
     means, evidently, that as matters at 
     <lb/>
     present stand, it is felt that the pro<lb break="no"/>posed arrangements are too liberal,. but

     that the ' better terms' system will, in

              <p>
      The legislators who cannot keep the  
     <lb/>
    total expenses of the session within the 
     <lb/>limit of $4,000; should be cashiered 
     <lb/>by the people. The hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>Government puts down in his figures 
     <lb/>the cost of a general and partial elec<lb break="no"/>tion for every year ; perhaps this is 
     <lb/>because his own government is so weak 
     <lb/>that it will not stand longer than that. 
     <lb/>I consider one-fourth of that amount 
     <lb/>sufficient to be placed in our annual 
     <lb/>Expenditure, under confederation. 
     <lb/>The greater part of the sum expended 
     <lb/>for public printing last year, was paid 
     <lb/>to the printers employed by the Coali<lb break="no"/>tion Government. All the Custom 
     <lb/>House printing, will, under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, belong to the Dominion, which 
     <lb/>will reduce the usual outlay consider 
     <lb/>ably. All expenses of Light Houses 
     <lb/>will be included in Dominion expenses. 
     <lb/>The 9000 spent in the Steam Dredge 
     <lb/>should not be placed in our annual 
     <lb/>expenditure, as we shall not require 
     <lb/>one every year. Nor will we require 
     <lb/>a New Court House, and Jail an<lb break="no"/>nually. I consider that $54,000 am<lb break="no"/>ple for the yearly Expenditure of the 
     <lb/>Board of Works under Confederation. 
     <lb/>The Miscellaneous include many items 
     <lb/>which will belong to the Dominion, to 
     <lb/>the extent of $4247.73 leaving only 
     <lb/>$2550.33 for the expenses of the local 
     <lb/>government, under this head. But 
     <lb/>the hon. Leader of the Government 
     <lb/>takes this sum, without analyzing it, 
     <lb/>
           <cb/>
     jumbles it altogether and charges it to 
     <lb/>
     the local government. Making all 
     <lb/>
     necessary allowances, I should say 
     <lb/>
     that our total Expenditure, under Con<lb break="no"/>federation will not exceed $205,038.85, 
     <lb/>
     per annum. Then, as regards our 
     <lb/>
     Receipts under Confederation, he states 
     <lb/>
     that one-third of the amounts due for 
     <lb/>
     Public Lands sold by the government, 
     <lb/>
     will be lost. I contend that the sum 
     <lb/>
     allowed us for the purchase of lands 
     <lb/>
     will go a long way, if properly man<lb break="no"/>aged. We are now paying six per 
     <lb/>
     cent for money, and I consider the one 
     <lb/>
     per cent difference in the interest un<lb break="no"/>der Confederation will fully make up 
     <lb/>
    for all the loss we may sustain on our 
     <lb/>public lands. I believe that the Land 
     <lb/>Subsidy allowed us will be fully worth 
     <lb/>$45,000 per year to the Colony, and 
     <lb/>will therefore allow no reduction of 
     <lb/>that item. I will allow any financier 
     <lb/>in or out of this Colony to judge be<lb break="no"/>tween my financial statement and that 
     <lb/>of His Honor the Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and to say which is correct. 
     <lb/>I will put my word and reputation be<lb break="no"/>fore his, and allow the public to judge 
     <lb/>between us. Taking the whole mat<lb break="no"/>ter into consideration ; if his honor has 
     <lb/>no better reasons for another Delega<lb break="no"/>tion to Ottawa than he has adduced, he  
     <lb/>might as well have no recess, for he 
     <lb/>has not given a single argument in 
     <lb/>support of his claim for better terms, 
     <lb/>that will be entertained by the Domi<lb break="no"/>

     <lb/>
           
   
          
     nion Government. I have not the 
     <lb/>
     least doubt that if he had obtained the 
     <lb/>
     present terms, he would have boasted 
     <lb/>
     loudly of the ability displayed in ob<lb break="no"/>taining them; but the great trouble 
     <lb/>
     with him is that he did not bring them 
     <lb/>
     down himself, and he therefore, can<lb break="no"/>not accept them. The great secret of 
     <lb/>
     the matter is that the present govern<lb break="no"/>ment did not obtain the present terms, 
     <lb/>
     and they must needs put the country 
     <lb/>
     to the expense of another delegation. 
     <lb/>
     I would not be sorry to see more 
     <lb/>
     liberal terms obtained, but as there is 
     <lb/>
     not the shadow of a prospect of obtain<lb break="no"/>ing them, it would be a mere waste of 
     <lb/>
     time and money to endeavor to attempt 
     <lb/>
     to do so. The government do not 
     <lb/>
     seem to entertain the least respect for 
     <lb/>
     the Despatch from Lord Dufferin, 
     <lb/>
     stating that no better terms will be 
     <lb/>
     conceded to this Colony. Would the 
     <lb/>
     Governor-General stultify himself by 
     <lb/>
     making a statement which he knew to 
     <lb/>
     he untrue? The thing is absurd. I 
     <lb/>
     have heard the private declaration of 
     <lb/>
     members of the Dominion Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council that no appllcation need be 
     <lb/>
     made for better terms than those now 
     <lb/>
     offered, for they would not be granted. 
     <lb/>
     We asked for $10,000 a year more 
     <lb/>
     for our lands ; but received only $5,<lb break="no"/>000, and were then told that this was 
     <lb/>
     the last concession P. E. Island would 
     <lb/>
     receive from them. The Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government invited the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment to send a delegation up to Ottawa; 
     <lb/>
     we did not invite ourselves. We re<lb break="no"/>ceived quite as much consideration 
     <lb/>
     from the Dominion government as the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Leader of the government him<lb break="no"/>self would have got, if he had been on 
     <lb/>
     that delegation. As anti-confederates, 
     <lb/>
     we were more likely to succeed in ob<lb break="no"/>taining liberal terms than he would 
     <lb/>
     have been, as he agreed to accept far 
     <lb/>
     less favorable terms than those now. 
     <lb/>
     offered. His party ran the election on 
     <lb/>
     false pretences, and now endeavor to 
     <lb/>
     cover up their change of base by send<lb break="no"/>ing off another delegation to make an 
     <lb/>
    attempt to get better terms, but they 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
     cannot show the shadow of an argu<lb break="no"/>ment in favor of their action. I won<lb break="no"/>der whether the hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>Government will ask Canada to give 
     <lb/>up the Railway to this Island and 
     <lb/>allow us to work it ourselves ? If it 
     <lb/>would earn $50,000 the first year over 
     <lb/>and above working expenses, as stated 
     <lb/>by the hon. member for Alberton (Mr. 
     <lb/>Howlan), by all means get it back ; 
     <lb/>but I believe his honor the Leader of 
     <lb/>the government expects the earnings 
     <lb/>to be $20,000 a year less than work<lb break="no"/>ing expenses. I have not the least 
     <lb/>doubt that the Dominion government, 
     <lb/>if asked to do so, would willingly give 
     <lb/>up the Railway to be worked and 
     <lb/>managed by our local government.
