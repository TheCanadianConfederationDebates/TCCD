            <p>
     In the<lb/>paragraph having reference to the<lb/>Union of the Island with Canada, it 
     <lb/>
     was amusing to notice that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment expressed the hope - the 
     <lb/>
     earnest hope—of the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment on that question. If the para<lb break="no"/>graph expressed anything it was the 
     <lb/>hope that the policy of the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on that question should be— 
     <lb/>carried out. Yes, that the policy which 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Alberton had, on 
     <lb/>nomination day, condemned in his- 
     <lb break="yes"/>speech. at St. Eleanors, should he sus<lb break="no"/>tained. The hon. member on that 
     <lb/>occasion said, that the government was 
     <lb/>" going to take away the Constitution." 
     <lb/>In order that they might escape the 
     <lb/>disagreeable duty of presenting the 
     <lb/>public accounts "to the Legislature," 
     <lb/>and asked " what there was in our 
     <lb/>affairs to cause the delegates to rush 
     <lb/>away to Ottawa on Saturday night to 
     <lb/>sell our privileges to the Dominion. 
     <lb/>They were pledged against Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, but they stole away to Ottawa in 
     <lb/>the silence of the night, to put us into 
     <lb/>Confederation." That was his language<lb/>before the election. Yet the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of which the hon. memhér 
     <lb/>formed one, came down, and in the 
     <lb/>Speech from the Throne said the 
     <lb/>matter will receive their most serious<lb/>consideration . He (Mr. L.) would 
     <lb/>tell the hon. member, that in going to 
     <lb/>Canada they did not violate any pledge 
     <lb/>made to the people. The delegation<lb/>went up, not to sell the country, or<lb/>barter away its Constitution, but in

     the embarrassed state of the Colony, 
     <lb/>
    brought about by the Railway measure 
     <lb/>to see what terms could be had— 
     <lb/>expressly with the intention of laying 
     <lb/>them before the country - and giving 
     <lb/>the people an opportunity, if they were 
     <lb/>willing to cast in their lot with the 
     <lb/>Dominion; and although as a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment they had been defeated, yet the 
     <lb/>Speech from the Throne proved their 
     <lb/>policy had been sustained. This was 
     <lb/>not acting like the Coalition Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, which in violation of a pro<lb break="no"/>mise made to some of their supporters, 
     <lb/>brought forward the Railway Bill, and 
     <lb/>carried it at midnight without submit<lb break="no"/>ting it to the people. This was the 
     <lb/>main charge brought against that 
     <lb/>Government, and for that reason did 
     <lb/>the people on the first occasion that 
     <lb/>offered afterwards, hurl them from 
     <lb/>power. The late Government pursued 
     <lb/>a different course. They dissolved 
     <lb/>the House and sent Confederation to 
     <lb/>the polls. Those who passed a mea<lb break="no"/>sure for the construction of 200 miles 
     <lb/>of Railway, knew when doing so that 
     <lb/>it would involve an expenditure utterly 
     <lb/>beyond what the resources of the 
     <lb/>Colony could hear. The hon. Leader 
     <lb/>of the Government had not the manli<lb break="no"/>ness then to lay that great measure 
     <lb/>before the people. But he (Mr. L.) 
     <lb/>and his friends displayed no such 
     <lb/>cowardice. True, they were not now 
     <lb/>backed up by a majority, yet it was 
     <lb/>equally true that they were not con<lb break="no"/>demned on account of their Railway 
     <lb/>policy. In confirmation—of this he 
     <lb/>claimed that the late Government 
     <lb/>were sustained in all the most wealthy 
     <lb/>and intelligent districts in the Island, 
     <lb/>Charlottetown alone excepted. When 
     <lb/>the Murray Harbor district was con<lb break="no"/>tested last autumn, the Government 
     <lb/>was handsomely sustained. The same 
     <lb/>success attended their candidates 
     <lb/>lately. When Mr. Gordon resigned 
     <lb/>his seat in the Legislative Council, 
     <lb/>the then Opposition could find no man 
     <lb/>willing to oppose Mr. McDonald. If 
     <lb/>there was one district more difficult 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     
     
     han any other to contest an election 
     <lb/>
    in after agreeing to the Branch BilI, it 
     <lb/>was Belfast, and though the most 
     <lb/>popular man who had ever represented 
     <lb/>that part of the County, was brought 
     <lb/>out, yet the candidates of the late 
     <lb/>Government were handsomely return<lb break="no"/>ed at the head of the poll, It was the 
     <lb/>same, and attended with similar results 
     <lb/>in the district represented by his hon. 
     <lb/>friends Messrs. Callbeck and McNeill. 
     <lb/>His hon. friend the late Leader of the 
     <lb/>Gov't. in this House, met also with 
     <lb/>more than ordinary opposition, yet he 
     <lb/>(Mr. L.) was proud to know that that 
     <lb/>intelligent district had triumphantly 
     <lb/>sustained Hon. Mr. Sinclair, and had 
     <lb/>also given him an able colleague in his 
     <lb/>hon. friend Mr. Stewart, who ran in 
     <lb/>conjunction with him. He ,was glad 
     <lb/>also to be able to state that the plucky 
     <lb/>and worthy member for the second 
     <lb/>District of Prince County had also 
     <lb/>been returned without opposition. He 
     <lb/>referred to the Hon. James Yeo. He 
     <lb/>(Mr. L.) held, therefore, that the as<lb break="no"/>sertion he made was correct, and that 
     <lb/>the late Government had not been 
     <lb/>defeated on account of its policy with 
     <lb/>respect to building the Branch lines of 
     <lb/>the Railway. In proof he would turn 
     <lb/>to those districts in which there had 
     <lb/>been a falling off. In Cardigan the 
     <lb/>probability was that the late represen<lb break="no"/>tative got in there to some extent by 
     <lb/>accident. Had their present represen<lb break="no"/>tative, Hon. Mr. Owen, been on the 
     <lb/>Island at the time, in all likelihood he 
     <lb/>would have been returned, then, as 
     <lb/>now. So that the result there could 
     <lb/>scarcely be looked upon as a defeat to 
     <lb/>the late Government. He would next 
     <lb/>turn to Bedeque ; and he regretted 
     <lb/>that the senior member for that dis<lb break="no"/>trict had changed sides. That hon. 
     <lb/>member is reported to have stated on 
     <lb/>nomination day, that " he would not 
     <lb/>give sixpence for D. Laird's calcula<lb break="no"/>tions." Although [that might be so, 
     <lb/>yet he thought the hon. member would 
     <lb/>agree with him in saying that it was 
     <lb/>the Railway policy of the coalition 
     <lb/>

     government which brought the country 
     <lb/>
     into its present difficulty. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member said further, that, " he found 
     <lb/>
     no fault with the Government till they 
     <lb/>
     changed their policy with regard to 
     <lb/>
    Confederation, and then he had no 
     <lb/>alternative but to oppose them." Thus 
     <lb/>the hon. member had honestly said 
     <lb/>that it was their Confederate and not 
     <lb/>their Railway policy which made him 
     <lb/>Oppose the late Government. In the 
     <lb/>Third District of Queen's County, hon. 
     <lb/>Mr. Beer had been handsomely re<lb break="no"/>turned in spite of the extraordinary 
     <lb/>influence which had been used against 
     <lb/>him. The senior member for that 
     <lb/>district ran his election as an officer of 
     <lb/>the late Government, and therefore 
     <lb/>the electors had no legitimate reason 
     <lb/>for knowing, but that in supporting 
     <lb/>him they were also supporting 
     <lb/>the Government as much as when 
     <lb/>voting for hon. Mr. Beer. It was well 
     <lb/>known, however, that Catholic influence 
     <lb/>had been largely used to prevent the 
     <lb/>return of the hon. member (Mr. Beer) 
     <lb/>though he was happy to add, unsuccess<lb break="no"/>fully. Up to the day the delegation 
     <lb/>left for Ottawa, they looked upon the<lb/>hon. member for Fort Augustus, as<lb/>a supporter of the late Government.<lb/>It was said, their flying visit to Ottawa<lb/>had the effect of changing their views of<lb/>the hon. member ; then, if such was<lb/>the case, he would oppose Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. It could not have been their<lb/>policy with respect to the Branches<lb/>which caused that hon. member to<lb/>change sides. The same was true<lb/>also of the hon. member for East Point,<lb/>the hon. Mr. McLean. He, too, of<lb/>all men, could not have been dissatis<lb break="no"/>fied because they undertook the imme<lb break="no"/>diate construction of the Branch lines.<lb/>He remained in the Government until<lb/>the dissolution of the House was agreed<lb/>upon, which showed that he was not<lb/>against ascertaining what better terms<lb/>could be obtained from the Dominion<lb/>Government. In so far, therefore, as<lb/>going to Ottawa was concerned, the<lb/>hon. member was as much responsible<lb/>
  
  
    
            <cb/>
      
      
     as any of them. But the plain matter 
     <lb/>
     of fact seemed to be, when some men 
     <lb/>
     want an excuse, if they have none, 
     <lb/>
     they will make one, as the hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
    Sullivan did last winter, when he made 
     <lb/>the matter of the reinvestment clauses 
     <lb/>in the Branch Bill one for resigning 
     <lb/>his seat at the late Executive Board. 
     <lb/>But on that question the opinion of the 
     <lb/>late Government was sustained by the 
     <lb/>law officers of England, notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing the boasted legal ability of some<lb/>men on the other side. Yes, we had 
     <lb/>during the last session, to contend for 
     <lb/>that measure, hour after hour, and by 
     <lb/>hard fighting won the ground inch by 
     <lb/>inch, and being sustained in our views 
     <lb/>by the authorities in the old country, 
     <lb/>he could not but regard their victory 
     <lb/>in that matter, as a triumph of which 
     <lb/>the late Government might justly feel 
     <lb/>proud. It was a triumph which show<lb break="no"/>ed no imbecility. He was sorry the 
     <lb/>hon. member for St. Peter's was not 
     <lb/>now in his place. It was currently 
     <lb/>reported that Roman Catholic influen<lb break="no"/>ce similar to that brought to the notice 
     <lb/>of Judge Keogh, of Ireland, had been 
     <lb/>brought out against the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in St. Peter's. The hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>Hogan did not offer again. If, there<lb break="no"/>fore, the late Government had in St.<lb/>Peter's and elsewhere, been defeated,<lb/>they fell in a manly fight. The school<lb/>question was made to do duty against<lb/>them. It was education, and not<lb/>Railway Branches and Confederation,<lb/>which overthrew the late Government.<lb/>Well did the hon. member for Souris<lb/>know, that every disposition was shown<lb/>by the late party and the Government,<lb/>to do all that lay in their power for<lb/>his and other districts. This they did<lb/>to the loss and injury of their own<lb/>districts. What were the tanks they<lb/>received in return ? The Government<lb/>took a look at the affairs of the Colony.<lb/>They found the Finance was not in<lb/>such a state as they could wish. Large<lb/>amounts for land damages were re<lb break="no"/>quired. The Railway Bill provided<lb/>that immediate payment should be<lb/>

     made in cash for. land damages, as they 
     <lb/>
     became due and were presented. 
     <lb/>
     Hence it was found difficult to obtain 
     <lb/>
     cash to meet the claims for lands as 
     <lb/>
     they came in. The Government re<lb break="no"/>quired $50,000. The old Bank, at 
     <lb/>
     that time, in November, could only let 
     <lb/>
     them have $10.000 and the Union 
     <lb/>
     Bank $5,000. The hon. the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the Government told him a few days 
     <lb/>
     ago, that if he had been in power he 
     <lb/>
     would have had no difficulty in obtain<lb break="no"/>ing the amount required. This he 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. L.) did not believe. The credit 
     <lb/>
     at the Colony was just as good under 
     <lb/>
     one Government as the other. If 
     <lb/>
     otherwise, and the Banks were to be<lb break="no"/>come more party institutions, the 
     <lb/>
     sooner the country knew it the better. 
     <lb/>
     Such, however, he had no reason to 
     <lb/>
     believe was the case. Under those 
     <lb/>
     circumstances the Government had to 
     <lb/>
     try and dispose of some of their De<lb break="no"/>bentures abroad. They sold a few at 
     <lb/>
     par, but rather than dispose of them at 
     <lb/>
     a discount, they borrowed $25,000, 
     <lb/>
     which had been of great service during 
     <lb/>
     the winter, In view of the present 
     <lb/>
     and prospective difficulties of the Col<lb break="no"/>ony, they saw that increased taxation, 
     <lb/>
     or Confederation, was unavoidable. As 
     <lb/>
     a nativeof the country, it he saw any 
     <lb/>
     feasible way by which they could hope 
     <lb/>
     to overcome those difficulties and re<lb break="no"/>main as they were, he would feel glad. 
     <lb/>
     But as the Railway debt would be 
     <lb/>
     largely increased in another year, he 
     <lb/>
     saw no course open but the one they 
     <lb/>
     took. They opened up a correspond<lb break="no"/>ence, and then by invitation from the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion Cabinet, went to Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     and discussed the matter with the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council. They obtained terms, 
     <lb/>
     dissolved the House, and laid the 
     <lb/>
     question before the country, and he, 
     <lb/>
     for one, would never feel ashamed of 
     <lb/>
     what he did in that matter. It was 
     <lb/>
     not selling the country as has had been 
     <lb/>
     said. He would not go into the finan<lb break="no"/>cial aspect of the question then, as he 
     <lb/>
    intended doing so when the papers, 
     <lb/>came down, and the general question 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
       
       
     would be considered. The late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment viewed the difficulties of the 
     <lb/>Colony, and having done so, cheerfully 
     <lb/>cast their trust upon the people's care. 
     <lb/>He had to contest an election in one of 
     <lb/>the most difficult districts to be found 
     <lb/>to contest an election on that question 
               <lb/>in, yet he met with but one man who<lb/>told him he was afraid of union, and<lb/>still he voted fro him. But in several<lb/>districts other questions had been<lb/>brought forward. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Herald</hi>, which<lb/>up to the time the delegates left for<lb/>Ottawa, had supported us, immediately<lb/>changed its tone, and in its last issues<lb/>says ;-<lb/>

               <add><persName ref="pers:HOWL2">Mr. Howlan</persName> — </add>  [...] the rights and privileges of the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     had been infringed upon, because the 
     <lb/>
     rules had not been passed immediately 
     <lb/>
     after the officers were appointed. He 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. H.) saw, no attempt made to in<lb break="no"/>fringe upon any rights or privileges; if 
     <lb/>
     he saw any such attempt, he would be 
     <lb/>
     the first to raise his voice against it. 
     <lb/>
     But he could pardon the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for the charges which—he had just 
     <lb/>
     made against the government, because 
     <lb/>
     his parliamentary experience was ex<lb break="no"/>tremely limited, and he had everything 
     <lb/>
     to learn in reference to these matters. 
     <lb/>
     If the hon. member's law out of par<lb break="no"/>liament was no sounder than he had 
     <lb/>
     shown it to be in it, he (Mr. H.) 
     <lb/>
     pitied his unfortunate clients. The 
     <lb/>
     course pursued by the government 
     <lb/>
     was in perfect accordance with the 
     <lb/>
     rules laid down in May on Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     But what did the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Murray Harbor care for precedent? 
     <lb/>
     Nothing whatever ; precedents were 
     <lb/>
     nothing to him, as his decision was, in 
     <lb/>
     his own opinion, superior to them all. 
     <lb/>
     People are generally satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     one well-established precedent, but a 
     <lb/>
     dozen were of no account in the 
     <lb/>
     judgment of the hon. member for Murray 
     <lb/>
     Harbor. When the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     the Draft Address was resumed, he 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. H.) would pay his compliments 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. member, but he would 
     <lb/>
     make no further remarks upon the 
     <lb/>
     present amendment, further than to 
     <lb/>
     say, that it was his. (Mr. H's) opinion 
     <lb/>
     that his honor the Speaker could not 
     <lb/>
     entertain it, as it was out of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. T. Kelly said that he had 
     <lb/>
    listened to the eloquent address of the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Murray Harbor with 
     <lb/>surprise, not unmingled with amuse<lb break="no"/>ment. He (Mr. D.) was a member 
     <lb/>of the legal profession, and a gentleman 
     <lb/>of culture, and considerable ability, and 
     <lb/>yet had just made statements which he 
     <lb/>himself must have known were not 
     <lb/>strictly correct. The hon. member 
     <lb/>stated that a law of Parliament is a 
     <lb/>law of the land. Now the expression, 
     <lb/>" law of the land " was a very nice<lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
       
       
     expression, and one which tended to 
     <lb/>
     captivate and please the general pub<lb break="no"/>lic; but the statement was not strictly 
     <lb/>
     correct. Would the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     deny that one well-established prece<lb break="no"/>dent in a case perfectly analogous to 
     <lb/>
     the one under consideration would not 
     <lb/>
     bind? On the other hand, it can be 
     <lb/>
     shown that there are 'none strictly 
     <lb/>
     against the present one. By con<lb break="no"/>sulting the Journals of 1854 and 1859 
     <lb/>
     and 1863, hon. members would find 
     <lb/>
    that the Draft Address was submitted 
     <lb/>during those three Sessions of the 
     <lb/>House before the Rules were passed. 
     <lb/>If those three precedents would not 
     <lb/>bind in cases perfectly analagous, he 
     <lb/>could not tell what would. Then 
     <lb/>again, there is a rule laid down that 
     <lb/>in all cases where the tules of last 
     <lb/>Session do not apply, the Rule of the 
     <lb/>Imperial Parliament is binding. It is 
     <lb/>also clearly established that the Stand<lb break="no"/>ing Rules of the late House stand 
     <lb/>good from Session to Session until 
     <lb/>they are repealed. A single pre<lb break="no"/>cedent is sufficient to bind in all 
     <lb/>questions of this kind, and "the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Murray Harbor knows 
     <lb/>this very well.

     <lb/>
     propriety of a portion of the Speech 
     <lb/>
     with which His Honor the Lieutenant 
     <lb/>
     Governor had opened the Session. As 
     <lb/>
     hon. members were aware of the country

     that the late government had been

     owed their majority to that result.

     The late government were not defeated 
     <lb/>

     Question. If the late government had 
     <lb/>
     advocated Sectarian Schools, they 
     <lb/>
    might to-day have been in power, but . 
     <lb/>they could not conscientiously grant 
     <lb/>public money for the support, of those, 
     <lb/>schools. After the battle of Sadowa, 
     <lb/>as is well known, the School Ques<lb break="no"/>tion was discussed all over Europe, 
     <lb/>and the Emperor of Austria, was com-; 
     <lb/>pelled to bow to the will of his sub<lb break="no"/>jects to prevent a political revolution, 
     <lb/>and took the education of the people 
     <lb/>out of the hands of the clergy and 
     <lb/>placed it in the hands of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The Concordat was thus re<lb break="no"/>pealed on the demand of the people. 
     <lb/>Are we now going to take the educa<lb break="no"/>tion of our people out of the hands of 
     <lb/>the govarnment and place it in the 
     <lb/>handsof the Clergy, thus establishing a 
     <lb/>system which the people of Europe 
     <lb/>have tried to rid themselves of ? The 
     <lb/>demand of His Lordship the Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic Bishop, amounts to nothing 
     <lb/>less than that. If the grant were 
     <lb/>once conceded, denominational schools 
     <lb/>would inevitably follow, for the Clergy 
     <lb/>are never satisfied. If one denomina<lb break="no"/>tion received a grant, others would 
     <lb/>demand the same, and there would be 
     <lb/>no end to the trouble that would arise 
     <lb/>from it. If the public schools of this 
     <lb/>Colony were once placed in the hands 
     <lb/>of the various denominations, where is 
     <lb/>the man who would dare raise his 
     <lb/>voice against denominational Schools ? 
     <lb/>It is well known that the School 
     <lb/>Question underlaid everything at the 
     <lb/>late election, and that the Catholic 
     <lb/>Clergy used their influence against the 
     <lb/>return of the late government to power. 
     <lb/>For this demand he (Mr. D.) did not 
     <lb/>blame them in the least, because he 
     <lb/>believed they were sincere in what 
     <lb/>they asked for . He lost, through their 
     <lb/>influence, one-third of the votes of those 
     <lb/>who supported him at the former 
     <lb/>election, but some Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>did support him, and those he thought 
     <lb/>were true patriots. He would most 
     <lb/>sincerely thank them for their support, 
     <lb/>and they deserved the thanks of the 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
         
         
     country for the public spirit which they 
     <lb/>
     had shown. The district had formerly 
     <lb/>
     been a strongly Anti-confederate one, 
     <lb/>
    and nothing would have turned the 
     <lb/>people in favor of Confederation if they 
     <lb/>had not come to the conclusion that if 
     <lb/>the Colony did not join the Dominion 
     <lb/>it would be placed in great financial 
     <lb/>troubles. When the Delegation first 
     <lb/>started for Ottawa, he thought the act 
     <lb/>of the government in sending it there 
     <lb/>a monstrous one, and contrary to the 
     <lb/>interests of the Colony, but when the 
     <lb/>terms came down and he found that 
     <lb/>they were just and liberal he at once 
     <lb/>embraced them. He saw that the 
     <lb/>sum allowed us was sufficient to meet 
     <lb/>the requirements of the Colony, if they 
     <lb/>did not exceed those of the last few 
     <lb/>years. He thought the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment had obtained a great triumph in 
     <lb/>carrying those terms at the late elec<lb break="no"/>tion as they had done. The only thing 
     <lb/>which prevented them from retaining 
     <lb/>the reins of power, was the School 
     <lb/>Question. He was told that he need 
     <lb/>not show himself on the Pisquid Road, 
     <lb/>but he obtained considerable support 
     <lb/>there, and believed that to-day, he 
     <lb/>could poll as many, votes there as the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Tignish, (Mr. H.) 
     <lb/>although he represents the head of his 
     <lb/>church. The terms he thought were 
     <lb/>very liberal, as the Canadians would 
     <lb/>not only pay our Railroad debt and 
     <lb/>our old public debt, but would allow 
     <lb/>us a sum sufficient to pay all our re<lb break="no"/>quirements. This is a very important 
     <lb/>question, for if we do not accept the 
     <lb/>terms now offered we must be prepared 
     <lb/>to pay the interest on 3.25 millions of 
     <lb/>dollars, and that in gold. He would 
     <lb/>like to see how the government could 
     <lb/>make provisions for it. On the other 
     <lb/>hand, if they accept the terms, and join 
     <lb/>the Dominion, many of their supporters 
     <lb/>in voting with them would break the 
     <lb/>pledges given by them to the people at 
     <lb/>the polls. He believed the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Alberton (Mr. H.) had went 
     <lb/>through that district, declaring against 
     <lb/>Confederation and he could not under<lb break="no"/>

     stand how that hon. member could 
     <lb/>now turn round in favor of it. Several<lb/>other hon. members on the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment side of the House were in a<lb/>similar position to that hon. member.<lb/>The government need take no credit to<lb/>themselves for obtaining a majority in<lb/>the way they had. It has been Her<lb/>Majesty's intention for some years past<lb/>that these Provinces should be united<lb/>and consolidated, but we as a Province,<lb/>have not, hitherto, been favoured with<lb/>an offer of just and liberal terms for<lb/>our acceptance. When the Quebec<lb/>terms came down, we found that they<lb/>would entail intolerable burdens upon<lb/>us, and therefore indignantly rejected<lb/>them. The better terms of 1869,<lb/>although far more liberal than the first,<lb/>were also rejected, because, after count<lb break="no"/>ing the cost, we found that the country<lb/>would suffer great loss by accepting<lb/>them. But the passing of the Railway<lb/>Bill by Mr. Pope's government in 1871<lb/>has increased our debt to the extent of<lb/>three millions of dollars—a terrible<lb/>debt for so small a population as ours.<lb/>The late government saw that they<lb/>must either go into Confederation or<lb/>tax the people heavily. Now we know<lb/>that our taxes are already nearly equal<lb/>to those of Canada ; some say they<lb/>are greater. A great many kinds of<lb/>goods manufactured in Canada, would,<lb/>under Confederation, come in here<lb/>duty free, such as winter clothing,<lb/>blankets, boots and shoes, mowing<lb/>machines, &amp;c., upon which we now<lb/>pay a duty of fifteen per cent. He<lb/>was of opinion, all things considered,<lb/>that we should be great gainers by<lb/>accepting the terms now offered us,<lb/>and he believed that the great body of<lb/>the people entertained a similar<lb/>opinion. At the outside, we could not<lb/>increase the duty upon goods more<lb/>than 2 1/2 per cent, and the increase of<lb/>Revenue from this would fall far<lb/>short of meeting the wants of the<lb/>country. There was no other course<lb/>that could safely be adopted, but to<lb/>seek a union with Canada upon reason<lb break="no"/>
       
       
            <cb/>
       
       able terms. The present land tax is 
     <lb/>an unfair one, as it is levied from rich<lb/>and poor alike without regard to the<lb/>quality of the land. If £30,000 or<lb/>£40,000 sterling were drained out of<lb/>the Colony every year to pay interest<lb/>on the Railway debt, what would be<lb/>the result ? The Railway would<lb/>never pay the interest on its cost and<lb/>working expenses. As to the terms<lb/>offered by Canada, be thought the<lb/>Laird terms $168,000 per year better<lb/>than the Better Terms of 1869. He<lb/>understood a delegation was about to<lb/>be appointed by the government to be<lb/>sent to Ottawa to ask better terms still,<lb/>than those now offered. The Canadians<lb/>will certainly be astonished to meet<lb/>his honor the Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment asking for better terms, when<lb/>they remember that he was satisfied<lb/>with terms far less liberal.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:HOWL2">Hon. Mr. HOWLAN</persName>.—It appeared 
     <lb/>that the hon. senior member for Belfast<lb/>had read the Address over and over<lb/>again, and the oftener he read it the<lb/>less he knew about it. The beginning,<lb/>in the hon. member's opinion, was no<lb/>good, the middle no good, and the end<lb/>no good. The hon. member had read<lb/>the Address through, found fault with<lb/>it, and yet did not know anything about<lb/>it after all ! This reminded him (Mr.<lb/>H.) of the despatch which the hon.<lb/>member once signed, but some months<lb/>after, he declared that he never signed<lb/>it, had not seen it and did not believe<lb/>in it ; yet his signature was at the<lb/>end of it. It appears the hon. member<lb/>got along first rate during his late<lb/>
     canvass in his district ; he had one 
     <lb/>story for the Catholics on Pisquid road<lb/>and another for the Presbyterians of<lb/>Belfast, as he told the former that the<lb/>clergymen, only, agitated for the grant,<lb/>and that Col. Gray would not give his<lb/>vote in favor of it, and the latter that<lb/>Col. Gray had made a Speech a few<lb/>years ago at St. Dunstan's College in<lb/>which he stated that if he had a son to<lb/>educate, he would entrust that institu<lb break="no"/>tion with his education. The hon.<lb/>member would have had no chance<lb/>whatever of being re-elected for that<lb/>district, if he had not misrepresented<lb/>his political opponents. Not satisfied<lb/>with scattering printed circulars in<lb/>English among the people, he had<lb/>Gaelic circulars printed for their es<lb break="no"/>pecial benefit, in order to complete his<lb/>misrepresentation and to make it as<lb/>effectual as possible. If it had not<lb/>been for the School Question, the hon.<lb/>member would not have had the small<lb break="no"/>est chance of being elected ; this could<lb/>not be denied. The hon. senior mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Belfast tells us that the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion of the people to a change in the<lb/>school system, enabled him to carry<lb/>his election, and the hon. junior mem<lb break="no"/>ber says he gained his election on<lb/>Confederation , alone. He (Mr. H.)<lb/>believed that Confederation had<lb/>nothing to do with the election of<lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
     
     
     either of those hon. members, and that 
     <lb/>if it had not been for their misrepre<lb break="no"/>sentations on the school question, the<lb/>hon. Col. Gray would be a member of<lb/>the House of Assembly to-day. Little<lb/>did Col. Gray think, when he delivered<lb/>that Address at St. Dunstan's College,<lb/>that it would, a few years afterwards,<lb/>be worth so much money to the pre<lb break="no"/>sent hon. members for Belfast. Col.<lb/>Gray spoke in the Address, in high<lb/>terms, of the efficiency of the teachers,<lb/>the cleverness and good-conduct of the<lb/>pupils, and the excellent course of<lb/>training carried out in St. Dunstan's<lb/>College ; and how could he speak<lb/>otherwise ? Could he (Mr. H.) not<lb/>admire the beautiful edifies erected<lb/>by the Methodists, Presbyterians,<lb/>Episcopalians, &amp;c., because they be<lb break="no"/>longed to denominations differing from<lb/>himself in religious opinions or matters<lb/>of conscience ? Were it not for<lb/>scheme, trickery and misrepresenta<lb break="no"/>tion, no seat in this House would be<lb/>occupied by the hon. B. Davies to-day.<lb/>That hon. member used language<lb/>throughout the country in reference to<lb/>the memorial presented to Mr. Hen<lb break="no"/>sley's government by His Lordship<lb/>Bishop McIntyre, intended to misre<lb break="no"/>present His Lordship. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber wished to make it appear that the<lb/>Bishop demanded separate schools,<lb/>although he well knows that His<lb/>Lordship asked for nothing of the kind.<lb/>

     The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member had made allusion to his 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. H's) speech at St. Eleanor's, on 
     <lb/>
     Nomination day. He opposed Con<lb break="no"/>federation at that time, because he 
     <lb/>
    could not do anything else ; no terms 
     <lb/>were before the country and no prospect 
     <lb/>of obtaining fair and equitable terms. At 
     <lb/>the close of the financial year, it was 
     <lb/>shown by the late government party 
     <lb/>with a great flourish of trumpets that 
     <lb/>the Revenue for the past year had 
     <lb/>increased to the extent of $10,000— 
     <lb/>notwithstanding their dashaway-policy. 
     <lb/>This country was his home, and he 
     <lb/>loved it too well to sacrifice its consti<lb break="no"/>tutional rights and privileges. It was 
     <lb/>a great misfortune that the miserable 
     <lb/>faction who had ruled the country for 
     <lb/>the past twelve months had control of 
     <lb/>its affairs as long as they had ; but he 
     <lb/>
        
        

    
            <cb/>
         
         
     had hoped, all along, that by economy 
     <lb/>
     and good management chaos might be 
     <lb/>
     reduced to order, and the credit of the 
     <lb/>
     country preserved without going into 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. He little thought, at 
     <lb/>
     the beginning of the present year, what 
     <lb/>
    plotting and scheming were going on 
     <lb/>in the government, and it appeared 
     <lb/>that some of the members of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment themselves, knew nothing 
     <lb/>at all about the delegation to Ottawa, 
     <lb/>until it had stolen off. The hon.junior 
     <lb/>member for Belfast and two or three 
     <lb/>more schemers concocted the whole 
     <lb/>scheme, and kept it to themselves till 
     <lb/>they were prepared to strike. A few 
     <lb/>months before, those very men had 
     <lb/>published an account of the flourishing 
     <lb/>state of the Colony, and had undertaken 
     <lb/>the construction of new and very ex<lb break="no"/>pensive bridges at New London and 
     <lb/>North Rustico. Never before had 
     <lb/>$94,000 been spent by the Board of 
     <lb/>Works in a single year. Yet this was 
     <lb/>done by the very men who complained 
     <lb/>that the Colony could now no longer 
     <lb/>maintain its credit without Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion ! Before the present Government 
     <lb/>was organized, he was not aware of 
     <lb/>the real financial condition of the 
     <lb/>colony ; but he now saw the bad state 
     <lb/>of affairs, and was in a position to say 
     <lb/>that the mismanagement of the late 
     <lb/>government had been the sole cause 
     <lb/>of it. There never was a time when 
     <lb/>the country stood in greater need of a 
     <lb/>good government than last year ; but 
     <lb/>it was notorious that the country had 
     <lb/>never before suffered from one so im<lb break="no"/>becile as the one that had lately resign<lb break="no"/>ed the reins of power. They had sent 
     <lb/>Mr. Albert Hensley off to the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion to negociate the sale of the Land 
     <lb/>Damage Debentures, and through 
     <lb/>mismanagement, disposed of but a small 
     <lb/>amount. They then, through their 
     <lb/>agent borrowed the sum of $25,000 
     <lb/>from a Provincial Bank to meet their 
     <lb/>wants and Mr. Hensley's note now 
     <lb/>lies there for that amount. That note, 
     <lb/>they intended, he believed, to renew, 
     <lb/>at the enormous interest of one per 
     <lb/>
  
  
        
         
         
     <fw type="num">24</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> 
  
  
     cent per month, if they remained in 
     <lb/>power. It appeared they had sent<lb/>about $80,000 to London, to meet the<lb/>interest of the Railway debentures due<lb/>in July. Was it a business like trans<lb break="no"/>action to send off money early in the<lb/>spring to meet the interest due in July,<lb/>and then to turn around and borrow<lb/>money from one of the Banks of the<lb/>other Provinces at an enormous inter<lb break="no"/>est ? No man in transaction his own<lb/>business would have acted in this<lb/>manner. The hon. Mr. Muirhead<lb/>stated in Summerside, that the first<lb/>intention of the late govenrment was<lb/>to legislate the Island into the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion without appealing the the people<lb/>at the polls at all, while Hon. E. Palmer<lb/>declared that the Delegates had gone<lb/>to Ottawa for the purpose of "fending<lb/>off" Confederation. This shows that<lb/>there was secret plotting going on<lb/>somewhere, of which all the members<lb/>of the late government were not aware,<lb/>at first. The hon. junior member for<lb/>Belfast has not, now, a word to say<lb/>about the charges made by him and<lb/>his party last year against the Coali<lb break="no"/>tion government. The only charge he<lb/>now makes against them is, that they<lb/>forced the Railway upon the people<lb/>without their consent. Does that hon.<lb/>member remember his charges made<lb/>during the six days'scession, of Bribery,<lb/>Corruption, Tammany, Ring &amp;c., &amp;c.<lb/>When the Opposition of last Session ask<lb break="no"/>ed for a Committee of Investigation to<lb/>ascertain the truth of those charges,<lb/>they received no answer but "haw !<lb/>haw ! haw ! the country has condemn<lb break="no"/>ed you and that is sufficient ; that is<lb/>all the investigation we will grant you."<lb/>Not a nook in any public office was<lb/>left unsearched; no drawer was left un<lb break="no"/>searched, no scheme was left untried,<lb/>no means unemployed, to endeavor to<lb/>convict the members of the coalition<lb/>government of dishonesty. Neither<lb/>himself nor his friend the hon. A. A.<lb/>McDonald had ever accepted a public<lb/>office of any kind, and could not be<lb/>accused of being greedy of office and of<lb/>
            
            
            <cb/>
       
       
     making money out of their position in 
     <lb/>the government. Not so with their<lb/>most prominent accusers, for the mom<lb break="no"/>ent they obtained the government, they<lb/>showed a greed for office never before<lb/>known in this Colony. Although they<lb/>had every means at their command,<lb/>they could have wished for, to enable<lb/>them to investigate the conduct of their<lb/>predecessors, they refused to do so.<lb/>The record of the country is against<lb/>them, that when really put to the proof<lb/>of their charges they utterly failed.<lb/>After they had carried out their dash-<lb break="yes"/>away policy for a few months, off they<lb/>start for Ottawa, and seek admission<lb/>into Confederation, contrary to every<lb/>principle upon which they were elected,<lb/>a year ago. Hon. Mr. Haythorne,<lb/>although acknowledging himself a<lb/>Confederate had pledged himself to<lb/>his constituents not to put the country<lb/>into the Dominion without their con<lb break="no"/>sent at the polls ; but it was the inten<lb break="no"/>tion of that hon. gentleman together<lb/>with the other members of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, to force the Colony into Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, if possible, this session. Mr.<lb/>Muirhead had made a statement to this<lb/>effect in the presence of two gentlemen<lb/>who stood high in the community, and<lb/>he (Mr. H.) repeated it on their author<lb break="no"/>ity. There are no longer snake maps<lb/>exhibited through the country, no<lb/>curves int he line, no spruce sleepers<lb/>to condemn, no badly constructed cul<lb break="no"/>verts to be carried away by the first<lb/>spring freshet, no stumps on the road<lb/>bed. What has produced this great<lb/>change ? Where is the government of<lb/>last year ? Where ? The old Coali<lb break="no"/>tion is back in government again<lb/>stronger than they ever were ; they<lb/>have been tried by a jury of their<lb/>countrymen and most triumphantly<lb/>acquitted of the slanderous charges<lb/>made against them by the present<lb/>Opposition Party. That is the cause<lb/>of the silence in reference to those<lb/>charges. There was one thing he was<lb/>sorry to have to state, and that was,<lb/>that matters affecting the best interests<lb/>

     of the country were in a far different 
     <lb/>
     state from that in which the Coalition 
     <lb/>
     government left them ; in fact they 
     <lb/>
     were now in a most deplorable condi<lb break="no"/>tion. When the late government found 
     <lb/>
     that they had brought the country to 
     <lb/>
     the verge of bankruptcy by, their dash- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     away policy they proposed secretly 
     <lb/>
     to send that famous delegation off to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, and ascertain what terms 
     <lb/>
     Canada would offer for the admission 
     <lb/>
     of this Colony into Confederation. To 
     <lb/>
     ensure their return to the legislature, 
     <lb/>
     they determined to excite the minds of 
     <lb/>
     the people on the school question, and 
     <lb/>
     to make them believe that if the Bishop 
     <lb/>
     obtained the grant, two crosses, would 
     <lb/>
     be erected on every school-house in 
     <lb/>
     the country. He (Mr. H.) had seen 
     <lb/>
     a public notice " to whom it may con<lb break="no"/>cern," and at first concluded that a 
     <lb/>
     ship must Be ashore and for sale, or 
     <lb/>
     something of that sort ; but when he 
     <lb/>
     had read it, he found it was a circular 
     <lb/>
     on the School question, signed by a 
     <lb/>
     large number of Protestant Clergymen. 
     <lb/>
     The ship was for sale, sure enough, 
     <lb/>
     for, away the Delegates started for 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa for Better Terms. When 
     <lb/>
     they returned, the late government 
     <lb/>
     party concluded to agitate the school 
     <lb/>
     question in order to carry Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion at the Polls. Said they, " if we 
     <lb/>
     can only make the people believe that 
     <lb/>
     Messrs. Pope and Brecken will go for 
     <lb/>
     the grant to Catholic Schools, we are 
     <lb/>
     all right. No matter what terms we 
     <lb/>
    may get or what we may do, we shall 
     <lb/> be all right." When the delegates 
     <lb/>first started for Ottawa, people could 
     <lb/>not believe that the report of their 
     <lb/>departure was true. Some refused to 
     <lb/>believe it even upon the oath of their 
     <lb/> informants ; but they seen discovered 
     <lb/>that they had not properly estimated 
               <lb/> those hon. gentlemen. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Patriot</hi> 
     <lb/>editor had formerly led the people to 
     <lb/>believe that the whole Dominion 
     <lb/>Parliament did not contain an honest 
     <lb/>man ; but was now among the first to. 
     <lb/>propose going into Confederation, and 
     <lb/>to show that it was the very best 
     <lb/>
   
   

    
            <cb/>
       
       
     course the Island could take. Why 
     <lb/>
     we could never get new potatoes or 
     <lb/>
     seed grain worth having, unless we t 
     <lb/>
     them from Canada ! The Hon. E. 
     <lb/>
     Palmer who had said that if everybody 
     <lb/>
     would follow the example of the Catho<lb break="no"/>lics in their opposition to Confederation 
     <lb/>
     the Island would be safe, was changed. 
     <lb/>
     all at once into a full blown Confeder<lb break="no"/>ate ! All those of their suppporters 
     <lb/>
     whose greed for office and opposition 
     <lb/>
     to the acts of the Coalition Government 
     <lb/>
     had been conspicuous, followed the ex<lb break="no"/>ample of their party and turned. Con<lb break="no"/>federates in an hour. Nothing was 
     <lb/>
     now to be heard from those new-born 
     <lb/>
     Confederates but high-sounding praise 
     <lb/>
     of. the Dominion and its government— 
     <lb/>
     their statesmanship was grand, their 
     <lb/>
     position exalted and their credit un<lb break="no"/>bounded. The people of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     should be made aware that the terms 
     <lb/>
     now before the country were obtained 
     <lb/>
     by a government the most unprincipled, 
     <lb/>
     reckless and imbecile, that ever held 
     <lb/>
     the reins of power in this Colony. 
     <lb/>
     The people of Belfast and Murray 
     <lb/>
     Harbor were told that the Steam 
     <lb/>
     Dredge was built expressly for them ; 
     <lb/>
     but they now found that theyhad been 
     <lb/>hoodwinked by the late government 
     <lb/>and that the local government of this 
     <lb/>Colony, under Confederation, will only 
     <lb/>be able to obtain a share of its services. 
     <lb/>In the New London District, Protes<lb break="no"/>tant Clergyman sounded the alarm on 
     <lb/>the school question, from their pal<lb break="no"/>pits, and reports were circulated that 
     <lb/>pledges had been given by Mr. Pope's 
     <lb/>party to the Catholics, promising a 
     <lb/>grant to their schools. (The hon. 
     <lb/>member here read a letter received by 
     <lb/>him from New London corrobating 
     <lb/>this statement.) But with all their 
     <lb/>manoeuvering, twisting and misrepre<lb break="no"/>sentation, the hon. member for New 
     <lb/>London did not receive as many votes 
     <lb/>ashe did last year. He (Mr. H.) had 
     <lb/>the Returns for that district for the 
     <lb/>last three Elections, and found that 
     <lb/>there was not at present as large 
     <lb/>majority there, against the present

     government, as  there was two years 
     <lb/>
    ago. At Bedeque, he had this year 
     <lb/>received a courteous and fair  hearing, 
     <lb/>but a year  ago, one could scarcely meet 
     <lb/> a man who did    not say something 
     <lb/> about the Ring, Curves and  Spruce 
     <lb/> Sleepers. All this is now changed for 
     <lb/>the better, and the falsehoods  and 
     <lb/>misrepresentations circulated against 
     <lb/> Mr. Pope's government, have almost  
     <lb/>entirely died out. A great change had 
     <lb/>also taken place at Summerside, and 
     <lb/>Mr. Muirhead a member of the late 
     <lb/> government had made the statement 
     <lb/>there a short time ago, that he had 
     <lb/>never stated that there was a Railway 
     <lb/>Ring. Another great change had oc<lb break="no"/>curred in the West River district, and 
     <lb/>it had been stated on good authority 
     <lb/>that if it had not been for the Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic Frenchmen of North Rustico, 
     <lb/>the present representatives of that 
     <lb/>district would not be here to-day, as  
     <lb/>members of this House. Indeed, it is 
     <lb/>pretty clear, that in all cases where 
     <lb/>the people could get reliable informa<lb break="no"/>tion, the late government have been 
     <lb/>shaken to their foundations. The re<lb break="no"/>turns for the West River and Rustico  
     <lb/>District show unmistakeably, that the 
     <lb/>heart of that district was, and is op<lb break="no"/>posed to the policy of the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and that it had been fairly dealt  
     <lb/>with on the school question, it would 
     <lb/>have returned Messrs. Jenkins and 
     <lb/>Longworth at the head of the poll. 
     <lb/> Where is now the boasted strength  of 
     <lb/>the late government ?  The slanders 
     <lb/>uttered by them last year had much 
     <lb/> more to do with their defeat than they 
     <lb/>are willing or honest enough to admit. 
     <lb/>A vast change has also taken place in 
     <lb/>Belfast, and had they been honorably 
     <lb/>dealt with by the present Representa<lb break="no"/>tives of that district, Messrs. Gray and 
     <lb/>Smith would have had a large majority<lb/> of votes : of this there was the clearest 
     <lb/>proof. In Charlottetown, Messrs. Pope 
     <lb/>and Brecken, members of the Coalition 
     <lb/>government, walked the course, as no 
     <lb/>one could be found to oppose them. 
     <lb/>At Summerside Mr. McMillan, an  
     <lb/>
          
          
            <cb/>
          
          
      ex-M. P. voted against his own   nomi<lb break="no"/>nee, and Mr. Vickerson,   the only can<lb break="no"/>didate     brought forward by the late 
     <lb/>government party, was pledged to<lb/>
     
      support Mr. Pope's government.    The 
     <lb/>
     public  feeling there ran so   high 
     <lb/>
     against the late government,  that even 
     <lb/>
     the office-holders voted against them.  
     <lb/>
     If Confederation had never   been 
     <lb/>
     mooted or mentioned, their defeat 
     <lb/>
     would have been just as  sure as  it is 
     <lb/>
     to-day. The very things with  which 
     <lb/>
     the late government had charged the 
     <lb/>
     Coalition, they themselves did ;  for 
     <lb/>
     instance, they charged their predeces<lb break="no"/>sors with not accepting the lowest  
     <lb/>
     tender, but they did worse by  passing 
     <lb/>
     over several tenders without  even 
     <lb/>
     making the necessary inquiries.  They 
     <lb/>
     charged the Coalition with putting too 
     <lb/>
     many curves on the line of Railway, 
     <lb/>
     but when they let the Branch Lines 
     <lb/>
     they put in 15 per cent  more curves 
     <lb/>
     than the Trunk contained.  Mr. Pope's 
     <lb/>
     government were taunted by them for 
     <lb/>
     the manner in which the Contracts 
     <lb/>
     were let, but they immediately turned 
     <lb/>
     round and let the Branch lines at a 
     <lb/>
     cost of $1000 per mile more. The 
     <lb/>
      Coalition government did the best they 
     <lb/>
     could, but having had no  experience 
     <lb/>
     in building Railways, made  some mis<lb break="no"/>takes ; but the late government, with 
     <lb/>
     all the experience of their predecessors 
     <lb/>
     to go  by, made far greater blunders 
     <lb/>
     than they did. Then again, it was  
     <lb/>
     said by some members of   the late 
     <lb/>
     government that no man could be 
     <lb/>
     honest who had anything to do with  
     <lb/>
     Schreiber and Burpee ; but these were   
     <lb/>the very men whom they selected  for 
     <lb/>their contractors. They paid from  the 
     <lb/> public chest for the survey  of the 
     <lb/>Branch lines, but the Coalition com<lb break="no"/>pelled the  Contractors of the trunk  
     <lb/>line to  pay the cost of  the survey  of 
     <lb/>that line. Then another  terrible 
     <lb/>blunder was made by them,—the 
     <lb/>worst of all—they  removed the only 
     <lb/>proper security  the country had for 
     <lb/>the proper construction of the trunk 
     <lb/>line. When the coalition government 
     <lb/>
         
         
    
         
         <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">27</fw>
        
        
     let the trunk  contract, it was  stipulat<lb break="no"/>ed that the Contractors    should re<lb break="no"/>ceive only 90  per cent of their money, 
     <lb/>
     before the completion of the contract, 
     <lb/>
     and that ten per cent should  remain 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of the  government till 
     <lb/>
     then. The late  government agreed to 
     <lb/>
     recind that part of the  agreement, and 
     <lb/>
     in doing so, released every man who 
     <lb/>
      was security for the  faithful perfor<lb break="no"/>mance of the  contract. The bond 
     <lb/>
       was signed by the securities  on condi<lb break="no"/>tion that ten per cent of the pay was 
     <lb/>
     to remain in the hands of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, until the completion of the con<lb break="no"/>tract, and might have been a strong 
     <lb/>
      inducement to them to give their 
     <lb/>
      names as security. But the securities 
     <lb/>
     are, by the act of the late government, 
     <lb/>
     entirely released, because the contract 
     <lb/>
     has been broken by the latter without 
     <lb/>
      the consent of the former. With our 
     <lb/>
      public credit broken up and our finan<lb break="no"/>ces placed in a wretched condition by 
     <lb/>
      an unprincipled and imbecile govern<lb break="no"/>ment there was, he was sorry to say, 
     <lb/>
     only one way to get out of our difficult<lb break="no"/>ies, and that was to get still better 
     <lb/>
      terms, if possible, at Ottawa, and unite 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. Fancy the effect of a 
     <lb/>
     travelling financier going round to all 
     <lb/>
     the cities of the Dominion, endeavor<lb break="no"/>ing, with little success, to sell our gov<lb break="no"/>ernment debentures ! What effect 
     <lb/>
     would this have upon the sale of our 
     <lb/>
     Railway Debentures in the London 
     <lb/>
     money market ? The hon. junior 
     <lb/>
      member for Belfast, when setting off 
     <lb/>
    on the delegation, acted like a robber,  
     <lb/> who having robbed a house, sets fire to 
     <lb/>it, and burns it down, to prevent his 
     <lb/>robbery from being discovered. After 
     <lb/>all that had been said and done, what 
     <lb/> was the only  charge that had been 
     <lb/>  made against him (Mr. H.) as a public 
     <lb/>man ? He had been charged with 
     <lb/>being in favor of a grant to Catholic 
     <lb/> Schools, of taking the poor child off  
     <lb/> the street, and placing it in   a good 
     <lb/>school. He gloried in his position 
     <lb/>upon the School Question. The pub<lb break="no"/>lic mind is in a diseased state upon<lb/>


            <cb/>
       
       
     this question ; but he had no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that in time the disease would die out. 
     <lb/>
     The present opposition did  all in their 
     <lb/>
     power to establish a strong Protestant  
     <lb/>
     government, and to exclude Catholics   
     <lb/>
     from having any voice in the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of the government, and any 
     <lb/>
     share of the official patronage.  They 
     <lb/>
     wished to divide Catholic  against 
     <lb/>
     Protestant, and then to go into Con<lb break="no"/>federation—that was their whole 
     <lb/>
     policy. In what position would they 
     <lb/>
     stand , if they had entered the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion with a government from which  
     <lb/>
     Catholics were excluded ?    How would 
     <lb/>
     their policy appear to the statesmen of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, many of whom are 
     <lb/>
     better Protestants than they ?  They 
     <lb/>
     would leave over  forty thousand of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this colony in a discontented 
     <lb/>
     condition, without any  voice in the 
     <lb/>
     government of the Colony or participa<lb break="no"/>tion in  the management   of Public 
     <lb/>
     affairs. Do they believe that their 
     <lb/>
     conduct would receive the approbation 
     <lb/>
     of all high-mined liberal Dominion 
     <lb/>
     Statesmen? If so, they are woefully 
     <lb/>
     mistaken. That kind of policy might 
     <lb/>
     do very well for Uigg, Rona and Raasa,  
     <lb/>
     but it would not do for the Dominion ! 
     <lb/>
     The hon. junior member for Belfast 
     <lb/>
     who a short time ago had endeavoured 
     <lb/>
     to stigmatize every hon. member of 
     <lb/>
     the House who entertained confederate 
     <lb/>
     sentiments ; he who had been only one 
     <lb/>
     year in public life and had been noto<lb break="no"/>rious for being a malicious defamer 
     <lb/>
     so pronounced by the records  of the  
     <lb/>
     House ; had, in a moment changed his 
     <lb/>
     policy and had lately done more to 
     <lb/>
     promote Confederation than any hon. 
     <lb/>
     member in the whole Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     This was the action of an hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber who had defamed the characters of 
     <lb/>
     more men, in his public utterances and 
     <lb/>
     his journal than any other man he 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. H.) had ever heard of. His 
     <lb/>
      (Mr. Laird's) own friends had con<lb break="no"/>demned him by their vote recorded in 
     <lb/>
     the Journals of the House. On the 
     <lb/>
     strength of a mere minute of Council, 
     <lb/>
    that hon. member  and his  co-delegate 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            <pb n="1873-04-24_Page_028"

     set off for Ottawa, and the first infor<lb break="no"/>mation the country received of their 
     <lb/>
      departure was contained in a fly sheet 
     <lb/>
     of the Royal Gazette of Feb. 15th.  
     <lb/>
     The official announcement of the terms 
     <lb/>
     published in the Royal Gazette, did 
     <lb/>
     not reach him (Mr. H.) till after the 
     <lb/>
     general election ; as it was only print<lb break="no"/>ed on the 28th March, there was not 
     <lb/>
     sufficient time  for it to reach the more 
     <lb/>
     distant parts of the Island. He could 
     <lb/>
     come to no other conclusion, than that 
     <lb/>
     there were no terms before the coun<lb break="no"/>try on nomination day, as there was 
     <lb/>
     nothing officially published for which 
     <lb/>
     anybody was responsible. If the 
     <lb/>
      terms had been published in time as 
     <lb/>
      they should have been, the people 
     <lb/>
     would have been in a position to pro<lb break="no"/>nounce an  intelligent opinion upon 
     <lb/>
     them, but as this was not the case, they 
     <lb/>
      could not do so. No intelligent man 
     <lb/>
     would  say that a list of terms with no 
     <lb/>
     official signature should be recognized 
     <lb/>
      by the  people as reliable. A great 
     <lb/>
     many people believed all that time, 
     <lb/>
     that  the whole thing was a fabrication 
     <lb/>
      got up for the purpose drawing their 
     <lb/>
     attention from other matters. His 
     <lb/>
     honest conviction was, that it was the 
     <lb/>
               original intention of the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment to put the country into Confed<lb break="no"/>eration <hi rendition="simple:italic">nolens volens</hi>.  Mr. H. Beer, a 
     <lb/>
     member of that government resigned 
     <lb/>
    his seat as a member of the Executive  
     <lb/>Council when the delegation was ap<lb break="no"/>pointed and no reason had been given 
     <lb/>for that resignation. Although that 
     <lb/>hon. member had resigned months ago, 
     <lb/>his resignation had not reached the 
     <lb/>Lieutenant governor till a day or two 
     <lb/>ago.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BEER2">Mr. BEER</persName> rose to a point of order, 
     <lb/>
     and stated that he had resigned his 
     <lb/>
     seat in the late Executive before the 
     <lb/>
     Delegates were  appointed. He had 
     <lb/>
     ran his election altogether on the Con<lb break="no"/>federate ticket.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOWL2">Hon. Mr.  HOWLAN</persName>.—There must 
     <lb/>
      have been some reason for the resigna<lb break="no"/>tion of the hon. member, and  it was 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
       
       
     fair to presume  that the Delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa had  something to do with it. 
     <lb/>
     His Honor might  not have received  
     <lb/>
     that  resignation, at the time, and this 
     <lb/>
     may have been the  reason why it was 
     <lb/>
     not published till all the members of 
     <lb/>
     the late government resigned. There   
     <lb/>
     was,  at one time, a  great flourish of 
     <lb/>
     trumpets is reference to the ability of 
     <lb/>
     the late government as displayed in 
     <lb/>
       the reinvestment clauses of the Branch 
     <lb/>
     Railway Bill, but what did those 
     <lb/>
     clauses amount to ? The station at 
     <lb/>
     Summerside had been changed, which 
     <lb/>
     necessitated  the building of a breast<lb break="no"/>work in a very exposed situation that 
     <lb/>
     might be broken  down by the first 
     <lb/>
     storm after it is completed. One would 
     <lb/>
     have thought they would move the 
     <lb/>
     whole world by their rejoicings at the 
     <lb/>
     change of that Station—the Great 
     <lb/>
      Peace Jubilee in Boston was nothing 
     <lb/>
     to it. How far did they move the 
     <lb/>
     Alberton Station ? Merely across the 
     <lb/>
     road. He had offered to the late 
     <lb/>
      Railway Commissioners a site on the 
     <lb/>
     side of the road opposite ; they com<lb break="no"/>plained that the ground was too low ;  
     <lb/>
     he  offered to fill it up and make it   
     <lb/>
     level, but they still refused it. The 
     <lb/>
     truth is that the original spot chosen 
     <lb/>
     was the  proper place for the station, 
     <lb/>
     when the continuation of the line to 
     <lb/>
     Tignish is taken  into account, and the 
     <lb/>
     the Engineer  will corroborate this 
     <lb/>
     statement. The investigating En<lb break="no"/>gineers reported on that station under 
     <lb/>
     the impression that it was to be made 
     <lb/>
     a terminal one, and did not take into 
     <lb/>
      account the continuation of the Branch  
     <lb/>
     to Tignish. In speaking of the change 
     <lb/>
     of station at Summerside, the Engineers 
     <lb/>
     stated,  " of course in taking this sug<lb break="no"/>gestion into consideration,   the increas<lb break="no"/>ed cost must be borne in mind." But 
     <lb/>
     the increase of  cost was nothing to the 
     <lb/>
     government that carried out the dash- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     away policy. The property-holders in   
     <lb/>
      that part of the  town through which  
     <lb/>
     the railway at present passes, happen<lb break="no"/>ed to be opposed to the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and therefore the latter did not  
     <lb/>
         
         
        
        
        
        
        <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">29</fw>
       
       
       
     hesitate to direct that the road should 
     <lb/>
     be carried through their property, thus 
     <lb/>
      greatly damaging it, and cutting up 
     <lb/>
     the streets. In changing that station  
     <lb/>
     the late government squandered $100,<lb break="no"/>000 of the public money, and did 
     <lb/>
     $500,000 damage to the town. It is 
     <lb/>
     stated  by engineers and others ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with the matter, that a small 
     <lb/>
     country town requires a large station 
     <lb/>
     ground for agricultural and other pur<lb break="no"/>poses, as the products of the soil and 
     <lb/>
     forest are bulky and conveyed in 
     <lb/>
     vehicles  requiring considerable space. 
     <lb/>
     The Summerside station ground is a 
     <lb/>
     small one, and often washed by the 
     <lb/>
     tide, and will always be a source of 
     <lb/>
     trouble and  dissatisfaction. The late 
     <lb/>
     Government have left this Island in 
     <lb/>
     such a position, with its credit irrepar<lb break="no"/>ably injured, that nothing less than 
     <lb/>
      Confederation will relieve us from fin<lb break="no"/>ancial embarrassment.  They had sent 
     <lb/>
     for the New York Engineers, and the 
     <lb/>
     result was that their  own charges were 
     <lb/>
     proved to be  false, and without a sha<lb break="no"/>dow of foundation. The Hon. R. P. 
     <lb/>
     Haythorne declared last session in his 
     <lb/>
       place in the Legislative Council, that 
     <lb/>
     he was not answerable for what takes 
     <lb/>
     place in the heat of debate, but if he 
     <lb/>
     found that the Contract had been faith<lb break="no"/>fully carried out according to the letter 
     <lb/>
     and spirit of the Railway Act, he 
     <lb/>
     would be the first to acknowledge it. 
     <lb/>
     Where is the acknowledgment ? No<lb break="no"/>thing of the kind has been made, al<lb break="no"/>though the  Engineers' Report has 
     <lb/>
     shown the Railway  Act to be carried 
     <lb/>
     out to the  letter. When that Report 
     <lb/>
     was received, they (the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment) did not understand the figures 
     <lb/>
     it contained, nor the statements in re<lb break="no"/>ference to the curves, and therefore 
     <lb/>
     they wrote that famous letter to the 
     <lb/>
     Engineers,  almost begging them to find 
     <lb/>
     some fault with the Trunk Line, in 
     <lb/>
     some way or other. There was that 
     <lb/>
     terrible curve on the  Thompson farm 
     <lb/>
     and some others, which they almost 
     <lb/>
     implored the Engineers to find some 
     <lb/>
     fault with, but did not succeed in their 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
       
       
     designs. Then, in order to throw 
     <lb/>
     odium, if possible, upon Mr. Boyd, 
     <lb/>
     they put the Report in a drawer and 
     <lb/>
     locked it up, instead of publishing it, 
     <lb/>
     like honest men, for the information of  
     <lb/>
     the people  who were deeply interested 
     <lb/>
     in the result of that investigation. 
     <lb/>
     When the Engineers were about set<lb break="no"/>ting out to engage in their work, a 
     <lb/>
     letter was sent to them by the late 
     <lb/>
     Government telling them not to speak 
     <lb/>
     to Messrs. Pope, Howlan, or Carvell, 
     <lb/>
     in other words to " avoid as far as 
     <lb/>
     possible the  intrusion of persons desir<lb break="no"/>ous of volunteering information, and 
     <lb/>
     offering their opinions," and to " form 
     <lb/>
     your own unbiassed opinions on the 
     <lb/>
     matters submitted to you."  No men 
     <lb/>
     durst speak to them, as there  was a 
     <lb/>
     fence all around them. Now, who 
     <lb/>
     were the men who were to be particu<lb break="no"/>larly guarded against as dangerous,  
     <lb/>
     and therefore to be dreaded ? The 
     <lb/>
     strong advocates of the Railway policy 
     <lb/>
     of the Coalition Government, Messrs. 
     <lb/>
     Pope, Howlan, Carvell,  &amp;c., &amp;c. Then 
     <lb/>
     certain members of the late Executive 
     <lb/>
     were to accompany those Engineers 
     <lb/>
     wherever they went, in order to pre<lb break="no"/>vent the intrusion of those dangerous 
     <lb/>
     persons he had just mentioned. He 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. H.) wondered what these En<lb break="no"/>gineers thought of those gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who  watched and guarded them with  
     <lb/>
     such jealous  care they, no doubt, en<lb break="no"/>tertained their own opinions of the 
     <lb/>
     state of matters and of the motives of 
     <lb/>
     the men who gave them their instruc<lb break="no"/>tions. What did the  late Executive 
     <lb/>
     say to the following remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     Engineers in answer to Mr. Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne's statement in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     curve on the Thompson farm : " Now 
     <lb/>
     we beg leave, most respectfully, to say 
     <lb/>
     that these remarks about the alignment 
     <lb/>
     at these points, are not borne out by  
     <lb/>
     the facts of the case." Those Engineers 
     <lb/>
     came here with the very  best testi<lb break="no"/>monials, and it is fair to assume that 
     <lb/>
     they knew more about Railways than 
     <lb/>
     the Hons. P. Sinclair, Haythorne, &amp;c.,

     old the then Government in the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil Chamber. what their opinions on 
     <lb/>
     the Trunk Line Were. and were also 
     <lb/>
     thoronghly cross-questioned on every 
     <lb/>
     point, yet the late Executive depended 
     <lb/>
     that it would, after all, come to pass 
     <lb/>
     that the Report would condemn the 
     <lb/>
               Railway <hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi>, and therefore made 
     <lb/>
     every possible effort to the very last, 
     <lb/>
     to break down and destroy the reputa<lb break="no"/>tion of the projectors of 'the Railway 
     <lb/>
     Scheme. They even went so far as 
     <lb/>
     to express to those Engineers their 
     <lb/>
     own opinions on the curves, spruce 
     <lb/>
    sleepers, wire fence, &amp;c., &amp;c., thus in<lb break="no"/>timating what kind of a Report they 
     <lb/>desired. The Engineers gave a truth<lb break="no"/>ful report, and when the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment tried to trip them up, they found 
     <lb/>it impossible to do so, and circulated a 
     <lb/>report which they knew to be false, 
     <lb/>viz.: that the Engineers had been 
     <lb/>bought over to the Opposition. Their 
     <lb/>last resort was to slander the very men 
     <lb/>they themselves had selected to in<lb break="no"/>vestigate the work of their political 
     <lb/>opponents. The whole matter, to<lb break="no"/>gether with their action in reference 
     <lb/>to Confederation, has been the means<lb/>of placing them where they richly de<lb break="no"/>serve to be, viz.: in the small minori<lb break="no"/>ty they are to-day. Even if Confed<lb break="no"/>eration had never been mooted, they<lb/>would not have been able to hold the<lb/>Government many hours after the<lb/>opening of the Legislature. Last year,<lb/>Mr. Boyd's statements were not trusted<lb/>by the hon. members of the present<lb/>Opposition; this year his statements<lb/>are taken by them to Ottawa as the<lb/>very best authority on our Island Rail<lb break="no"/>way that can be got. Last year that<lb/>gentleman was pronounced by them<lb/>an incompetent; this year he is a<lb/>walking monument of ability. A great<lb/>deal had been said about Mr. Boyd<lb/>being a relation of Hon. Mr. Brecken;<lb/>and it had also been said that he<lb/>owed his present position as Chief En<lb break="no"/>gineer to that relationship. Nothing<lb/>could be father from the truth. The<lb/>
         
         <cb/>
               
               
         fact was that he (Mr. H.) had been 
     <lb/>the means of that gentleman's appoint<lb break="no"/>ment to that important office; having 
     <lb/>made his acquaintance in New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, and knowing that he ranked 
     <lb/>high in his profession, he recommend<lb break="no"/>ed him to the Government to fill the 
     <lb/>position he at present occupies. The 
     <lb/>fact that the Colony is to day in a bad 
     <lb/>financial position and compelled to 
     <lb/>knock at the doors of the Dominion 
     <lb/>for admission, altogether owing to 
     <lb/>the incompetence. blundering and mis<lb break="no"/>management of the late Government. 
     <lb/>It is much easier to destroy the credit 
     <lb/>of the country than to build it up as 
     <lb/>strong as it formerly'was. He would 
     <lb/>rather see the Colony remain out of 
     <lb/>Confederation, if it could redeem its 
     <lb/>credit, but he saw that there was not 
     <lb/>much prospect of its-doing so, and 
     <lb/>would therefore endeavor to obtain 
     <lb/>the best terms possible, and do all that 
     <lb/>lay in his power to forward the best 
     <lb/>interests of this Island.

     the same time, when the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     made the statement first he said the 
     <lb/>
     Board Spent $120,000 which was not 
     <lb/>
     correct. The Board had a vote of the

     House last session for ordinary public 
     <lb/>
     works, such as roads, bridges, wharves, 
     <lb/>

     Government House, fuel,&amp;c... $10,000. 
     <lb/>
     And for unfinished works a sum suffi<lb break="no"/>cient amounting to about $46,000. In 
     <lb/>
     addition to these amounts they had 
     <lb/>
     local subscription lists for most of the 
     <lb/>
     heavy works amounting to $3 000. 
     <lb/>
     These amounts when balanced against

     $93,500 expended, showed that the

     <lb/>
     within the limits assigned by the

     <lb/>
     laid the Government did wrong in 
     <lb/>
     remitting money to London before it 
     <lb/>
     became due, this he thought could be 
     <lb/>
     easily answered when the public ac<lb break="no"/>counts came up for discussion. Thus 
     <lb/>
     as regards the delegation to Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     he had simply to say that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment took the state of the Colony, 
     <lb/>
     with reapect to its finances into con<lb break="no"/>sideration, and found that in order to 
     <lb/>
     meet the public demands as they be. 
     <lb/>
     came due, taxation to the extent of 
     <lb/>
     about $2.00 a head on the population 
     <lb/>
     of the Colony would be required to be 
     <lb/>
     levied. Such being the result of their 
     <lb/>
     enquires it was deemed advisable to 
     <lb/>
     open up negotiations with the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion Government. All they did in the 
     <lb/>
     matter was fair and open. No advan-   
     <lb/>
     tage was taken of the country in any 
     <lb/>
     way whatever in what they did. The 
     <lb/>
     late Government was defeated because 
     <lb/>
     the school question was used against 
     <lb/>
     them and not on account of their Con<lb break="no"/>federation policy. On these two ques<lb break="no"/>

        tions their policy was sustained by the 
     <lb/>
     present party. For his part he was 
     <lb/>
     not once of those who had one policy 
     <lb/>
     for today and another for to-morrow. 
     <lb/>
     The letter which the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Alberton read, stated that the school 
     <lb/>
     question was brought up at a public 
     <lb/>
     meeting in New London. Mr. Ross, 
     <lb/>
     who he believed wrote that letter, was 
     <lb/>
     a candidate at the late contest, and ap<lb break="no"/>peared to think he might succeed if he 
     <lb/>
     could get the Catholic vote. For his 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. S.'s) part, he only mentioned the 
     <lb/>
     question once, and that was at a meet<lb break="no"/>ing at Lot 29. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Alberton if in earnest on the school 
     <lb/>
     question. now that he was in power 
     <lb/>
     again, should move in the matter. If 
     <lb/>
     there was an hon. member in the 
     <lb/>
     House which that question did more 
     <lb/>
     service to than another, it was the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member himself. He denied the mis<lb break="no"/>management charged against the late 
     <lb/>
     Government. When they went out of 
     <lb/>
     power they left more money in the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury titan they found there when 
     <lb/>
     they came into office, and had besides 
     <lb/>
     in London, to the credit of the Colony, 
     <lb/>
     £6,000 sterling. With regard to sur<lb break="no"/>veying and locating the branch lines of 
     <lb/>
     the Railroad, he believed the country 
     <lb/>
     gained by their doing 80. Previous to 
     <lb/>
     the location of the Main Trunk the 
     <lb/>
     distance from Alberton to Georgetown 
     <lb/>
     had been computed at 120 miles, or 27 
     <lb/>
     miles less than the actual length. The 
     <lb/>
     branches had been estimated at about 
     <lb/>
     50 miles, and the resulthad shown that 
     <lb/>
     in estimating the length'they came 
     <lb/>
     within a mere trifle oi the distance. 
     <lb/>
     This he thought would not be the case 
     <lb/>
     if the Contractors had been allowed to 
     <lb/>
     locate the branches as they did the 
     <lb/>
     main line. True the cost per mile 
     <lb/>
     was higher, but they would have a 
     <lb/>
     better road. The sleepers were to be 
     <lb/>
     Juniper and cedar instead of spruce and 
     <lb/>
     hemlock. He felt satisfied that those 
     <lb/>
     living on the two ends of the line 
     <lb/>
     would have a better road than the 
     <lb/>
     centre would prove to be. The finan<lb break="no"/>cial affairs of the Colony were man<lb break="no"/>
        
        
            <cb/>
         
         
         aged as efficiently and with as much 
     <lb/>
     regard to economy and the welfare of 
     <lb/>
     the country as they had been by their 
     <lb/>
     predecessors, and on retiring from the 
     <lb/>
     Government they left them, as he be<lb break="no"/>fore said, in as good a condition as 
     <lb/>
     they found them. He knew of no 
     <lb/>
     clergyman in his district who used any 
     <lb/>
     influence in his favor during the late 
     <lb/>
     election ; but believed there were 
     <lb/>
     clergymen on both sides who did so in 
     <lb/>
     other districts. The policy foresha<lb break="no"/>dowed in the Speech be regarded as a 
     <lb/>
     sound one, and if the Government ad<lb break="no"/>hered faithfully to it they should, while 
     <lb/>
     doing so have his support. When the 
     <lb/>
     Railway Bill was carried he felt the 
     <lb/>
     Island would not much longer be able 
     <lb/>
     to stand erect under the burden it 
     <lb/>
     would impose, and the result proved 
     <lb/>
     that he was correct. He had the 
     <lb/>
     honor to represent one of the largest 
     <lb/>
     and most intelligent districts in the 
     <lb/>
     Island, and notwithstanding what was 
     <lb/>
     said by the hon. member for Alberton,

     party to be slandered while their

     policy was swallowed. The Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion do not intend by factibus opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to embarrass the Government in 
     <lb/>
     having the Revenue Bill carried

     through at the proper time, yet when 
     <lb/>
     a member of the Government occupied 
     <lb/>
     so much time in saying so little, he, for 
     <lb/>
    one would assert his right to reply. 
     <lb/>The result of the election had been dis<lb break="no"/>cussed. He for one felt surprised to 
     <lb/>hear hon. members state that the 
     <lb/>school question was not before the 
     <lb/>country. The fact was—it could not 
     <lb/>be denied—every man on both sides 
     <lb/>was schooled up on that particular 
     <lb/>question. Each elector when polling 
     <lb/>a vote for a Catholic candidate knew 
     <lb/>he was recording one in favor of grants 
     <lb/>in aid of Catholic schools. (No.) 
     <lb/>Hon. members might say no, but he 
     <lb/>believed such was the fact. He knew 
     <lb/>it was so in the Murray Harbor dis<lb break="no"/>trict in which there were many Catho<lb break="no"/>lics who value and appreciate the Free 
     <lb/>Educational System which we possess. 
     <lb/>Numbers of them voted for him (Mr. 
     <lb/>D.) because he was in favor of main<lb break="no"/>taining the system in its integrity, and 
     <lb/>in, so far as his humble ability would 
     <lb/>enable him, hoped he would be found 
     <lb/>always ready to defend and support it 
     <lb/>He felt quite convinced the school 
     <lb/>question was just as much before elec<lb break="no"/>tors at the late contest as Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. In looking at the Speech of His 
     <lb/>Honor the Lieutenant Governor he 
     <lb/>could not but feel that a majority were 
     <lb/>returned to support the policy of the 
     <lb/>late Government on the question of 
     <lb/>grants to Denominational Schools and 
     <lb/>Confederation. On these two ques<lb break="no"/>tions the late Government carried the 
     <lb/>country with them. Certainly if such 
     <lb/>was not the case and the views of some 
     <lb/>ere to be met on Education, it should 
     <lb/>be set forth in the Speech. On Con<lb break="no"/>federation the Speech did foreshadow 
     <lb/>the fact that the Governnent had en<lb break="no"/>dorsed the policy of their predecessors. 
     <lb/>Where in such conduct was the con<lb break="no"/>sistency of the hon. member for Tignish 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
         
         
     who had inscribed, on his flag "No 
     <lb/>
     Confederation ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOWL2">Hon. Mr. HOWLAN</persName> rose to a point 
     <lb/>
     of order, to say, he had no flag with 
     <lb/>
     such an inscription on it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. L. H. DAVIES</persName> would say further, 
     <lb/>
     that when the hon. member came 
     <lb/>
     down on this particular occasion with 
     <lb/>
     aspeech in which no reference was 
     <lb/>
     made to the school question,—in a 
     <lb/>
     word, abandoning the Catholic claims 
     <lb/>
     for their schools, it ill became him to 
     <lb/>
     assail the late Representative for Char<lb break="no"/>lottetown in the manner he did. He 
     <lb/>
     could tell the hon. member, that the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Daniel Davies as a public man 
     <lb/>
     stood high in the estimation of the 
     <lb/>
     petple. That in all the walks of life 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Daniel Davies stood upon a 
     <lb/>
     pedestal far higher than the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Tigrish had ever reached. 
     <lb/>
     And such being the case the remarks 
     <lb/>
     made respecting him by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber could do that hon. gentleman no 
     <lb/>
     harm. In so far as Confederation 
     <lb/>
     went, the late Government was the 
     <lb/>
     only one which ever existed in this 
     <lb/>
     Colony that could have carried that 
     <lb/>
     question at the polls. Nor would he 
     <lb/>
     hesitate to assert that on the general 
     <lb/>
     question the hon. member for Belfast 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. Laird) would pull more 
     <lb/>
     votes, yes a two to one vote, over any 
     <lb/>
     other public man in the Colony. 
     <lb/>
     Again, an attempt had been made to 
     <lb/>
     shew that the late party slandered the 
     <lb/>
     Engineers. This he denied. But at 
     <lb/>
     the same time was willing to admit, 
     <lb/>
     nor would he hesitate frankly to admit, 
     <lb/>
     that the Report of the inspecting En<lb break="no"/>gineers cleared the late Government. 
     <lb/>
     of all blame in the matter. Yet while 
     <lb/>
     admitting that much, he could not but 
     <lb/>
     express his firm belief also, that the 
     <lb/>
    ultimate intention of Mr. Pope's Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in carrying the Railway Bill, 
     <lb/>was to land the Colony into Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation They must have known, and 
     <lb/>he believed did know, that it could be 
     <lb/>used as an effectual means to accom<lb break="no"/>plish that end. Unquestionably the 
     <lb/>
       
       
            <pb n="1873-04-24_Page_036"

     measure was carried against the wishes 
     <lb/>
     of a large majority of the people, and 
     <lb/>
     when so sweeping a Bill was rushed 
     <lb/>
     through the Legislature without the 
     <lb/>
     consent of the electors, they felt them<lb break="no"/>selves grossly insulted, an insult 
     <lb/>
     which they resented on the first oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity which afterwards presented it<lb break="no"/>self. The bulk of the people knew 
     <lb/>
     that the passing of that Bill meant in<lb break="no"/>crease taxation to an extent beyond 
     <lb/>
     what they could bear, or Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. This the people knew, and felt 
     <lb/>it too, up to the present hour. The  
     <lb/>Report of the Inspecting Engineers 
     <lb/>substantially says that most of the 
     <lb/>blunders it. connection with the under<lb break="no"/>taking, were chargeable. to the manner 
     <lb/>in which the contract was let. There 
     <lb/>was not a man in the country who for l 
     <lb/>a moment believed the contract was 
     <lb/>fairly let. In letting it the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment opened the door wide for fraud 
     <lb/>to enter. As a professional man, he 
     <lb/>would not for a moment hesitate to 
     <lb/>assert, that a more loosely drawn up  
     <lb/>Bill was never passed through the 
     <lb/>Legislature. It was utterly impossi<lb break="no"/>ble to understand some of its provisions, 
     <lb/>or to account for many omissions there<lb break="no"/>in. Unless the Act was amended the 
     <lb/>land damages which would have to be 
     <lb/>paid, would be enormous. The amend<lb break="no"/>ments required were numerous. No 
     <lb/>provision is made for crossing the 
     <lb/>Road. No one knew who drew up 
     <lb/>the Bill, though it was shrewdly sus<lb break="no"/>pected that it was drawn up by some 
     <lb/>of the friends of the hon. member the 
     <lb/>Leader of the Government, across the 
     <lb/>water. Any one who would take up 
     <lb/>the Act and carefully peruse it would
     <lb/>find tlat it was all he described it to 
     <lb/>be. It was a Bill, however, which 
     <lb/>virtually changed the Constitution of 
     <lb/>the Colony ; and the manner in which 
     <lb/>it was carried through the Legislature 
     <lb/>went far to convince the people that it 
     <lb/>was done with a view to deprive this- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Colony of its Constitution. Was it 
     <lb/>any wonder the electors hurled the 
     <lb/>Government which carried the mea<lb break="no"/>
         
         
            <cb/>
         
         
     sure, from power on the first oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity which offered afterwards. But 
     <lb/>
     says the hon. member from Alberton 
     <lb/>
     "the country have hurled you from 
     <lb/>
     power too." True, but the principle 
     <lb/>
     upon which the late Government ap 
     <lb/>
     pealed to the people on, has been sus<lb break="no"/>tained. The speech of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber was so incoherent he could make 
     <lb/>
     nothing of it. While on his feet he. 
     <lb/>
     made some strong assertions and read 
     <lb/>
     a few letters for the information of 
     <lb/>
     hon. members, but believed if they 
     <lb/>
     were closely examined they would 
     <lb/>
     prove to be the emanations of the hon 
     <lb/>
     member himself. On one question. 
     <lb/>
     however, he (Mr. D) felt pleased to 
     <lb/>
     be able most cheerfully to congratulate 
     <lb/>
     his Catholic friends, and that was on 
     <lb/>
     the change which had taken place in 
     <lb/>
     their minds on the question ol Educa<lb break="no"/>tion. It was a question at all events 
     <lb/>
     which demanded an answer, but upon 
     <lb/>
     it they were as silent as the grave. 
     <lb/>
     Yet, notwithstanding, he assumed it 
     <lb/>
     was not their intention to allow the 
     <lb/>
     matter to drop. He supposed the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member held the same views now as 
     <lb/>
     those he gave utterance to last year. 
     <lb/>
     In the Parliamentary Reporter for 
     <lb/>
     1872 the hon. member is reported as 
     <lb/>
     pleading thus :—" But it was a lasting 
     <lb/>
     disgrace that when £23,000 or £24,<lb break="no"/>000 were spent for educational purposes 
     <lb/>
     in the Colony, seven out of every ten 
     <lb/>
     parents in the city. were paying for 
     <lb/>
     the education of their children in the 
     <lb/>
     private schools. Would any person 
     <lb/>
     say it was fair to allow those schools 
     <lb/>
     to be kept up by private enterprise 
     <lb/>
     when schools in a disgraceful state in 
     <lb/>
     back lanes and yards were receiving 
     <lb/>
     large sums from the public. There 
     <lb/>
     was no reason why this should be, ex<lb break="no"/>cept the narrow minded views of men 
     <lb/>
     of the stamp of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Belfast. In almost all other countries 
     <lb/>
     grants were given to Denominational 
     <lb/>
     Schools. In the Dominion, France, 
     <lb/>
     Austria, Prussia, Great Britain and in 
     <lb/>
     Australia this was done. Then why 
     <lb/>
     not here? The only thing that stood 
     <lb/>
       
       
     
     
     
     <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">87</fw> 
 
 
   
       
       
     in the way was the intolerance and 
     <lb/>
     bigotry of men of whom the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member was a type. If that hon. gen 
     <lb/>
    tleman were a Christian these could 
     <lb/>not be the sentiments of his heart. 
     <lb/>We believed he made use ot them as 
     <lb/>clap-trap for electioneering purposes." 
     <lb/>Such was the earnestly expressed opin<lb break="no"/>ions of the hon. member when in 
     <lb/>Opposition. So earnest was he that 
     <lb/>in the same speech he further says : 
     <lb/>" He would tell that hon. member that 
     <lb/>the blood of 45.000 of his fellow 
     <lb/>colonists was reeking on his hands, that 
     <lb/>he was the Champion of infidelity and 
     <lb/>a disgrace to any Christian Church." 
     <lb/>Well the hon. member was now in 
     <lb/>power and if sincere in what he then 
     <lb/>said, he should see to it that his cher<lb break="no"/>ished views on that question were 
     <lb/>carried out. He well remembered 
     <lb/>when the hon. member was the re<lb break="no"/>spected leader of the Liberal party in 
     <lb/>this House. But who broke up his 
     <lb/>party on that question. If he was 
     <lb/>sincere then, he would show it now. 
     <lb/>He then signed a bond not to press 
     <lb/>that question, had he done the same 
     <lb/>again? Did the hon. member suppose 
     <lb/>his Catholic friends were going to be 
     <lb/>satisfied with empty promises ?—with 
     <lb/>vain words and unfulfilled pledges ? 
     <lb/>For his part be (Mr. D.) owed much 
     <lb/>to the Free Educational System, and 
     <lb/>to the full extent of his humble ability 
     <lb/>would ever use his best efforts to main<lb break="no"/>tain it in its purity.   He admired the 
     <lb/>system because in its princrples it ex<lb break="no"/>tended even handed justice to all, and 
     <lb/>favor to none. He would never con<lb break="no"/>sent that Catholics or Protestants 
     <lb/>should enjoy or receive any advantage 
     <lb/>the one over the other. Fair play to 
     <lb/>all and favor to none was the rule 
     <lb/>which should govern him. It was 
     <lb/>time that question ceased to be one 
     <lb/>which could be used for breaking up 
     <lb/>Governments, at the will and pleasure 
     <lb/>of any party. So long as such should 
     <lb/>continue to be the case, it would be 
     <lb/>not only a source of political annoyance 
     <lb/>but also an injury to the country. He 
     <lb/>
         
    
            <cb/>
        
        
     hoped the junior member for Bedeque 
     <lb/>
     would have the manliness'to adhere to 
     <lb/>
     the statements he gave utterance too 
     <lb/>
     or nomination day. and not go in for   
     <lb/>
     selling his country like another Castle<lb break="no"/>reagh. As to the senior member (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howatt) he did not doubt for a moment 
     <lb/>
     bu. that he would keep those he made  
     <lb/>
     and believed the hon. member would 
     <lb/>
     feel more comfortable on the other 
     <lb/>
    side of the House. But that the hon. 
     <lb/>member will vote against Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion as he promised he had no doubt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOWA1">Mr. HOWATT</persName> understood full well 
     <lb/>
     what the general policy of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was at the time of the late gener<lb break="no"/>al election. He knew also, that many 
     <lb/>
     at the Government were in favor of 
     <lb/>
     going into Confederation. During his 
     <lb/>
     canvass in the late contest, he did not 
     <lb/>
     say anything against either the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment or Opposition. But gave it 
     <lb/>
     as his opinion that Confederation in<lb break="no"/>stead of improving the situation of the 
     <lb/>
     country, would on the contrary have 
     <lb/>
     the desired effect. Some of the can<lb break="no"/>didates said it was simply a question 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation or taxation. His 
     <lb/>
     opinion was it would beincreased tax<lb break="no"/>ation in either case. It was said that 
     <lb/>
     he had left his party. Such was not 
     <lb/>
     the case, on the contrary when they 
     <lb/>
     took up their Confederate policy, they 
     <lb/>
     then left him. He disapproved  of 
     <lb/>
     their policy. A great many were dis<lb break="no"/>posed to regard the question altogether 
     <lb/>
     from a pound, shilling and pence stand 
     <lb/>
     point ; nor did he hear a single argu<lb break="no"/>ment in favor of a union with the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, but those which had refer<lb break="no"/>ence to their pockets. He disapproved 
     <lb/>
     of getting ontheir knees and begging 
     <lb/>
     terms of Canada. Before doing any<lb break="no"/>thing of the kind it would have been 
     <lb/>
     much more consistent with what was 
     <lb/>
     due to themselves and to the country, 
     <lb/>
     to have first put their own shoulder to 
     <lb/>
     the wheel and tested the resources of 
     <lb/>
     the country. The speech of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for New London convinced 
     <lb/>
     him that if we were willing we might

     get through  with our difficulties. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member had shown that the coun<lb break="no"/>try was not in such a state but that 
     <lb/>
     this might be done, with the exception 
     <lb/>
     of £10,000  or 15,000 which would 
     <lb/>
      fall due for interest next June, there 
     <lb/>
     were no pressing  demands upon the 
     <lb/>
      Colony nor would there be any until  
     <lb/>
    next January.  When such was the 
     <lb/> case, he failed to see the necessity 
     <lb/>which existed for sending a delegation 
     <lb/>so hastily to  Canada. Last year the 
     <lb/>crops were not as good as formerly. 
     <lb/>Mercantile men met with more difficul<lb break="no"/>ties than usual and other reasons,  
     <lb/>occurred to render the public affairs  
     <lb/>of the Colony  more difficult  to adjust 
     <lb/>than formerly. Such might not occur 
     <lb/> again. If we went into union with 
     <lb/>Canada our Revenue would then be<lb break="no"/>long to the Dominion Government. 
     <lb/>The general Government would col<lb break="no"/>lect the Revenue in our notes, and no 
     <lb/>doubt draw the gold as freely out of 
     <lb/>our Banks as it is drawn now. He 
     <lb/> was told that the Bank of Montreal, in 
     <lb/>the interest of the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had a branch in  St. John and 
     <lb/>Halifax, and that they were drawing 
     <lb/>the gold from the  local Banks in those 
     <lb/>cities to an extent that was felt to be 
     <lb/>injurious to trade. Suppose then that 
     <lb/>the same was done here what better 
     <lb/>position would we be  in, in Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion than we would be  out of it. Why 
     <lb/>it would have a   tendency to place 
     <lb/>the business men in as tight a place as 
     <lb/>ever. If we go into the Dominion we 
     <lb/>will receive but £40,000 or £50,000 a 
     <lb/>year for our local wants. Now if 
     <lb/>£120,000 is not sufficient at present it 
     <lb/> was clear that at an early day we 
     <lb/>would have to resort to direct taxation 
     <lb/>for local purposes. It was an easy 
     <lb/>matter to say we are going to throw 
     <lb/>our burdens  upon the Federal Gover<lb break="no"/>nment, but for his part he regarded the 
     <lb/> Canadian ministers as too shrewd to 
     <lb/> make a bargain that would relieve  us 
     <lb/>in the slightest degree from paying 
     <lb/>our full share of the Revenue which 
     <lb/>will be continually required. No 
     <lb/>
        
    
            <cb/>
        
        
     doubt the Canadian Government will 
     <lb/>
     work our finances to suit themselves. 
     <lb/>
     The fact that the Government expres<lb break="no"/>sed a wish to unite with Canada, gave 
     <lb/>
     them an advantage, inasmuch  as it 
     <lb/>
     showed we were not able to manage  
     <lb/>
     our own affairs. For a period of one  
     <lb/>
     hundred years we had been able to 
     <lb/>
     conduct the business of the country, 
     <lb/>
     but all at once when a pressure came  
     <lb/>
     the first thing thought of was the sur<lb break="no"/>rendering of our rights to Canada, — 
     <lb/>
     giving up before we had tested our  
     <lb/>
     own ability to tide over the difficulty. 
     <lb/>
     The amount of taxation they had to 
     <lb/>
     pay in the  Dominion was far higher 
     <lb/>
     than it was here. Direct taxation we 
     <lb/>
     would have to come to very soon if we 
     <lb/>
     went into Confederation. He would 
     <lb/>
     move a Resolution when the proper 
     <lb/>
      time came which would express  his 
     <lb/>
     views on the subject, as one he would 
     <lb/>
     vote against Confederation on any 
     <lb/>
    terms. He hoped each hon. member 
     <lb/>would hear in mind that the question 
     <lb/>was one which offered  us for all time. 
     <lb/>It amounted  in his view of the matter 
     <lb/>to political annihilation. We might 
     <lb/>add a little  to the credit of the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion Government.

     duct were considered they would ap<lb break="no"/>pear most inconsistent. It was amus<lb break="no"/>ing to listen to the arguments of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member the Leader of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion and those of the learned member 
     <lb/>
     for Murray Harbor.    No doubt the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic members duly appreciated  the 
     <lb/>
     kind intentions of the  hon. members. 
     <lb/>
    He would however inform them and  
     <lb/>other members of that hon. House, that 
     <lb/>the views of Catholics were entirely 
     <lb/>misrepresented.  Two or three  days 
     <lb/>before the late election,  the " Patriot " 
     <lb/>said that two or three Catholic mem<lb break="no"/>bers were free to act upon the School 
     <lb/>question as they  saw fit. But in his 
     <lb/>next issue stated that they had swal<lb break="no"/>lowed the School question.  His be<lb break="no"/>lief was that the manner in which they 
     <lb/>carried on the Government while in 
     <lb/>power, and the ways  they let the con<lb break="no"/>tract for the Branch Lines led to their 
     <lb/>overthrow. It had been asserted that 
     <lb/>when they passed the Bill for the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Branch lines, one of 
     <lb/>their supporters said, that although 
     <lb/>they carried the Bill yet it never 
     <lb/>would be agreed to at Home. Thus 
     <lb/>while passing that Bill to gratify some 
     <lb/>of their supporters, they led others of 
     <lb/>them to suppose it never would be<lb break="no"/>come law. As a corroboratives opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, the contract was not signed until 
     <lb/>a few minutes before the clock struck 
     <lb/>twelve, which was the very last mom<lb break="no"/>ent it would have been legal to do so. 
     <lb/>He would ask the hon. member from 
     <lb/>whom he received his authority to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed to Ottawa ? Had they the con<lb break="no"/>sent of their own friends in the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature ? certainly not. They did not 
     <lb/>as much as call their own supporters 
     <lb/>together and consult with them before 
     <lb/>moving in so important a matter. 
     <lb/>They say now they sent the question 
     <lb/>to the people at the polls. But the 
     <lb/>hasty manner in which electors were 
     <lb/>called upon  to vote upon a matter 
     <lb/>which would affect  them for all  time, 
     <lb/>rendered the appeal more like a farce 
     <lb/>than a reality. The terms were not 
     <lb/>placed before the people in a reliable 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
           
           manner until after the election had<lb/>taken place. Some few might have<lb/>seen them before the poll closed but<lb/>the majority of the people did not see<lb/>the Royal Gazette in which they were<lb/>published until after that time. He's<lb/>a Catholic, but on the School question<lb/>was determined not to do anything<lb/>which would violate the promise made<lb/>to the constituency he had the honor<lb/>to represent. It was not the School<lb/>question but opposition to the late<lb/>Government that determined the late<lb/>election in Summerside. So intense was<lb/>the feeling that even Mr. McMillan<lb/>cast a vote for an opposition Candidate<lb/>while his own nominee was pledged to<lb/>support Mr. Pope if he should succeed<lb/>in forming a government.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:STEW2">Mr.  STEWART</persName>—Said there was but 
     <lb/>
     one paragraph of any importance in 
     <lb/>
     the address, and that is the one which 
     <lb/>
     referred to Confederation, so that on 
     <lb/>
     that question he was happy to say he  
     <lb/>
     was in unison with the Government. 
     <lb/>
     But whilst fully concurring in the 
     <lb/>
     views expressed in the address on that  
     <lb/>
     subject, he had also to congratulate the 
     <lb/>
     Leader of the Government on his 
     <lb/>
     change of views with regard to Con<lb break="no"/>federation.  For up to the time the 
     <lb/>
     colony was free from the embarrassed  
     <lb/>
     position it was now in, brought about 
     <lb/>
     entirely by the  policy of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member, he had proclaimed himself an 
     <lb/>
     anti-confederate. Yet the hon. member 
     <lb/>
      ought not to suppose he had power 
     <lb/>
     now to grind down others. Nor could 
     <lb/>
     he refrain from saying that these hon. 
     <lb/>
     members who so suddenly changed 
     <lb/>
     their views, and who were now such 
     <lb/>
     warm advocates of a policy which they 
     <lb/>
     so recently condemned, should, in view 
     <lb/>
     of these facts be more modest. For 
     <lb/>
     his part he would not for a moment 
     <lb/>
     dare to cope in  ability, much less in 
     <lb/>
     experience with the hon. and learned 
     <lb/>
     member for Summerside. But he could 
     <lb/>
     not refrain from observing, that it was 
     <lb/>
     most singular the hon. member did

     not see the Gazette of the 17th inst.,

     in which the terms were published. 
     <lb/>The hon. member for Bedeque (Mr.<lb/>Howatt) regards the matter simply as<lb/>one of money. Well assuming the<lb/>view taken of the question by the<lb/>hon. member to be correct would he<lb/>regard it as wise to refuse these terms,<lb/>when, in a money point of view, they<lb/>are so favorable. It was obvious to<lb/>any one who would carefully consider<lb/>the matter, that by accepting them<lb/>we can get along for some time with<lb break="no"/>out resorting to local taxation, whereas<lb/>if we reject them, we will be forced to<lb/>resort to increased taxation immedia<lb break="no"/>tely. When contesting his election,<lb/>his hon. colleague (Hon. P. S.) and<lb/>himself were fiercely opposed. With<lb/>regard to the statement of the hon.<lb/>member from Alberton, who said the<lb/>School question was not before the<lb/>country at the late election, he would<lb/>only say, if such was the case the hon.<lb/>member knew very little of what was<lb/>going on in the country. Any one<lb/>however, acquainted with the hon.<lb/>member would hardly give him credit<lb/>with being so innocently ignorant re<lb break="no"/>specting what was before the country<lb/>at the late election. Why in listening<lb/>to him one would suppose the hon.<lb/>member did not meddle with politics<lb/>at all. But he (Mr. S.) believed that<lb/>whoever shook the fruit bearing <choice><sic>politi<lb break="no"/>tical</sic><corr>political</corr></choice> tree he made out to be nigh<lb/>enough to it for some of the political<lb/>apples to fall into his hands. The<lb/>hon. member for Alberton must not<lb/>therefore, endeavor to impose upon<lb/>the House by telling them that the<lb/>reaason the government favored going<lb/>into a union with Canada was because<lb/>the late government mismanaged the<lb/>finances of the Colony. Mere asser<lb break="no"/>tion and high toned declamation would<lb/>not do. When the Documents were<lb/>brought down and their administration<lb/>fairly considered, he felt convinced, it<lb/>would be seen that the statesmanship<lb/>of the out-going government was equal<lb/>to, if not far superior, to that of their<lb/>predecessors. Had it not been for the<lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
       
       School question, and the use made of it<lb/>to influence the elections in some dis<lb break="no"/>tricts, Mr. Haythorne's party were still<lb/>in power, Catholic, to his own know<lb break="no"/>ledge, expected a Grant for their<lb/>Schools, from Hon. Mr. Pope's Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. They rendered good service<lb/>when the Free School System was<lb/>first carried, and many of them felt<lb/>they were entitled to an allowance for<lb/>a few of their Schools. He could and<lb/>does respect the honest convictions of<lb/>a sincere Catholic, but a man who acts<lb/>inconsistent with his profession he did<lb/>not respect. Much was said respecting<lb/>the embecility of the late adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, but he failed to see wherein<lb/>the administrative ability of the present<lb/>Executive lay. It does not appear in<lb/>the draft address, or in the arguments<lb/>used in its support. The late govern<lb break="no"/>ment conducted the business of the<lb/>country as ably and with as much<lb/>ability as the former government did,<lb/>and with much more consistency.<lb/>Were it not for the manner in which<lb/>the Railway Bill was carried the hon.<lb/>the Leader of the Government would<lb/>stand higher than he does in the esti<lb break="no"/>mation of the people. But Mr. Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne, and his hon. friend the Leader<lb/>of the Opposition took no advantage of<lb/>the people in their Confederation policy<lb/>or in any other way. They laid the<lb/>matter fairly before the people, leaving<lb/>them to accept or reject the Terms<lb/>brought down. He and his hon. collea<lb break="no"/>gue were returned to vote for their<lb/>acceptance. It therefore the hon.<lb/>member the Leader of the Government<lb/>brought in a Resolution in their favor<lb/>he would support it.<lb/>

        written requisition from his supporters<lb/>requiring him to do so. And like<lb/>his hon. colleague (Mr. H.) he was<lb/>not going to violate any promise made<lb/>to his supporters. When considering<lb/>the question, he felt it to be his duty<lb/>to look across the straits and see how<lb/>Confederation was working in the<lb/>Provinces which are united. And<lb/>what did he see? Why this: New<lb/>Brunswick was clamoring for Better<lb/>Terms. Manitoba too was complain<lb break="no"/>ing. When such was the case the<lb/>duty of this colony, and those who<lb/>represented her in the Legislature,<lb/>was, calmly to consider what they did.<lb/>The question should be well and very<lb/>carefully considered. No hasty le<lb break="no"/>gislation should be gone into on so im<lb break="no"/>portant a matter. He was of the<lb/>opinion that we might keep out of<lb/>Confederation altogether if we were so<lb/>disposed, and the way in which this<lb/>might be done he would on some future<lb/>occasion submit for the consideration<lb/>of hon. members. The Catholics did<lb/>not press the school question on him,<lb/>on the contrary many of them told him<lb/>they did not wish him to vote for any<lb/>alteration in the School Act. Yet<lb/>notwithstanding these facts the Sum<lb break="no"/>merside <hi rendition="simple:italic">Progress</hi> stated that he had<lb/>been pledged to vote for grants to<lb/>Catholic schools. A more barefaced<lb/>lying assertion was never made. And<lb/>were it not for the falsehoods circu<lb break="no"/>lated against him on that question he<lb/>felt satisfied he would have received<lb/>400 more votes than he did. When<lb/>the hon. member the Leader of the<lb/>Opposition referred to what he (Mr.<lb/>Holland) said at the nomination, he<lb/>should have told the whole truth.<lb/>For he who withholds a part of the<lb/>truth is as guilty as he who utters a<lb/>falsehood. What he did say was:-<lb break="yes"/> that we might keep out of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion if we prepared to pay a<lb/>gih a tax as they did in the other<lb/>Provinces in the Dominion.

It was most<lb/>likely they would be looking forward<lb/>for opportunities which might enable<lb/>them to put something into their poc<lb break="no"/>kets.

     <lb/>formed a highway upon which the<lb/>Island would run swiftly down into<lb/>the depths of financial ruin, and thence<lb/>of necessity <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> union with the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. The argument brought for<lb break="no"/>ward by the Senior member for<lb/>Bedeque would not do. The failure<lb/>in our crops did not produce the pre<lb break="no"/>sent state of affairs. The simple fact<lb/>is the Railway was too much of an<lb/>undertaking for this small colony. It<lb/>might be thought strange that he (Mr.<lb/>McN.) should have won his election<lb/>so easily during the last campaign,<lb/>especially when it was borne in mind<lb/>that he came out in favor of the terms<lb/>brought down by Mr. Laird and Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne. The fact was many of his<lb/>supporters were leaseholders. They<lb/>saw that the great cost of the Railway<lb/>deprived them of ever becoming free<lb break="no"/>holders <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> hope that under present<lb/>circumstances the Government would<lb/>be able to purchase out the Proprietors<lb/>Estates <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>. They saw that if<lb/>the Proprietors were even willing to<lb/>sell the Government would not for<lb/>want <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> funds, be in a position to pur<lb break="no"/>chase. Hence <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>, in the $800,000<lb/>offered in the terms brought down a<lb/>positive certainty, when the Proprie<lb break="no"/>tors would sell, of purchasing their<lb/>farms. He believed no hon. member<lb/>on either side would be willing to levy<lb/>a tax equal to what would be required<lb/>to meet the present and increasing re<lb break="no"/>quirements of the country. The hon.<lb/>member from Alberton thought a<lb/>change in the mind of the electors, un<lb break="no"/>favorable to the late Government, had<lb/>taken place or he (Mr. McN.) would<lb/>have been returned with a much<lb/>larger majority. But he believed such<lb/><unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> had not influenced half<lb/>a dozen of voters. A friend of Mr.<lb/>Longworth asked him how he intended<lb/>to act on the Grant Question. He<lb/>(Mr. McN.) stated in consequence of<lb/>having done so lost about 150 votes.<lb/>But the number of his Protestant sup<lb break="no"/>

         porters was the same as usual. Some 
     <lb/>represented him as a bigot, while others<lb/>among his Catholic friends said they<lb/>had nothing against him. Emissaries<lb/>went among the people telling the<lb/>Catholics that <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> could be<lb/>wrong from him in aid of endowing<lb/>Denominational Schools. Nor would<lb/>he ever agree to anything of the kind.<lb/>The moment they did so, they would<lb/>lay down a principle which in the end<lb/>would completely destroy the public<lb/>schools of the colony. He had been<lb/>opposed by able men who were much<lb/>respected in his district, and he be<lb break="no"/>lieved were it not for the issue raised<lb/>on the school questions, his support<lb/>would have been as good as ever it<lb/>was. One clergyman did vote for him;<lb/>he was a gentleman through a clergy<lb break="no"/>man who considered it his duty al<lb break="no"/>ways to record his vote, and although<lb/>he voted for him at the last election<lb/>yet the same, Rev. gentleman voted<lb/>against him on former occasions. But<lb/>he (Mr. McN.) never asked him for a<lb/>vote, he did not see therefore that out<lb/>of that circumstance his opponents had<lb/>say just grounds for manufacturing<lb/>political capital. When the Railway<lb/>Bill was passing through the House,<lb/>he then told th ehon. member for<lb/>Bedeque [Mr. Howell] that the time<lb/>might come when they would have to<lb/>choose between increased taxation or <lb/>Confederation. That crisis in our his<lb break="no"/>tory had come. Doubtless financial<lb/>and other pressures had come upon<lb/>the Colony, during the past year, but<lb/>these had occurred before, and would<lb/>do so again. The true cause of our<lb/>present difficulty can only be attributed<lb/>to the fact, that our responsibilities<lb/>were greater than the resources of the<lb/>Island, could bear. Such being the<lb/>case, he saw no course open, but to ac<lb break="no"/>cept the terms brought down by the<lb/>Delegates and unite with the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CALL1">Mr. CALLBECK</persName>:- could not fail to<lb/>notice the change which had come<lb/>over the hon. member since last year.<lb/>He presumed the hon. member felt the<lb/>responsibilities of his present position.<lb/> Meagre thought the speech undoubted<lb break="no"/>ly was, yet it contained matter, which,<lb/>if the Opposition felt disposed to avail<lb/>themselves of, gave a wide scope for<lb/>a lengthened debate. But he did not<lb/>suppose hon. members in Opposition<lb/>would follow the bad example set by<lb/>the hon. Leader of the Government<lb/>and his friends during the last session.<lb/>The charges of imbecility made against<lb/>the last government had been so well<lb/>refuted, and ably met, by hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers who preceded him, that he would<lb/>not revert to that matter now. It<lb/>was said the late government did not <lb/>pursue the proper course in placing<lb/>the terms before the country. But<lb/>the circumstances and condition of the<lb/>colony have so changed that he thought<lb/>when men would lay aside party and<lb/>side issues, they would, when the facts<lb/>were fairly considered, come to a dif<lb break="no"/>ferent conclusion. And when so look<lb break="no"/>ing at the case, they would, in the let<lb break="no"/>ting of the Branch Lines and sending<lb/>up a Delegation to Ottawa, see that<lb/>the late government could not be dis<lb break="no"/>charged with either imbecility or<lb/>mismanagement. In 1859 the public<lb/>debt of the Colony was $5.00 a head<lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
        
        while that of the Dominion was $25.00<lb/> or five times that of this Island for its<lb/>population. Such was not the case<lb/>now. Our debt had run up very much<lb/>since 1859. The debt of the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion was also increased. In the terms<lb/>brought down the debt was placed at<lb/>$45.00 per head, which left a margin<lb/>in our favor. He regarded the terms<lb/>brought down as fair, just and reason<lb break="no"/>able and such as reflected great credit<lb/>on the ability of the Delegates. His<lb/>intention was to vote for accepting<lb/>these Terms. He was one of those<lb/>who attended the meeting which was<lb/>held in Hon. Mr. Palmer's office. They<lb/>had the terms then, and emphatically<lb/> denied that anyone at that meeting<lb/>either spoke of, or suggested accepting<lb/>them without submitting them to the<lb/>people. When the House was dissol<lb break="no"/>ved he (Mr. C.) did not go through the<lb/>District soliciting votes. He was in<lb break="no"/>vited to attend a public meeting, and<lb/>when there explained his views fully,<lb/>and his approval also of the terms<lb/>brought down. He was not returned<lb/>by means of the use of any lies as the<lb/>hon. member for Alberton said, neither<lb/>was he pledged.

The hon. junior<lb/>member for Murray Harbor had stated<lb/>at a public meeting held in the Car<lb break="no"/>digan District that Mr. Prowse was as<lb/>firm on the School Question as he (Mr.<lb/>Davies) was, and yet that hon. member<lb/>had made use of the School Question<lb/>in the Murray Harbor district to secure<lb/>Mr. Prowse's defeat.

Where are the<lb/>warrants issued by the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment to meet their demands ? They<lb/>are still afloat and must be paid as<lb/>they become due.

How did the late government<lb/>provide for the payment of the interest<lb/>due on the debentures on the first of<lb/>July next ? They borrowed the<lb/>money from the Maritime Bank of St.<lb/>John, N.

Oh,<lb/>what financiers. Why did they go to<lb/>Ottawa ? Because they could not<lb/>manage the financial affairs of the<lb/>Colony any longer, and did not know<lb/>how.

The hon. member for<lb/>Murray Harbor had taken pains to<lb/>abuse the Catholics, although their<lb/>money went into the Treasury to the<lb/>extent of nearly one-half the Revenue<lb/>of the Colony, and although their<lb/>money had paid for that hon. member's<lb/>education three days out of every week.<lb/>That hon. member could not now say<lb/>anything harsh enough or abusive<lb/>enough about them, simply because they<lb/>were Catholics and had views of their<lb/>own in reference to the School Ques<lb break="no"/>tion.

He (Mr. Howlan)<lb/>had never attacked a gentleman out<lb break="no"/>side the Bar of that House, because it<lb/>was unmanly and unfair to attack those<lb/>who were not in a position to reply.<lb/>Last year the members of the Coalition<lb/>Government were, at a large number<lb/>of political meetings, held in different<lb/>parts of the country, accused by their<lb/>political opponents of fraud in connex<lb break="no"/>ion with letting and carrying out the<lb/>Railway Contract ; and prominent<lb/>among those who made those charges<lb/>were the hon. member for Belfast and<lb/>the hon. E. Palmer. He (Mr. H.)<lb/>then said to the hon. Leader of the<lb/>present Government " Unless you<lb/>bring the first of those men who makes<lb/>a criminal charge against the Coalition<lb/>government, before the Supreme Court<lb/>at its next sitting, I will wash my<lb/>hands clear of you." So the next<lb/>time the present hon. member for Mur<lb break="no"/>ray Harbor made a similar charge he<lb/>was asked whether he really preferred<lb/>

        a criminal charge against the Coalition<lb/>government. What was his answer ?<lb/>" Oh," said he, " I make these charges<lb/>politically." Hon. members might<lb/>differ in politics and still practice the<lb/>amenities and civilities of life ; but it is<lb/>pretty hard when one is called a rogue,<lb/>a thief, and a liar, at political assem<lb break="no"/>blies, &amp;c., to treat those who act in<lb/>this manner, as at other times. What<lb/>was the first speech the hon. member<lb/>for Murray Harbor delivered in this<lb/>House ? It was a tirade of abuse<lb/>against gentlemen outside the Bar<lb/>who were not in a position to reply to<lb/>him.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. L. H. DAVIES</persName> did not think<lb/>the remarks of the hon. member for<lb/>Alberton worth replying to ; but that<lb/>hon. member had made one statement<lb/>in reference to him which he would<lb/>not allow to pass uncontradicted. He<lb/>would not allow that hon. member to<lb/>state that he (Mr. D.) was educated<lb/>partly at the expense of the Catholics<lb/>and had now turned round and abused<lb/>them. This statement no founda<lb break="no"/>tion in fact. He had ever, at any<lb/>time, made any statement calculated<lb/>to offend or insult his Roman Catholic<lb/>fellow-countrymen, or to show disre<lb break="no"/>spect for their religion. He would<lb/>have been among the basest of charac<lb break="no"/>ters had he done so. He had support<lb break="no"/>ed a political party, the majority of<lb/>whom were Roman Catholics, from<lb/>the first day he had taken any interest<lb/>in politics, had fought side by side<lb/>with them for civil and religious<lb/>liberty, and was always of opinion that<lb/>no political distinctions should be<lb/>thrown between Catholics and Protes<lb break="no"/>tants, and that they should enjoy equal<lb/>privileges. He would give both<lb/>Catholics and Protestants equal privi<lb break="no"/>leges, but would never consent to give<lb/>one side an inch more than the other.<lb/>He was glad to see that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Cardigan (Mr. McD.) had<lb/>come doen from his Anti-Confederate<lb/>position. During his late canvass, that<lb/>hon. member expressed the opinion<lb/>
      
      
            <cb/>
        
        that Confederation was a mere politi<lb break="no"/>cal bugbear and a mere political dodge<lb/>of the late government to retain office<lb/>and power, and promised when the<lb/>House met, to lay down a scheme by<lb/>which it might be avoided. He had<lb/>no doubt that when that scheme was<lb/>submitted it would be such as would<lb/>become that hon. member. He did<lb/>not believe the hon. member would<lb/>make a statement which he did not be<lb break="no"/>lieve to be true ; but when he told the<lb/>people of Cardigan that he could carry<lb/>on the government without going into<lb/>Confederation, he did not understand<lb/>our position as a Colony. He congra<lb break="no"/>tulated the hon. member on his extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary change of base. The hon.<lb/>senior member for Cardigan would not<lb/>give any pledge to oppose Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion ; but the hon. junior member<lb/>rushed where the hon. senior member<lb/>feared to treat, and firmly pledged<lb/>himself. He (Mr. D. ) then told the<lb/>hon. junior member, that he would not<lb/>be many days on the floor of the<lb/>House before making a recantation,<lb/>and he now found he was right, for<lb/>the hon. member now accepts the situ<lb break="no"/>ation. Let him now try to run his<lb/>election against Mr. Scrimgeour and<lb/>he will find a different state of affairs.<lb/>They accused Mr. Scrimgeour of fit<lb break="no"/>ting himslf out with gold spectacles,<lb/>gold pens and pencils, &amp;c.<lb/>

            <p>Messrs. McDonald and Owen here<lb/>both denied the truth of this statement,<lb/>and stated that they had never, at any<lb/>time, made such a charge against Mr.<lb/>Scrimgeour.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:OWEN2">Mr. OWEN</persName> said that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Murray Harbor had endeavored<lb/>to make considerable political capital<lb/>during the canvass in the Cardigan<lb/>district, of certain words used by Mr.<lb/>George Owen, that certain things<lb/>looked very suspicious, but he (Mr.<lb/>O.) had never, during the whole can<lb break="no"/>vass, insinuated anything of the kind<lb/>against Mr. Scrimgeour.

        out of the School Question, and used it<lb/>at several public meetings against him,<lb/>and had it not been that the people<lb/>knew his principles and had full con<lb break="no"/>fidence in him, he would not have<lb/>received a single Protestant vote in<lb/>the whole district. But the people<lb/>reposed full confidence in him, and the<lb/>consequence was that he received a<lb/>very large Protestant and Catholic<lb/>support. He had been always op<lb break="no"/>posed to Confederation, and opposed it<lb/>at the commencement of the canvass,<lb/>because it was impossible for him to<lb/>ascertain the true state of matters, and<lb/>how the financial affairs of the country<lb/>really stood. He had endeavored to<lb/>find access to the Public Accounts, but<lb/>found that it could not be had. When<lb/>he saw that Confederation would prove<lb/>to be a great advantage to the people<lb/>of this Colony, he would go for it, but<lb/>not before.<lb/>
