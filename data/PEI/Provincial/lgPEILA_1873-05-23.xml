     <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">167</fw> 
    
            
     This question of Confederation is the 
     <lb/>
     most important matter ever taken into 
     <lb/>
     consideration by a Committee of the 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly of this Colony. 
     <lb/>
     The Government considered the Terms 
     <lb/>brought down from Ottawa by Messrs. 
     <lb/>Haythorne and Laird, were such that 
     <lb/>if accepted, the Colony would be 
     <lb/>forced to resort immediately to local 
     <lb/>taxation in order to meet its yearly 
     <lb/>requirements ; and, therefore, felt it to 
     <lb/>be their duty to appoint another dele<lb break="no"/>gation for the purpose of obtaining 
     <lb/>better Terms, if possible. This Island 
     <lb/>occupies an entirely different position 
     <lb/>from that of any of the other Colonies, 
     <lb/>as the latter have many great sources 
     <lb/>of revenue which we have not. On<lb break="no"/>tario derives a revenue from her Crown 
     <lb/>lands, amounting to a million dollars 
     <lb/>per year ; New Brunswick has her 
     <lb/>Crown lands and forests, and Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia lands and mines. Although 
     <lb/>this Province is the most fertile and 
     <lb/>productive in British America, it is 
     <lb/>dependent upon the products of its soil 
     <lb/>and fisheries, and has no Crown lands 
     <lb/>or forests as sources of revenue, as 
     <lb/>have the other Provinces. Owing to 
     <lb/>our isolated position, we could not ex<lb break="no"/>pect to successfully carry on manufac<lb break="no"/>turing Operations or anything of that 
     <lb/>kind, while the other Provinces are 
     <lb/>not cut off from each other during half 
     <lb/>the year, and have four millions of 
     <lb/>customers for their manufactured 
     <lb/>.goods. I, therefore, looked upon this 
     <lb/>Island as occupying an exceptional 
     <lb/>position, and in giving up the power 
     <lb/>of self government and taxation, I felt 
     <lb/>that we should receive a sum sufficient 
     <lb/>to enable us to meet our requirements, 
     <lb/>as we have hitherto done. Although 
     <lb/>we had a Railway from one end of the 
     <lb/>Island to the other, it was only fair 
     <lb/>that Canada should take it off our 
     <lb/>hands and keep it running. The 
     <lb/>Government were told that the Terms  
     <lb/>brought down by Messrs. Haythorne 
     <lb/>and Laird were liberal, generous, and 
     <lb/>the best that could be obtained ; but 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     we did not consider they would supply 
     <lb/>
     the wants of the Colony. The House 
     <lb/>
     then authorized the appointment of 
     <lb/>
     another delegation to proceed to Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, and endeavor, if possible, to ob<lb break="no"/>tain better Terms which would meet 
     <lb/>
     our requirements, and, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time, be just, reasonable and fair. 
     <lb/>
     Messrs. Haviland, Howlan and myself 
     <lb/>
     were appointed on that delegation, and 
     <lb/>
     proceeded on our mission. On our 
     <lb/>
     arrival at Ottawa, we had a good deal 
     <lb/>
     to contend with. We had been pre<lb break="no"/>ceded by the Leaders of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion in both Branches of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, who composed the former dele<lb break="no"/>gation, and who, I believe, did all they 
     <lb/>
     could to obtain the most liberal Terms. 
     <lb/>
     On their return they had declared that 
     <lb/>
     no better Terms would be granted. 
     <lb/>
     And we had also heard a great deal 
     <lb/>
     about the Governor General's tele<lb break="no"/>gram which had been sent down here ; 
     <lb/>
     but we know that telegrams of that 
     <lb/>
     kind are sometimes asked for by the 
     <lb/>
     ministry of the day, and paid no atten<lb break="no"/>tion to it. Representations bad pre<lb break="no"/>ceded us from this Island to the effect  
     <lb/>
     that the great bulk of the people were 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with the Terms already offer<lb break="no"/>ed, and that I had stated that if I could 
     <lb/>
     not obtain better Terms, I would ac<lb break="no"/>cept the Terms brought down by the 
     <lb/>
     former delegates. Some of our friends 
     <lb/>
     and well wishers had written to Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, stating that they considered the 
     <lb/>
     Terms already obtained just and 
     <lb/>
     liberal, and that they were satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to the people generally. We stated in 
     <lb/>
     plain terms that what we wanted was 
     <lb/>
     a sufficient amount to carry on our 
     <lb/>
     local Government, and meet the usual 
     <lb/>
     wants of the Colony, without being 
     <lb/>
     compelled, immediately after entering 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, to resort to local taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. Our idea was that the manner 
     <lb/>
     in which we presented our claims 
     <lb/>
     would enable the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to judge for themselves, and they 
     <lb/>
     could then provide for them as they 
     <lb/>
     thought fit. I wrote a note to the 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="1873-05-23_Page_168"

     Finance Minister, and asked for an 
     <lb/>
     answer ; but the latter was very short, 
     <lb/>
     and most people would think there 
     <lb/>
     was no prospect held out in it of ob<lb break="no"/>taining better Terms. However, we 
     <lb/>
     persevered, and made out as good a 
     <lb/>
     case as we possibly could by taking a 
     <lb/>
     rather prospective view of our expen<lb break="no"/>diture, and after spending some time 
     <lb/>
     in negociation we succeeded in ob<lb break="no"/>taining the following addition to the 
     <lb/>
     Terms brought down by the preceding 
     <lb/>
     delegates: Instead of entering Con<lb break="no"/>federation with an assumed debt of 
     <lb/>$45 per head, we shall be entitled to 
     <lb/> incur a debt equal to $50 per head of 
     <lb/>our population, which will give us 
     <lb/>$23,500 annually. Then, in order to 
     <lb/>keep up constant communication with 
     <lb/>the capital, the Dominion Government 
     <lb/>agreed to pay $2,000 as a subsidy to 
     <lb/>the Telegraph Company. As we re<lb break="no"/>quire a great deal of inland Steam 
     <lb/>communication, such as the line to 
     <lb/>Mount Stewart, Orwell, Crapaud, 
     <lb/>Georgetown, Summerside, &amp;c., we 
     <lb/>claimed an annual allowance for that 
     <lb/>purpose, and obtained an assurance of 
     <lb/>$10,000 yearly for mail service by 
     <lb/>those lines. Our inland Steam Com<lb break="no"/>munication, will, we are assured, be 
     <lb/>connected with the Steam Service con<lb break="no"/>necting this Island with Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>and New Brunswick. This would fully 
     <lb/>make up the sum of $33,000 per year 
     <lb/>over and above the Terms obtained by 
     <lb/>Messrs. Laird and Haythorne. We 
     <lb/>endeavored to impress upon the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government the fact that it 
     <lb/>would be better to prevent the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of our being compelled to resort to 
     <lb/> direct local taxation for a few years 
     <lb/> after entering Confederation, than to 
     <lb/>have our people enter the Dominion 
     <lb/>discontented and dissatisfied. We 
     <lb/>were also promised that the wharves 
     <lb/>in our principal harbors would be 
     <lb/>taken by the Dominion, and <choice><sic>maintain<lb break="no"/>tained</sic><corr>maintained</corr></choice>, which would be another valu<lb break="no"/>able  addition to the preceding Terms. 
     <lb/>When the House of Commons is  in a 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
          
     Committee of Supply, a small amount<lb/>for such a purpose does not receive<lb/>much attention, while it will materially<lb/>assist us. The Opposition were per<lb break="no"/>fectly satisfied with the Terms pro<lb break="no"/>cured by their Government, and,<lb/> therefore, I am sure, that when they 
     <lb/>
    find them supplemented by the hand<lb break="no"/>some sum procured by the last delega<lb break="no"/>tion, they will give them their cordial 
     <lb/>support. I sincerely hope and trust that 
     <lb/>this great question of Confederation 
     <lb/>will be carried by a unanimous vote of 
     <lb/>this House. A resolution, embodying 
     <lb/>the Terms now offered us, has been 
     <lb/>passed in the Dominion Parliament, 
     <lb/>and also an Address to Her Majesty, 
     <lb/>in accordance with the North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca Act. I have received a telegram 
     <lb/>from the Finance Minister, stating 
     <lb/>that the Legislation necessary on the 
     <lb/>part of Canada was done and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, the matter only requires action 
     <lb/>on our part to consummate the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment or our admission into the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. The resolution passed through 
     <lb/>their Parliament without much oppo<lb break="no"/>sition, and I hope this House will 
     <lb/>follow their example in that respect. 
     <lb/>Something was stated in that Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to the effect that the Terms were 
     <lb/>too liberal to this Colony ; but as there 
     <lb/>was a general feeling in favor of the 
     <lb/>consolidation of all the Provinces, little 
     <lb/>opposition was offered. As delegates, 
     <lb/>we did all that was in our power to do 
     <lb/>in the short time allotted us, and I think 
     <lb/>we accomplished a good deal, consider<lb break="no"/>ing the circumstances. The House of 
     <lb/>Commons was about to rise, and the 
     <lb/>Ministers had a great many duties to 
     <lb/>attend to, which occupied their atten<lb break="no"/>tion to a very late hour. If we had 
     <lb/>been allowed more time, we might 
     <lb/>have done still more, but we did not 
     <lb/>think the House should be detained 
     <lb/>much longer, as hon. members were 
     <lb/>anxious to return to their homes and 
     <lb/>business. As delegates we assented 
     <lb/>to the Terms, and the Government 
     <lb/>approved of all we had done. 1 be<lb break="no"/>

     lieve our supporters are ready to sup<lb break="no"/>port the acceptance of the Terms, and<lb/>to carry out this great question to its<lb/>final issue ; and that the hon. members<lb/>of the Opposition will also approve of<lb/>the Terms we have obtained, instead<lb/>of being grieved at the additional<lb/>allowance we are to receive. I hope<lb/>that when we go into Committee for<lb/>the consideration of the matter, it will<lb/>be dealt with in a proper spirit, and in<lb/>a manner that will reflect credit upon<lb/>this House. If the Opposition give<lb/>their support in carrying out Confed<lb break="no"/>eration upon the basis of the Terms<lb/>now before us, they will receive their<lb/>full share of the credit resulting from<lb/>it. I hope we shall have a unanimous<lb/>vote upon the Terms now before the<lb/>House, and I believe we shall, with<lb/>the exception, perhaps, of my hon.<lb/>friend from Bedeque (Mr. Howatt),<lb/>but I hope that even he will make up<lb/>his mind and support their acceptance,<lb/>also. I do not think he will like to<lb/>see his name recorded as that of the<lb/>only hon. member who has voted<lb/>against the important measure which<lb/>will be introduced for consummating<lb/>this matter of Confederation. The<lb/>increased trade that will result from a<lb/>union with the Dominion will be of<lb/>very great service to us as a Colony.<lb/>The people of the Dominion take a<lb/>very great interest in this little Island,<lb/>and I believe free intercourse with<lb/>them in every respect will be of vast<lb/>benefit to us. There will be no trouble<lb/>about our credit, and with proper<lb/>economy, I believe we shall be able to<lb/>get along without asking our people to<lb/>contribute anything, for many years to<lb/>come, in direct taxation for local pur<lb break="no"/>poses. The sum we shall receive from<lb/>the Dominion would amount to more<lb/>than two dollars on every acre of land<lb/>in this Colony, and if that tax had to<lb/>be levied from our people, it would be<lb/>found very objectionable. With due<lb/>economy I think we shall have suffi<lb break="no"/>
     
<cb/>
            
           cient for our wants, and I, therefore,<lb/>rejoice that the time will soon arrive<lb/>when we shall become a part of the<lb/>great Dominion of Canada.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HAVI1">Hon. Mr. HAVILAND</persName> seconded the<lb/>motion of the hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to go into Committee for the<lb/>consideration of the Terms lately offer<lb break="no"/>ed to this Colony by the Dominion of<lb/>Canada.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAIR2">Mr. LAIRD</persName>.—I am surprised that 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Georgetown 
     <lb/>would second the motion of the hon. 
     <lb/>Leader of the Government without a 
     <lb/>single remark upon the important 
     <lb/>matter contained in the message from 
     <lb/>His Honor the Lieutenant Governor. 
     <lb/>I thought he would certainly have 
     <lb/>given some explanation of the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings of the delegation to Ottawa ; 
     <lb/>and it seems he is merely going to 
     <lb/>give a silent vote upon the question. 
     <lb/>However, we may hear from him 
     <lb/>when the House goes into Committee. 
     <lb/>It is surprising that the hon. member 
     <lb/>would append his name to the state<lb break="no"/>ment made to the Privy Council of the 
     <lb/>Dominion, that the people of this 
     <lb/>Island were dissatisfied with the Terms 
     <lb/>then before them, and wished so much 
     <lb/>more in addition, and also, that those 
     <lb/>Terms were not just and equitable. 
     <lb/>The hon. member voted for Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation on the basis of the Quebec 
     <lb/>Scheme, and when the Haythorne-<lb break="yes"/>Laird Terms came down, he declared 
     <lb/>in public, that they were just and 
     <lb/>liberal to the people of this Colony, 
     <lb/>but in this communication to the Privy 
     <lb/>Council, he states that those Terms 
     <lb/>were not just and equitable. Perhaps 
     <lb/>he thinks we should endeavor to ob<lb break="no"/>tain all we can. Well, I will agree 
     <lb/>with him in that, and am very glad 
     <lb/>he has got better Terms. The hon. 
     <lb/>Leader of the Government has given 
     <lb/>us an account of the doings of the 
     <lb/>delegation, and was very moderate in 
     <lb/>his speech ; but his statement in refer<lb break="no"/>

     ence to the $10,000 promised him by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion authorities for Inland 
     <lb/>
     Steam communication, is not backed 
     <lb/>
     up by any written document to that 
     <lb/>
     effect, and cannot be taken into ac<lb break="no"/>count as forming any part of the Terms 
     <lb/>
     now offered us. The written Terms 
     <lb/>
     contain nothing in reference to either 
     <lb/>
     Inland Steam communication, or to 
     <lb/>
     Harbor improvements, and, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     grants for those matters are not guaran<lb break="no"/>teed to us. We may set down the 
     <lb/>
     statements in reference to them as so 
     <lb/>
     much mere assertion, because we can<lb break="no"/>not expect to have anything granted 
     <lb/>
     that is not contained in the written 
     <lb/>
     Terms. Although ministers may give 
     <lb/>
     certain assurances, the fulfilment of 
     <lb/>
     them depends upon the ministry of the 
     <lb/>
     day, and are not to be depended upon 
     <lb/>
     for all time to come. The Terms 
     <lb/>
     brought down by the last delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, amount, therefore, to only 
     <lb/>
     $25,000 more than the Terms obtained 
     <lb/>
     by the former delegation and we have 
     <lb/>
     not had, so far, any explanation as to    
     <lb/>
     the basis upon which this  additional   
     <lb/>amount has been secured. The for<lb break="no"/>mer delegates explained the basis upon<lb/>which they obtained the $45 per head,<lb/>and how the calculation was made.<lb/>They showed that the Dominion was<lb/>engaged in carrying on several great<lb/>and costly public works, which would<lb/>swell her debt to a certain amount,<lb/>and that in receiving the $45 per<lb/>head, we would receive an equivalent<lb/>to that expenditure. But the House<lb/>has not been informed how the extra<lb/>five dollars, obtained by the last dele<lb break="no"/>gation, has been secured, whether it<lb/>was because there is to be a re-adjust<lb break="no"/>ment of the assumed debts of all the<lb/>Provinces of the Dominion, or whether<lb/>additional public works to those al<lb break="no"/>ready spoken of are to be undertaken?<lb/>If any new work is to be undertaken<lb/>by the Dominion, in addition to those<lb/>previously mentioned by them, the<lb/>House should be informed of it. If<lb/>
     
     <cb/>
            there is to be a re-adjustment of the
     <lb/>debts of the several Provinces of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, we should also be informed of it. 
     <lb/>New Brunswick is seeking for better 
     <lb/>Terms, and at next session of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Parliament we may see their 
     <lb/>Government offer to increase the 
     <lb/>grants to all the other Provinces. If 
     <lb/>this turns out. to be the real state of 
     <lb/>matters, it will make a vast difference 
     <lb/>as to the real value of the Terms now 
     <lb/>offered us, as we shall have to hear 
     <lb/>our share of the taxation necessary to 
     <lb/>carry out that arrangement. I must 
     <lb/>say matters look very suspicious, as 
     <lb/>they at present appear. I do not say 
     <lb/>that this is really so, but I do say that 
     <lb/>the explanation given by his honor the 
     <lb/>Leader of the Government, as to the 
     <lb/>hams upon which the present Terms 
     <lb/>have been secured, is extremely un<lb break="no"/>satisfactory, and leaves great room for 
     <lb/>doubt and suspicion. I have looked 
     <lb/>over the arguments contained in the 
     <lb/>correspondence with the Finance Min<lb break="no"/>ister by the last delegates, and I fail 
     <lb/>to see in the claims they put forth,<lb/>one single argument to justify the<lb/>sending of that delegation to Canada.<lb/>Before the delegation was appointed,<lb/>the House was informed that certain<lb/>Lighthouses and the Drill Sheds were<lb/>built since the Quebec Conference<lb/>took place, and that the expense of<lb/>their construction should be borne by<lb/>the Dominion Government. But we<lb/>find that when the delegates reached<lb/>Ottawa they did not even mention<lb/>those items. I think the Op<lb break="no"/>position must have so thoroughly con<lb break="no"/>vinced them of the shallowness of their<lb/>arguments, that they felt ashamed of<lb/>them and did not dare to present them.<lb/>There is something remarkable in the<lb/>fact that the Minute of Council, con<lb break="no"/>taining their claims, was nearly identi<lb break="no"/>cal in substance to that adopted by the<lb/>late Government, before their delega<lb break="no"/>tion started for Ottawa. They actually<lb/>stole the arguments advanced by the<lb/>
            
           
            
     <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw>  <fw type="num">171</fw> 
    
            
   
           
     late Government, and based their 
     <lb/>
     claim for better Terms upon them. 
     <lb/>
     There was only one item in their 
     <lb/>
     claims different from those of the for<lb break="no"/>mer delegates, and that was, a claim 
     <lb/>
     for $100,000 for a little branch line 
     <lb/>
     of Railway to Port Hill. This, I can 
     <lb/>
     say with all my heart, I wish they had 
     <lb/>
     obtained. With that single exception, 
     <lb/>
     the last delegation could not raise a 
     <lb/>
     single argument in addition to those 
     <lb/>
     contained in the Minute of Council of 
     <lb/>
     the late Government, and which was 
     <lb/>
     presented by the former delegates to 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion Government. The for<lb break="no"/>mer delegates received a memorandum 
     <lb/>
     from the Dominion authorities stating 
     <lb/>
     that their claims were inadmissable, 
     <lb/>
     and the last delegation received a 
     <lb/>
     similiar memorandum, stating the 
     <lb/>
     same thing in a very few words. 
     <lb/>
     When the former delegates found that 
     <lb/>
     they could not obtain the Terms they 
     <lb/>
     asked for, on the grounds they took, 
     <lb/>
     they asked for them in connection with 
     <lb/>
     our lands. We claimed that we 
     <lb/>
     should receive full compensation for 
     <lb/>
     the loss of our Crown lands. Ontario 
     <lb/>
     received a revenue of a million of 
     <lb/>
     dollars per year from her Crown lands, 
     <lb/>
     and it would be unfair that we should 
     <lb/>
     suffer on account of the granting away 
     <lb/>
     of our lands. Under this head we 
     <lb/>
     gained $5000, although we received 
     <lb/>
     $15,000 per year less than the amount 
     <lb/>
     we claimed. In the claims put in by 
     <lb/>
     the last delegation we find them talk 
     <lb/>
     about rotten hemlock wood in our 
     <lb/>
     bridges and wharves. There was 
     <lb/>
     nothing very powerful in that line of 
     <lb/>
     argument. The hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Government stated in this House, be<lb break="no"/>fore the last delegation were appointed, 
     <lb/>
     that unless we received $70,000 per 
     <lb/>
     year in addition to the Terms obtained 
     <lb/>
     by the late Government, the Colony 
     <lb/>
     could not work its way in Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion without resorting to immediate 
     <lb/>
     local taxation ; but the Terms they 
     <lb/>
     have obtained come far short of that 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     amount, and according to his own 
     <lb/>
     argument, we shall still be compelled 
     <lb/>
     to resort to direct local taxation, im<lb break="no"/>mediately after entering the Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     if we accepted the Terms he has 
     <lb/>
     brought down. The last delegates 
     <lb/>
     asked $51 per head of our population, 
     <lb/>
     but obtained only $50 per head, which 
     <lb/>
     shows they were not all powerful with 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion authorities. I wonder 
     <lb/>
     how the Government are going to keep 
     <lb/>
     up a system of mail communication by 
     <lb/>
     inland steamers? Unless they send 
     <lb/>
     the mails regularly by those steamers, 
     <lb/>
     they cannot secure the $10,000 pro<lb break="no"/>mised them for that purpose. The 
     <lb/>
     country was assured that they had 
     <lb/>
     obtained $33,000 in addition to the 
     <lb/>
     Terms brought down by the former 
     <lb/>
     delegates, but that amount has dwindl<lb break="no"/>ed down to $25,500. However, I am 
     <lb/>
     glad that the delegates have gone up 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa, and that the Terms now be<lb break="no"/>fore us have been obtained, as Confed<lb break="no"/>eration will now be supported by both 
     <lb/>
     political parties, with the exception of 
     <lb/>
     the no-Terms men. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     any person could find fault with the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition for opposing the sending 
     <lb/>
     of the last delegation to Ottawa, as 
     <lb/>
     they had no reason for expecting any 
     <lb/>
     additional concessions from the Do<lb break="no"/>minion immediately after the return of 
     <lb/>
     the former delegates from Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     as they had been elected by the people 
     <lb/>
     at the late election to accept the Terms 
     <lb/>
     then before the country. But as bet-<lb break="yes"/>Terms have actually been secured, the 
     <lb/>
     country should be satisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     result of the last delegation. I con<lb break="no"/>sider that the Opposition would have 
     <lb/>
     been guilty of a dereliction of duty, if, 
     <lb/>
     after having been returned to support 
     <lb/>
     the acceptance of the Terms secured 
     <lb/>
     by the late Government, they had not 
     <lb/>
     opposed sending another delegation. 
     <lb/>
     By following the course we then took, 
     <lb/>
     we were doing our duty tol our own 
     <lb/>
     constituents as well as to the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     Government. I sent no telegram to

     Ottawa to endeavor to prevent the 
     <lb/>last delegates from obtaining better<lb/>Terms, not did I, in any way, endea<lb break="no"/>vor to throw any obstacle in their<lb/>way ; but I know that telegrams were<lb/>sent when the former delegation went<lb/>up there to find the effect that we (Messrs.<lb/>Haythorne and Laird) were not to be<lb/>trusted, and those telegrams were pub<lb break="no"/>lished in the Ottawa newspapers at the<lb/>time. I do not blame any member of<lb/>the present Government with sending<lb/>those Telegrams, but somebody sent<lb/>them. We took no such means to in<lb break="no"/>jure the labors of the last delegation ;<lb/>but, at it is well known, such tele<lb break="no"/>grams will, by some means, be sent in<lb/>such cases. The newspapers of this<lb/>Island find their way to the Senate<lb/>Chamber and the House of Commons,<lb/>and while there, I went, upon the<lb/>arrival of every mail, to see them.<lb/>During such times as these, when a<lb/>great question, such as Confederation<lb/>is before the people, the members of the<lb/>Dominion Government are sure to look<lb/>at those papers of both sides of politics.<lb/>I am not at all satisfied with the ex<lb break="no"/>planation of the hon.

They also<lb/>stated that they would not give up the<lb/>New Law Courts to the Dominion<lb/>Government, as required it our<lb break="no"/>selves, but there has been no change<lb/>made by them in this respect. With<lb/>the exception of the $5 per head and<lb/>the grant for telegraph communication,<lb/>the Terms are word for word with<lb/>those obtained by the former delegates.<lb/>At the end of the first memorandum<lb/>there are a dew words said in reference<lb/>to the fisheries, but there is nothing said<lb/>about them afterwards. The former<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
  
     delegation endeavored to press that        
     <lb/>question upon the attention of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government, to a considerable<lb/>extent, but did not succeed. They<lb/>also claimed a grant for the telegraph<lb/>communication, but it was refused.<lb/>We thought the Dominion Government<lb/>should take charge of that matter and<lb/>pay the annual subsidy, but the<lb/>Finance Minister said they did not<lb/>pay for telegraph communication for<lb/>any of the other Provinces, and could<lb/>not promise to do anything for us.<lb/>But they have now done us justice in<lb/>this respect, and will find the telegraph<lb/>almost a necessity for the purpose of<lb/>keeping up a communication between<lb/>the general Government and the Do<lb break="no"/>minion officials. If any accident hap<lb break="no"/>pened to the telegraph, they could not<lb/>communicate with their officers here ;<lb/>they had, therefore, a good right to<lb/>pay the subsidy.

               <lb/>heard a question discussed which re<lb break="no"/>flected upon the whole Government,<lb/>and yet they left the matter to the<lb/>Leader of the Government to defend.<lb/>Any other course would be wearisome<lb/>and attended with so prolonged a discus<lb break="no"/>sion that the public business could not<lb/>be proceeded with. But as the hon.<lb/>member is so anxious that I should<lb/>not give a silent vote, I will favor him<lb/>with a few remarks ; and first I must<lb/>congratulate him on his aptitude as a<lb/>learner, for, as Leader of an Opposition<lb/>he is becoming thoroughly acquainted<lb/>with those facilities which Teinrey<lb/>lays down as a rule when he says, the<lb/>duty of an Opposition is to oppose<lb/>everything which comes from a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment.

Well, the best answer to<lb/>that is : <hi rendition="simple:italic">argumentem ad hominem</hi>, as it<lb/>is an argument which applies to the<lb/>pockets of the people, and they care<lb/>little for those of the ablest speakers<lb/>in comparison with that which bears<lb/>upon their personal welfare. The hon.<lb/>member seems sore because we have<lb/>succeeded so much better than he did,<lb/>and asks upon what basis we received<lb/>more ? Well we got the additional<lb/>$5 a head, upon the same basis as he<lb/>obtained the $45, with this difference,<lb/>that we convinced them by our argu<lb break="no"/>ment that on account of our isolated<lb/>and exceptional condition, we were en<lb break="no"/>titled to more than $45, and yielding<lb/>to the force of this reasoning, when<lb/>taken in connection with the principle<lb/>laid down in the North American Act,<lb/>they allowed us the extra $5 per<lb/>head. The hon. member expressed<lb/>surprise that I went on the delegation.<lb/>Why, Sir, if he is surprised at me for<lb/>going on the delegation, because I said<lb/>I would go for the Terms be hrought<lb/>down, if better could not be obtained,<lb/>I may, with much more reason, ex<lb break="no"/>press my surprise and astonishment,<lb/>that he, who had been pledged himself,<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     against Confederation, and who, 
               <lb/>through the use of the columns of the<lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Patriot</hi> had been the means of having<lb/>other public men pledged, should have<lb/>thought of going on such a mission.<lb/>Who would have thought that a<lb/>gentleman, who, for so many years had<lb/>been comparing Canda to the scarlet<lb/>something,—which was not to be<lb/>trusted—that after all this, he should<lb/>turn round in favor of a union with<lb/>this same country, may well surprise<lb/>any one. That he, the quintessence of<lb/>anti-Confederate sincerity, should so<lb/>suddenly change his views, and in one<lb/>night decide and go to Canada, may<lb/>well astonish the public. Indeed, I<lb/>think the hon, member is surprised<lb/>himself at the suddenness of his con<lb break="no"/>version. But I am glad that he is<lb/>now a Confederate. I am proud to<lb/>know that the good seed of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation has taken root and is thriving so<lb/>well ; and that the hon. member him<lb break="no"/>self is one of the tallest trees which<lb/>this seed has produced. What I said<lb/>at Georgetown was, that sooner than<lb/>that this Island should go into a state<lb/>of bankruptcy, I would go for Mr.<lb/>Laird's Terms, if better could not be<lb/>had. But, says the hon. member, you<lb/>asked for $51 and only got $50.<lb/>Well, even so, is not $50 better than<lb/>$45 ? it is useless to go into this<lb/>question at any length to attempt to<lb/>convince this hon. House of the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages of a union with the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, or that the Terms we received<lb/>are better than Mr. Laird's. Such an<lb/>attempt would be as unnecessary asit<lb/>would be to get up and attempt to<lb/>show to the people of this Island the<lb/>advantages of education. It has now<lb/>become a self-evident proposition, that<lb/>we cannot any longer remain out of<lb/>Confederation. A concession was<lb/>made to us on account of our ice-bound<lb/>position for so many months in the<lb/>year, and also in view of the fact that<lb/>our people had not been accustomed to<lb/>direct taxation, and that if we went in<lb/>under terms which would necessitate<lb/>
            
            <pb n="1873-05-23_Page_174"

     us to resort to this, the people would 
     <lb/>
     be dissatisfied. Perhaps the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member, the Leader of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>
     made use of such arguments too. I do 
     <lb/>
     not doubt but that he did his best, nor 
     <lb/>
     do I doubt either. but that he approves 
     <lb/>
     of all we did. I am inclined to think 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member is only joking. The 
     <lb/>
     question, however, is important. So, 
     <lb/>
     also, is the crisis which has arrived in 
     <lb/>
     our history. It is one which, in the 
     <lb/>
     decision we may arrive at, will affect 
     <lb/>
     us for weal or woe for all time; there<lb break="no"/>fore, it is important. Unless we ac<lb break="no"/>cept the Terms now before us and go 
     <lb/>
     into Confederation, it will be utterly 
     <lb/>
     impossible, with the large debt now 
     <lb/>
     thrown upon us, to float our Deben<lb break="no"/>tures, and establish our public credit. 
     <lb/>
     If we go in we will be better off. The 
     <lb/>
     taxation will be less, and I believe, 
     <lb/>
     hope and trust. that when we go into 
     <lb/>
     Committee that a resolution will be 
     <lb/>
     agreedto which will be forwarded to 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty, together with an Ad<lb break="no"/>dress, which will enable us forth with 
     <lb/>
     to become a part of the great Do<lb break="no"/>minion of Canada. It would be to our 
     <lb/>
     advantage that we should go in before 
     <lb/>
     the 1st of July. That is the time when 
     <lb/>
     the financial year begins, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, in many ways it would be to our 
     <lb/>
     advantage. We will receive our half 
     <lb/>
     yearly allowance in advance, which as 
     <lb/>
     a matter of course will facilitate the 
     <lb/>
     public business of the Island. As his 
     <lb/>
     honor the Leader of the Government. 
     <lb/>
     has stated, Canada has done her part. 
     <lb/>
     We have to do ours when all that 
     <lb/>
     will be required will he to agree upon 
     <lb/>
     an Address to the Queen, asking Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty to have this Island united 
     <lb/>
     with the Dominion, in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the Terms of the North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     Hence, as Mr. Tilley says, if we wish 
     <lb/>
     to go in by the 1st of July, we know 
     <lb/>
     what we have to do. The hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber said, when he and his friend were 
     <lb/>
     up there, they did all in their power 
     <lb/>
     to get the Dominion to relieve us of   
     <lb/>
     the subsidy paid to the Telegraph 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     Company. That they did so, I do not 
     <lb/>
     for a moment doubt. But we showed 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Minister of Canada that 
     <lb/>
     by the Teams of the North American 
     <lb/>
     Act, the general Government is bound 
     <lb/>
     to keep up all Telegraph communica<lb break="no"/>tion between the Provinces in the 
     <lb/>
     Union. He became convinced of the 
     <lb/>
     reasonableness and justness of the plea, 
     <lb/>
     and when he saw it in that light, con<lb break="no"/>sented at once to allow it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI2">Hon. B. DAVIES</persName>.—Mr. Speaker, as 
     <lb/>
    I have no wish that we should go to 
     <lb/>Canada in the position of mendicants, 
     <lb/>I contend we have a right to be told 
     <lb/>what the basis is upon which the $50 
     <lb/>per head has been obtained. As we 
     <lb/>are about to enter the Dominion, it is 
     <lb/>a matter of importance for us to know 
     <lb/>how she spends her money, therefore, 
     <lb/>there must be some reason upon which 
     <lb/>this extra amount has been based. We 
     <lb/>should know why it is given. If a 
     <lb/>proportionate allowance, on a re-<lb break="yes"/>adjustment of the debt of the Colonies, 
     <lb/>is to be made to the other Provinces, 
     <lb/>it amounts to an extra additional debt 
     <lb/>of twenty millions dollars. And if so, 
     <lb/>I do not think they would think of un<lb break="no"/>dertaking such an outlay without mak<lb break="no"/>ing it known to the delegates. When 
     <lb/>the delegates are so unwilling to com<lb break="no"/>municate fuller information to this 
     <lb/>House, on this subject, I am inclined 
     <lb/>to suppose that they probably obtained 
     <lb/>it by importunity. I do not see, Sir, 
     <lb/>that we can arrive at any other con<lb break="no"/>clusion. The Canadian Government 
     <lb/>was satisfied they offered to the late 
     <lb/>delegates all we were entitled to ; and 
     <lb/>it appears to me that the late delegates, 
     <lb/>on account of the late Government 
     <lb/>being defeated on the floor of this 
     <lb/>House, took advantage of that fact to 
     <lb/>persuade the Privy Council of Canada, 
     <lb/>that unless an additional allowance 
     <lb/>was granted, this Island would not 
     <lb/>enter the Dominion. Now, if such 
     <lb/>were the arguments resorted to, to 
     <lb/>obtain this, they were dishonorable. 
     <lb/>

     It was wrong to beg money of them 
     <lb/>
     in this way. It is. due to the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion and also to the supporters of the 
     <lb/>
     Government in this House, to explain 
     <lb/>
     how this extra allowance was obtained, 
     <lb/>
     and upon what principle it was grant<lb break="no"/>ed. But as they took such care, by 
     <lb/>
     the resolution they carried before they 
     <lb/>
     went, to have every man bound by its 
     <lb/>
     construction to vote for the Terms they 
     <lb/>
     would bring down. they feel in<lb break="no"/>dependent of this side of the House in 
     <lb/>
     this matter; knowing as they do, 
     <lb/>
     thatno hon. member of this hon. House, 
     <lb/>
     would, for a moment, think of being so 
     <lb/>
     dishonorable as to vote against the 
     <lb/>
     Terms brought down, after having 
     <lb/>
     supported the resolution upon which 
     <lb/>
     the delegates was appointed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The motion was then put and agreed 
     <lb/>
     to when the House resolved itself into 
     <lb/>
     a Committee of the whole House, for 
     <lb/>
     the further consideration of the Re<lb break="no"/>port.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAIR2">MR. LAIRD</persName> said the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment laid the telegrams before the 
     <lb/>
     Home, which passed between the 
     <lb/>
     delegates and the Government when 
     <lb/>
     they were in Canada, and maintained 
     <lb/>
     that the telegrams which passed be<lb break="no"/>tween the present delegates and the 
     <lb/>
     Government should have been laid 
     <lb/>
     upon the table of the House consecu<lb break="no"/>tively with the other correspondence. 
     <lb/>
     It was said that the addition to the 
     <lb/>
     Haythorne and Laird Terms was 
     <lb/>
     $33,000 in excess of those brought 
     <lb/>
     down by the delegates of the late 
     <lb/>
     Government. It is fair to enquire 
     <lb/>
     what has become of the balance? 
     <lb/>
    Perhaps it has been used for some pur<lb break="no"/>pose.which the telegram, respecting the 
     <lb/>$10,000 which fell so heavily upon 
     <lb/>some poor man's head, might explain. 
     <lb/>Why, the Committee should report 
     <lb/>progress and gather up the fragments 
     <lb/>which constitute the remaining $1,500, 
     <lb/>in order that nothing might be lost. 
     <lb/>

     Besides, it is not fair to this hon. 
     <lb/>
     Committee that any information should 
     <lb/>
     be withheld. In the speech of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman, the Leader of the

     <lb/>
     that we were entitled to receive $70,<lb break="no"/>000 in addition to the previous Terms.

           or a trifle more than half what they<lb/>claimed. But he supposed they went<lb/>on the principle that it was better to<lb/>take half a loaf than starve. He<lb/>thought he heard the hon. Leader of<lb/>the Government state the other night<lb/>that he was always convinced that if<lb/>the real friends of the Dominion went<lb/>up to Ottawa, they would obtain better<lb/>Terms than others could. But who<lb/>are the real friends of union ? What<lb break="no"/>ever may be said of some, he knew<lb/>the record of the hon. member for<lb/>Tignish was not very bright on that<lb/>question. The hon. member quoted<lb/>history largely, in the past, to show<lb/>the evils which Confederation would<lb/>entail upon our Island. He felt sur<lb break="no"/>prised the learned Colonial Secretary<lb/>should have been so silent. Perhaps<lb/>he always felt that the Railway would<lb/>impose too heavy a burden upon the<lb/>Colony, and saw that it would bring<lb/>about that union with Canada which<lb/>he so much desired. Had it not been<lb/>for the exertions of the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and their friends, the Hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber the Leader of the Government<lb/>and his friends could never have car<lb break="no"/>ried Confederation. And if they had<lb/>any true gratitude they would erect<lb/>over our political graves a monument<lb/>as high as the Pyramids of Egypt.<lb/>(Laughter.) The record of the other<lb/>two delegates is somewhat more favor<lb break="no"/>able than that of the hon. member<lb/>from Tignish. But at one time, viz.,<lb/>when the Terms of 1867 came down,<lb/>the learned Attorney General was re<lb break="no"/>garded as somewhat heretical in his<lb/>views. It would be tedious to go<lb/>through the course some of them have<lb/>pursued, but in the meantime it was<lb/>obvious that truth was stranger than<lb/>fiction. If he had written and spoken<lb/>against Confederation, it could be<lb/>shown that from the first, up to the<lb/>present moment, he never deceived<lb/>any one. The hon. Col. Secreatry,<lb/>according to his speech on Declaration<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           day at Georgetown, would rather take<lb/>the Haythorne-Laird Terms than have<lb/>none at all. But why the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man should have consented to throw<lb/>these into the teeth of Canada, he<lb/>could not understand. Probably, on<lb/>that occasion, the hon. gentleman wax<lb break="no"/>ed more eloquent than wise. For his<lb/>(Mr. L.) part, he thought that even<lb/>then he would rather have the Quebec<lb/>Terms, those of 1869, or the Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne-Laird Terms, than remain out<lb break="no"/>side. So desirous has the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber ever been to have a Dominion<lb/>horse, that he would rather have a<lb/>spavined one than none at all. But<lb/>the truth was, nothing taking place<lb/>now in regard to politics, should as<lb break="no"/>tonish any one.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SINC6">MR. SINCLAIR</persName> was pleased  with the 
     <lb/>
     Terms, but thought the information  
     <lb/>
     brought down was not as full and ex<lb break="no"/>plicit as it should be. It was tele<lb break="no"/>graphed down to the Government that 
     <lb/>
     $33,000 had been obtained. Now it 
     <lb/>
     turns out there are but $25,500.  The 
     <lb/>
     late Government was charged with 
     <lb/>
     having mutilated the Terms secured 
     <lb/>
     by their delegates.  But no one ever 
     <lb/>
     charged them with boasting of having 
     <lb/>
     received more than they said they had 
     <lb/>
     obtained. With respect  to what they 
     <lb/>have secured, no basis has been shown 
     <lb/>for a single dollar,  except what was 
     <lb/>secured for the telegraph line, and the 
     <lb/>late Government were  told we had a 
     <lb/>right to that, and he had no doubt but 
     <lb/>that it would have been received. 
     <lb/>This only seems to have been asked 
     <lb/>for upon a certain basis.  If the $50   
     <lb/>per head has been granted upon the 
     <lb/>  principle that a re-adjustment of the 
     <lb/>debt of the other Provinces is to take 
     <lb/>place, then they have received  nothing 
     <lb/>more in that particular than we would 
     <lb/>receive when that re-adjustment  takes 
     <lb/>place. They said at one time, some 
     <lb/>of them at least, that they were will<lb break="no"/>ing to accept the Terms of 1869. But

     the late Government asked  and re<lb break="no"/>ceived far better than those  of that 
     <lb/>
    year. They asked   for more than the   
     <lb/>present delegates did.     The late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, in a Minute of Council, agreed 
     <lb/> to ask   for $5,000 on account of  the 
     <lb/> increased expense of legislation, and  
     <lb/>their request was acceded to. What 
     <lb/>have the last delegates asked   for ? 
     <lb/>Just think of it, a branch of Railroad 
     <lb/>from Port Hill to Egmont Bay.  Well, 
     <lb/>he could hardly think that they 
     <lb/>thought that request would be  granted 
     <lb/>though they did ask for it. Before 
     <lb/>they went up,  they coutended that the 
     <lb/>land upon which the new Post Office 
     <lb/>stands should be paid for. Now we 
     <lb/>do not hear a word about it. Nothing 
     <lb/>less would do them than  $70,000. If, 
     <lb/>when they put in that claim, they 
     <lb/>were sincere, they were not justified  
     <lb/>in closing for $25,00.  If this sum 
     <lb/>was obtained as payment for the land 
     <lb/>upon which the Post Office stands, for 
     <lb/>the Barracks, Drill Sheds, &amp;c., then it 
     <lb/>would be a gain ; but if on the basis of 
     <lb/>a re-adjustment of the Colonies, why 
     <lb/>there is no gain at all.  He was sur<lb break="no"/>prised that when they went up  to 
     <lb/>Ottawa, they did not at once put in a 
     <lb/>claim for all the specified objects  of 
     <lb/>which they spoke before they went. If 
     <lb/>this extra allowance has been on the 
     <lb/>basis of the re-adjustmeut of the debt 
     <lb/>of the Colonies,  for the Drill Sheds, 
     <lb/>&amp;c., and if it is only because the other 
     <lb/>Colonies are to receive a certain 
     <lb/>amount, then it will all come out of 
     <lb/>the Dominion Exchequer, and in the 
     <lb/>end, we will  have to pay our full share 
     <lb/>of it.  The delegates have not shown 
     <lb/>that we have any right to the extra  
     <lb/>allowance granted. We have a right 
     <lb/>to know whether  it is a free favor  or 
     <lb/>an allowance based upon a legitimate    
     <lb/>claim.  If we are to have it as  a free  
     <lb/>favor, it is as well to make it known. 
     <lb/>He (Mr. S.) would like to know also 
     <lb/>whether anything has been obtained 
     <lb/>for education ?  We have reason to 
     <lb/>assume and to believe that the Terms 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     telegraphed down were correct. If    so, 
     <lb/>
      $33,000 is what has been gained ? 
     <lb/>
      What has become of the balance ? It   
     <lb/>
    is due  to the House to show the  basis 
     <lb/>upon which it has been received. He  
     <lb/>found that  the press of the  Dominion, 
     <lb/> in the interest of  Sir John's Cabinet, 
     <lb/>say the other Provinces are  to have 
     <lb/>the same advantages extended to them.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. Mr. POPE</persName> said, the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber said he was pleased with  the 
     <lb/>
     Terms, and then endeavored to show 
     <lb/>
     that they were no better than those 
     <lb/>
     brought down by  Messrs. Laird and 
     <lb/>
     Haythorne. The hon. member must  
     <lb/>
     have known that his statement had 
     <lb/>
     no foundation to rest upon. He (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     P.) cannot look upon the statement 
     <lb/>
     of the hon.member  as being  made 
     <lb/>
     for any other purpose than that of 
     <lb/>
     deceiving the  country. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member knew full well that the 
     <lb/>
     extra $5,  obtained by  the late dele<lb break="no"/>gates, was not obtained because of the 
     <lb/>
      re-adjustment of the debt of the other  
     <lb/>
     Provinces. No such a consideration  
     <lb/>
     was thought of.  In so far as the tele<lb break="no"/>grams go, the hon. member is welcome 
     <lb/>
     to make what use of  them he pleases. 
     <lb/>
     We have obtained a clear gain over 
     <lb/>
     the Laird-Haythorne Terms of $25<lb break="no"/>500. There are also many other con<lb break="no"/>cessions promised, all of which will  be 
     <lb/>
     fulfilled, which would have justified  
     <lb/>
     the delegates in saying  they had re<lb break="no"/>ceived concessions equivalent to $40,<lb break="no"/>000 over the Laird-Haythorne  Terms. 
     <lb/>
      True, for some of these the delegates have 
     <lb/>
     but the assurance of the Privy Council, 
     <lb/>
     but when such a Government as that 
     <lb/>
     of Canada will guarantee that it will 
     <lb/>
     be all right, that $10,000  will be ex<lb break="no"/>pended in connection with the inland 
     <lb/>
     mail service, are we to suppose they 
     <lb/>will not fulfill their promise ? Again, 
     <lb/>in the Dominion Act, they are not 
     <lb/>bound to take wharves, but they have 
     <lb/>given us the assurance that they  will 
     <lb/>send an Engineer to report upon the 
     <lb/>property of the Dominion, or what

     will become such, and he (Mr. P.) 
     <lb/>thought all that might be safety esti<lb break="no"/>mated at $10,000 ; and he contended<lb/>still that the whole may fairly be re<lb break="no"/>garded as equal to $40,000. He did<lb/>not say it was that much, but he be<lb break="no"/>lieved it to be such. He thought the<lb/>hon. member for New London was<lb/>not only striving to deceive the coun<lb break="no"/>try, but the Committee also. With<lb/>respect to the new Post Office, why,<lb/>we left that as it had been fixed by the<lb/>delegates who preceded us, but he,<lb/>for one, would not think of calling<lb/>that a bargain. The building cost the<lb/>money, while the land it stood upon,<lb/>with what will be given with it, was<lb/>worth £4,000 or £5,000. Under any<lb/>circumstances it was simply selling a<lb/>building for what it was worth. We<lb/>took the ground that we were entitled<lb/>to all that was included in the Terms<lb/>of 1869, and also that they should<lb/>take our Railway and assume its debt<lb/>on account of our isolated position as a<lb/>Colony. Our isolation, and excep<lb break="no"/>tional condition for so many months in<lb/>the year was the reason, when the<lb/>matter was urged upon them, why<lb/>our allowance was increased above<lb/>that allowed to the former delegates.<lb/>We said that we felt we would have<lb/>no right to ask for concessions not<lb/>made to the other Provinces but for<lb/>these reasons viz., our isolation, &amp;c.,<lb/>and having told them that our peo<lb break="no"/>ple would not consent to go in at<lb/>all unless we could receive enough to<lb/>enable us to carry on the local Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment without having to resort to<lb/>direct taxation. We are as independ<lb break="no"/>ent as any of the Provinces, and there<lb/>is nothing to compel us to go in. Place<lb/>us in as good a position as we are<lb/>present, our people will be much more<lb/>contented. We have no lands or<lb/>minerals to fall back upon. Such were<lb/>the arguments we used. Although he<lb/>gave the ministry at Ottawa credit for<lb/>being willing to do the best they could<lb/>for us, yet he (Mr. P.) felt certain<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     
     they felt themselves hampered, owing          
     <lb/>to the statements made by them to the<lb/>former delegates. Had the late dele<lb break="no"/>gates not been preceded by Messrs.<lb/>Laird and Haythorne, he (Mr. P.)<lb/>felt quite convinced that there would<lb/>have been no difficulty whatever in<lb/>arranging for Terms much more favor<lb break="no"/>able than he had been obtained.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SINC6">Mr. SINCLAIR</persName> still contended there<lb/>is no basis given for the extra $5 per<lb/>head. He also believed that it had<lb/>been telegraphed down that $33,000<lb/>had been secured in addition to what<lb/>was obtained by Messrs. Laird and<lb/>Haythorne.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HAVI1">Hon. Mr. HAVILAND</persName> wished to<lb/>know if it had been telegraphed down<lb/>that $33,000 had been secured in ad<lb break="no"/>dition in cash ?<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SINC6">Mr. SINCLAIR</persName> thought that answer<lb/>would not do. There is no guarantee<lb/>for any amount save $25,500. The<lb/>late Government was charged with<lb/>making statements which were not<lb/>correct. But here is a Government<lb/>whose delegates telegraphed that $33,<lb break="no"/>000 had been secured, and when the<lb/>guarantee for this is asked for, we are<lb/>told they have the assurance of the<lb/>Dominion Government. The late<lb/>Government had the same, but they<lb/>did not include such in the Terms.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BREC1">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>, (Mr.<lb/>Brecken) said the hon. member the<lb/>Leader of the Opposition made allu<lb break="no"/>sion to his (Hon. Atty.

But the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber should recollect that the resolution<lb/>placed upon the table of the<lb/>House was too strong. That, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to it, if the Dominion Government<lb/>were to agree to offer Terms which<lb/>

     would literally pave our streets with 
     <lb/>gold, yet according to that resolution<lb/>we could not accept them. Besides, at<lb/>that time he felt disposed to look upon<lb/>it as a Colonial, rather than an Im<lb break="no"/>perial question. He, therefore, con<lb break="no"/>sidered it his duty to act as he did<lb/>in the matter, and believed he did right.<lb/>But in 1869, when the Terms came<lb/>down, he knew that there were quite a<lb/>number in the Island who said that if a<lb/>Railroad from Charlottetown to Sum<lb break="no"/>merside had been added to the Terms,<lb/>and the building thereof guaranteed<lb/>within a reasonable time, they would<lb/>have been willing that the Terms<lb/>should have been accepted and when<lb/>the delegates from the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment declared, in a Minute of<lb/>Council, that the Terms would be<lb/>favorably considered if supplemented<lb/>by a Railway. He was one of those,<lb/>who, at that time favored this view of<lb/>the matter, believing as he did that<lb/>Confederation would, on Terms just to<lb/>this Island, ultimately prove beneficial<lb/>to this Colony. Yet the Opposition<lb/>have the hardihood to charge Mr.<lb/>Pope's Government with passing the<lb/>Railway Bill for the purpose of bring<lb break="no"/>ing this Island into Confederation,<lb/>than which nothing can be further from<lb/>the truth. As to the hon. member,<lb/>the junior member for Belfast, as an<lb/>anti-Confederate, he stood head and<lb/>shoulders above any other man in the<lb/>colony, and when he undertook the<lb/>mission to Ottawa, as a delegate, he<lb/>removed every objection which the<lb/>anti-Confederate party on the Island<lb/>had to a union with Canada. But<lb/>the hon. member says he is now a<lb/>Confederate from necessity and not<lb/>from choice. Well, how far that is so,<lb/>after all that the late Government did<lb/>to forward a union of this Island with<lb/>Canada, forms matter for reflection, if<lb/>not of doubt. But for his (hon. Atty.<lb/>General) part, he could truly say he<lb/>was a Confederate from choice. If the<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     hon. member is sincere, then before 
     <lb/>
     going up as a delegate to seek for 
     <lb/>
     Terms of union with Canada, he 
     <lb/>
     should have put forth every effort to 
     <lb/>
     enable the Island to retain its political 
     <lb/>
     independence. He should have 
     <lb/>
     thought of the time when he published 
     <lb/>
     to the world that he saw, in our union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada, the subjugation of our 
     <lb/>
     independence. When every family 
     <lb/>
     was to be taxed, and when burdens so 
     <lb/>
     weighty and so grievous would be im<lb break="no"/>posed upon the men, women and 
     <lb/>
     children in the Colony. If, however, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member has seen that he was 
     <lb/>
     then in the dark, and had been labor<lb break="no"/>ing under a delusion, then he should 
     <lb/>
     come over and shake hands with every 
     <lb/>
     Confederate on the Government side 
     <lb/>
     of the House. If he is sincere in 
     <lb/>
     what he says, and is in favor of union 
     <lb/>
     from necessity, rather than choice, he 
     <lb/>
     should have left no stone unturned to 
     <lb/>
     prevent so dire a calamity falling upon 
     <lb/>
     our people. But what does the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member mean when he speaks about 
     <lb/>
     consulting our independence? He 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. B.) feared he did not go up to 
     <lb/>
     Canada as a loyal Confederate. He 
     <lb/>
     was afraid his loyalty pointed more to 
     <lb/>
     the political larder of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     than to the principles embodied in 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, either as a Colonial or 
     <lb/>
     Imperial question. The hon. member, 
     <lb/>
     in the course of his remarks, was severe 
     <lb/>
     upon the hon. member for Alberton, 
     <lb/>
     because he had, at one time, been an 
     <lb/>
     anti-Confederate. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     seemed to think hon. Mr. Howlan 
     <lb/>
     should not, therefore, have gone up as 
     <lb/>
     a delegate. The conduct of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Alberton was quite legi<lb break="no"/>timate and consistent, but such could 
     <lb/>
     not be truthfully said of the political 
     <lb/>
     career of the junior member for Belfast. 
     <lb/>
     Had Mr. Pope's Government sent off 
     <lb/>
     a delegation at the dead of night, how 
     <lb/>
               soon would the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Patriot"</hi> have sounded 
     <lb/>
     the Toscin. Everything would have 
     <lb/>
     been tortured to suit his purpose, and

     pictured forth to the detriment of Mr.

     Pope and his friends. His hon. friend 
     <lb/>from Alberton had a perfect right to go<lb/>up as a delegate to Ottawa. Had the<lb/>late delegates not gone up, this Island<lb/>would be annually minus $25,500 less<lb/>than it will now receive. Will the<lb/>hon. member for New London say he<lb/>would rather it was ? No doubt they<lb/>would have been glad if the delegates<lb/>had returned without obtaining an ad<lb break="no"/>ditional dollar. It is time the country<lb/>saw and understood the loyalty of the<lb/>Opposition, and the great interest they<lb/>feel in the welfare of the Island. Just<lb/>look at the resolution moved by the<lb/>Opposition before the delegates went<lb/>up, and contrast it with what has been<lb/>said by the hon. member for New<lb/>London. It is clear if he had his own<lb/>way we would have been annually<lb/>poorer by $25,500 than we will now<lb/>be. But he is anxious about those<lb/>telegrams. Well, he (Mr. B.) received<lb/>one which stated that what had been<lb/>obtained might be placed at $30,000.<lb/>and another that it amounted to $33,000.<lb/>Nor had he (Mr. B.) any hesitation<lb/>in saying that in what has been se<lb break="no"/>cured in cash, and what has been pro<lb break="no"/>mised for other purposes, that amount<lb/>is under, rather than over what has<lb/>been secured.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BREC1">Hon. Mr. BRECKEN</persName>.—Does the<lb/>hon. member mean to insinuate that<lb/>so little faith is to be placed in the<lb/>word of Canadian Ministers ? He felt<lb/>astonished at the remark. Why a few<lb/>weeks ago he was wishing to place<lb/>our destinies in their hands. If he<lb/>could trust them in a great matter,<lb/>surely he can do so in a small. He<lb/>thought the Leader of the Opposition<lb/>had great influence over his followers.<lb/>He can do with them as he pleases.<lb/>The hon. member told us that we gave<lb/>expression to statements which were<lb/>not in accordance with the fact. This <lb/>he (Mr. B.) denied. And if the ex<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
           pression of Mr. Pope and his friends 
     <lb/>manifested some feeling, it is proper<lb/>to recollect that last year they were<lb/>there politically hand-cuffed, nor had<lb/>the hon. member and his friends the<lb/>manliness or candor to enquire if we<lb/>had a right to wear them, or honor<lb break="no"/>ably to remove them. It was on that<lb/>account we spoke warmly. But the<lb/>country has nobly done what they had<lb/>not the magnanimity to do. The hon.<lb/>member may say he was not then<lb/>in the Government, but if he was not,<lb/>he had a very good idea of what was<lb/>going on. Why, to see the apostle of<lb/>all the anti-Confederates going on a<lb/>mission to Ottawa, was indeed a sight<lb/>worth seeing. In the name of com<lb break="no"/>mon sense who sent him up to Canada ?<lb/>He still represents an anti-Confederate<lb/>constituency ; yet without consulting<lb/>them he started off at the hour of mid<lb break="no"/>night to put this Island into the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. Could the conduct of a public<lb/>man be more unscrupulous ? Then<lb/>again there is the hon. member for<lb/>New London, very likely it took three<lb/>or four months to feed him up so that<lb/>his political strength would enable him<lb/>to mount the Confederate political hust<lb break="no"/>ings. But judging from that " dash<lb break="no"/>away " letter of his, when he did so,<lb/>he went about it quite vigorously. He<lb/>first favored the opening up of a cor<lb break="no"/>respondence with the Dominion, and<lb/>then gave his free consent for the dele<lb break="no"/>gation to proceed at midnight to Otta<lb break="no"/>wa. Well, considering the anteced<lb break="no"/>dents of the hon. member, it must be<lb/>admitted that the hon. Leader of the<lb/>Opposition did most effectually suc<lb break="no"/>ceed in converting the hon. member<lb/>for New London over to his views.<lb/>Yet he was willing to admit that the<lb/>course adopted by the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, was constitutionally correct,<lb/>though on other grounds it was not<lb/>consistent. But for the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to say they treated the people<lb/>with consideration in the matter, was<lb/>what they could not say and confine<lb/>
           
           <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">181</fw>
           
           themselves to statements consistent<lb/>with the fact. He did not believe the<lb/>late Government were defeated upon<lb/>the Terms brought down. The coun<lb break="no"/>try was flooded with an array of<lb/>figures which they did not understand,<lb/>but they were defeated upon their own<lb/>record. Had the late delegates re<lb break="no"/>turned without obtaining any addi<lb break="no"/>tional concessions, they would only<lb/>have been laughed at. We have,<lb/>however, secured the best Terms, and<lb/>if any re-arrangement for the re-adjust<lb break="no"/>ment of the debt of the Provinces<lb/>shall take place, we will come in for<lb/>our share. Although the hon. member<lb/>the Leader of the Opposition is a Con<lb break="no"/>federate from necessity, yet he (Mr.<lb/>B.) cannot but congratulate him on the<lb/>service he has rendered to the Con<lb break="no"/>federate cause.<lb/></p>

     It is an easy matter for politicians to 
     <lb/>give fine promises, but it is another<lb/>matter for them to fulfill them. I have <lb/>not the slightest doubt that members<lb/>of the present Government made many<lb/>promises before the late election, which<lb/>they now find they cannot carry into<lb/>execution, and it may prove to be the<lb/>same with the Dominion Government<lb/>in reference to the promises they made<lb/>to the last delegation. The former<lb/>delegation received similar assurances,<lb/>but I did not consider them of much<lb/>account. It may be the intention of<lb/>the Dominion Government to carry<lb/>out the promises they have made, but<lb/>when they place their resolution be<lb break="no"/>fore the House of Commons, the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of that body will ask them why<lb/>they wish to grant a sum for steam<lb/>communication for P. E. Island when<lb/>they withhold a similar grant from<lb/>the other Provinces ? Nova Scotia<lb/>has her large rivers upon which there<lb/>are steamboats running by the dozen,<lb/>and so has New Brunswick. If we<lb/>receive the promised grant, those Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces will demand the same upon<lb/>similar grounds. The Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment never undertook to sustain the<lb/>steam communication of the several<lb/>Provinces, and I would like to know<lb/>how a grant for that purpose can be<lb/>conceded to this Island. The former<lb/>delegates obtained precisely similar<lb/>promises, but they did not boast of<lb/>what they received from the Dominion<lb/>Government in that way. They did<lb/>not send down anything in the tele<lb break="no"/>grams except what was contained in<lb/>the written Terms, because they knew<lb/>that those alone could be depended<lb/>upon. We already have the written<lb/>assurance, obtained by the former dele<lb break="no"/>gates, that the Island shall receive a<lb/>fair proportion from the Dominion for<lb/>public works, in the $45 per head.<lb/>As far as mere promises are concerned<lb/>they are of no account whatever. The<lb/>Dominion Government may be well<lb/>intentioned, but they may find that<lb/>their supporters may not bear them<lb/>

          out in those promises, and beside this,<lb/>the men in power to-day may not be<lb/>the men in power to-morrow. We<lb/>know that a few days ago, there was<lb/>an adverse vote in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons to the Government, and that<lb/>the Dominion Ministry may soon be<lb/>among the things that were. The<lb/>hon. member for New London was,<lb/>therefore, perfectly justified in saying<lb/>that the Terms brought down by the<lb/>last delegates did not contain more<lb/>than $25,500 in addition to the pre<lb break="no"/>vious Terms. I wonder that business<lb/>men would telegraph a statement from<lb/>Ottawa to the effect that they had re<lb break="no"/>ceived $33,000 in addition to the<lb/>Terms obtained by the former delega<lb break="no"/>tion, when they knew it was partly<lb/>founded on mere promises. They had<lb/>a right to state what Terms had been<lb/>obtained in black and white, but noth<lb break="no"/>ing further, as to make a statement on<lb/>mere promises would be an attempt<lb/>to deceive the country. The figures<lb/>telegraphed down by Mr. Haythorne<lb/>and myself, stood the most searching<lb/>investigation, and were borne out by<lb/>the Minutes of the Executive Council,<lb/>laid on the table of this House. The<lb/>hon, member for Alberton is astonished<lb/>beyond measure that I should become<lb/>a delegate to Ottawa, after having<lb/>done so much for years past to oppose<lb/>Confederation. I can tell that hon.<lb/>member that my going upon that<lb/>delegation, and in conjunction with<lb/>my co-delegate, obtained the hand<lb break="no"/>some Terms we brought back, was the<lb/>proudest action of my life. What I<lb/>then did, was done conscientiously, and<lb/>the Terms we secured was one of the<lb/>greatest boons ever secured to this<lb/>Colony. If it had not been for my<lb/>opposition to Confederation in years<lb/>gone by, we would to-day have the old<lb/>spavined horse with the hon. Col.<lb/>Secretary was willing to accept, and<lb/>with that old horse we would now be<lb/>limping and hobbling along. The<lb/>eighty cents per head, and the debt<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     equivalent, were all that were granted 
     <lb/>under the Quebec Scheme, and I am<lb/>to-day proud that I opposed that<lb/>scheme. The Better Terms of 1869<lb/>I also opposed, and I am glad I did<lb/>so, as the Terms secured by the for<lb break="no"/>mer delegation were $14,000 better<lb/>than they were. Any pledge which I<lb/>have given to my constituents, I have<lb/>kept in good faith. I went to Ottawa<lb/>merely upon a mission of inquiry, for<lb/>the purpose of ascertaining what<lb/>Terms could be obtained from the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. I never appended my name<lb/>to any document, pledging myself to<lb/>accept the Terms we brought down.<lb/>The first statement I made in favor of<lb/>accepting those Terms, was at a public<lb/>meeting held in the Market Hall,<lb/>Charlottetown, before the late election,<lb/>when I said that if returned by the<lb/>people to the House of Assembly, I<lb/>was prepared to accept the Terms<lb/>then offered. The hon. member for<lb/>Charlottetown, (Mr. Brecken) became<lb/>an ardent Confederate upon the better<lb/>Terms of 1869, although he had been<lb/>pledged at his nomination to oppose<lb/>Confederation, and night after night,<lb/>during the session of 1870, this Hall<lb/>re-echoed with his elegant voice while<lb/>be descanted upon the glories of the<lb/>great Dominion, and the blessings that<lb/>would flow from our acceptance of the<lb/>Terms then offered us. He then de<lb break="no"/>clared that our liberties would not be<lb/>impaired by casting in our lot with<lb/>Canada, and that it was useless on our<lb/>part to oppose Confederation, as it was<lb/>inevitable ; yet he now declares that<lb/>in taking that course, he only did his<lb/>duty ! After his re-election, he ob<lb break="no"/>tained absolution for all his political<lb/>sins, but in his opinion there was no<lb/>pardon for me, as my course was so<lb/>entirely different from his ! Before<lb/>the first delegation started for Ottawa,<lb/>our financial prospects were anything<lb/>but bright. Our debt had been run<lb/>up to a very large amount, and as a<lb/>natural consequence, our debentures<lb/>
           
          
           
     <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">183</fw> 

          
     going down below par. The late 
     <lb/>Government found it extremely diffi<lb break="no"/>cult to negotiate the sale of the Land<lb/>Damage Debentures at par, and I be<lb break="no"/>lieve the present Government have<lb/>had some experience of the same<lb/>trouble. Did the Government sell<lb/>the Debentures in order to pay the<lb/>note held by the Maritime Bank of<lb/>New Brunswick? No, they took the<lb/>money out of the treasury, contrary<lb/>to the principles of the Railway Bill,<lb/>for that purpose. I thought we should<lb/>look at our real position, and then<lb/>adopt the best plan that could be de<lb break="no"/>vised to relieve the Colony from its<lb/>financial difficulties. I broke no pledge<lb/>and gave Confederation no public<lb/>advocacy, until there were Terms be<lb break="no"/>fore the people, which, under our then<lb/>existing circumstances, I considered it<lb/>my duty to accept. All we promised<lb/>the Dominion to do, was to lay the<lb/>Terms offered us before the country at<lb/>a general election ; we were not<lb/>pledged to accept them, and there is<lb/>no record to show that we were bound<lb/>in any way to do so. The first dele<lb break="no"/>gates asked the Dominion for an allow<lb break="no"/>ance of $58 per head of our popula<lb break="no"/>tion, but obtained only $45 per head,<lb/>so that they did not lose for want of<lb/>asking and pressing their claims. A<lb/>great deal has been said in reference<lb/>to the Revenue received by the other<lb/>Provinces from their Crown lands.<lb/>When the first delegates to Ottawa<lb/>found they could not obtain any addi<lb break="no"/>tion to the $45 per head, they took up<lb/>the land argument more strongly, and<lb/>said that this Colony should receive<lb/>an additional allowance on account of<lb/>the loss of our lands. On this ground<lb/>they secured $5000 annually, in addi<lb break="no"/>tion to the amount formerly granted.<lb/>If the additional Terms, brought down<lb/>by the last delegation, were obtained<lb/>upon the same basis, the $800,000<lb/>would be increased to $1,200,000.<lb/>But, the hon. member for Georgetown<lb/>declares that the isolated and excep<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     tional position of Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island was the argument upon which 
     <lb/>
     the increase was obtained. That was 
     <lb/>
     something new certainly ! The rea<lb break="no"/>son the last delegation secured the $5 
     <lb/>
     per head extra, was because P. E. 
     <lb/>
     Island is really an Island !  Why did 
     <lb/>
     they not tell the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that there was ice on the north 
     <lb/>
     side of this Island up to the first of 
     <lb/>
     June, and that Tignish Run was jam<lb break="no"/>med full of ice up to the same date? 
     <lb/>
     There is not a word in their memoran<lb break="no"/>dums about the little Summerside 
     <lb/>
     Lighthouse, and some others, or about 
     <lb/>
     the Drill Sheds! The rotten hem<lb break="no"/>lock argument did not secure the in<lb break="no"/>creased allowance; there must have 
     <lb/>
     been some other reasons put forward, 
     <lb/>
     which have not yet been spoken of. 
     <lb/>
     Before the hon. Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment went upon the last delegation, he 
     <lb/>
     stated that in reckoning the indebted<lb break="no"/>ness of the Dominion, the Finance Min<lb break="no"/>ister had forgotten to include ten mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars expended upon the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway last year, and that 
     <lb/>
     our share of thst sum would be $250,<lb break="no"/>000; but we find that in his negocia<lb break="no"/>tions with the Dominion Government 
     <lb/>
     this matter was never once mentioned. 
     <lb/>
     Where are his claims for the alleged 
     <lb/>
     five millions of dollars to be expended 
     <lb/>
     in addition to the estimated cost of the 
     <lb/>
     Bay Verte Canal? We do not find a 
     <lb/>
     word in his memorandums about them. 
     <lb/>
     We are even left in doubt whether the 
     <lb/>
     $5 per head additional, that has been 
     <lb/>
     obtained, is secured to us on a sound 
     <lb/>
     financial basis for all time to come, or 
     <lb/>
     whether there is to be a re-arrange<lb break="no"/>ment of the debts of the other Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. If the taxation of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion is to be increased, the extra 
     <lb/>
      Terms secured will be no clear gain to 
     <lb/>
     this Colony, as they will not place us 
     <lb/>
     in a better poaltion than we would 
     <lb/>
     have been under the Terms procured 
     <lb/>
     by the former delegates. The last 
     <lb/>
     delegates were all able men, occupying 
     <lb/>
     the first position among our Island

          politicians, well versed in all the poli<lb break="no"/>tical questions of the day, the first<lb/>financiers of the Colony, and one of<lb/>them had even been on a delegation to<lb/>Washington ! I was nothing to be<lb/>compared with them, Sir, except in<lb/>lineal measure ! They were all<lb/>Colonels-three gallant Colonels- we<lb/>need not, therefore, be surprised that<lb/>they took Ottawa by storm ! There is<lb/>no need to ask for further explanation ;<lb/>they stormed the city, and carried off<lb/>$33,000, but lost a part of it while on<lb/>their way home ! There were two <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex-<lb break="yes"/>officio</hi> delegates at Ottawa besides the<lb/>three delegates, and it may be that<lb/>their services were the means of secur<lb break="no"/>ing more than those of the latter.<lb/>We have a right to see all the tele<lb break="no"/>graphic correspondence between the<lb/>delegates and the Government, as they<lb/>were sent upon the authority of this<lb/>House, and also because this House<lb/>agreed to ratify the Terms they<lb/>brought back. With all their financial<lb/>and legal knowledge, the last delegates<lb/>did not do as much financiering as the<lb/>former delegates. The Terms brought<lb/>down by the first delegates were un<lb break="no"/>derstood by every school boy in the<lb/>country, and the people generally were<lb/>in favor of them. Some hon. members<lb/>on the Government side of the House,<lb/>would not look at those Terms first<lb/>published, because they considered<lb/>them spurious, and looked upon them<lb/>as a piece of deception of the part of<lb/>the late Government ; it was no won<lb break="no"/>der then, that they did not calculate<lb/>and ascertain what they would amount<lb/>to. But the people generally un<lb break="no"/>derstood the financial position of the<lb/>Colony, and were soon able to come to<lb/>a conclusion as to the amount of money<lb/>the Island would receive if the Terms<lb/>were accepted. His honor the Leader<lb/>of the Government assured us that the<lb/>Terms first obtained were $70,000 per<lb/>year short of our local wants, and that<lb/>he would never be willing to go into<lb/>Confederation, if we were to be forced<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     to resort to local taxation immediately 
     <lb/>after we enter the Dominion. How is<lb/>local taxation to be avoided under the<lb/>Terms he has obtained, if his state<lb break="no"/>ment was correct? The Terms now<lb/>before us are still $45,000 short, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to his own estimate ! In the<lb/>absence of information as to the basis<lb/>upon which the Terms were obtained,<lb/>we shall wait for more light upon the<lb/>matter.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOWL2">Hon. Mr. HOWLAN</persName>.- I have had<lb/>the pleasure of hearing a good many<lb/>discussion in this House, but I must<lb/>candidly say that the remarks just<lb/>offered by the hon. Leader of the Op<lb break="no"/>position contained the greatest rigma<lb break="no"/>role of buncome I ever listened to. It<lb/>was, in his eyes, a great sin for me to<lb/>accompany the other delegates to Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, because I held anti-Confederate<lb/>views, although he well knows I did<lb/>not consent to the appointment of<lb/>another delegation, till I found that by<lb/>the mismanagement of the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, the country was left in such<lb/>a position, that there was no other<lb/>course to be pursued. He, himself,<lb/>had arrived at a similar conclusion,<lb/>when he started upon that self-consti<lb break="no"/>tuted delegation to Ottawa. He cer<lb break="no"/>tainly imposed most successfully upon<lb/>the people of Belfast, when he made<lb/>them believe it was perfectly right for<lb/>him to seek Terms for Confederation<lb/>at Ottawa, but that it was altogether<lb/>wrong for his political opponents to<lb/>do so. There are men whose hearts<lb/>and souls are so narrow, that they can<lb/>only conceive that to be right which<lb/>emanates from themselves. When a<lb/>man slanders his political opponents,<lb/>robs them of their character, and after<lb/>all, turns round and adopts the mea<lb break="no"/>sures they supported, declaring at the<lb/>same time that he has acted conscien<lb break="no"/>tiously and honestly, on would sup<lb break="no"/>pose that he would be the last man to<lb/>attack others who had changed their<lb/>views upon just and reasonable grounds.<lb/>

     I have held anti-Confederate views,but 
     <lb/>owing to the bad management of men<lb/>who called themselves financiers, whom<lb/>the people returned to occupy a high<lb/>place in the Government of the coun<lb break="no"/>try for twelve months, and whose only<lb/>characteristic was their inability and<lb/>incompetency, I find that no other<lb/>course is now let open to us, as a<lb/>Colony, but to accept the best Terms<lb/>we can procure, and enter the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. The Government have been<lb/>accused of sending over a bag of gold<lb/>to New Brunswick, for what purpose?<lb/>To pay a debt contracted by the late<lb/>Government, where the credit and<lb/>honor of the Island were at stake.<lb/>The late Government would have re<lb break="no"/>newed the note, held by the Maritime<lb/>Bank of St. John, at the enormous<lb/>rate of one per cent, per month, inter<lb break="no"/>est, if the present Government had<lb/>not been returned to power. We paid<lb/>the debt, and thereby made out credit<lb/>godd. What was the result of that<lb/>act ? I have, on my desk, an agree<lb break="no"/>ment signed by the President of that<lb/>Bank, that it will take $100,000 in<lb/>our Island debentures, at par. This is<lb/>what we have done to preserve the<lb/>credit of the country while absent on<lb/>that delegation, and i we had done<lb/>nothing more, our time would have<lb/>been well spent. But I am glad to<lb/>say we have done a good deal more.<lb/>We have no correspondence before<lb/>this House in referecne to the doings<lb/>of the delegation sent up to Ottawa by<lb/>the late Government, although there<lb/>are two or three telegrams about snow<lb/>storms. The documents on the table<lb/>of this House, show clearly that we<lb/>did not neglect the interests of this<lb/>Island in our negociations with the<lb/>Dominion Government. We told<lb/>them we would be unwilling to return<lb/>to this Colony without receiving Terms<lb/>that would be just and fair, and re<lb/>ceived every attention that could pos<lb break="no"/>sibly be given us. Certain men,<lb/>
           <cb/>
            within the hearing of my voice, exert<lb break="no"/>ed all their influence in endeavoring<lb/>to defeat us in the object of our mission !<lb/>I ask was such conduct patriotic ? The<lb/>very men who declare that it was<lb/>necessary for us to go into Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, used all their influence to pre<lb break="no"/>vent our obtaining better Terms ! The<lb/>Terms we have brought back are<lb/>ridiculed by the same individuals as<lb/>of no advantage to the country, simply<lb/>because they were greatly in advance<lb/>of anything they were able to procure.<lb/>The majority in the Upper Branch<lb/>of the Legislature went up a reolution to<lb/>Ottawa, showing, falsely, that the dele<lb break="no"/>gates represented the v iews of but a<lb/>small portion of the people of this<lb/>Colony, although they well know that<lb/>we were the representatives of a very<lb/>large majority of our population.<lb/>When our own guns were turned<lb/>against us, we were placed at a great<lb/>disadvantage in endeavoring to obtain<lb/>better Terms. The additional Terms<lb/>which we have secured, are held up to<lb/>ridicule by the hon. junior member for<lb/>Belfast ; in his exalted idea of mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars, a few thousands are<lb/>nothing at all. The increase of the<lb/>amount procured by us, is, in his eyes,<lb/>a mere bagetelle. The $33,000 extra<lb/>are certainly most annoying to that<lb/>hon. member. We are told that the<lb/>promise of the Dominion Government<lb/>to grant ten thousand dollars annually<lb/>for Inland Steam Communication, is a<lb/>humbug. I have an authenticated<lb/>copy of the proceedings of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Parliament, and I find there an<lb/>allowance for increased mail service to<lb/>P. E. Island. This annual grant will<lb/>be secured to us on condition that a<lb/>portion of our inland mails are for<lb break="no"/>warded by steamboat. Each succeed<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ing Government is bound by the con<lb break="no"/>tracts made by the preceding Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and, therefore, there will be no danger of our being dissapointed in<lb/>reference to the grant for the carriage<lb/>

     of the inland mails by the steamers 
     <lb/>
     employed for that purpose. We are 
     <lb/>
     also told, by the hon. junior member 
     <lb/>
     for Belfast. that there is to be a. re<lb break="no"/>arrangement of the debts ofthe various 
     <lb/>
     Provinces of the Dominion, and that 
     <lb/>
     we shall be no better off by obtaining 
     <lb/>
     the additional $5 per head, as the in<lb break="no"/>crease of our taxation will be greater 
     <lb/>
     than the amount we shall receive. A 
     <lb/>
     most extraordinary piece of intelli<lb break="no"/>gence surely! If a rearrangement 
     <lb/>
     of the debts does take place next year, 
     <lb/>
     should we be saddled with less taxa<lb break="no"/>tion if we had accepted only $45 per 
     <lb/>
     head? The hon. member says he 
     <lb/>
     never broke any pledges to his con<lb break="no"/>stituents. It is very hard to say what 
     <lb/>
     he means by a pledge, as he appears 
     <lb/>
     in so many different colors. There 
     <lb/>
     is nothing to show us how or when 
     <lb/>
     the correspondence between certain 
     <lb/>
     members of the late Government. and 
     <lb/>
     the Governor General of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion commenced. Hon. Mr. Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne stated a short time ago, that it 
     <lb/>
     began last August, but thereis nothing 
     <lb/>
     in the public Records to show that 
     <lb/>
     such was the case. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     was taken into the late Government 
     <lb/>
     shortly afterwards, and surely Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haythorne explained to him the posi<lb break="no"/>tion he would occupy in that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. But the hon. member, although 
     <lb/>
     knowing the policy of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of which he was a member, did 
     <lb/>
     not risk the people of Belfast whether 
     <lb/>
     they were willing to go for Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion or not. Nothing of the kind was 
     <lb/>
     mentioned to them. I, on the con<lb break="no"/>trary. wrote to my constituents before 
     <lb/>
     I went with the other delegates to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa to ask whether they were 
     <lb/>
     willing or not for me to go upon the 
     <lb/>
     delegation? I stated to them plainly 
     <lb/>
     that the position of the affairs of the 
     <lb/>
     Colony was such that I could not 
     <lb/>
     avoid the question of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and that there was no other way of 
     <lb/>
     redeeming our credit, but to obtain 
     <lb/>
     the best possible Terms, and enter the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     Dominion. This was all that I could 
     <lb/>
     do in the limited time: allowed me to 
     <lb/>
     decide as to the course i should take. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member states that when he 
     <lb/>
     returned from Ottawa, he. advised his 
     <lb/>
     Leader to dissolve the House, in order 
     <lb/>
     to give him an opportunity to consult 
     <lb/>
     the people of Belfast. After doing all 
     <lb/>
     he could to put the Colony into Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, he turns round and asks the 
     <lb/>
     people to sanction what he did. This is 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman who upbraids hon. 
     <lb/>
     members of this House with voting in 
     <lb/>
     favor of Confederation, without con<lb break="no"/>sulting their constituents. He en<lb break="no"/>deavored to make out that the Terms 
     <lb/>
     we brought back from Ottawa amount. 
     <lb/>
     to nothing at all. If he had stated 
     <lb/>
     that we had secured an additional 
     <lb/>
     annual amount equal to the interest 
     <lb/>
     upon half a million of dollars at five 
     <lb/>
     per cent, he would have been honest, 
     <lb/>
     but to do so would be against his 
     <lb/>
     principles. The Terms are unjust and 
     <lb/>
     actually against our interests, but he 
     <lb/>
     is going to vote for them! Wonder<lb break="no"/>ful! As to the correspondence be<lb break="no"/>tween the delegates and the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     authorities, it shows clearly that we 
     <lb/>
     were not unmindful of the powers of 
     <lb/>
     this House, or of the hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who sent us upon our mission. If the 
     <lb/>
     delegates had returned empty handed. 
     <lb/>
     and the Government had been com<lb break="no"/>pelled to levy additional local taxation. 
     <lb/>
     matters would have assumed a differ<lb break="no"/>ent aspect. They asked more than 
     <lb/>
     they received, unlike the former dele<lb break="no"/>gates. who received all they asked for. 
     <lb/>
     During the night of the torch light 
     <lb/>
     procession, for which, by the way, we 
     <lb/>
     have to thank the citizens of Charlotte<lb break="no"/>town, the hon. junior member for 
     <lb/>
     Belfast was heard to say, " Well, I 
     <lb/>
     believe they have got better Terms 
     <lb/>
     after all." If the hon. member will 
     <lb/>
     give us all the telegrams sent up by 
     <lb/>
     his party to oppose our getting better 
     <lb/>
    Terms, I will promise him a copy of 
     <lb/>all we sent down from Ottawa. It. is 
     <lb/>nothing but fair for the hon. member 
     <lb/>

     to admit that the promises made by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion Government, both to the 
     <lb/>
     first and last delegates, will be kept in 
     <lb/>
     good faith, as he had no reason to 
     <lb/>
     come to any other conclusion. The 
     <lb/>
     Railway will be taken and worked by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, but I am in favor of re<lb break="no"/>taining it, to be worked by our local 
     <lb/>
     Government, because I believe that if 
     <lb/>
     I live five or six years, I shall find it 
     <lb/>
     a paying institution. I cannot believe 
     <lb/>
     that a Railway, about two hundred 
     <lb/>
     miles in length, running through a 
     <lb/>
     fertile and highly cultivated country, 
     <lb/>
     will ever prove to be worthless, useless 
     <lb/>
     or non-paying; but as my friends in the 
     <lb/>
     Government are opposed to our re<lb break="no"/>taining it, I give way to their opinions 
     <lb/>
     on the matter. Time will prove that 
     <lb/>
     1 am correct in my opinions, and that 
     <lb/>
     our railway will yet be one of the best 
     <lb/>
     paying lines in the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. The Government is, of course, 
     <lb/>
     ruled by the Opinions of the majority 
     <lb/>
     of its friends, and as the latter are in 
     <lb/>
     favor of the Dominion taking and 
     <lb/>
     working the railroad, their wishes will 
     <lb/>
     be acceded to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     MR, STEWART.—I willingly accord 
     <lb/>
     the last delegates my meed of praise 
     <lb/>
     for the addition which they have ob<lb break="no"/>tained to the Terms brought down by 
     <lb/>
     the former delegation. I opposed the 
     <lb/>
     motion to appoint the last delegation, 
     <lb/>
     not from personal motives, but on ac<lb break="no"/>count of the great latitude which the 
     <lb/>
     resolution gave them in their negocia<lb break="no"/>tions with the Dominion Government. 
     <lb/>
     I had reason to believe that some 
     <lb/>
     members of, the Government were in 
     <lb/>
     favor of retaining the Railway, for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of being worked by our local 
     <lb/>
     Government, and with the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the highest authority—that of the 
     <lb/>
     Government Engineer — before me, 
     <lb/>
     showing that it would entail a great 
     <lb/>
     loss upon the country, I could not vote 
     <lb/>
     for a resolution giving the delegates so 
     <lb/>
     much latitude. As it is, I am proud 
     <lb/>
     to acknowledge that, they have ob<lb break="no"/>tained better Terms, and will not stop 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     to ask whether the latter are $25,000 
     <lb/>
     or $33,000 better than those brought 
     <lb/>
     down by the former delegates. I 
     <lb/>
     stated before the last delegates left for 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa that I would vote for the 
     <lb/>
     Terms then before the country. but I 
     <lb/>
     also said that if better Terms could be 
     <lb/>
     obtained, I would vote for their ac<lb break="no"/>ceptance when laid beforetbo House. 
     <lb/>
     It would, I think, have been better if 
     <lb/>
     the delegates had not led the people 
     <lb/>
     to believe they had received so large 
     <lb/>
     an amount as they at first named. 
     <lb/>
     There is no doubt that we shall be 
     <lb/>
     fairly dealt with by the Parliament of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, and that whenever we 
     <lb/>
     can clearly show that we do not receive 
     <lb/>
    justice, it will act fairly towards us. 
     <lb/>I am sorry that hon. members enter 
     <lb/>into personal disputes, which only tend 
     <lb/>to belittle them in the eyes of the 
     <lb/>country and of the people of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, who are watching our pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings. Whilst I give my vote in 
     <lb/>favor of the Terms, I would have been 
     <lb/>better pleased if the delegates had not 
     <lb/>made Such a tremendous cackling over 
     <lb/>them. I have nothing to say against 
     <lb/>the torch light procession, and fire 
     <lb/>works, but I should like to see hon. 
     <lb/>members on the Government side of 
     <lb/>the House address themselves to the 
     <lb/>facts before them. I do not for a 
     <lb/>moment think the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Alberton believed that the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, were prepared, or ever in<lb break="no"/>tended to give one per cent per month 
     <lb/>to the Maritime Bank of St. John, N. 
     <lb/>B., for the renewal of the note, about 
     <lb/>which so much has been said. The 
     <lb/>present Government had no right to 
     <lb/>to take the money out of the Treasury 
     <lb/>to pay that note, as their action in 
     <lb/>that respect was contrary to law. 
     <lb/>They should have sold Land. Damage 
     <lb/>Debentures to pay the amount of the 
     <lb/>note. The reason why our debentures 
     <lb/>have gone up, or increased in value, is 
     <lb/>that Confederation is near its con<lb break="no"/>summation. For that reason,and that 
     <lb/>only, our debentures have risen in lllt' 
     <lb/>market. I am only too happy to 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="1873-05-23_Page_188"

     know that Confederation is so nearly 
     <lb/>
     consummated on fair and reasonable 
     <lb/>
     terms, that our Island is to be freed 
     <lb/>
     from its tremendous debt, and that we 
     <lb/>
     shall be a free, independent, and well 
     <lb/>
     governed people, retaining all our pre<lb break="no"/>sent rights and privileges.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">MR. L. H. DAVIES</persName>.—I am in the 
     <lb/>
     same dilemma as the hon. Leader of 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition, in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     Terms now before the House, and 
     <lb/>
     think we should have been informed 
     <lb/>
     as to the basis upon which they were 
     <lb/>
     granted. When the hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General stated that the greater num<lb break="no"/>ber of the people did not understand 
     <lb/>
     the terms of Confederation upon which 
     <lb/>
     they voted at last election, he made an 
     <lb/>
     incorrect statement Ifthe people have 
     <lb/>
     voted in ignorance of the matter, this 
     <lb/>
     House would not bejustified in voting 
     <lb/>
     away the constitutioa of the Colony, 
     <lb/>
     as the electors should know the facts 
     <lb/>
     of the case, and have an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to deal with them accordingly. It 
     <lb/>
     would be unjust and unfair to take 
     <lb/>
     advantage of the peeple, and if his 
     <lb/>
     statement is correct, the question of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation should be referred to 
     <lb/>
     the magain for their decision. But I 
     <lb/>
     take issue with the hon. member on 
     <lb/>
     thts matter, and am prepared to vote 
     <lb/>
     for the Terms now before us, because 
     <lb/>
     I believe that nearly every voter in 
     <lb/>
     the country understood the financial 
     <lb/>
     aspect of the great question of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, and was in a position to 
     <lb/>
     give an intelligent decision as to 
     <lb/>
     whether the Terms should be accepted 
     <lb/>
     or not. Any man who has read the 
     <lb/>
     published debates of this House, and 
     <lb/>
    the comments of the newspapers on 
     <lb/>political affairs, must be well posted 
     <lb/>up in reference to the Haythorne-<lb break="yes"/>Laird Terms. The late Government 
     <lb/>laid the figures clearly before the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and the leading men of both poli<lb break="no"/>tical parties discussed the matter so 
     <lb/>fully, that all must have understood it. 
     <lb/>If the hon. Atty. General really be<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
            
            lieves that the people did not under<lb break="no"/>stand what they voted upon, he is 
     <lb/>
     placing himself in a false position by 
     <lb/>
     voting for the present Terms, and has 
     <lb/>
     a right to refer the question. again to 
     <lb/>
     the electors, in order to obtain an in<lb break="no"/>telligent decision. I believe his honor 
     <lb/>
     was one of those who voted for the 
     <lb/>
     celebrated " No terms," resolution, 
     <lb/>
     which precluded the idea of entering 
     <lb/>
     into negociations with the Government 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion at all He has 
     <lb/>
     therefore, only become a Confederate 
     <lb/>
     at the eleventh hour, and that too, be<lb break="no"/>fore Canada conceded the liberal 
     <lb/>Terms now offered us. I, on the other 
     <lb/>hand have become a Confederate upon 
     <lb/>grounds which the hon. member can<lb break="no"/>not deny I should occupy. He has 
     <lb/>stated, time and again, that the man 
     <lb/>who persistently adheres to his opinion 
     <lb/>in the face of logic and facts, is more 
     <lb/>a fool than a politician. The enor<lb break="no"/>mous debt which presses heavily upon 
     <lb/>this Colony, and which we cannot 
     <lb/>much longer bear, has been the means 
     <lb/>of my becoming a a Confederate. The 
     <lb/>Terms now before us are good, but I 
     <lb/>do not think them better than the 
     <lb/>Haythorne-Laird Terms, because the 
     <lb/>latter were granted on a good sound 
     <lb/>reasonable basis, while the former 
     <lb/>seem to be based upon a re-adjustment 
     <lb/>of the debts of the several Provinces 
     <lb/>of the Dominion. The delegate tele<lb break="no"/>graphed from Ottawa, that they had 
     <lb/>received $33,000 in addition to the 
     <lb/>Terms obtained by the first delegation, 
     <lb/>but that sum has dwindled down to a 
     <lb/>little over $25,000. What has be<lb break="no"/>come of the difference between those 
     <lb/>amounts? We have no information 
     <lb/>before us, as to the grounds or basis 
     <lb/>upon which the additional sum has 
     <lb/>been secured. If I understand the 
     <lb/>second section of the Minute of Con<lb break="no"/>ference, aright, this extra sum has been 
     <lb/>given us in "view of the possibility of 
     <lb/>a re-adjustment of the financial ar<lb break="no"/>rangements between Canada and the 
     <lb/>seven Provinces now embraced in 
     <lb/>
          
            
          
     <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">189</fw> 
     
   
          
     the Dominion." I believe that any 
     <lb/>
     person who reads that section, impar<lb break="no"/>tially, will come to the same con<lb break="no"/>clusion. The $45-per head was agreed 
     <lb/>
     to by the Dominion, because they in<lb break="no"/>tended to increase their public debt to 
     <lb/>
     that amount, by the construction of 
     <lb/>
     certain important public works. The 
     <lb/>
    hon. Leader of the Government states 
     <lb/>that be obtained the addition upon the 
     <lb/>same grounds upon which the first 
     <lb/>delegation obtained their Terms, and 
     <lb/>that the latter made a mistake in their 
     <lb/>calculations. If this is the case, why 
     <lb/>does he not point out that error, and 
     <lb/>show the basis upon he obtained the 
     <lb/>additional sum? There is an ominous 
     <lb/>silence upon this matter, on the part 
     <lb/>of the delegates. I believe that the 
     <lb/>other Provinces will receive the five 
     <lb/>dollars per head, all round, in addition 
     <lb/>to their present allowances from the 
     <lb/>Dominion Treasury. If they (the last 
     <lb/>delegates) proved to the Dominion 
     <lb/>Government that Messrs. Haythorne 
     <lb/>and Laird omitted something in their 
     <lb/>calculations, why do they not show us 
     <lb/>in what respec and how the error 
     <lb/>was made? If, the other Provinces 
     <lb/>receive $5 per head of their population, 
     <lb/>in addition to their present allowances, 
     <lb/>$20,000,000 will be added to the debt 
     <lb/>of the Dominion. If this is the case 
     <lb/>we shall, under Confederation, be 
     <lb/>forced to pay an additional tax to pay 
     <lb/>the interest on that amount, and the 
     <lb/>real gain on our part will be nothing 
     <lb/>stall. If this is the real state of 
     <lb/>matters, the House has been deceived, 
     <lb/>and the country is being deceived. 
     <lb/>When the Haythorne-Laird Terms 
     <lb/>came down, the hon. Col. Secretary, 
     <lb/>one of the last delegates, said he was 
     <lb/>prepared to accept them at once. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI2">Hon. COL. SECRETARY</persName>.—I stated 
     <lb/>
     that l was prepared to accept them, if

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">MR. L. H. DAVIES</persName>.—The hon.

            <cb/>
           
     town, and that statement was pub<lb break="no"/>lished in the newspapers, to the effect, 
     <lb/>
     that he was prepared to vote for the 
     <lb/>
     Terms then offered, and he never de<lb break="no"/>nied the correctness of the report. 
     <lb/>
     On what grounds did the Government 
     <lb/>
     ask the appointment of the last dele<lb break="no"/>gation? They asked it upon the 
     <lb/>
     grounds that Messrs. Haythorne and 
     <lb/>
     Laird bad omitted certain demands 
     <lb/>
     which were contended to be just and 
     <lb/>
     reasonable, and which they would have 
     <lb/>
     made, if they had been authorized to 
     <lb/>
     send a delegation to Ottawa. They 
     <lb/>
     also stated that the Haythorne-Laird 
     <lb/>
     delegation did not claim the cost of 
     <lb/>
     the land upon which the new Post 
     <lb/>
     Office is built, and of certain Light<lb break="no"/>houses and the Drill Sheds, for all of 
     <lb/>
     which we should receive remuneration, 
     <lb/>
     according to their reasoning. But it 
     <lb/>
     now appears that not one of those 
     <lb/>
     items was urged before the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council of Canada. A great deal was 
     <lb/>
     also said before the late delegation 
     <lb/>
     was appointed, to the effect, that one 
     <lb/>
     section of the former Terms was not 
     <lb/>
     carefully enough worded, and that the 
     <lb/>
     Steam Dredge could be taken away 
     <lb/>
     by the Dominion Government for use 
     <lb/>
     in the other Provinces; but we find 
     <lb/>
     that there was not a word said about 
     <lb/>
     this matter. His honor the Leader of 
     <lb/>
     the Government discovered a mares 
     <lb/>
     nest, when he found out that ten mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars had been omitted by 
     <lb/>
     the former delegates in their calcula<lb break="no"/>tion. I challenge him, now, to state 
     <lb/>
     whether his remarks in reference to 
     <lb/>
     that matter were correct or not.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. L. H. DAVIES</persName>.—The infer<lb break="no"/>ence which his honor drew from the<lb/>Budget Speech, was, that the ten<lb/>millions of dollars were not included<lb/>in the calculations of Messrs. Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne and Laird ; but it was a mere<lb/>Will-o-the-Wisp, as those calculations<lb/>in reference to the present and pros<lb break="no"/>pective debt of the Dominion, were<lb/>correct in every particular. I can come<lb/>to no other conclusion than that the<lb/>extra sum was obtained on the basis<lb/>that there is to be a re-arrangement<lb/>of the debts of the several Provinces<lb/>of Canada. If this is not so, I should<lb/>like to know upon what other basis it<lb/>was obtained ?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI2">Hon. COL. SECRETARY</persName>.—The $5<lb/>per head was obtained on the same<lb/>basis as that upon which Messrs. Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne and Laird obtained the $45<lb/>per head. I am not aware that there<lb/>will be any addition made to the<lb/>allowances received by the other Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces on account of the concession to<lb/>this Colony.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAIR2">MR. LAIRD</persName>.—Does his honor the<lb/>Col. Secretary mean to say that the<lb/>addition to the Terms was obtained<lb/>on the same calculations as were made<lb/>by the former delegates ? The state<lb break="no"/>ment will not hold good, for it cannot<lb/>be proved.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI2">Hon. COL. SECRETARY</persName>.—The iso<lb break="no"/>lated and exceptional condition of this<lb/>Colony was given as a reason why we<lb/>should obtain better Terms. We also<lb/>stated that our people had never been<lb/>used to direct taxation, and that the<lb/>union with the Dominion would be<lb/>unpopular, if our educational establish<lb break="no"/>ments, roads, bridges, &amp;c., had to be<lb/>sustained by local taxation immedi<lb break="no"/>ately after going into Confederation.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">MR. L. H. DAVIES</persName>.—Every hon.<lb/>member of this House will rejoice that<lb/>such a concession has been made to<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            this Colony ; but if it were made on the<lb/>same basis as the former Terms why<lb/>were not the statements in reference<lb/>to this matter embodied in the same<lb/>paragraph ? There is reason for be<lb break="no"/>lieving that the addition was granted<lb/>on other grounds that those mentioned<lb/>by his honor the Col. Secretary. If a<lb/>re-adjustment of the financial arrange<lb break="no"/>ments petween the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the several Provinces is the<lb/>basis upon which the last concession<lb/>has been made, not a member from<lb/>this Island could vote against a similar<lb/>allowance to the other Provinces, if it<lb/>is proposed next year in the Dominion<lb/>Parliament ; and this Island will not<lb/>receive one dollar in addition to the<lb/>Haythorne-Laird Terms. Before the<lb/>last delegation was appointed, his<lb/>honor the Leader of the Government<lb/>stated that if the country accepted the<lb/>Terms then before it, there would be<lb/>an annual deficit of $70,000. If that<lb/>statement was correct, there is still a<lb/>very large deficit ; no less than $45,<lb break="no"/>000 per year ! Is his honor prepared<lb/>to tax the people to that extent after<lb/>accepting Confederation ? I rejoice<lb/>that we are about to become a part of<lb/>the Dominion, and shall, therefore,<lb/>vote for the acceptance of th Ters<lb/>now before us, even although they are<lb/>no better than the former Terms, be<lb break="no"/>cause I believe we cannot carry on<lb/>our local Government any longer<lb/>without over-burdening the people<lb/>with taxation. I am not much afraid<lb/>of the future of this Island under the<lb/>Terms we are about to receive. The<lb/>former Terms would, in my opinion,<lb/>if accepted, give us surplus of<lb/>Revenue to the extent of $17,000 per<lb/>year, and we shall, at least, be no<lb/>worse off under the present Terms.<lb/>In a matter of this kind, the very least<lb/>the Government could do, is to ex<lb break="no"/>plain fully the basis upon which the<lb/>additional sum has been obtained.<lb/>The paragraph in the Minutes of Con<lb break="no"/>ference, states that the $5 per head<lb/>
         
            <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">191</fw>
            
            was obtained in view of a re-adjust<lb break="no"/>ment of the debts of the Provinces of<lb/>the Dominion. If so, I do not think<lb/>we have, in the Terms now before us,<lb/>anything in addition to that brought<lb/>down from Ottawa by Messrs. Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne and Laird.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. LEADER OF THE GOVERN<lb break="no"/>MENT</persName>.—The additional sum of $5 per<lb/>head conceded to this Colony by the<lb/>Dominion, was not given us on the<lb/>basis of a re-adjustment of the debts<lb/>of the Provinces of the Dominion.<lb/>That amount was granted for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of placing us in the same position,<lb/>financially, as the people of the other<lb/>Provinces. The delegates did not get<lb/>as large an amount was was asked for,<lb/>but they received as much as it was<lb/>expected they should receive. As the<lb/>season was far advanced, and the Do<lb break="no"/>minion House of Commons about to<lb/>rise, and as knew that our own<lb/>Legislature was awaiting our return,<lb/>our time was extremely limited ; but<lb/>we did the best we could do, under<lb/>the circumstances. The hon. member<lb/>for Strathalbyn (Mr. Stewart) made a<lb/>most reasonable speech in reference to<lb/>the action of the last delegates ; but<lb/>I cannot agree with him when he says<lb/>that the Government had no right to<lb/>take $25,000 out of the Treasury to<lb/>pay the amount due from this Colony<lb/>at the Maritime Bank of St. John, N.<lb/>B. Should that amount be drawn<lb/>from the Treasury, or should we allow<lb/>the note to be dishonored and the<lb/>credit of the Colony injured to a far<lb/>greater extent than it has already<lb/>been ? No Government whose credit<lb/>was worth anything would have agreed<lb/>to renew their note at the enormous<lb/>interest of one per cent per month !<lb/>The President and Vice President<lb/>of that Bank were members of the<lb/>Dominion Parliament, and if we had<lb/>not paid the amount due, those gentle<lb break="no"/>men, owing to their position, might<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            represent to the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that the Colony was in such a<lb/>state that it was forced to accept any<lb/>Terms they might offer, and we should<lb/>thus be prevented from obtaining any<lb/>additional concession. We considered<lb/>it our first duty to redeem that note<lb/>and save the credit of the Colony. As<lb/>soon as that sum was paid, I made<lb/>an arrangement with the President of<lb/>that Bank by which he agreed to take<lb/>the Land Damage Debentures to the<lb/>extent of $100,000 upon the terms<lb/>that when those debentures are put<lb/>into the market the Government of<lb/>this Colony shall receive the interest<lb/>that has accrued upon them. The<lb/>credit of the country has thus been<lb/>maintained, and the members of that<lb/>delegation, in acting as they did,<lb/>deserved, I think, the thanks of this<lb/>House and of the country. As this<lb/>matter has been pretty fully discussed,<lb/>I beg to submit the following resolu<lb break="no"/>tions :—<lb/>

            </p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
               6. That, in consideration of the <choice><sic>tran<lb break="no"/>fer</sic><corr>transfer</corr></choice> to the Parliament of Canada of the<lb/>powers of taxation, the following sums<lb/>shall be paid yearly by Canada to<lb/>Prince Edward Island for the support<lb/>of its Government and Leglislature—<lb break="yes"/>that is to say, Thirty thousand dollars<lb/>($30,000), and an annual grant of 80<lb/>cents per head of its population, as<lb/>shown by the Census Returns of 1871,<lb/>viz : 94,021 both by half-yearly pay<lb break="no"/>ments in advance ; such grant of eighty<lb/>per cents per head to be augmented in<lb/>proportion to the increase of popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the Island, as may be shown<lb/>by each subsequent decennial Census,<lb/>until the population amount to Four<lb/>Hundred Thousand, at which rate<lb/>such a grant shall thereafter remain, it<lb/>being understood that the next census<lb/>shall be taken in the year 1881.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAIR2">Mr. D. LAIRD</persName>.—If the influence of<lb/>his honor the Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was so great that he could easily<lb/>have negociated the loan of a sum of<lb/>money, from our Island capitalists,<lb/>without going out of the Colony, suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to meet the wants of the country,<lb/>why did he not use his great influence<lb/>to raise those debentures to par, the<lb/>moment he obtained the reins of<lb/>power, and thus have prevented the<lb/>necessity for taking the money out of<lb/>the Treasury to pay that note. If his<lb/>influence with that Bank was as great<lb/>as represented, all he had to do was to<lb/>negociate the sale, at par, of the de<lb break="no"/>bentures deposited in the Maritime<lb/>Bank, to prevent the necessity of tak<lb break="no"/>ing the gold out of the Colony. He<lb/>was in a position to issue an additional<lb/>quantity of Land Damage Debentures,<lb/>which, if his influence was sufficient,<lb/>he could have sold at par, and thus<lb/>have redeemed the note in question.<lb/>But it seems that he has no more in<lb break="no"/>fluence in getting our debentures<lb/>cashed at par than any other person, or<lb/>he would have done so long before this.<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            The President and Vice President of<lb/>that Bank knew that Confederation<lb/>was certain to become an accomplished<lb/>fact with regard to this Island, and,<lb/>therefore, were quite willing, under<lb/>these circumstances, to take our de<lb break="no"/>bentures at their full value. If the<lb/>late Government had remained in<lb/>power, the gold would never have<lb/>been taken out of the Colony to re<lb break="no"/>deem that note, as the debentures<lb/>lying in the Bank as security, would<lb/>have been sold at par for its payment,<lb/>whenever Confederation became a<lb/>certainty. The hon. Leader of the<lb/>Government endeavors to make out<lb/>that if that note had not been redeem<lb break="no"/>ed in the way it was, the last delega<lb break="no"/>tion would have been thereby placed<lb/>at a disadvantage in obtaining better<lb/>Terms. Now, I maintain that his<lb/>whole argument before the Privy<lb/>Council for better Terms, was based<lb/>on the necessities of the Colony, from<lb/>rotten hemlock down to the repairing<lb/>of the Government House. If the<lb/>statement, so often made by his honor,<lb/>that the Railway was worth what it<lb/>cost, was correct, why did he not re<lb break="no"/>peat it at Ottawa ? If that assertion<lb/>were correct, we should receive the<lb/>$50 per head over and above the Rail<lb break="no"/>way debt. His honor knew, too well,<lb/>that the Dominion Government would<lb/>not be caught by such chaff as that.<lb/>The hon. member for Alberton de<lb break="no"/>clared, in this House, that the Rail<lb break="no"/>way would pay $50,000 per year over<lb/>working expenses, but he never ven<lb break="no"/>tured to put forth that argument at<lb/>Ottawa. The last delegates well<lb/>knew that the statements I made in<lb/>reference to the Railway, before the<lb/>Privy Council, were nearer the truth.<lb/>Hon. Mr. Haythorne and myself pre<lb break="no"/>sented the statement of the Chief En<lb break="no"/>gineer as to the working expenses and<lb/>receipts of the Railway, and said that<lb/>its friends and promoters calculated it<lb/>would be very soon self-sustaining.<lb/>
            
          
            <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">195</fw>
            
            We gave the latter statement as the<lb/>opinion of the hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and his friends, and not as<lb/>our own. We did not entertain that<lb/>opinion ourselves, but we let it go for<lb/>what it was worth. In return we<lb/>were laughed at for our pains, and,<lb/>therefore, took good care not to repeat<lb/>the statement again. I never boasted<lb/>of my influence or ability ; but the<lb/>highest compliment has been paid me<lb/>this evening by his honor the Atty.<lb/>General, who says that I can keep<lb/>back Confederation or push it forward,<lb/>just as I please ! It seems that the<lb/>last delegates repeated our arguments<lb/>in reference to the Railway, but they<lb/>were choked off at once by the Privy<lb/>Council. They stated that the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature was not satisfied with the Terms.<lb/>In doing so, they gave ony one side<lb/>of the story, forgetting all about the<lb/>action of the Legislative Council and<lb/>the Opposition in this House. In this<lb/>correspondence we now have it stated<lb/>that the delegates to Quebec went un<lb break="no"/>authorized by the people of this Island.<lb/>This is certainly a great admission after<lb/>all that has been said on that subject.<lb/>The present Government party con<lb break="no"/>demned the late Government because<lb/>they appointed their delegation with<lb break="no"/>out convening the Legislature and<lb/>asking its consent to the action ; yet<lb/>the same men sent the delegation to<lb/>the Quebec Conference without the<lb/>authority of the people ! Scarcely<lb/>had the first delegation to Ottawa left<lb/>the Island, when an indignation meet<lb break="no"/>ing was called by the then Opposition,<lb/>and the resolution which was passed,<lb/>condemning the action of the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, was immediately sent to<lb/>Ottawa, for the purpose of thwarting<lb/>the delegates in obtaining fair and<lb/>reasonable terms of Confederation for<lb/>this Colony. They condemned the<lb/>late Government because it sent up<lb/>delegates to ascertain what Terms<lb/>Canada would offer for our acceptance.<lb/>

           The hon. member for Charlottetown,<lb/>(Mr. Brecken) forgot his patriotism<lb/>and his duty to his country, and joined<lb/>in a declaration of indignation at the<lb/>conduct of the late Government in<lb/>merely sending up a delegation to<lb/>Ottawa, to ask what Terms they<lb/>would offer this Colony for its entrance<lb/>into the Dominion !<lb/>
