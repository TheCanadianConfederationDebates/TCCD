To ensure as much unanimity, also,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-7-448"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-8-449">as possible at the Conference, a clause was thrown in to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-9-379"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-10-379">the effect that due regard should be had to the claims of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-11-314"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-12-315">the members of the Legislative Council of the Opposition</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-13-702"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-14-702">in each Province. But this provision will be of little</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-15-138"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-16-139">account, for after the divisions which the discussion of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-17-242"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-18-243">the Confederation question has caused, I think it will be</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-19-886"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-20-886">difficult to tell how individuals stand with respect to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-21-287"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-22-288">parties. When I saw the drift of the whole section in</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-23-943"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-24-944">regard to the constitution of the Legislative Council as it</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-25-25"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-26-26">now stands in the Report, I strongly expressed the hope</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-27-169"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-28-170">that the delegates would except this Island from such a</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-29-422"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-30-423">piece of corruption. Again with respect to our Local</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-31-477"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-32-477">Legislature under the Confederation scheme, what would</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-33-280"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-34-281">it amount to ! We would be a laughing stock to the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-35-571"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-36-571">world. The City Council would be a king to such a</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-37-846"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-38-846">Legislature. In this House scarcely anything would be</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-39-419"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-40-419">left us to do, but to legislate about dog taxes and the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-41-90"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-42-90">running at large of swine. Some hon members have</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-43-951"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-44-952">referred to the great advantage of this Colony being</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-45-939"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-46-939">allowed to retain its local legislature. Probably they</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-47-580"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-48-580">intend to remove to Canada themselves, and care little</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-49-359"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-50-359">about what they leave behind them. I will now turn to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-52-259"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-53-260">the financial part of the Report. When the Committee on</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-54-544"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-55-545">finance was appointed at the Conference, I was so satisfied</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-56-882"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-57-882">that the proposition for a grant of £200,000, sterling, to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-58-775"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-59-776">this Colony would be carried out, that I scarcely gave</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-60-887"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-61-888">the appointment any consideration. But, Sir, when the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-62-781"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-63-782">committee reported at the Conference Board, I was</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-64-619"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-65-620">struck with amazement, and expressed myself very freely</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-66-907"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-67-908">to that effect. At my suggestion it was resolved that the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-68-504"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-69-505">committee should reconsider their scheme. But, Sir, I</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-70-872"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-71-872">believe that my objections to the committee's report</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-72-332"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-73-333">aroused the delegates from Newfoundland and New</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-74-606"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-75-606">Brunswick, for when it was brought in again next</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-76-509"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-77-509">morning a subsidy was provided for each of these Colonies,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-78-358"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-79-358">but it did not include any allowance for this Island.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-80-856"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-81-856">Newfoundland received a liberal consideration at the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-82-121"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-83-121">hands of the committee, the sum guaranteed to her being</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-84-929"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-85-930">$150,000 annually. The Report says that this allowance is</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-86-891"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-87-892">for the surrender of her mines and minerals and public lands</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-88-426"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-89-427">to the General Government ; but in reality it was given to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-90-774"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-91-775">that Colony on account of the plea put forth by the New-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-92-740"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-93-741">foundland delegates that their people were, to a great</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-94-88"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-95-88">extent, paupers. The Colonial Secretary informed us at</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-96-518"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-97-518">the Town meeting that the grant to Newfoundland was</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-98-973"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-99-974">made in consideration of her revenue being nearly wholly</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-100-443"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-101-443">derived from customs' duties, the relinquishment of which</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-102-483"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-103-483">would leave her without any local income. But I ask</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-104-352"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-105-357">what are the local revenues of this Island ? Would we</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-106-855"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-107-856">not be nearly in the same position as Newfoundland if</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-108-766"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-109-766">our revenue from duties were given up to the General</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-110-415"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-111-415">Government ! Then New Brunswick, too, received a</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-112-63"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-113-63">consideration to induce her to enter the Uuion, namely.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-114-412"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-115-412">the respectable sum of $63,000 a year for ten years. This</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-116-896"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-117-897">grant, no doubt, was obtained through the able advocacy of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-118-434"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-119-435">Hon. Mr. Tilley, who was on the committee as finance</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-120-620"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-121-621">minister for that Province. And, Sir, I am not much</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-122-124"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-123-124">surprised that the £200,000, sterling, was not secured</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-124-703"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-125-703">for this Island, since I heard the Colonial Secretary, who</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-126-538"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-127-538">acted on the financial committee for this Colony, declare</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-128-443"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-129-443">that he considered the terms of the Report just and liberal</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-130-0"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-131-0">to Prince Edward Island. When I objected to the report</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-132-707"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-133-708">of the financial committee on the ground that no grant</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-134-557"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-135-558">was to be given to this Colony, the Hon. George Brown said</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-136-367"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-137-367">that more money was already allowed us than we would know</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-138-977"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-139-978">what to do with. And no wonder that he said so, when the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-140-366"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-141-367">delegate from this Island, who assisted to draw up the financial</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-142-820"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-143-820">arrangement, affirms that it is liberal. I shall next refer to the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-144-578"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-145-579">subject of expenses, and show that our taxation must be greatly</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-146-329"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-147-329">increased. Besides having to tax ourselves for local improve-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-148-91"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-149-92">ments, we will have to bear a share of the expenses of Canada,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-150-894"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-151-895">as she is unable to meet them now, and will be less able to do</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-152-902"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-153-902">so under Confederation, for they will be much heavier than at</span></span>

Whether the Canadian Gov-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-15-325"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-16-325">ernment will really spend half a million on fortifying Montreal,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-17-931"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-18-932">as Lord de Grey expects, we very much doubt, for there is a</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-19-558"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-20-559">great difference between calling out Volunteers and Militia at a</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-21-544"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-22-545">time of excitement, and taxing the community to raise masses of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-23-387"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-24-387">earthworks and put guns in position. If the fortification of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-25-601"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-26-602">Quebec by England be looked upon as part of an arrangement</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-27-617"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-28-618">between the Mother Country and the Colony, then we suppose</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-29-678"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-30-679">we must submit and pay the £200,000, or whatever more the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-1-812"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-2-812">works may cost. But we cannot affect to say that it will be</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-3-937"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-4-937">done with any enthusiasm.'</span></span>

And this view of the relative responsibilities forces us to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-16-691"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-17-691">return to the cause which necessitates the outlay. Again then,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-18-538"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-19-538">we say, Canada has no quarrel with her powerful neighbor, nor</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-20-488"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-21-488">would have but as a dependency, an outlaying portion of the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-22-232"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-23-232">British Empire, a weak point, vulnerable and easily assailable.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-24-650"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-25-650">That we are all this is no fault of ours ; but says the <i>Times</i>,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-26-640"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-27-640">" you must take the consequences, you must fortify the weakest</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-28-977"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-29-977">points, and England will undertake that which requires the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-30-936"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-31-936">least expenditure."
