     to join a country and submit to taxation 
     <lb/>
     to conquer a province that was united to 
     <lb/>
     them without their consent, and to be 
     <lb/>governed by men who were unfit to rule<lb/>any country. The hon member had<lb/>predicted that the members of the present<lb/>government would never be returned to<lb/>the House, because they appended their<lb/>names to the Minute of Council, and that<lb/>this Minute of Council committed the<lb/>Island to confederation. But the very<lb/>first words of the Minute of Council<lb/>were: <lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>" Inasmuch as the said terms do not comprise<lb/>a full and immediate settlement of the land<lb/>tenures, and indemnity from the Imperial<lb/>government fro loss of territorial revenues, the<lb/>committee cannot recommend said terms to the<lb/>consideration of their constituents."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Was it an expression of approval to say<lb/>they could not recommend the terms<lb/>even to the people's consideration ?<lb/>Another paragraph read as follows:<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>" The opinion of the people of this Island on 
     <lb/>the question of union has been expressed by<lb/>them, in the most decisive language, as opposed<lb/>to any union with the Dominion. This opinion<lb/>the Council has no reason to believe has been<lb/>changed, and therefore conceives it is unne<lb break="no"/>cessary for them to enter into any other details<lb/>to which they believe many valid and serious<lb/>objections are entertained."<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     There were the sentiments expressed by 
     <lb/>the members of the government, and it<lb/>was said they would never be returned<lb/>to the House. By whom was such a<lb/>statement made? Surely he must be a<lb/>paragon of perfection. The immaculate<lb/>member censuring the government for<lb/>favoring confederation appeared to him<lb/>like Satan rebuking sin. He (Mr. L.)<lb/>would now look at another part of the<lb/>Minute of Council which confederates<lb/>were very fond of quoting :<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>"The Council can only further express a<lb/>hope that the government and parliament will<lb/>adopt this question (that is the Land Question)<lb/>as their own, and make such persistent and<lb/>powerful representations thereon to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial authorities as may result in obtaining<lb/>redress for this injured colony. Success would<lb/>be productive of the best results. It would<lb/>establish the prestige of the Dominion ; cause<lb/>a spontaneous, not an artificial reaction of<lb/>public opinion in Prince Edward Island."<lb/>(Hear, hear, from several hon members.)<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>He would ask was it any harm to request<lb/>the Dominion Parliament to make the<lb/>Land Question of this Island their own?<lb/>And if they succeeded in settling it there<lb/>would be a great reaction in the feelings<lb/>of the people of this Island towards them.<lb/>They said they would settle the question,<lb/>and the government told them to do so.<lb/>It was used as an argument in favor of<lb/>confederation that the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>

            <p>ernment had so much more power with 
     <lb/>the British Parliament than we had, and<lb/>it was deemed advisable to test their<lb/>power. The result proved that they had<lb/>no more power than ourselves to settle<lb/>this long existing grievance. He (Mr.<lb/>L.) would challenge his hon member to<lb/>put his finger on any passage in the<lb/>Minute of Council to prove that the<lb/>government pledged themselves to accept<lb/>confederation, even had the Dominion<lb/>Government settled the Land Question.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BREC1">Mr. BRECKEN</persName> said the government<lb/>could not pledge themselves to that, but<lb/>they threw in their weight, and did all<lb/>they could.<lb/>

There<lb/>was not even a wish expressed ; it was<lb/>only giving them a chance to prove that<lb/>their pretended power was real, and had<lb/>they been honest statesmen, they would<lb/>have performed what they were asked<lb/>to do. It was states, in a speech delivered<lb/>in the Ottawa Parliament, but Sir John<lb/>A. McDonald, that the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment saw eye to eye with the Dominion<lb/>Government on the question of coercing<lb/>the people of Red River into submission<lb/>to the Canadian authorities. The British<lb/>Government had stained their escutcheon<lb/>when they forced their trade upon the<lb/>unwilling Chinese; and he (Mr. L.)<lb/>hoped we might never see their banner<lb/>unfurled to crush the free-born people of<lb/>Red River unless justice was first meted<lb/>out to them. He (Mr. L.) was sorry to<lb/>see the hon member for Charlottetown<lb/>(Mr. Brecken) desire that we should<lb/>join a country and pay taxes to a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to help carry on a war against<lb/>another colony. The hon member (Mr.<lb/>Brecken) was willing to take the " Better<lb/>Terms, " with the addition of a railroad<lb/>from Summerside to Georgetown.<lb/>

The<lb/>hon member had also spoken very hard<lb/>against the Canadians ; but the truth<lb/>was, Canada had made rapid strides in<lb/>civilization, in agricultural progress, and<lb/>commercial prosperity. In 1841, when<lb/>the two Canadas were united, they had<lb/>not half the population they had at<lb/>present. With the difficulties of an un<lb break="no"/>happy situation to contend with, they<lb/>had made rapid progress - they had built<lb/>railways.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HAVI1">Hon. Mr. HAVILAND</persName>.-In 1867 the debt<lb/>of Canada was sixty-seven millions of<lb/>dollars, which was very small in pro<lb break="no"/>portion to the great benefits derived from<lb/>the expenditure of the money. Canada<lb/>had two-thousand miles of railroad, and<lb/>the finest canals in the world, and their<lb/>public buildings had cost millions of<lb/>dollars. The hon member seemed to<lb/>have a great horror of confederation<lb/>now than when he made his speech at<lb/>Summerside, or when he signed the<lb/>Minute of Council. The United States<lb/>were opposed to the confederation of<lb/>those provinces, because they considered<lb/>that if they remained separate there<lb/>would be a greater probability of them<lb/>being united to their great country. The<lb/>government had a great horror of re<lb break="no"/>ceiving money from Canada, but they<lb/>wished them to settle the Land Question.<lb/>A Machiavellian policy again. The hon<lb/>member (Mr. Laird) said they had not<lb/>pledged themselves to accept confedera<lb break="no"/>tion in case the Canadians succeeded in<lb/>settling the Land Question ; but Lord<lb/>Granville thought differently. He (Mr.<lb/>H.) believed the Dominion Government<lb/>would never have taken the trouble to<lb/>send down those proposals unless they<lb/>had been encouraged to do so by the<lb/>Island Government. The hon member<lb/>talked of shedding blood at Red River ;<lb/>but the only blood shed there was<lb/>that of a man named Scott, who was<lb/>shot by Riel, and this was the man the<lb/>hon member had such sympathy for.<lb/>That territory was given to a company in<lb/>the reign of Charles II, and all the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government had done was to buy<lb/>out the rights of that company ; but the<lb/>hon member (Mr. Laird) would not wish<lb/>

            <p>
     A discussion of a conversional cha<lb break="no"/>racter took place on the resolution sub<lb break="no"/>mitted by Hon. Mr. Howlan on Thursday<lb/>night, and principally on that part of it<lb/>which expressed the opinion that the<lb/>people of this Island were almost unani<lb break="no"/>mously opposed to any change in the<lb/>constitution of the Colony.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HEND3">Hon. Mr. HENDERSON</persName> said if the reso<lb break="no"/>lution before this hon. committee had<lb/>elicited nothing new on the question of<lb/>confederation, the portion of it which<lb/>affirmed that, " the people of this colony<lb/>were almost unanimous in their opposi<lb break="no"/>tion " to that question, had given the<lb/>discussion a turn that demanded from<lb/>him a few additional observations. Hon.<lb/>members who favored confederation,<lb/>affirmed that not a few of the French<lb/>population of the colony were prepared<lb/>to vote for union at the next general<lb/>election. On this point he was not in a<lb/>position to say either yea or nay.

               important subject together with what<lb/>he had lately heard from many of them,<lb/>would justify him when he asserted in<lb/>the strongest terms, that the confederates<lb/>in the Murray Harbor District were ex<lb break="no"/>tremely few and far between. Though<lb/>he had so often condemned the extreme<lb break="no"/>ly unjust and provoking means by which<lb/>Nova Scotia had been forced into the<lb/>confederacy, without the consent of the<lb/>people, and in spite of everything they<lb/>could do to prevent it, he must once<lb/>more cull a few facts illustrative of the<lb/>feelings that lately pervaded many parts<lb/>of it, and which were not extinct at the<lb/>present moment. In July 1867, he hap<lb break="no"/>pened to be at New Glasgow the very<lb/>day on which the North American Act<lb/>of confederation was proclaimed the<lb/>law of the land. This was certainly an<lb/>extraordinary event in the history of<lb/>North America and it evoked demon<lb break="no"/>strations which were equally so. He<lb/>carefully scanned every flag that floated<lb/>in the breeze, and could only see one in<lb/>its proper position, while many were to<lb/>be seen half mast high, with a few black<lb/>ones, and some stars and stripes ! On<lb/>the first of July 1868, he was at Halifax,<lb/>and in company with an intelligent gen<lb break="no"/>tleman from Quebec, visited the princi<lb break="no"/>pal streets of the city. His companion<lb/>was an ardent unionist, but one who<lb/>was determined to examine things for<lb/>himself, and when he saw the more<lb/>handful of bunting that indicated the<lb/>dwellings and establishments of the con<lb break="no"/>federates, he looked at him (Mr. H.)<lb/>with a countenance that discovered no<lb/>joy, and remarked, to the effect, that if<lb/>the strength of the unionists was to be<lb/>estimated by their banners they were<lb/>but a very small force in the capital. It<lb/>was well known that hte Nova Scotians<lb/>had been always distinguished fro pro<lb break="no"/>found loyalty ; and it was to that source,<lb/>more than to any other, that their pre<lb break="no"/>sent quietness was to be attributed. It<lb/>was all very well to lay due stress on<lb/>the tone of private letters from Nova<lb/>Scotia. He also had a few intelligent<lb/>correspondents, and many friends there,<lb/>but was in possession of a copy of a<lb/>public Minute of Council from the Exe<lb break="no"/>cutive Government of that Province to<lb/>the Colonial Minister, relative to the<lb/>vexed question on which he could lay<lb/>much greater stress than could be safely<lb/>done on any thing of a private nature.<lb/>That minute contained flat contradic<lb break="no"/>tions of statements made by the colonial<lb/>Minister in one of his despatches to the<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:HEND3">Hon. Mr. HENDERSON</persName> would tell the 
     <lb/>hon. member that in his opinion the lan<lb break="no"/>guage alluded to was the result of the<lb/>speaker's overheated state of mind.<lb/>But he (Mr. H.) would tell him besides,<lb/>that if the Dominion Government had<lb/>acted prudently toward the people of<lb/>Red River, much of the confusion that<lb/>now existed there might have been pre<lb break="no"/>vented. It might have appeared to the<lb/>Dominion Government a very conveni<lb break="no"/>ent thing to find offices for troublesome<lb/>friends and supporters, by sending them<lb/>off to the distant region, but common<lb/>sense, with the history of Canada itself<lb/>before them, should have suggested the<lb/>suspicion that the wishes of some 15,000<lb/>inhabitants could not be totally ignored<lb/>with safety. That some public man of<lb/>the Dominion should be appointed<lb/>Governor, appeared quite right and<lb/>necessary, but he contended that the<lb/>subordinate officers should have been<lb/>chosen from among the people them<lb break="no"/>selves, which, if judiciously done, would<lb/>greatly tend to conciliate the masses.<lb/>The hon. member (Mr. Brecken) made<lb/>some allusion, during this discussion, to<lb/>the magnificent mansions of the merchant<lb/>princes in the cities, and to the public<lb/>buildings of Canada, generally, as proofs<lb/>of the greatness of that country, and as<lb/>reasons why we should be prepared to<lb/>cast in our lot with the Dominion. That<lb/>there were such mansions and merchants<lb/>in Canada, could not be denied ; but he<lb/>contended that many of the humbler<lb/>classes experienced the very opposite<lb/>extreme.

            <p>" 1. WHEREAS, The people of this Island value<lb/>highly the powers and privileges which as a<lb/>Colony of the British Empire, they now exer<lb break="no"/>cise and enjoy.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"And Whereas, This Island having prospered<lb/>under the Constitution granted by the Parent<lb/>Country, its inhabitants are exceedingly averse<lb/>to any change in their political condition,<lb/>which would take the management of the affairs<lb/>of the Colony out of their hands, and place<lb/>them under the control of a distant Govern<lb break="no"/>ment.<lb/>

            <p>"And Whereas, This House believe that a<lb/>Union of this Island with the Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, as proposed in a Minute of the Privy Coun<lb break="no"/>cil of Canada, dated the 14th Decemer, 1869,<lb/>would be inimical tot he best interests of the<lb/>Colony - Thereed RESOLVED, That, this<lb/>House cannot entertain the said proposals of<lb/>the Dominion Government, and consequently<lb/>approve of the general tenor of the reply of the<lb/>Executive Government of this Island, as ex0<lb/>pressed in their Minutes of Council, dated res<lb break="no"/>pectively the Seventh day of January and the<lb/>Fourth Day of February, 1870.<lb/>

            <p>"2. WHEREAS, By a recent Despatch from<lb/>Earl Granville, Her Majesty's Principal Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State for the Colonies, dated the 7th<lb/>day of March, 1870, it is stated that, in his opin<lb break="no"/>ion, the Government of Prince Edward Island<lb/>will not act wisely if they allow themselves to<lb/>be diverted from their own real interests for<lb/>the sake of keeping alive a claim against the<lb/>Imperial Government, which it is quite certain<lb/>will never be acknowledged. And Whereas,<lb/>This House believe that the best interests of<lb/>the Island will be promoted by remaining its<lb/>present form of Government under the Crown<lb/>of Great Britain. And Whereas, but the inti<lb break="no"/>mation given in the above Despatch, this Island<lb/>is left in an exceptional position, as compared<lb/>with the Provinces of the Dominion in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter of Crown Lands and Territorial Revenues -<lb/> Therefore RESOLVED, That we, the people's<lb/>Representatives, feel it to be our duty to op<lb break="no"/>pose a Union with the Dominion of Canada,<lb/>and to express our opinion that the people of<lb/>this Island, while loyal in their attachment to<lb/>the Crown and Government of Great Britain,<lb/>are nevertheless almost unanimously opposed<lb/>to any change in the Constitution of the<lb/>Colony."<lb/>

     Hon. Mr. Kelly stated that as he had 
     <lb/>occupied the position of chairman during<lb/>the debate on confederation, he had been<lb/>deprived of the privilege of giving ex<lb break="no"/>pression to his opinion on this important<lb/>
     subkect ; and as every conceivable phase 
     <lb/>
     of the question had been discussed al<lb break="no"/>ready, any lengthened remarks now<lb/>
     would necessarily be a repetition of the 
     <lb/>ideas expressed by hon members who<lb/>
     had previously spoken. He (Mr. K.) 
     <lb/>was entirely opposed to confederation on<lb/>any terms. It was his unalterable de<lb break="no"/>termination to use his utmost exertions<lb/>to keep our independent legislature, and<lb/>he hoped it would be a long time before<lb/>we should be dependent on a legislature<lb/>seven or eight hundred miles from us,<lb/>with only two or three members to re<lb break="no"/>present us is it.
