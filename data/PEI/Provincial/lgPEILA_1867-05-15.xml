<!-- </p> <p>them rather go naked than vote for him (Dr. Jen<lb break="no"/>kins.)<lb/>
</p> <p>Hon. Mr. HENDERSON was surprised at the<lb/>
manner in which the hon. Leader of the Government<lb/>
was acting in relation to his Bill. There appeared<lb/>
to be some misunderstanding between him and His<lb/>
Excellency the Lieut. Governor. He was astonished<lb/>
that some hon. members should contend that raw<lb/>
recruits were as good as trained soldiers. They might<lb/>
with equal justice, say that the shop boy with one<lb/>
day's acquaintance with his business was as good as<lb/>
the trained clerk. He did not understand how the<lb/>
Militia movement could be regarded as a Confederate<lb/>
"dodge." Confederation was a new question, while<lb/>
Militia acts were of old standing. Though he did<lb/>
not advocate carrying the matter of Militia training<lb/>
too far, still it was absurd to suppose that people<lb/>
could be prepared for action in the field with only<lb/>
a few days' notice.<lb/>
</p> <p>Hon. ATTY. GENERAL would assure the hon.<lb/>
member for Murray Harbor, that there was no mis<lb break="no"/>understanding with His Excellency in the matter of<lb/>
this Bill. all anxiety on that point might be dis<lb break="no"/>missed.<lb/>
</p> <p>The amendment that the words "and the perform<lb break="no"/>ance of the Statute labor," be struck out of the clause,<lb/>
was then put and carried.<lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:COLE1">Hon. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT</persName>.—He <lb/>
was not a supporter of the Government. <lb/></p>

<p><persName ref="pers:BREC1">Mr. BRECKEN</persName>.—He attended the caucus at the <lb/>
formation, for a trepanning operation upon him was <lb/>
threatened by a certain hon. member during one of <lb/>
these meetings. He would congratulate the Gov- <lb/>
ernment upon their acquisition. The Conservatives <lb/>
had had him for four or five years, and be never <lb/>
bounced true, and now he was repudiated by the <lb/>
Liberals. The Government were acting strangely <lb/>
with a Bill coming, as this one did, from His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency. The hon. Leader of the Government, a few <lb/>
days since, characterized the militia training as "tom<lb break="no"/>foolery," and he this morning supported the Bill be<lb break="no"/>fore the Committee, which was to be enacted for the <lb/>
purpose of compelling the people to play the tom-fool, <lb/>
and very lately voted £2500 to keep up the foolery. <lb/>
The Leader of the Opposition might be twitted for <lb/>
being so strong a unionist, but he was not working. <lb/>
so effectually in the cause as was the present disgrace<lb break="no"/>ful Government. The most departmental officer in <lb/>
the House was the doorkeeper, and the Bill had better <lb/>
be handed over to him. When His Excellency en<lb break="no"/>quired what had become of the Bill, the thing called a <lb/>
Government would be responsible. The hon. Leader <lb/>
would have to answer, " l opposed the Bill because it <lb/>
was intended to patch up tom-foolery." The hon. <lb/>
member for Tryon would say that it was in his opinion <lb/>
"a political dodge to drive us into Confederation," <lb/>
while the hon. member for Belfast will give as the <lb/>
reason for his opposition that" it took men from their <lb/>
business and was it useless expense to the country <lb/></p>

    <p><persName ref="pers:HENS1">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>- It was useless <lb/>
for the Opposition to find fault, because this Bill was <lb/>
not made a Government uncasure, when they, while in <lb/>
power, allowed the question of confederation to remain <lb/>
an open one. The Opposition need not twit the <lb/>
Government with being divided when we had seen <lb/>
one at their own members put out of the Executive. <lb/>
He did not desire either the sympathy or assistance <lb/>
of the Opposition in the manner in which they were<lb/>
giving it.<lb/></p>

<p>After a lengthy discussion the motion that the<lb/>
Speaker take the chair was lost on the division of 16 to<lb/>
3.<lb/></p>
