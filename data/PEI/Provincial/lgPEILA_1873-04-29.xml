            <p>
     The legislators who cannot keep the  
     <lb/>
    total expenses of the session within the 
     <lb/>limit of $4,000; should be cashiered 
     <lb/>by the people. The hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>Government puts down in his figures 
     <lb/>the cost of a general and partial elec<lb break="no"/>tion for every year ; perhaps this is 
     <lb/>because his own government is so weak 
     <lb/>that it will not stand longer than that. 
     <lb/>I consider one-fourth of that amount 
     <lb/>sufficient to be placed in our annual 
     <lb/>Expenditure, under confederation. 
     <lb/>The greater part of the sum expended 
     <lb/>for public printing last year, was paid 
     <lb/>to the printers employed by the Coali<lb break="no"/>tion Government. All the Custom 
     <lb/>House printing, will, under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, belong to the Dominion, which 
     <lb/>will reduce the usual outlay consider 
     <lb/>ably. All expenses of Light Houses 
     <lb/>will be included in Dominion expenses. 
     <lb/>The 9000 spent in the Steam Dredge 
     <lb/>should not be placed in our annual 
     <lb/>expenditure, as we shall not require 
     <lb/>one every year. Nor will we require 
     <lb/>a New Court House, and Jail an<lb break="no"/>nually. I consider that $54,000 am<lb break="no"/>ple for the yearly Expenditure of the 
     <lb/>Board of Works under Confederation. 
     <lb/>The Miscellaneous include many items 
     <lb/>which will belong to the Dominion, to 
     <lb/>the extent of $4247.73 leaving only 
     <lb/>$2550.33 for the expenses of the local 
     <lb/>government, under this head. But 
     <lb/>the hon. Leader of the Government 
     <lb/>takes this sum, without analyzing it, 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     jumbles it altogether and charges it to 
     <lb/>
     the local government. Making all 
     <lb/>
     necessary allowances, I should say 
     <lb/>
     that our total Expenditure, under Con<lb break="no"/>federation will not exceed $205,038.85, 
     <lb/>
     per annum. Then, as regards our 
     <lb/>
     Receipts under Confederation, he states 
     <lb/>
     that one-third of the amounts due for 
     <lb/>
     Public Lands sold by the government, 
     <lb/>
     will be lost. I contend that the sum 
     <lb/>
     allowed us for the purchase of lands 
     <lb/>
     will go a long way, if properly man<lb break="no"/>aged. We are now paying six per 
     <lb/>
     cent for money, and I consider the one 
     <lb/>
     per cent difference in the interest un<lb break="no"/>der Confederation will fully make up 
     <lb/>
    for all the loss we may sustain on our 
     <lb/>public lands. I believe that the Land 
     <lb/>Subsidy allowed us will be fully worth 
     <lb/>$45,000 per year to the Colony, and 
     <lb/>will therefore allow no reduction of 
     <lb/>that item. I will allow any financier 
     <lb/>in or out of this Colony to judge be<lb break="no"/>tween my financial statement and that 
     <lb/>of His Honor the Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and to say which is correct. 
     <lb/>I will put my word and reputation be<lb break="no"/>fore his, and allow the public to judge 
     <lb/>between us. Taking the whole mat<lb break="no"/>ter into consideration ; if his honor has 
     <lb/>no better reasons for another Delega<lb break="no"/>tion to Ottawa than he has adduced, he  
     <lb/>might as well have no recess, for he 
     <lb/>has not given a single argument in 
     <lb/>support of his claim for better terms, 
     <lb/>that will be entertained by the Domi<lb break="no"/>-->

            <!-- IC, 2018-08-17, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
           
    <!-- nion Government. I have not the 
     <lb/>
     least doubt that if he had obtained the 
     <lb/>
     present terms, he would have boasted 
     <lb/>
     loudly of the ability displayed in ob<lb break="no"/>taining them; but the great trouble 
     <lb/>
     with him is that he did not bring them 
     <lb/>
     down himself, and he therefore, can<lb break="no"/>not accept them. The great secret of 
     <lb/>
     the matter is that the present govern<lb break="no"/>ment did not obtain the present terms, 
     <lb/>
     and they must needs put the country 
     <lb/>
     to the expense of another delegation. 
     <lb/>
     I would not be sorry to see more 
     <lb/>
     liberal terms obtained, but as there is 
     <lb/>
     not the shadow of a prospect of obtain<lb break="no"/>ing them, it would be a mere waste of 
     <lb/>
     time and money to endeavor to attempt 
     <lb/>
     to do so. The government do not 
     <lb/>
     seem to entertain the least respect for 
     <lb/>
     the Despatch from Lord Dufferin, 
     <lb/>
     stating that no better terms will be 
     <lb/>
     conceded to this Colony. Would the 
     <lb/>
     Governor-General stultify himself by 
     <lb/>
     making a statement which he knew to 
     <lb/>
     he untrue? The thing is absurd. I 
     <lb/>
     have heard the private declaration of 
     <lb/>
     members of the Dominion Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council that no appllcation need be 
     <lb/>
     made for better terms than those now 
     <lb/>
     offered, for they would not be granted. 
     <lb/>
     We asked for $10,000 a year more 
     <lb/>
     for our lands ; but received only $5,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     000, and were then told that this was 
     <lb/>
     the last concession P. E. Island would 
     <lb/>
     receive from them. The Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government invited the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment to send a delegation up to Ottawa; 
     <lb/>
     we did not invite ourselves. We re<lb break="no"/>ceived quite as much consideration 
     <lb/>
     from the Dominion government as the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Leader of the government him<lb break="no"/>self would have got, if he had been on 
     <lb/>
     that delegation. As anti-confederates, 
     <lb/>
     we were more likely to succeed in ob<lb break="no"/>taining liberal terms than he would 
     <lb/>
     have been, as he agreed to accept far 
     <lb/>
     less favorable terms than those now. 
     <lb/>
     offered. His party ran the election on 
     <lb/>
     false pretences, and now endeavor to 
     <lb/>
     cover up their change of base by send<lb break="no"/>ing off another delegation to make an 
     <lb/>
    attempt to get better terms, but they 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     cannot show the shadow of an argu<lb break="no"/>ment in favor of their action. I won<lb break="no"/>der whether the hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>Government will ask Canada to give 
     <lb/>up the Railway to this Island and 
     <lb/>allow us to work it ourselves ? If it 
     <lb/>would earn $50,000 the first year over 
     <lb/>and above working expenses, as stated 
     <lb/>by the hon. member for Alberton (Mr. 
     <lb/>Howlan), by all means get it back ; 
     <lb/>but I believe his honor the Leader of 
     <lb/>the government expects the earnings 
     <lb/>to be $20,000 a year less than work<lb break="no"/>ing expenses. I have not the least 
     <lb/>doubt that the Dominion government, 
     <lb/>if asked to do so, would willingly give 
     <lb/>up the Railway to be worked and 
     <lb/>managed by our local government.

     <lb/>$1.000 per mile over that of the Trunk 
     <lb/>Line. Now, I contend that those con<lb break="no"/>tractors could afford to have taken 
     <lb/>the Branch Contract at a lower rate 
     <lb/>than the Trunk Line: but it appeared 
     <lb/>they were privileged by the late gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and allowed to draw the 
     <lb/>whole of the debentures due them on 
     <lb/>the Trunk Line as the work proceeded, 
     <lb/>instead of only ninety per cent accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the original contract. This was 
     <lb/>nothing less than a compromise. The 
     <lb/>hon. junior member for Belfast con<lb break="no"/>sidered that the Branch contract was 
     <lb/>let at a cheaper rate than the trunk 
     <lb/>line. I differ from him, and can show 
     <lb/>that the Branch Line is by far the 
     <lb/>higher contract when the nature of 
     <lb/>the country, &amp;c., is considered. Not<lb break="no"/>withstanding all the charges made by 
     <lb/>members of the late government 
     <lb/>against their predecessors, in reference 
     <lb/>to letting the trunk contract to an 
     <lb/>alleged Ring, they themselves let the 
     <lb/>Branch contract to the same parties. 
     <lb/>Our local men should have received 
     <lb/>due consideration instead of being un<lb break="no"/>ceremoniously thrown overboard as 
     <lb/>they were, in this case. I do not 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     blame the contractors in the least, for 
     <lb/>
     they had a perfect right to attend to 
     <lb/>
     their own interests, but I blame the 
     <lb/>
     late government for not protecting the 
     <lb/>
     interests of their country, as they 
     <lb/>
     should have done. When the Coali<lb break="no"/>tion government went out of power, 
     <lb/>
     they were charged by the hon. junior 
     <lb/>
     member for Belfast and his friends 
     <lb/>
     with having ruined the country by 
     <lb/>
     undertaking the construction of the 
     <lb/>
     trunk line; but when he and his 
     <lb/>
     party got into power they went to 
     <lb/>
     work and changed two of the stations 
     <lb/>
     at an enormous expense, to satisfy a 
     <lb/>
     few interested friends, thus showing 
     <lb/>
     their insincerity in their charges of 
     <lb/>
     extravagance. The hon. member and 
     <lb/>
     his friends in the late government 
     <lb/>
     made numberless charges against their 
     <lb/>
     predecessors in reference to curves in 
     <lb/>
     the line, spruce sleepers, stumps in 
     <lb/>
     the road, wire fence, &amp;c., and an in<lb break="no"/>vestigation of these matters having 
     <lb/>
     been called for, two competent engineers 
     <lb/>
     were employed, who after a thorough 
     <lb/>
     inspection, and survey, sent in their 
     <lb/>
     Report. This report stated that the 
     <lb/>
     road was properly staked out and all 
     <lb/>
     the work upon it thoroughly and satis<lb break="no"/>factorily done; but the report was 
     <lb/>
     kept locked up for several months in<lb break="no"/>stead of being published for the infor<lb break="no"/>mation of the people, who were really 
     <lb/>
    interested in the result of that inves<lb break="no"/>tigation. Instead of being sorry for 
     <lb/>the false charges they had made, and 
     <lb/>honestly confessing that they had 
     <lb/>done wrong, the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Belfast and his party still vainly tried 
     <lb/>to defend their course, and to condemn 
     <lb/>the Coalition Government; but their 
     <lb/>charges now fall harmless to the 
     <lb/>ground. Several hon. members of this 
     <lb/>House were at the last election return<lb break="no"/>ed to support Confederation, but it 
     <lb/>was different with myself and hon. 
     <lb/>colleague as we were pledged in a 
     <lb/>great measure against it. Many ob<lb break="no"/>jections have, from time to time been 
     <lb/>made against me, because I am a Con<lb break="no"/>federate, but I promised my constituents 
     <lb/>
          
           <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMERTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">77</fw>
            
           
     at the two former elections that I 
     <lb/>
     would not vote for Confederation with<lb break="no"/>out their consent. When contesting 
     <lb/>
     the late election, my hon. colleague 
     <lb/>
     and I were pledged to get. better 
     <lb/>
     terms if possible; but I stated that if 
     <lb/>
     better terms could not be obtained. I 
     <lb/>
     would accept the present terms. The 
     <lb/>
     late government did not give the peo<lb break="no"/>ple the information necessary to enable 
     <lb/>
     them to form a correct opinion upon 
     <lb/>
     the question they were called upon to 
     <lb/>
     decide. It is true they did issue a 
     <lb/>
               supplementary <hi rendition="simple:italic">Gazette</hi> on the 15th 
     <lb/>
     March last, containing garbled state<lb break="no"/>ments, but the next 'issue contained 
     <lb/>
     nothing at all about the subject. The 
     <lb/>
               next numberof the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Gazette</hi> containing 
     <lb/>
     the official announcement of the terms 
     <lb/>
     did not reach the people generally, 
     <lb/>
     till after the election was over so that 
     <lb/>
     during the contest, the people were 
     <lb/>
     without reliable information upon the 
     <lb/>
     question before the country. It is 
     <lb/>
     unfair, therefore, for the present op<lb break="no"/>position to charge hon. members on 
     <lb/>
     this side of the House with having 
     <lb/>
     acted inconsistently, as we really had 
     <lb/>
     no terms before us at the late election. 
     <lb/>
     Last night the hon. jun. member for 
     <lb/>
     Belfast stated that the Dominion tariff 
     <lb/>
     was as high as 13 1/2 per cent in 1870, 
     <lb/>
     and that it is now down to 9 1/2 per 
     <lb/>
     cent, showing a reduction of four per 
     <lb/>
     cent; but he forgot to tell us how the 
     <lb/>
     Revenue is raised in Canada. We 
     <lb/>
     know that many large items for which 
     <lb/>
     we pay from the Treasury are there 
     <lb/>
     paid for by local taxation. In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion we may float along for a few 
     <lb/>
     years by accepting the present terms 
     <lb/>
     but we will be forced to resort to 
     <lb/>
     heavy local taxation before long, to 
     <lb/>
     supply our requirements, as they are 
     <lb/>
     continually increasing. According to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member's mode of reasoning, 
     <lb/>
     l do not wonder he does not want 
     <lb/>
     better terms ; if I could see through 
     <lb/>
     his glasses, I would also be satisfied 
     <lb/>
     with the present terms ; but I cannot 
     <lb/>
     see the matter in the light he does. 
     <lb/>
     It now appears clear that whether we 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
          
     accept Confederation or not, we will 
     <lb/>
     be taxed, and therefore, the best we 
     <lb/>
     can do is to choose the least of two 
     <lb/>
     evils. When the resolution in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of another Delegation 
     <lb/>
     is submitted, I am prepared to vote 
     <lb/>
    for it, as I believe we shall receivé 
     <lb/>still more liberal terms. I cannot see 
     <lb/>why the Opposition will not join hands 
     <lb/>with the government in this matter, 
     <lb/>and thus strengthen their hands in ob<lb break="no"/>taining the best possible terms, before 
     <lb/>accepting Confederation. The hon. 
     <lb/>junior member for Belfast said that 
     <lb/>perhaps some little matters might be 
     <lb/>conceded to this delegation. Well, 
     <lb/>several small things put together may 
     <lb/>be of great importance to this little 
     <lb/>Colony. The hon. member mentioned 
     <lb/>the Summerside light-house and the 
     <lb/>the Tignish Breakwater among those 
     <lb/>items, and as if not worth attention 
     <lb/>from the Dominion. Several ot such 
     <lb/>items put together make a large and 
     <lb/>important matter, well worthy of con<lb break="no"/>sideration and an effort on our part to 
     <lb/>obtain compensation. New Brunswick 
     <lb/>once thought she had very good terms, 
     <lb/>but she is now very much dissatisfied 
     <lb/>with them. and is asking for Better 
     <lb/>Terms. Now is the time for us to ob<lb break="no"/>tain our rights at the hands of the 
     <lb/>Dominion, as we shall be almost 
     <lb/>powerless after we enter, to obtain 
     <lb/>anything in addition. We have good 
     <lb/>reason for asking better terms, as we 
     <lb/>have greater claims than any of the 
     <lb/>other Colonies on account of our isola<lb break="no"/>ted position and having no public lands, 
     <lb/>minerals or timber to fall back upon. 
     <lb/>Although Messrs. Laird and Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne deserve credit for the terms now 
     <lb/>before us, this should not prevent us 
     <lb/>from making as good a bargain as we 
     <lb/>can. As those hon. gentlemen were 
     <lb/>elected Anti-Confederates, they should 
     <lb/>have called the Legislature together 
     <lb/>before constituting themselves into a 
     <lb/>Delegation to seek terms of Union with 
     <lb/>Canada. They had no right to go 
     <lb/>upon that Delegation before calling a 
     <lb/>session of the House. If the Legisla<lb break="no"/>

     ture had been convened for two or 
     <lb/>
     three weeks and consulted in reference 
     <lb/>
     to this matter, the late government 
     <lb/>
     would have acted wisely, and would 
     <lb/>
     perhaps have many in their ranks 
     <lb/>
     to-day who are now on this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House. Although the late Delegates 
     <lb/>
    obtained very liberal concessions, they 
     <lb/>are not thereby exonerated from blame. 
     <lb/>The country has been taken by sur<lb break="no"/>prise on this question, and the conse<lb break="no"/>quence is, that many of the districts 
     <lb/>are still strongly Anti-Confederate. 
     <lb/>I consider that the present state of 
     <lb/>our finances and our public credit re<lb break="no"/>quires every representative to act for 
     <lb/>the best interests of the country, and I 
     <lb/>do not see anything left us but to ac<lb break="no"/>cept the terms we now have, if, after 
     <lb/>making every effort, we cannot get 
     <lb/>better terms. The credit of the coun<lb break="no"/>try has been so much injured abroad, 
     <lb/>that it will be almost impossible to re<lb break="no"/>store it, and additional taxes would, 
     <lb/>at present, be very, obnoxious to the 
     <lb/>people generally. The hon. junior 
     <lb/>member for Belfast stated this morning 
     <lb/>that our duty upon liquors should be 
     <lb/>raised till equal to that of the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion ; but last night he stated that the 
     <lb/>Dominion Tariff was much lower than 
     <lb/>ours. Now I cannot understand that 
     <lb/>mode of reasoning: if our tariff is 
     <lb/>much higher than theirs, why 
     <lb/>should we raise it to make it equal ?: 
     <lb/>Under our present circumstances, I see 
     <lb/>nothing left us but to accept Confed» 
     <lb/>eration. I stated at last election, that 
     <lb/>if I found that the credit of the coun<lb break="no"/>try could not be maintained, I should 
     <lb/>endeavor to get better terms, and if 
     <lb/>these could be got I would accept 
     <lb/>the terms now before us. I shall, 
     <lb/>therefore, vote for sending a Delega<lb break="no"/>tion to seek Better Terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Mr: Sinclair.—In addressing you 
     <lb/>
     on this great question I shall endeavour. 
     <lb/>
     
     more particularly to reply to the Speech<lb/>
     
     made by the hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment last night. One of his princi<lb break="no"/>pal arguments was that it was all on<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     account of the bad legislation of the 
     <lb/>
     late government during the past year 
     <lb/>
     that we are now forced to seek admis<lb break="no"/>sion into the Dominion of Canada, that 
     <lb/>
     there was; extravagance in every 
     <lb/>
     branch of the publie service, and that 
     <lb/>
     if they had managed the affairs of the 
     <lb/>
     country as well as the Coalition had, 
     <lb/>
     we would not be in the position we are 
     <lb/>
     in today. Now, I maintain that this 
     <lb/>
     Colony was brought into its present 
     <lb/>
     position by the action of the Coalition 
     <lb/>
    Government in passing the Railway   
     <lb/>Bill: His honor the Leader of the 
     <lb/>Government was then clearly told by 
     <lb/>the members of the Opposition what 
     <lb/>the result of the passing of that mea<lb break="no"/>sure would be, and if hon. members 
     <lb/>will take the trouble to turn up the 
     <lb/>speeches on the Railway Question in 
     <lb/>the Parliamentary Reporter of 1871, 
     <lb/>they will find the protests of the 0p<lb break="no"/>position as clearly set forth as if now 
     <lb/>delivered. No government could carry 
     <lb/>on the affairs of the country satisfac<lb break="no"/>torily for any length of time with our 
     <lb/>present Revenue and send out of the 
     <lb/>country the interest of our Railway 
     <lb/>debt, in gold. The late government 
     <lb/>has been blamed for passing the 
     <lb/>Branches without making any provis<lb break="no"/>ion for their construction. Now those 
     <lb/>Branches were the result of the action 
     <lb/>of the Coalition Government, as, at the 
     <lb/>opening of the six days' session, they 
     <lb/>brought down in the Speech, a para<lb break="no"/>graph promising their immediate con<lb break="no"/>struction. But :as they were then in a 
     <lb/>minority, they did not succeed in even 
     <lb/>getting a committee appointed to pre<lb break="no"/>pare the Draft Address in Reply to the 
     <lb/>Speech with which the Session was 
     <lb/>opened. The House was then dissolved 
     <lb/>and we all went to the people at the 
     <lb/>polls on that question. The result. 
     <lb/>was that four members were returned 
     <lb/>pledged to go for the party that would 
     <lb/>go for the Branch lines and without 
     <lb/>whom it was impossible to form a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, so that we had either to pro<lb break="no"/>mise to construct the Branches or 
     <lb/>allow the then hon. Leader. of the 
     <lb/>
          
           <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">79</fw>
          
     Opposition to form a government with<lb/>these hon. members. If we had done 
     <lb/>
     the latter, we need never have gone to 
     <lb/>
    our   constituents as candidates for   
     <lb/>Legislative honors again. There was 
     <lb/>nothing left us, therefore, but to under<lb break="no"/>take the construction of the Branches. 
     <lb/>As a dissolution at that time could not 
     <lb/>be obtained, we stated, that the present 
     <lb/>session would be ample time to make 
     <lb/>provision for the construction of the 
     <lb/>Branch lines, and this is now found to 
     <lb/>be the case, for there has not been a 
     <lb/>single debenture yet issued for that 
     <lb/>purpose. The late government found 
     <lb/>that the remittance of a sufficient sum 
     <lb/>of money to London to pay the interest 
     <lb/>on the Debentures was more than the 
     <lb/>country could stand, and it was ascer<lb break="no"/>tained that before another twelve 
     <lb/>months rolled round, we should be pay<lb break="no"/>ing interest on no less a sum than 3 1/4 
     <lb/>millions of dollars on account of the 
     <lb/>construction of the Railway and 
     <lb/>Branches. That amount will all have 
     <lb/>to be provided for this Session if 
     <lb/>we do not enter the Dominion. To 
     <lb/>cover the interest of that vast Railway 
     <lb/>debt, we would require to make an 
     <lb/>annual remittance of $195,000 in gold; 
     <lb/>to London. We then took into con<lb break="no"/>sideration the returns of the railroad 
     <lb/>&amp;c.. and found that it would cost from 
     <lb/>$50,000 to $100,000 a year more than<lb/>the total amount of its earnings. If 
     <lb/>the hon. Leader of the Government is 
     <lb/>not satisfied with the present terms, 
     <lb/>and wishes to have'the Railroad back, 
     <lb/>that we may work it ourselves, I have 
     <lb/>not the least doubt the Dominion 
     <lb/>Government will be willing to give it 
     <lb/>to us on that condition. But reckless 
     <lb/>as the present government are, I do 
     <lb/>not believe they want the Railway 
     <lb/>back, as they could hardly get a party 
     <lb/>to stick to them if they undertook to 
     <lb/>work the Railroad at the expense of 
     <lb/>this Colony. No man who deserves 
     <lb/>the name of a statesman would attempt 
     <lb/>to levy taxation for any purpose be<lb break="no"/>fore it is required. As far as the sur<lb break="no"/>vey of the Branch lines was concern<lb break="no"/>
   
            <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">79</fw>
         
        ed, there was suffiicient money raised 
     <lb/>by the increase on the duties on liquors 
     <lb/>to pay its whole cost. The western 
     <lb/>Branch was reckoned from the first, to 
     <lb/>be between 12 or 15 miles in length 
     <lb/>and the eastern one between 35 or 
     <lb/>40 miles, both altogether making about 
     <lb/>50 miles. There has been no imposi<lb break="no"/>tion practised by the late government 
     <lb/>in the House in reference to the length 
     <lb/>of the road, as it is now found after 
     <lb/>the line is surveyed that the total 
     <lb/>length is a trifle less than fifty miles. 
     <lb/>This clearly proves the benefit of hav<lb break="no"/>ing the line surveyed and located be<lb break="no"/>fore letting the contract. When the 
     <lb/>Bill for constructing the Trunk line 
     <lb/>was introduced, some hon. members of 
     <lb/>the government said the length of the 
     <lb/>road would be 120 miles and other 
     <lb/>said it would be 125 miles, but after 
     <lb/>allowing the contractors to make their 
     <lb/>own survey the length was greatly 
     <lb/>increased. I was accused of being the 
     <lb/>cause of making one curve in the line. 
     <lb/>I did use my influence to bring the 
     <lb/>road to Kensington, but I did not ask 
     <lb/>to have it turned right back again to 
     <lb/>Bedeque. I think the people of Ken<lb break="no"/>sington may thank the hon. member 
     <lb/>for Indian River for getting the line   
     <lb/>brought to that place, and not me, as I 
     <lb/>had no influence with the government. 
     <lb/>It was the pressure brought to bear 
     <lb/>upon the hon. Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment by his own friends and support<lb break="no"/>ers that was the means of bringing the 
     <lb/>line to Kensington. The road leaves   
     <lb/>that place at almost a right angle, and 
     <lb/>it is owing to those twists and crooks 
     <lb/>that it is now 147 1/2 miles in length,or 30 
     <lb/>miles longer than the distance mention<lb break="no"/>ed in the advertisement. By surveying 
     <lb/>the Branches, before letting the con<lb break="no"/>tract, we calculated that we saved 
     <lb/>about ten miles of road, instead of <choice><sic>fol<lb break="no"/>owing</sic><corr>following</corr></choice> the course pursued by the 
     <lb/>Coalition Government. The American 
     <lb/>Engineers have not cleared the Coali<lb break="no"/>tion from all blame. They cleared 
     <lb/>the Contractors and the Engineers by 
     <lb/>declaring that the work was well done

           but they said that the manner in which<lb/>the contract was let was the cause of<lb/>the whole blunder, and that if it had<lb/>been let in the United States instead<lb/>of on this Island, we would have been<lb/>worse bitten than we are. The hon.<lb/>member for Summerside (Mr. Lefurgy)<lb/>stated that the change of Summerside<lb/>Station cost $100,000. Now it did<lb/>not cost the country half that amount,<lb/>as the whole cost was only $40,000.<lb/>The Railway Commissioners valued<lb/>the Land damages of both lines and<lb/>reported to the government that the<lb/>front line, or the one now adopted,<lb/>would be the cheaper one. No one<lb/>but an extreme political partizan would<lb/>disapprove of the change of that Sta<lb break="no"/>tion. The hon. Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment declared that in Charlottetown<lb/>the Railway should run along the<lb/>heads of all the wharves. If so, why<lb/>should the same rule not be applied to<lb/>Summerside also ? The members of<lb/>the late government consulted Messrs.<lb/>Boyd and Gregory who said that<lb/>branches to stations were always ob<lb break="no"/>jectionable, and if possible should be<lb/>avoided. If ground can be obtained<lb/>at the head of the Railway Wharf the<lb/>Station should, by all means, be placed<lb/>there. We asked Mr. Boyd, Engineer,<lb/>how it would answer to fill up the<lb/>flat on the shore at the head of the<lb/>wharf, for a station ground, and he<lb/>said it was the proper place for it,<lb/>that he had never recommended the<lb/>upper station, but had laid it off by<lb/>order of the Coalition Government.<lb/>The Contractors, at first, wanted $80,<lb break="no"/>000 for changing that branch, but they<lb/>afterwards came down to $40,000, and<lb/>will, I believe, require every dollar of<lb/>that sum to carry out the change. If<lb/>the Railway is to do any good to Sum<lb break="no"/>merside, the line at present adopted is<lb/>in all respects the proper one, as the<lb/>people there will reap a double amount<lb/>of benefit from it, compared with the<lb/>one first laid of. In changing the<lb/>Alberton Station, we acted on the same<lb/>principle. I was one of those appoint<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
           ed to report on that Station, and in<lb/>company with four Engineers went up<lb/>to see it. The hon. member for<lb/>Alberton maintained that the place<lb/>pointed out as the ground for the Sta<lb break="no"/>tion, was not the place at all but that<lb/>the site was down below his fence. But<lb/>Mr. Ball said that it was the place<lb/>he laid off, Mr. Howlan then offered<lb/>us a place below that spot, and after<lb break="no"/>wards offered us a site in front of his<lb/>farm, which was low ground and would<lb/>require to be filled up eight feet deep<lb/>which he offered to do. We told him<lb/>we did not like that place for we found<lb/>that if filled up with earth it would<lb/>require an expensive culvert. On ex<lb break="no"/>amining, we found that the best site<lb/>for that station was Hickey's field ;<lb/>but Mr. Bell had nothing to say about<lb/>it. The people will be the judges<lb/>whether we have acted impartially or<lb/>not. Let the government change the<lb/>Summerside Station and see what pub<lb break="no"/>lic opinion on the matter will be. The<lb/>hon. Leader of the government wanted<lb/>to make out that the branches to<lb/>Souris and Tignish cost $1000 per<lb/>mile more than the trunk line ; but he<lb/>did not take into account the fact that<lb/>there are several very expensive<lb/>Bridges on the former lines which<lb/>would cost more than the amount, and<lb/>that the country will have to pay for<lb/>no more miles than was mentioned in<lb/>the Branch Bill. We had several<lb/>offers to construct those lines, but<lb/>would not accept such as that of Mr.<lb/>McNeill of Summerside. If the late<lb/>government had accepted that gentle<lb break="no"/>man's tender, I would not attempt to<lb/>stand here and justify their action, for<lb/>the tender was not worthy of an<lb/>honest man. The first part of the<lb/>work was marked on that tender three<lb/>times too high and the last part to be<lb/>performed only one-seventh of the<lb/>amount stated on the other tenders.<lb/>After the first part of the work was<lb/>finished, he could have walked off<lb/>with a handsome profit, and at a great<lb/>loss to the country, after paying the<lb/>

     amount for which he gave security, as  
     <lb/>
     the government were  bound to advance   
     <lb/>
     money according to the  tender on 
     <lb/>
     the work performed. No government 
     <lb/>
      would be justified in accepting such  
     <lb/>
     a tender. The hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>
      government charged the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment with extravagance in constructing  
     <lb/>
     bridges at Rustico, Clifton, &amp;c. We   
     <lb/>
     received from this House,   last  year, a 
     <lb/>
      vote of $87,855  for the Board of  
     <lb/>
     Works, $32,000 of which   was for 
     <lb/>
     general contracts of Roads, Bridges,  
     <lb/>
      Wharves, &amp;c., and the  balance for 
     <lb/>
     Colonial Building Light Houses, &amp;c.  
     <lb/>
     We left the present government, after   
     <lb/>
      all our expenditure, the sum of $30,<lb break="no"/>000 to begin with.  The grand cause  
     <lb/>
     of all our present difficulties was the    
     <lb/>
     construction of the Railway, which   
     <lb/>
     was undertaken against the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     three-fourths of the people of this    
     <lb/>
     country. Those districts through  
     <lb/>
     which the Railway does not pass, put   
     <lb/>
     in claims for local wants which could 
     <lb/>
     not be overlooked  by any government,  
     <lb/>
     and in several cases backed up their  
     <lb/>
     petitioners with large amounts. The   
     <lb/>
     inhabitants of Clifton, Rustico and  
     <lb/>
      Victoria, in particular, contributed   
     <lb/>
     freely in aid of their several works.   
     <lb/>
     Those contracts have not injured the   
     <lb/>
     country to the extent of a single dollar,  
     <lb/>
     as the expenditure did not exceed the   
     <lb/>
     amount voted for Public Works.  The 
     <lb/>
     Board of Works, on the whole, did not  
     <lb/>
     exceed by $2000  or $3000 the  
     <lb/>
      amount voted by the House, last ses<lb break="no"/>sion. The Treasury was  in as good  
     <lb/>
       state when the late rovernment re<lb break="no"/>signed as it was when they received  
     <lb/>
     the reins of power.   The Railway 
     <lb/>
     undertaking has brought the country 
     <lb/>
     into its present position, and the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment are now obliged to  adopt our 
     <lb/>
     policy and to run in the  very same  
     <lb/>
     groove, step by step. With all  their 
     <lb/>
     opposition to the course we adopted, 
     <lb/>
     they are compelled to swallow our   
     <lb/>
     policy, and now tell   the people that 
     <lb/>
     they cannot avoid their  present  course. 
     <lb/>
     The amount of money in the Treasury  
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
               
               when we came into power was $23,000<lb/>I do not know what amount there is<lb/>in the Treasury at present, but I know<lb/>that we remitted 30,000 to London to<lb/>meet the interest on the Debentures,<lb/>due about the last of June. The hon.<lb/>Leader of the Government asks why<lb/>we borrowed money from a New<lb/>Brunswick Bank and allowed so much<lb/>money to be idle in London. We<lb/>found that if we drew the whole<lb/>amount from the Banks in sterling<lb/>exchange at once, we should cripple<lb/>them and thus injure the trade of the<lb/>country. The President of one of the<lb/>Banks spoke to us about this matter<lb/>and told us to begin early to prepare to<lb/>meet the interest on the Debentures,<lb/>and we did so. We commenced about<lb/>the beginning of March, and as a re<lb break="no"/>sult there is now £6000 sterling in<lb/>London, to meet the liabilities of the<lb/>Colony. I did not imagine so many<lb/>hon. members on the government side<lb/>of the House would have swallowed<lb/>the leek at once, as they did, when so<lb/>many of them ran their election against<lb/>Confederation. They have, by their<lb/>action, admitted that the course pur<lb break="no"/>sued by the late government was the<lb/>only proper one, and that they must<lb/>follow it. The hon. Leader of the<lb/>government stated that ours was a<lb/>dash-away-policy, but he has followed<lb/>it in every respect. The present<lb/>government party got hold of a letter<lb/>which I wrote to Mr. Lawson of the<lb/>Summerside <hi rendition="simple:italic">Progress</hi>, and published a<lb/>garbled extract from it ; but if they<lb/>had published the whole of it as it was<lb/>written, it would have condemned<lb/>them most clearly. Mr. Lawson asked<lb/>me what position the Colony was in,<lb/>and I wrote and told him my private<lb/>opinion in reference to it, and stated<lb/>that there were hon. gentlemen in the<lb/>country whose policy was to dash<lb/>away, levy taxation and ruin the colony.<lb/>I am not ashamed of a single syllable<lb/>contained in that letter, and would be<lb/>glad to see it published, as I wrote it ;<lb/>but I would feel ashamed if I had treat<lb break="no"/>

     mine. Let them produce the original 
     <lb/>
     letter, and I will publish it. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     Leader of the government stated that 
     <lb/>
     the terms now offercd us by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion are not equal to those of 
     <lb/>
     1869, andthat he was the means of 
     <lb/>
     procuring the $800,000 for the pur<lb break="no"/>chase of our lands. .Now, it is rather 
     <lb/>
     unfair for him to lay claim to that 
     <lb/>
     honor; the hon. George   Coles was 
     <lb/>
     the first who claimed a sufficient 
     <lb/>
     amount for the purchase of our lands, 
     <lb/>
     at the Quebec Conference; but we 
     <lb/>
     never had a guarantee from the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion that it would be granted till 
     <lb/>
     1869. The Better Terms amounted 
     <lb/>
     to only $25 per head of our population 
     <lb/>
     while the present terms amounted to 
     <lb/>
     $45 per head as our assumed public 
     <lb/>
     debt. We can draw from the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion Treasury to the full amount of 
     <lb/>
     our assumed debt at any time after 
     <lb/>going into Confederation. During the <lb/>
     
     first twelve months after we join the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, we shall-be able to draw 
     <lb/>
     the interest on the unpaid amount of 
     <lb/>
     the sum to be paid for our railway, to 
     <lb/>
     the contractors, which will. amount to 
     <lb/>
     $75,000. This sum will be sufficient 
     <lb/>
     to build three new jails. and a Court 
     <lb/>
     House, The late government have 
     <lb/>
     been charged. with extravagance in 
     <lb/>
     their Railway expenditure. Let us 
     <lb/>
     look at. the two, administrations, viz, 
     <lb/>
     the late government and the Coalition. 
     <lb/>
     The latter levied 2 1/2 per cent taxation 
     <lb/>
     to pay the interest on the Debentures; 
     <lb/>
     but how did they   use the amount thus 
     <lb/>
     obtained, viz £18,800? They used 
     <lb/>
     that money tor general purposes con<lb break="no"/>trary to the Revenue Act and expend<lb break="no"/>ed more. than the amount of the whole 
     <lb/>
     Revenue—in fact, they.ran the Colony 
     <lb/>
     about £7,000 in debt. The next year, 
     <lb/>
     we had the management of public 
     <lb/>affairs, and raised the whole of the<lb/>
    revenue raised from the 2 1/2 per cent 
     <lb/>for Railway interest, and more also,<lb/>for the very legitimate purpose for 
     <lb/>which it was levied. We also paid  
     <lb/>$20,000 for the Worrel Estate, $6000 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     for new cent coinage, &amp;c. If we take 
     <lb/>
     these extraordinary expenditures out 
     <lb/>
       of the total outlay, we will find the 
     <lb/>latter very considerably reduced.  The<lb/>
    Revenue for last year was $895,478.03 
     <lb/>and the ordinary expenditure $385, 
     <lb/>881. 38.

            <p>
     
      <persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment</persName>- The new cent coin was bought 
     <lb/>
     and paid for before the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment came into power.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SINC6">Mr. Sinclair</persName>—But it was charged 
     <lb/>
     against last year. I stated at the time 
     <lb/>
     the 2 1/2 per cent was added to the Tariff 
     <lb/>
     that the money arising from it would 
     <lb/>be required to meet the ordinary ex<lb break="no"/>penditure of the Colony, and it has 
     <lb/>turned out just as I predicted, for the 
     <lb/>Coalition government used the Railway 
     <lb/>monies for other purposes than that 
     <lb/>provided. for in the Revenue Act. 
     <lb/>The expenditure of the Coalition ex<lb break="no"/>ceeded the Revenue by about $80,000, 
     <lb/>while the ordinary expenditure of the. 
     <lb/>late government was $5000 less than 
     <lb/>the ordinary revenue. It is clearly to 
     <lb/>be seen that the present Revenue of<lb/>the Colony is not more than sufficient<lb/>to meet our ordinary expenditure, 
     <lb/>leaving the Railway out of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion altogether. The late government 
     <lb/>found that the sum arising from the 
     <lb/>2 1/2 per cent was required for ordinary 
     <lb/>wants, and that the whole of the Rail» 
     <lb/>way expenditure would have to be 
     <lb/>met in some other way. When we 
     <lb/>consider the fact that about $200.000 
     <lb/>in gold must be remitted to Landon. 
     <lb/>annually to meet the interest on the. 
     <lb/>Debentures, we can see at a glance: 
     <lb/>that the Colony cannot long maintain. 
     <lb/>its present financial position, and that 
     <lb/>we must look for assistance to some 
     <lb/>other quarter. How could we remit 
     <lb/>that large sum in gold, without crippl<lb break="no"/>ing the commerce of the country? 
     <lb/>This is the grand question. The 
     <lb/>floating capital of the colony could 
     <lb/>never stand the immense drain upon 
     <lb/>it. At the end of ten years we shall 
     <lb/>

     have remitted in all, no less than 
     <lb/>
     $2,000,000,in gold. It is ridiculous 
     <lb/>
     to think that the country could stand 
     <lb/>
     it. I had reason to think that when 
     <lb/>
     the Railway Bill was passed, the 
     <lb/>
     Coalition knew the consequences. of 
     <lb/>
     their act. If the hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Government can get better terms, I 
     <lb/>
     will not object to his trying to obtain 
     <lb/>
     them,but I will object to tampering 
     <lb/>
     with the best interests of the country. 
     <lb/>
     I suppose the government think they 
     <lb/>
    have gone far enough in their change 
     <lb/>of base on Confederation, and that they 
     <lb/>must at least test the question whether 
     <lb/>they can obtain better' terms or not. 
     <lb/>If'they are forced to take the present 
     <lb/>terms at last, there will be no alterna<lb break="no"/>tive but to accept them, just as they 
     <lb/>are. It'they wish our support, they
     <lb/>should let us know upon what basis 
     <lb/>they intend to put in their claims for 
     <lb/>better terms. The only plea yet put 
     <lb/>forth by them is that we want a little 
     <lb/>more, so that we may conclude that 
     <lb/>they intend to adopt the begging sys<lb break="no"/>tem. If so, they should show how 
     <lb/>we have been neglected, and also that 
     <lb/>we have not received as good terms as 
     <lb/>the other Provinces. Unless they can 
     <lb/>do this, they will inevitably come short 
     <lb/>in their claims. I should not like to 
     <lb/>see this Colony placed in a mere beg<lb break="no"/>ging position. The hon. Leader of 
     <lb/>the government has shown that we 
     <lb/>have a right to receive from the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion the sums. expended on certain 
     <lb/>Light Houses, Drill Sheds and Bar» 
     <lb/>racks.. .Well, I think it would be a. 
     <lb/>credit to him to get the money expend<lb break="no"/>ed by him, in.building the Barracks, 
     <lb/>and that he has the best right to do so.. 
     <lb/>These buildings cost the country<lb/>£12,000, and if he can get it back from 
     <lb/>the Dominion, it will be a creditable 
     <lb/>act. The Drill Sheds are useful for<lb/>our annual Exhibitions, and Canada<lb/>does not care a rap for them.  The<lb/>telegraph line along the line of Rail<lb break="no"/>way will belong to the Dominion, and <lb/>cannot be used for any other than<lb/>Railway purposes, as it would interfere<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     with the interests and rights of the 
     <lb/>
     Telegraph Company. It would be 
     <lb/>
     good financial policy to buy out the 
     <lb/>
     claims of the Company as they have 
     <lb/>
     offered to sell. This a certain quan<lb break="no"/>tity of land to which they are entitled, 
     <lb/>
     which they have never yet claimed, 
     <lb/>
     and as land is now getting very valu<lb break="no"/>able, should they come forward and 
     <lb/>
     demand it, it will cost the local parlia<lb break="no"/>ment a considerable sum to procure it: 
     <lb/>
     The trifling claim for light houses, 
     <lb/>
     barracks, &amp;c, is a poor basis to argue 
     <lb/>
     upon for better terms, but the purchase 
     <lb/>
     of the rights of the Telegraph Com<lb break="no"/>pany would be a wise measure. Several 
     <lb/>
     hon. members on the government side 
     <lb/>
     of the House were elected as Anti-<lb break="yes"/>Confederates, and will therefore pur<lb break="no"/>sue a dishonorable course in turning 
     <lb/>
     in favor of Confederation now. They 
     <lb/>
     charged us with proving untrue to the 
     <lb/>
     country in sending the Delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa without calling the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     together ; but, I believe we acted for 
     <lb/>
     the best interests of the country in 
     <lb/>
     doing as we did. considering the .con<lb break="no"/>dition in which the Colony was placed. 
     <lb/>
     If the country had first been appealed to, 
     <lb/>
     the government of Canada might have 
     <lb/>
     been informed of the critical position 
     <lb/>
     in which we are placed, and the dele<lb break="no"/>gates might not have been able to 
     <lb/>
     secure the liberal terms we now have. 
     <lb/>
     Suppose we had convened the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature before the delegates were ap<lb break="no"/>pointed, what would the then Leader 
     <lb/>
     of the Opposition havesaid? We 
     <lb/>
     would probably have been told that we 
     <lb/>
     should have accepted he invitation to . 
     <lb/>
     send a Delegation, as the House did 
     <lb/>
     not know how to grapple with the pa<lb break="no"/>pers and correspondence laid: before 
     <lb/>
     them. When the country was appealed 
     <lb/>
     to on the question, the most intelligent 
     <lb/>
     districts on the Island declared that 
     <lb/>
     the   late government had taken a con<lb break="no"/>sistent course, and sustained their 
     <lb/>
     policy. The district which I represent 
     <lb/>
     is the most populous on the Island, as 
     <lb/>
     well as one of the most intelligent, and 
     <lb/>
     yet my constituents never questioned

            <p>
     the consistency of the course I followed 
     <lb/>
     as a member of the late government on 
     <lb/>
     this question of Confederation. I only 
     <lb/>
     hope the present government will be 
     <lb/>
     as consistent in their actions as we 
     <lb/>
     were. They are in a better position 
     <lb/>
     to negotiate with Canada than we 
     <lb/>
     were. As the House gives them the 
     <lb/>
     power to close I wish the new delega<lb break="no"/>tion success, and hope they are not 
     <lb/>
     going to spend $1,200 or $1,500 merely 
     <lb/>
     for the sake of testing the terme we 
     <lb/>
     now have, and that it is not their in<lb break="no"/>tention to get some trifling alterations 
     <lb/>
     made and then to come back and say 
     <lb/>
     they have obtained better terms. His 
     <lb/>
     Honor the Leader of the Government 
     <lb/>
     is, I believe the ablest financier on the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the House, and yet the 
     <lb/>
     only argument he adduces in favor of 
     <lb/>
     better terms, is based on the begging 
     <lb/>
     principle. Instead of their being a 
     <lb/>
     balance against the local government, 
     <lb/>
     under Confederation, there will be a 
     <lb/>
       balance in their favor, at the end of the 
     <lb/>
     financial year. If we claim several 
     <lb/>
     thousand dollars more than we have a 
     <lb/>
       right to, the politicians of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces will put in similar claims as 
     <lb/>they will be justly entitled to the same.<lb/>We shall have our share of the 14<lb/>millions now to be distributed among<lb/>the lower provinces, and of all their<lb/>expenditures for great public works<lb/>for many years to come, and therefore<lb/>have been very liberally dealt with.<lb/> The other Provinces handed over their<lb/>Light Houses to the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment without receiving one cent<lb/>for them; how then can it be shown<lb/>that we have any right to receive re<lb break="no"/>muneration for ours? If the hon.<lb/>Leader of the Government can show<lb/>that we have not, in the present terms,<lb/>received what is our due, I will sup<lb break="no"/>port him in sending another delegation<lb/>to Ottawa, but so far he has failed to<lb/>do so. I would go for making our <lb/>expenditure for local legislation as <lb/>light as possible and believe that by<lb/>proper economy the present terms<lb/>will meet our wants for many years,<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     without resorting to additional local 
     <lb/>
     taxation. The time will. come when 
     <lb/>
     local taxation will have to be resorted 
     <lb/>
     to; but it need not be for several 
     <lb/>
     years to come unless some unusual 
     <lb/>
     expenditure is undertaken. Looking 
     <lb/>
     at the terms before us, I believe the 
     <lb/>best course we can pursue is to accept<lb/>
    them, in order to assist the onward 
     <lb/>progress of the country and prevent it 
     <lb/>from getting into financial difficulties.

     Debate on Confederation resumed

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KELL2">Mr. T. KELLY</persName>.—Mr. Speaker. in 
     <lb/>
     rising to offer a few remarks, I may 
     <lb/>
     state that I have listened with pleasure 
     <lb/>
     to the speeches of hon. members on 
     <lb/>
     both sides, who have preceded me in 
     <lb/>
     this debate. They have. displayed 
     <lb/>
     ability and research, to the exclusion 
     <lb/>
     of that bitterness, which party feeling 
     <lb/>
     too frequently calls forth. Undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     sir, it is one of the most momentous 
     <lb/>
     questions which can occupy our atten. 
     <lb/>
    tion, inasmuch as it will effect the 
     <lb/>general interests of ourselves and our 
     <lb/>children for ages to come. In the 
     <lb/>language of a brilliant writer I may 
     <lb/>say that " as we are British subjects 
     <lb/>the least considerable amongst us has 
     <lb/>an interest equal in principle to the 
     <lb/>the country, and is equally called upon 
     <lb/>to make a contribution in support of 
     <lb/>them, whether it be by the heart to 
     <lb/>conceive, the understanding to direct 
     <lb/>or the head to control." (Applause) 
     <lb/>Such sir, is the-spirit which I deem it 
     <lb/>my duty to- cultivate when considering 
     <lb/>the subject now before us. I have 
     <lb/>carefully thought the matter over and<lb/>intend supporting the motion under 
     <lb/>consideration, and will support confed<lb break="no"/>eration from no party stand point of<lb/>view, inasmuch under our present<lb/>circumstances, that course is unavoid<lb break="no"/>able.Unquestionably circumstances now <lb/>
         
          
           <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">85</fw>
            
          
     combine to render this course a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of necessity, rather than one of 
     <lb/>
     choice. Who are to blame for this 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate state of affairs, I will not 
     <lb/>
     undertake to say. But this I do say, 
     <lb/>
     the time has arrived when it will 
     <lb/>
     have to be taken hold of and dealt 
     <lb/>
     with, entirely upon its merits. Refer<lb break="no"/>ence, however, has been made to 
     <lb/>
     parties, and statements have been 
     <lb/>
     made by hon. members opposite, 
     <lb/>
     which do not agree. For instance. 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member, the Leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition said yesterday, quite posi-   
     <lb/>
     tively, that the late Government was 
     <lb/>
     defeated in consequence of their Con<lb break="no"/>federation policy, while the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for New London said it was 
     <lb/>
     the School Question. Now which of 
     <lb/>
     these two statements are correct? 
     <lb/>
     Upon which can the country place re<lb break="no"/>liance? The hon. member for New 
     <lb/>
     London referred also to the alteration 
     <lb/>
     of the Railway Station at Summer<lb break="no"/>side, and said the change was rendered 
     <lb/>
     necessary in order that the bulk of 
     <lb/>
     country people might be better ac<lb break="no"/>commodated than they could be, had 
     <lb/>
     no change been made. He said also, 
     <lb/>
     that not one-fourth of the people, in<lb break="no"/>terested in the site of the station, were 
     <lb/>
     in favor of removing it from where it 
     <lb/>
     now is. Well time will tell. The 
     <lb/>
     people are moving in the matter on 
     <lb/>
     both sides, and when the petition 
     <lb/>
     comes in, I think it will be seen that 
     <lb/>
     the body of the people will be in favor 
     <lb/>
     of removing it from where it is at pre<lb break="no"/>sent. The hon. member asserted 
     <lb/>
     further, that when a few of the busi<lb break="no"/>ness men of Summerside last year 
     <lb/>
     wished to retain the Station where it 
     <lb/>
     had been formerly placed, there were 
     <lb/>
     very few who supported them in the 
     <lb/>
     movement. In connection with that I 
     <lb/>
     remember an incident which also oc<lb break="no"/>curred the same time. Mr. Robert 
     <lb/>
     Holman, who, in all probability, knew 
     <lb/>
     the intentions of the Government in 
     <lb/>
     the matter, offered some lots of land 
     <lb/>
     for sale, near to or immediately op<lb break="no"/>posite the Station ground, where it 
     <lb/>
         
   
          
            <cb/>
          
     was then supposed so be, and in con<lb break="no"/>sequence obtained good prices for 
     <lb/>
     them. Believing that the Station was 
     <lb/>
     to be there, it added a fictitious value 
     <lb/>
     to the property, which was used to the 
     <lb/>
     damage of the purchasers. A few 
     <lb/>
     days however after this sale  took   
     <lb/>
     place, an order was made in Council 
     <lb/>
     changing the Station. The hon. mem-   
     <lb/>
     ber referred also to Mr. McNeill's 
     <lb/>
     Tender. I think it would be difficult 
     <lb/>
     to justify the manner in which the 
     <lb/>
     late Government disposed of that mat<lb break="no"/>ter. When Mr. O'Brien's Tender for 
     <lb/>
     the main line was before Mr. Pope's 
     <lb/>
     Government, notwithstanding the time 
     <lb/>
     allowed, many of the party supporting 
     <lb/>
     the late Government went so far as to 
     <lb/>
     argue that the Legislature should have 
     <lb/>
     been called together to consider, if 
     <lb/>
     not his. at least the Tender of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Walker. But when the same men 
     <lb/>
     were in power they did not give Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McNeilI and some others who had 
     <lb/>
     sent in Tenders an opportunity to alter 
     <lb/>
     or amend their proposals: No, not to 
     <lb/>
     the extent of one minute of time. 
     <lb/>
     Surely they might have given Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McNeill at least one hour to amend 
     <lb/>
     or alter his Tender, or at least to com<lb break="no"/>municate with him on the subJect. 
     <lb/>
     They did not do so, but havmg allow<lb break="no"/>ed the last day and hour to expire, 
     <lb/>
     they opened the last Tender; and, in 
     <lb/>
     point of fact, actually received a new 
     <lb/>
     Tender after they opened Mr. Schrie<lb break="no"/>ber's. Yet these are the men who 
     <lb/>
     complained so loudly because   Mr. 
     <lb/>
     O'Brien had not more time given to 
     <lb/>
     him, although three  or four weeks 
     <lb/>
     were spent in negotiation and consul<lb break="no"/>tation with that gentleman. They 
     <lb/>
     have endeavored to show that that the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature could not have been called 
     <lb/>
     together before the matter of Confed-   
     <lb/>
     eration had been considered by the 
     <lb/>
     Govvernment. Permit me to say, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     that it is a generally acknowledged 
     <lb/>
     and admitted fact in politics,   that 
     <lb/>
     when the Leader of a. Government 
     <lb/>
     makes a public declaration respecting 
     <lb/>
     any public question, that he reflects   
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="1873-04-29_Page_086"

     the opinion of his party: Well, Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haythorne held the position of 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, and he publicly de<lb break="no"/>clared he would make no new move<lb break="no"/>ment in that direction, without consult<lb break="no"/>ing his constituents. So that in that 
     <lb/>respect he has been derelict in his 
     <lb/>duty, and false to his public promise. 
     <lb/>But says the hon. member, as early as 
     <lb/>last autumn I made up my mind that 
     <lb/>Confederation was inevitable. Now 
     <lb/>I would ask the hon. member, the 
     <lb/>Leader of the Opposition, if he made 
     <lb/>up his mind that such a course was 
     <lb/>inevitable last fall, how can he now 
     <lb/>say there was not time enough to have 
     <lb/>called the Legislature together? If it 
     <lb/>was a matter of duty as well as of 
     <lb/>opinion with the Government, then 
     <lb/>they should have also deemed it their 
     <lb/>duty,—if they had not time to meet 
     <lb/>with the Legislature,—to have con<lb break="no"/>sulted at least with their supporters. 
     <lb/>And having not done so, they, as a 
     <lb/>party, have left themselves open to 
     <lb/>blame; and ,as might be expected, 
     <lb/>have justly forfeited the confidence of 
     <lb/>the country.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI2">Hon. B. Davies</persName>—Mr. Spcaker, 
     <lb/>
     the question before this hon. House is 
     <lb/>
     whether we shall consent to send 
     <lb/>
     another delegation to Ottawa. or ac<lb break="no"/>cept the Terms brought down by 
     <lb/>
     Messrs. Laird and Haythorne? But 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Summerside has 
     <lb/>
     not said whether he will accept of 
     <lb/>
     these or look for better. I think the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Leader of the Government, or 
     <lb/>
     some of his friends, should have shown 
     <lb/>
     upon what grounds they expect to 
     <lb/>
     obtain better terms than those now 
     <lb/>
     offered. When asked for explana<lb break="no"/>tions on this point, hon. members on 
     <lb/>
     the Government side are unable to 
     <lb/>
     make any reply. Am I to understand 
     <lb/>
     that they are unable to make any re<lb break="no"/>ply to a question so reasonable, and 
     <lb/>
     one which they should answer? The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member referred to some land 
     <lb/>
     ,which was sold in Summerside. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KELL2">Mr. T KELLY</persName>—I said I believed 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     Mr. Holman was aware at the time 
     <lb/>
     that a change was to be made in the 
     <lb/>
     Station, but sold it to those who pur<lb break="no"/>chased, as if no alteration was to be 
     <lb/>
     made, which gave a fictitious value to 
     <lb/>
     the lots sold. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI2">Hon. B. Davies</persName>—I think in that 
     <lb/>
     respect the hon. member is astray in 
     <lb/>
     his opinions. With regard to the 
     <lb/>
     question before us, I think the whole 
     <lb/>
     matter has been ably and satisfactorily 
     <lb/>
     dealt with by the hon. member, the 
     <lb/>
     Leader of the Opposition, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, I shall but briefly refer to a few 
     <lb/>
     points which have been but slightly 
     <lb/>
     noticed. The hon. member, (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Laird) very properly said, and as ably 
     <lb/>
     proved, that unless we can lay down a 
     <lb/>
     principle as a basis upon which to 
     <lb/>
     found a claim for any better Terms, it 
     <lb/>
     will be but a mere waste of time to 
     <lb/>
     send another delegation to Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not see that we can show 
     <lb/>
     that we have any claim which has 
     <lb/>
     been overlooked by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     and his co-delegate. We cannot go, 
     <lb/>
     and, without any show of reason, ask 
     <lb/>
     for concessions to which we are not 
     <lb/>
     entitled. They allow us to phce 
     <lb/>
     our indebtedness at $45, a head, 
     <lb/>
     which is in excess of what we owe, 
     <lb/>
     and stipulate to grant us $800,000 
     <lb/>
     to buy out the remaining proprie<lb break="no"/>tors. And as for the hon. member, 
     <lb/>
     the Leader of the Govemment, he, by 
     <lb/>
     his negotiations with the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     delegates at the Alexandra Hotel, has 
     <lb/>
     forever debarred himself from asking 
     <lb/>
     for, or obtaining any better Terms. 
     <lb/>
     For he then said he would recommend 
     <lb/>
     that proposal to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     Island. Therefore, it will be an act 
     <lb/>
     of folly on the part of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber to go now, in the face of what he 
     <lb/>
     then did. Again,there is danger in 
     <lb/>
     reopening thc question, lest that in 
     <lb/>
     doing so we may lose what is now 
     <lb/>
     within our reach. The Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Ministry may withdraw a portion of 
     <lb/>
     what is now offered. My hon. col<lb break="no"/>league has satisfactorily shown, that 
     <lb/>
          
           
            <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">87</fw>
            
           
     the people in the other Provinces 
     <lb/>
     resort to local taxation for internal 
     <lb/>
     improvements. Itis unreasonable, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, to suppose that conces<lb break="no"/>sions will be made to us for purposes 
     <lb/>
     which are not provided for in any of 
     <lb/>
     the Provinces by the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The hon. Mr. Pope said 
     <lb/>
     that the properties taken for Railway 
     <lb/>
     purposes were over valued 100 per 
     <lb/>
     cent. Now as chief man of the Rail<lb break="no"/>way Commissioners, in reply to that 
     <lb/>
     statement, I have simply to say, that 
     <lb/>
     the Commissioners who acted under 
     <lb/>
     the Government of the hon. member, 
     <lb/>
     when they were in office, valued forty 
     <lb/>
     properties taken for Railway purposes, 
     <lb/>
     situated in Charlottetown, George<lb break="no"/>town and Alberton, with lands adjoin<lb break="no"/>ing, including Station grounds, at 
     <lb/>
     $68,000. The present Commissioners 
     <lb/>
     examined seven hundred claims, which 
     <lb/>
     include several Stations, and for com<lb break="no"/>pensation have allowed nearly $120,<lb break="no"/>000. So that the former Government 
     <lb/>gave more than half the amount to 
     <lb/>forty of their friends, which the late 
     <lb/>Government allowed for seven hun<lb break="no"/>dred claims. Therefore, I think the 
     <lb/>hon. member has been misinformed on 
     <lb/>the subject, or he would not have 
     <lb/>made the statements he did. Now 
     <lb/>let us consider the position we are in, 
     <lb/>or would be in, if the Railroad was 
     <lb/>now completed and in working order.

       extent, at least, one side has been<lb/>labouring to make a scapegoat of the<lb/>other. In order to see where the<lb/>truth lies in this matter, Mrs. Speaker,<lb/>it will perhaps be as well to investi<lb break="no"/>gate the matter somewhat closely. It<lb/>is said that the public affairs of the<lb/>Colony are in as good a position now<lb/>as they were when Mr. Pope's Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment went out of power. State<lb break="no"/>ments of this kind are easily made<lb/>and circulated, but when made in this<lb/>hon.

            <cb/>
           
           examine whether they are correct or 
     <lb/>incorrect. I have publicly stated<lb/>that the Finances of the Colony are<lb/>not in as healthy a state as they were<lb/>when the Coalition Government went<lb/>out of power. When I made that<lb/>statement I was sure I was correct.<lb/>Since then I have examined into the<lb/>matter, and find that such is the case.<lb/>I have drawn out a comparative state<lb break="no"/>ment of the public assets in the Trea<lb break="no"/>sury, on changes of Government in<lb/>the years 1872 and 1873, which is<lb/>copied from the Auditor's certificate.<lb/>

          obtain this? Money does not fall<lb/>down at our feet like rain or snow;<lb/>nor is it likely they had any more<lb/>facilities for obtaining money than<lb/>were common to other Governments.<lb/>The Government of Mr. Pope as they<lb/>obtained cash in the treasury at all<lb/>available for such a purpose, used it<lb/>for paying off the Warrants that were<lb/>out as they called them in, and in this<lb/>way would soon have had none afloat<lb/>at all! But the wise financiers of the<lb/>late Government take £ 6,000 and<lb/>send it to London, there to lie for six<lb/>months without yielding any interest<lb/>while they continue to issue fresh<lb/>Warrants. Yet such wa sthe states<lb break="no"/>manship which seemed to have been<lb/>pursued with the obvious intention of<lb/>forcing Confederation upon us by<lb/>bringing odium upon our public se<lb break="no"/>curities. The hon. member, the<lb/>Leader, of the Opposition said last<lb/>night, that he did not blame the con<lb break="no"/>tractors. This is a strange assertion<lb/>for the hon member to make now.<lb/>Why, Sir, last year I could scarcely<lb/>mention the name of these gentlemen<lb/>to any one who was a subscriber to his<lb/>paper.Now the man who derided<lb/>them last year, who persuaded the<lb/>people, by means of what was written,<lb/>published and said, that they were<lb/>hardly fit to be admitted into our<lb/>houses, now sees nothing wrong about<lb/>them. And as for the Chief Engineer,<lb/>Mr. Boyd, why he is now the most<lb/>excellent man of the lot. But the<lb/>hon. member says, Oh! I never said<lb/>one word against them. But now<lb/>like the snow, their false charges<lb/>against these men have all passed<lb/>away. Well, after all thier charges<lb/>against these me, it is refreshing to<lb/>notice that in heir estimation there<lb/>are now no men worthy of their con<lb break="no"/>fidence, as contractors, but Schrieber<lb/>and Burpee. Why, at one time the<lb/>people at large would have been so<lb/>suspicious if a second contract had<lb/>been given to those men by Mr.<lb/>Pope's Government, I believe an Act<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     of Parliament would have been first       
               <lb/>necessary for changing their names<lb/>before it could have been done. But<lb/>this aside, I deny that the Tender of<lb/>Messrs. Schrieber and Burpee was<lb/>the lowest. Nor do I admit that the<lb/>Government had any right to allow<lb/>them to lower their Tenders, (hear)<lb/>If that privilege was given to one party<lb/>they had no right to withhold it from<lb/>another, Why was it that the 31st<lb/>of December was allowed to come<lb/>before the contract was let, or a ten<lb break="no"/>der accepted? The only reason as<lb break="no"/>signed, so far, has been that the<lb/>surveys were not completed; but<lb/>they are not completed yet. The<lb/>true reason appears to be that they<lb/>were simply trying to see if they<lb/>could not get rid of building the<lb/>branch lines altogether. This was<lb/>one of the political horses they rode<lb/>into power on, and yet if they could,<lb/>at the time, have strangled him and<lb/>caused his death, it is quite clear they<lb/>would have done so. Mr. Pope's<lb/>Government gave O'Brien three<lb/>weeks to re-consider his offer; they<lb/>did not give any of the gentlemen<lb/>who had tendered one hour. And,<lb/>with respect to time, they had the<lb/>regulating of the matter in their own<lb/>hands, and if they had not time to<lb/>allow any such considerations to<lb/>gentlemen who sent in Tenders, the<lb/>fault was their own. But the fact<lb/>was, <hi rendition="simple:italic">at that late hour</hi> they were glad<lb/>to make the best bargain they could<lb/>with Schrieber and Burpee, who were<lb/>then the masters of the situation,<lb/>much more than the Government was.<lb/>When asked why the price per mile<lb/>on the branches is so much higher<lb/>than was allowed on the main line,<lb/>we were told that there are broad<lb/>rivers to cross,a nd very large and<lb/>costly bridges to build on the branch<lb/>lines; the cost of which will exceed<lb/>anything on the main line, Their<lb/>next reason is, that iron bus risen in<lb/>price.

     arranged that the sleepers .on the 
     <lb/>
     branches are to be of juniper and 
     <lb/>
     cedar. Now what are the facts? On 
     <lb/>
     the eastern line juniper is easier to be 
     <lb/>
     had than any other wood suitable for 
     <lb/>
     that purpose, while in the west cedar 
     <lb/>
     for such a purpose is more abundant 
     <lb/>
     than juniper or spruce in the vicinity 
     <lb/>
     of the line. In all they have done, that 
     <lb/>
     had the shadow of consistency about 
     <lb/>
     it, they have been merely walking in 
     <lb/>
     the footprints of their predecessors; 
     <lb/>
     and whereverthey have not done that, 
     <lb/>
     they bungled all they undertook. 
     <lb/>
     Then as regards locating the line, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Pope's Government ran the line, 
     <lb/>
     but the contractors had to pay for it; 
     <lb/>
     but Mr. Haythorne's Government 
     <lb/>
     located the branch lines at the ex<lb break="no"/>pense of the country, which was a large 
     <lb/>
     item of cost in favor of the contractors. 
     <lb/>
     Well, why did they thus act? Last 
     <lb/>
     year they were heaven-born Engi<lb break="no"/>neers, and were not going to have any 
     <lb/>
     crooks in the line. But now when 
     <lb/>
     the result of their engineering has 
     <lb/>
     been tested, it appears there is more 
     <lb/>
     curvature on the branches than there 
     <lb/>
     is on the main line. It is admitted 
     <lb/>
     all round that they could not have got 
     <lb/>
     into Souris without curves, but last 
     <lb/>
     year the same hon. member maintained 
     <lb/>
     that it was possible to get to Summer<lb break="no"/>side without departing from a straight 
     <lb/>
     line, or one nearly so. The country 
     <lb/>
     was quite level when Mr. Pope was 
     <lb/>
     in power, but became wonderfully 
     <lb/>
     rough when the hon. member for Bel<lb break="no"/>fast took charge of the ship of State. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member, the Leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition, taunts this side because 
     <lb/>
     some of us having ran our election 
     <lb/>
     against Confederation, are now in 
     <lb/>
     favor of it. Does the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     forget that when he ran his election in 
     <lb/>
     Belfast, he told the people he was 
     <lb/>
     going to knock the Railway on the 
     <lb/>

     falsified all those promises which he 
     <lb/>
     made to the people of his district, and 
     <lb/>
     agreed to go in for the immediate con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Branch lines.  Was it 
     <lb/>

     have succeeded a week or two ago, in 
     <lb/>
     getting Hon. Mr. Haviland to forfeit

     <lb/>
     they would only have been too glad 
     <lb/>
     to have had the opportunity of ap<lb break="no"/>pointing him for their Leader. Why, 
     <lb/>
     in a caucus which they held, so sure

     did they feel about obtaining the con<lb break="no"/>sent of the hon. member for George<lb break="no"/>town, that it is reported they actually 
     <lb/>
     appointed him their Leader. But in

Not,<lb/>Sir, from any disrespect I have per<lb break="no"/>sonally to that gentleman, but because<lb/>that in my opinion he was unfit for <lb/>such a mission, as the result has<lb/>proved. Any man sent on such a <lb/>mission, who would on the credit of <lb/>the Colony give his own note signed<lb/>Albert Hensley, for $25.000 payable<lb/>with interest at 7 1/2 per cent, leaving<lb/>also as collateral security Debentures<lb/>amounting to $28,000, betrayed his <lb/>incapacity for the duties of his mission<lb/>from a business stand point of view, he<lb/>disgraced himself, the government, and<lb/>the Island. Perhaps he may have to<lb/>pay the note himself. (Laughter.)<lb/>After borrowing the money this won<lb break="no"/>derful financier then buys exchange<lb/>here for cash which they remit in ad<lb break="no"/>vance to London in full to pay interest<lb/>which will not become due until June.<lb/>Truly he was a worthy representative<lb/>of the most inbecile and as business<lb/>men, most incompetent Government<lb/>which ever ruled the destinies of this<lb/>Colony. Indeed it would appear as if <lb/>Hon. Mr. Haythorpe, became a little<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     suspicious of the ability of his agent 
     <lb/>
     and determined to take the matter 
     <lb/>
     into his own hands, for we find him 
     <lb/>
     telegrapbing to Mr. Albert Hensley 
     <lb/>
     on December 13, 1872 telling him to 
     <lb/>
     remain a few days. Then sending 
     <lb/>
     one to Mr. Gray making enquiries 
     <lb/>
     respecting him. On Dec. 16th he 
     <lb/>
    telegraphs to Hensley again informing 
     <lb/>him that they had sold to Peaks 
     <lb/>Brothers $2,500 of Debentures at par. 
     <lb/>By this time Mr. Haythornc appears 
     <lb/>to have thought it was time for lntn to 
     <lb/>leave Montreal and move homewards. 
     <lb/>Hence on Dec. 23 he telegraphs again 
     <lb/>—" Return and take advance of $25,<lb break="no"/>000 at 7 1/2 per cent for six: months," 
     <lb/>Then next day Dec. 24th " take $25,<lb break="no"/>000 on those terms." On the 30th 
     <lb/>Dec. commands him to return, and 
     <lb/>states " several have been sold here at 
     <lb/>par." I think by this time the wires 
     <lb/>were getting warm, while the opera<lb break="no"/>tors must have felt aroused at the 
     <lb/>anxiety of the government for the 
     <lb/>return of their experienccd Bank 
     <lb/>Clerk. No doubt he had a good time, 
     <lb/>and had no wish to return until he had 
     <lb/>fully enjoyed himself. But after 
     <lb/>tclegraphing after him to Montreal and 
     <lb/>St. John they at last got him home, 
     <lb/>and the result of his mission we all 
     <lb/>know in the discredit it brought upon 
     <lb/>the Colony. The Delegation cost 
     <lb/>$386, and all he did was to secure the 
     <lb/>loan of $25,000 at 7 1/2 per cent and 
     <lb/>pledged as I said before $26,000 as

     Equally absurd was their conduct. 
     <lb/>
    when they brought the New York 
     <lb/>Engineers to the Island. The Tele<lb break="no"/>graph Wires had then also to be freely 
     <lb/>used. Instructions were given for the 
     <lb/>hon. Mr. Muirhead to meet them at 
     <lb/>one place, and to Mr. Sinclair to wait 
     <lb/>upon them in another. I don't think 
     <lb/>Mr. Muirhead travels much for pleas<lb break="no"/>ure,and we have fair reason to as<lb break="no"/>sume all this care to preserve those 
     <lb/>gentlemen from outside contamination, 
     <lb/>while on the Island, was not done for 
     <lb/>nothing, but inasmuch as they did not 
     <lb/>prevent them from testing Pope's 
     <lb/>champagne, it shows their duties were 
     <lb/>not performed according to the strict 
     <lb/>letter of Mr. Haythorne's instructions, 
     <lb/>(langhter.) I merely mention these 
     <lb/>matters to shew the singular and dis<lb break="no"/>graceful manner. in which, as a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. they managed every affair 
     <lb/>they undertook, and the sure and 
     <lb/>certain way they took of bringing the 
     <lb/>Island into disrepnte. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber, the Leader of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>(Mr. Laird) says, that when we are 
     <lb/>allowed to go into union with Canada, 
     <lb/>with a debt af $45 a head, our posi<lb break="no"/>tion is better than it was in 1866. 
     <lb/>This I do not believe. At that date 
     <lb/>they placed their indebtedness at £25 
     <lb/>per head. Since then they have be<lb break="no"/>come largely indebted for costly public 
     <lb/>undertakings. The Intercolonial is 
     <lb/>among these, and it is not yet finished, 
     <lb/>and besides there are other great im<lb break="no"/>provements which have been carried 
     <lb/>forward at great expense to the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, to say nothing of the Pacific, 
     <lb/>and other works which are sure to be 
     <lb/>undertaken at no distant day. Our 
     <lb/>imports have been $1,605,244, and 
     <lb/>the duty collected $302,757, equal to 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     about $5.80 per head; while that in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion according to Mr. Tilley, 
     <lb/>
     is $9.40;.and hence we shall, if we 
     <lb/>
     enter the union on these terms, have 
     <lb/>
     to make that difference good, either 
     <lb/>
     directly or indirectly. And I am not 
     <lb/>
     one of those who believed that our 
     <lb/>
    "people will consume less_' dutiable 
     <lb/>
     goods, according to the. number of our 
     <lb/>
     people, than they will in any other 
     <lb/>
     part of the Dominion; I will now 
     <lb/>
     come to the Terms. At the time of 
     <lb/>
     the election in my part of the country, 
     <lb/>
     at least, we had nothing but hearsay 
     <lb/>
     evidence upon which to ground a con<lb break="no"/>clusion. And perhaps if they had 
     <lb/>
     then, as they have since, been placed 
     <lb/>
     properly before the people, there might 
     <lb/>
     not have been so much opposition to 
     <lb/>
     them. Although I am still of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that they fall short of what 
     <lb/>
     we will require, and are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     receive. There is, however, one point 
     <lb/>
     which appears to have been overlooked 
     <lb/>
     and that is the one which refers to 
     <lb/>
     our Fisheries. Next month the Com<lb break="no"/>mission will sit. The Americans have 
     <lb/>
     received more than the Dominion al<lb break="no"/>ready, and unless our interests are 
     <lb/>
     closely looked after we will receive 
     <lb/>
     but little. The American Govern<lb break="no"/>ment entered into an agreement three 
     <lb/>
     years ago with the Government here 
     <lb/>
     and, on certain conditions being com<lb break="no"/>plied with by us, they promised to re<lb break="no"/>mit duties paid by traders here on 
     <lb/>
     fish, which passed through their Cus<lb break="no"/>tom House. But when asked to fulfil 
     <lb/>
     their part of the compact, they repu<lb break="no"/>diated the claim altogether. I fee1 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that this is an important 
     <lb/>
     matter, and one that should not be lost 
     <lb/>
     sight of. The Telegraph Lines here 
     <lb/>
     belong to a private company. When 
     <lb/>
     the Railroad is in operation it will 
     <lb/>
     require to be connected with the line 
     <lb/>
     at different points. Hence this mat<lb break="no"/>ter must of necessity be attended to at 
     <lb/>
     once. And hence I must conclude 
     <lb/>
     that if we fail unanimously to use our 
     <lb/>
     influence to have these and other 
     <lb/>matters arranged before we enter,<lb/>

     those who will vote against us in this<lb/>matter will yet feel that they did<lb/>wrong. Especially when we find that <lb/>we cannot carry on the business of<lb/>the country with this amount in the<lb/>Terms brought down. The fact ap<lb break="no"/>pears to be, the late Government were<lb/>in such hot haste to close up the mat<lb break="no"/>ter that I believe they forgot all about<lb/>many questions which should not have<lb/>
    been overlooked. I am told the learn<lb break="no"/>ed and hon. member for Murray Har<lb break="no"/>bor stated that he had no hesitation in<lb/>saying that the School Question had 
     <lb/>been before the people at the late 
     <lb/>election instead of Confederation , If 
     <lb/>so, it was raised by themselves. And<lb/>on that and other questions their fears 
     <lb/>were so exerciséd that all   kind of 
     <lb/>influences were brought forward in 
     <lb/>order that the weak and tottering 
     <lb/>foundations of their party might be 
     <lb/>supported. meetings  were held in 
     <lb/>St. Paul's School Room,   a circular 
     <lb/>was addressed to all whom it concern<lb break="no"/>ed, and surely no one wiIl say now 
     <lb/>that any object was expected to be 
     <lb/>gained by this, but maintaining, if 
     <lb/>possible, the late party in  power. 
     <lb/>Away with such arguments.  They 
     <lb/>come with a peculiarly bad grace from 
     <lb/>the learned member for Murray Har<lb break="no"/>bor, who, if he rode into his seat here 
     <lb/>thinks hon. members on this side did 
     <lb/>the same.  We are not, Sir, to be led 
     <lb/>away by any   such arguments from the 
     <lb/>question before us.   I believe {hat in 
     <lb/>view of the damaged public credit of 
     <lb/>Colony, Confederation or a large<lb/>increase of taxation is inevitable. <lb/>Nor is this all. If we accept the 
     <lb/>Terms brought down by Messrs. Laird<lb/>and Haythorne, direct taxation will<lb/>immediately, or very soon, have to be<lb/>resorted to. In New Brunswick the <lb/>Lieut. Governor came down with a de<lb break="no"/>mand, in the Speech from the Throne, 
     <lb/>for better Terms.  But there the<lb/>Dominion door had been closed, and 
     <lb/>they may find that a loud and long 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
       
     
     continued knock will be required be<lb break="no"/>fore it is again opened. The Gover<lb break="no"/>nor of that Province said that better<lb/>Terms is now a necessity.  None, I<lb/>
    presume, will suppose he did not know<lb/>what he was speaking about, and from<lb/>the five years experience of New <lb/>Brunswick in the Dominion, we<lb/>should learn a lesson. Why, Sir, the<lb/>people will blame us if we do not at<lb break="no"/>tempt to obtain a more favourable <lb/>arrangement from the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment than what has been promised 
     <lb/>the late delegates. For my part I 
     <lb/>feel bound, for one, to support a reso<lb break="no"/>lution in favor of making the attempt. 
     <lb/>I firmly believe if such a resolution is 
     <lb/>well sustained by the House we shall 
     <lb/>succeed in obtaining substantially far 
     <lb/>better Terms. If so, then we may 
     <lb/>enter side by side with the sister Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and I have no fear but that 
     <lb/>our people will succeed in the race for 
     <lb/>success as well as they. will. But if 
     <lb/>we enter on Terms which will  neces<lb break="no"/>sitate us to resort to direct taxation 
     <lb/>immediately, we shall then lay the 
     <lb/>basis of a discontent that may prove 
     <lb/>most disastrous in its results. Rather 
     <lb/>let us insist upon Terms that wlll be 
     <lb/>just and satisfactory to our people at 
     <lb/>large. If we do so our success   as a 
     <lb/>Colony is sure, otherwise it will be 
     <lb/>greatly marred.  I  do not agree  that 
     <lb/>building the Railway necessarily 
     <lb/>brought about Confederation It is 
     <lb/>all very well for those who saw such 
     <lb/>a result, through the blaze of the bon<lb break="no"/>fires when the measure was carried; 
     <lb/>and it was very well for the party who 
     <lb/>said this when they came into power 
     <lb/>to try and make their predictions 
     <lb/>good, by the gross mismanagement of 
     <lb/>the affairs of the Colony.  I do not, 
     <lb/>however, agree with the opinion that<lb/>Confederation was a necessary result<lb/>of such a measure.  But for agrument 
     <lb/>sake assuming such to be the case, the 
     <lb/>  Premier of the late Government was 
     <lb/>not opposed to the undertaking as the

     Here are the deliberately expressed

     views of hon. Mr. Haythorne, which, 
     <lb/>
     when contrasted with his subsequent 
     <lb/>
     conduct, does not place him in an 
     <lb/>
     enviable position as a public man. 
     <lb/>
     Had hon. Mr. Pope pursued so tor<lb break="no"/>tuous a course we would never hear 
     <lb/>
     the last of it. This resolution went 
     <lb/>
     forth through the country, and in 
     <lb/>
     reading it who could come to any con<lb break="no"/>clusion but that that gentleman was an 
     <lb/>
     out and out Railway man. But when 
     <lb/>
     he found local influences in his dis<lb break="no"/>trict against him, he came down to 
     <lb/>
     the level of a mere delegate for a 
     <lb/>
     small locality, and opposed the mea<lb break="no"/>sure. He even drove in the same 
     <lb/>
     sleigh with Mr. Pepe, and gave him 
     <lb/>
     to understand that he would support 
     <lb/>
     the undertaking. But after coming to 
     <lb/>
     Charlottetown and consulting with a 
     <lb/>
     few anti-Railway men, and moreover 
     <lb/>
     finding himself not likely to get into 
     <lb/>
    power soon, he, in his place in the 
     <lb/>Legislative Council, opposed the whole 
     <lb/>thing, declaring that he would consent 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     to no such public undertaking until 
     <lb/>
     the land question was first settled. 
     <lb/>
     But mark you, when the hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haythorne became Leader of a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, he all at once cast his opini<lb break="no"/>ons, respectingthe settlement of the 
     <lb/>
     land question, to the wild winds of 
     <lb/>
     Marshfield, and as a relief for such an 
     <lb/>
     ejection of sentiment, swallowed sixty 
     <lb/>
     miles more of a Railroad. As for the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member, the Leader of the Op<lb break="no"/>position, he now comes forward and 
     <lb/>
     says he never said or published a 
     <lb/>
     word against the Premier or the 
     <lb/>
     learned Attorney General. This is 
     <lb/>
     of a piece with the conduct of the 
     <lb/>
     Leader of the late Government in re<lb break="no"/>gard to fulfilling his promise respect<lb break="no"/>ing the Report of the New York 
     <lb/>
     Engineers. Oh! with respect to this, 
     <lb/>
     hon. Mr. Haythorne is as silent as the 
     <lb/>
     grave. They created an excitement 
     <lb/>
     in the country against Mr. Pope's 
     <lb/>
     Government, Burpee and Schrieber 
     <lb/>
     and the Engineers, which was worse 
     <lb/>
     than a fire, for a fire can only destroy 
     <lb/>
     a man's property, which health and

     industry, and the blessings of Provi<lb break="no"/>dence, may again restore, but when 
     <lb/>
     you succeed in robbing any man or 
     <lb/>
     body of men of their public character, 
     <lb/>
     it may not, in all cases, be in the 
     <lb/>
     power of the injured party to recover 
     <lb/>
               it again. Last year the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Patriot</hi> 
     <lb/>
     searched diligently for telegrams, and 
     <lb/>
     in reference thereto made statements 
     <lb/>
     which were not correct. But Sir, 
     <lb/>
     these of the Pope Government were 
     <lb/>
     but a trifle compared with those of 
     <lb/>
     the late party. I might begin with 
     <lb/>
     the first public man in the Colony who 
     <lb/>
     voted for the Railroad, and end with 
     <lb/>
     the loudest in its favor, hon. H. Bell. 
     <lb/>
     and show up the inconsistency of their 
     <lb/>
     conduct as public men. But it would 
     <lb/>
     be but an expose of weak and mis<lb break="no"/>directed political conduct which failed 
     <lb/>
     in conferring seats in the Executive to 
     <lb/>
     those who sought them at so deara 
     <lb/>
     price as the sacrifice of political con<lb break="no"/>sistency. Afew were greatly exer<lb break="no"/>cised because a certain gentleman

     swallowed Fraser. But who swallow<lb break="no"/>ed the Irish hero whom the hon. and 
     <lb/>
     learned member for Murray Harbor 
     <lb/>
     so delighted, in the past, to honor? 
     <lb/>
     Alas for human applause, especially 
     <lb/>
     when it comes from the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     and his political friends.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">MR. L. H. DAVIES</persName>.—Every hon. 
     <lb/>
     member of this House is desirous that 
     <lb/>
     this Colony should receive the very 
     <lb/>
     best Terms that can be obtained for a 
     <lb/>
     union with the Dominion of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Alberton, (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howlan) has not, in his remarks, put 
     <lb/>
     forward a single statement in reference 
     <lb/>
     to the demand for better Terms from 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion Government, but has 
     <lb/>
     endeavored to prove the inconsistency 
     <lb/>
     of hon. Mr. Haythorne. I hold in my 
     <lb/>
               hand the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Parliamentary Reporter</hi> for 
     <lb/>
     1870, and in it I find that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber himself made use oflanguage at that 
     <lb/>
     Session, identical with that of Mr. Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne, in reference to the construction 
     <lb/>
     of a Railway. The words used by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member were as follows: 1 
     <lb/>
     see around those desks enough of the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of those who unfurled the old 
     <lb/>
     ting, whose determination is not to 
     <lb/>
     surrender up the constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     country into other bands until the 
     <lb/>
     portrait of the last landlord is hung up 
     <lb/>
     in the Legislative Library of the 
     <lb/>
     Island, as a memento of the past. 
     <lb/>
     Then, and not till then, will the differ<lb break="no"/>ent sections of the country be brought 
     <lb/>
     into closer communion with each other 
     <lb/>
     by the introduction of the iron horse, 
     <lb/>
     which could then run through one free 
     <lb/>
     farm—as it were—extending from the 
     <lb/>
     North Cape to the East Point, carry<lb break="no"/>ing the products of our thrifty and en<lb break="no"/>terprising farmers to the best markets. 
     <lb/>
     The scene changes, Mr. Speaker, and 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member introduces the Rail<lb break="no"/>way Bill against the wish of three-<lb break="yes"/>fourths of the people of this Island. 
     <lb/>
     What does the hon. member gain by 
     <lb/>
     endeavoring to show up the inconsist<lb break="no"/>encies of hon. gentlemen who stand 
     <lb/>
     equally as high in the estimation of the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     people as himself? The important 
     <lb/>
     ruestion before the House should be 
     <lb/>
     discussed in a manner free from all 
     <lb/>
     personalities and side issues. Hon. 
     <lb/>
     members on the Government side of 
     <lb/>
     the House entertain the idea that if 
     <lb/>
     they can show up the extravagant 
     <lb/>
     conduct of the late Government to be 
     <lb/>
     the cause of their accepting terms of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, they will have a good 
     <lb/>
     and sufficient excuse for their change 
     <lb/>
     of base; but this they are utterly un<lb break="no"/>able to do. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     New London made an able effort this 
     <lb/>
     morning, and one which I believe will 
     <lb/>
     have its effect upon those hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers who make those charges. That 
     <lb/>
     hon. member showed clearly that the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure for the past year, not with<lb break="no"/>standing the heavy demands upon the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury, did not exceed the Revenue. 
     <lb/>
     " But," says the hon. member for Tig<lb break="no"/>nish, " the late Government called in 
     <lb/>
     all the Warrants and issued a lot 
     <lb/>
     more." That hon. member knows that 
     <lb/>
     the Coalition Government called it 
     <lb/>
     the Warrants when they were in 
     <lb/>
     power, and paid them off with the 
     <lb/>
     money they obtained for Railway pur<lb break="no"/>poses. The hon member says that it 
     <lb/>
     is true the Coalition carried the Rail<lb break="no"/>way Bill, but the late Government 
     <lb/>
     came in and carried the Branch Bill 
     <lb/>
     which was the last straw that broke 
     <lb/>
     the camel's back, and that they are, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, responsible for the whole.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">MR. L. H. DAVIES</persName>—The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member stated that the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment sacrificed the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     country in carrying out the Branch 
     <lb/>
     lines, although he well knows that the 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="1873-04-29_Page_096"

     construction of those lines formed the     
     <lb/>policy of the Coalition when they went<lb/>out of power, and were by them de<lb break="no"/>clared to be necessary. In the first<lb/>Railway Bill, the Branches were to<lb/>be built in five years, but in the<lb/>Speech, at the opening of the six days'<lb/>session, it was stated that they were to<lb/>be built immediately. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber says the late Government did as<lb/>he would have done, but that after all<lb/>they have sacrificed the best interests<lb/>of the country ! His actions in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to this matter are childish in the<lb/>extreme. Why was the Branch Bill<lb/>delayed till the last moment, last ses<lb break="no"/>sion ? Because the hon member op<lb break="no"/>posed the investment clauses it con<lb break="no"/>tained, with all the vehemence he<lb/>could bring to bear upon them. If<lb/>there was any delay, therefore, he must<lb/>shoulder the responsibility of it. He<lb/>declares the late Government spent<lb/>$20,000 on the public printing, while<lb/>the Coalition Government spent only<lb/>$11,000. I wonder why he attempts<lb/>to deceive people in that way, when<lb/>he knows that most of the money paid<lb/>for printing under the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment went to pay for printing ordered<lb/>by the Coalition Government ! He<lb/>employed a Professor to make an<lb/>analysis of the mussel mud and order<lb break="no"/>ed the publication of his report, at a<lb/>very considerable cost. The printers<lb/>employed by the late Government<lb/>received but a paltry share of the<lb/>amount paid for public printing dur<lb break="no"/>ing the past year. The hon. member<lb/>assumed that Mr. Albert Hensley was<lb/>not fit for his mission to dispose of our<lb/>Debentures in the other Provinces ;<lb/>but everybody knows that gentleman<lb/>to be quite as competent as the hon.<lb/>member for Albert on. When the<lb/>hon. member was sent upon a delega<lb break="no"/>tion to Washington, his Premier was<lb/>obliged to recall him. In reference to<lb/>our finances, he says that our taxation<lb/>at present amounts to $3.28 per head,<lb/>while our outlays amount to over $4.<lb/>Well, if we remain out of Confedera<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     tion, where are we going to be at that 
     <lb/>rate ? He knows that the Revenue<lb/>received for last year would not carry<lb/>us half through the present one, and<lb/>that when the Trunk Railway and<lb/>Branches are completed, our taxation,<lb/>if we remain out of Confederation,<lb/>will be $6.20 per head, in order to<lb/>meet the demands upon the Colony.<lb/>This would be nearly $3 per head<lb/>above and beyond our present taxa<lb break="no"/>tion ; and I would like to know it<lb/>could be levied. Will it be believed<lb/>that when the hon. member came to<lb/>tell us what addition he wanted to the<lb/>present Terms, it came down to pro<lb break="no"/>vincial postage and some little items<lb/>about the fisheries ! I decline to form<lb/>part of that delegation, as I have some<lb/>little respect left for myself. In the<lb/>matter of fisheries, we shall be placed<lb/>in precisely the same position as the<lb/>other Provinces ; we shall have our<lb/>share of the sum allowed by the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government, and cannot ask<lb/>more than that. It is our duty to look<lb/>after our interests and to endeavor to<lb/>get fair and reasonable Terms ; but<lb/>when we obtain them, we should be<lb/>satisfied. I shall now make a few re<lb break="no"/>marks in answer to those of the hon.<lb/>member for Summerside. From the<lb/>general tenor of his remarks I am<lb/>convinced the hon. member does not<lb/>know what addition to the present<lb/>Terms he is going to ask for. " I<lb/>cannot understand," he says, " how<lb/>we are to be the gainers by going into<lb/>Confederation, if Canada tariff is lower<lb/>than ours ?<lb/>

            the hon. Leader of the Government,<lb/>in his speech, to show that a few little<lb/>items for Lighthouses, Drill Sheda<lb/>and Breakwaters, had not been pre<lb break="no"/>sented by the late delegation, and that<lb/>their value might still be conceded by<lb/>the Dominion Government. The<lb/>ground on which he bases his argu<lb break="no"/>ments in favor of those items is so<lb/>paltry and narrow, when compared<lb/>with the liberal Terms now before us,<lb/>that it seems almost ridiculous. He<lb/>declares that the Haythorne-Sinclair<lb/>Government so depreciated the credit<lb/>of the country, that it is beyond his<lb/>power to renew it. I deny it Sir. If<lb/>any act was done that tended to de<lb break="no"/>stroy the credit of the Colony, it was<lb/>the publication of a leading article in<lb/>the Islander newspaper, printed by the<lb/>Queen's printer of the Coalition Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The credit of the country<lb/>was as good when the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment resigned, as when they came into<lb/>power. The hon. member for Sum<lb break="no"/>merside, (Mr. Lefurgy) stated that<lb/>the late Government squandered $10,<lb break="no"/>000 in changing the Summerside Sta<lb break="no"/>tion. This statement is altogether<lb/>untrue. He then charged them with<lb/>taking advantage of the country by<lb/>sending off the late delegation to Otta<lb break="no"/>wa. If they had acted in any other<lb/>way than they did, I would have op<lb break="no"/>posed them, for they adopted the only<lb/>proper course they could pursue under<lb/>the circumstances in which they were<lb/>placed, and have received the approval<lb/>of the people in reference to their<lb/>action. When I look across the<lb/>Straits and find that one of the<lb/>Provinces was almost in a state of open<lb/>rebellion, because the question of Con<lb break="no"/>federation was not submitted to the<lb/>people at the polls, I am perfectly<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     satisfied that the late Government, in 
     <lb/>submitting the question to the country<lb/>at a general election, took the only<lb/>proper and constitutional course they<lb/>could have adopted. The people were<lb/>the only tribunal who had the right to<lb/>decide the question whether they<lb/>should unite with the Dominion or not.<lb/>The great question was fully discussed<lb/>in every hamlet and schoolhouse in<lb/>the country, and there was hardly a<lb/>man who did not understand it in all<lb/>its bearings. The result of that elec<lb break="no"/>tion was that there is to-day, in this<lb/>House, only one man who opposes a<lb/>union with Canada, and he is not to<lb/>the fore, while the question is being<lb/>discussed. If the statement of the<lb/>hon. Leader of the Government is<lb/>correct, there is a great deal of force<lb/>in the position he takes, but I am fully<lb/>persuaded there is not the slightest<lb/>foundation for that statement. In his<lb/>figures, he charges, in the annual ex<lb break="no"/>penditure of this Colony, under Con<lb break="no"/>federation, the whole of the amount<lb/>expended last year by the Board of<lb/>Works. I am surprised at this, when<lb/>I look at his position. He knows that<lb/>several of the items which he has<lb/>charged against this Colony, under<lb/>Confederation, will be borne by the<lb/>Dominion. He should have deducted<lb/>those items from the $96,000 expended<lb/>by the Board of Works for 1872.<lb/>The Breakwaters will be taken charge<lb/>of by the Dominion under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and, therefore, their annual cost<lb/>should also be deducted from our ex<lb break="no"/>penditure ; (Mr. Davies here quoted<lb/>from the following financial statement,<lb/>and compared the different items,<lb/>charges, %c., with the figures submitted<lb/>by the hon. Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment :—<lb/>

            <p>I find that the amount expended
               <lb/>for Legislation last year was the
               <lb/>largest ever used for that purpose in
               <lb/>this Colony, and, therefore, should not
               <lb/>be set down as a regular annual ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. I should go for abolishing<lb/>
               
               <cb/>
           
            the Legislative Council altogether,
               <lb/>under Confederation. Then again,
               <lb/>the hon. Leader of the Government
               <lb/>puts down, as a yearly expenditure,
               <lb/>the cost of a general election; this is

     of the outlay for the election of 1872, 
     <lb/>and add to this $200 for partial elec<lb break="no"/>tions, making in all $1,080.73.  The<lb/>charge for Island Packets, after de<lb break="no"/>ducting the cost of trips between Pic<lb break="no"/>tou and Georgetown, will be born by 
     <lb/>the Local Government.  The cost of 
     <lb/>all our miscellaneous items was carried 
     <lb/>out by the hon. Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment as part of our yearly expendi<lb break="no"/>ture in Confederation; but I find that 
     <lb/>out of a total of $6,908.06 the sum of 
     <lb/>$4,355.19 will be assumed by the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, leaving a balance of only $2,<lb break="no"/>552.87 to be borne by the Colony. 
     <lb/>In the Statement I have given of the 
     <lb/>expendiiture of the Island under Con<lb break="no"/>federation, I believe I have stated the 
     <lb/>facts as as as can be ascertained, and 
     <lb/>I defy any honorable member of this 
     <lb/>House to show that I have made a 
     <lb/>single deduction which I cannot de<lb break="no"/>fend by the best of arguments. Our 
     <lb/>annual total expenditure, when we 
     <lb/>form part of the Dominion, will, there<lb break="no"/>fore, be $205,216.71. In calculating 
     <lb/>our receipts under Confederation, I 
     <lb/>assume that we will receive the in<lb break="no"/>terest on the difference between the 
     <lb/>$45 per head, allowed as our assumed 
     <lb/>debt and the debt we really owe. The 
     <lb/>actual debt of this Colony, including 
     <lb/>the whole cost of the Railway, on the 
     <lb/>31st January,l873, was $3,775,984. 83, 
     <lb/>and the amount of'debt assumed by 
     <lb/>the Dominion is $4,230,945. The 
     <lb/>balance upon which we shall draw 
     <lb/>interest, will, therefore, be $454,960.17. 
     <lb/>I am proud and happy to know that 
     <lb/>the day is coming when we shall have 
     <lb/>money sufficient to exterminate the 
     <lb/>old proprietory system of this Colony, 
     <lb/>and that the whole of our people will 
     <lb/>have an opportunity of purchasing the 
     <lb/>freehold of their lands. The hon. 
     <lb/>Leader of the  Government made a 
     <lb/>deduction of one- third from the amount 
     <lb/>granted for lands, for loss to be sus<lb break="no"/>tained in investing the money; but I 
     <lb/>cannot see why so large a deduction 
     <lb/>should be made from a sum of which 
     <lb/>we draw the yearly interest. He 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     omitted a  most important item of 
     <lb/>
     assets, as he told us nothingabout the 
     <lb/>
     89000 acres of unsold lands now in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Government. I claim 
     <lb/>
     interest in the full amount allowed for 
     <lb/>
     
     lands, but I will allow the unsold<lb/>
     lands, remaining on hand, to go against<lb/>the presumed loss which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Leader of, the Government says we 
     <lb/>
     shall incur iii investing the $800, 000, 
     <lb/>
     as it is likely we shal lose something 
     <lb/>
     in this way.  If credit is not given for 
     <lb/>
     the unsold lands now in the possession 
     <lb/>
     of the Government, it is unfair to de<lb break="no"/>duct one cent from the $800,000: The 
     <lb/>
     hon. Leader of the Government omit<lb break="no"/>ted entirely from his calculations the 
     <lb/>
     interest on the money not paid to the 
     <lb/>
     Railway contractors, which we shall 
     <lb/>
     receive till the principal is paid, and 
     <lb/>
     which will amount to over $75,000. 
     <lb/>
     This amount, if invested. would yiéld 
     <lb/>
     $4,692 annually. Our land assess<lb break="no"/>ment which would be an item of local 
     <lb/>
     revenue, would amount to $18,547.87. 
     <lb/>
     The total annual revenue wonld 
     <lb/>
     amount to $222,320,02- a very hand<lb break="no"/>some sum for local purposes to begin 
     <lb/>
     with under Confederation. By sub<lb break="no"/>tracting the expenditure from the 
     <lb/>
     revenue, we obtain a balance of $17,<lb break="no"/>103.31, in favor of the, Colony under 
     <lb/>
     the terms now offered: These figures 
     <lb/>
     cannot be swept away by mere asser<lb break="no"/>tion. I know we have been told that 
     <lb/>
     hon. members on the Opposition slde 
     <lb/>
     of the House have no financial 
     <lb/>
     ability; but I think by the present 
     <lb/>
     test we compare very favorfibly with 
     <lb/>
     hon. members on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     
     House.  We shall receive $20.00 per <lb/>head of our population more than Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick received 
     <lb/>
     per head when tbey became a part of 
     <lb/>
     the Union, which amounts to a total 
     <lb/>
     
     of $1,880,420.  We should ask for all<lb/>that is just, reasonable   and fair, from 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion Governinent; but we 
     <lb/>
     have no right to press unjust claims. 
     <lb/>
     If we adopt an unjust claim, we must 
     <lb/>
     be prepared to mete out the same 
     <lb/>
     measure to the other Provinces, if we 
     <lb/>

     receive it. These terms must be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the Dominion Parliament, 
     <lb/>
     and laid on the table before giants in 
     <lb/>
     financial ability ; we should, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     be careful not to make any demand 
     <lb/>
     for additional concessions without good 
     <lb/>
     and sufficient grounds for so doing. I 
     <lb/>
     cannot see upon what grounds the new 
     <lb/>
     delegation can ask for better Terms ; I 
     <lb/>
     believe we cannot prosecute any addi<lb break="no"/>tional demand with any amount of 
     <lb/>
     fair play. The Lighthouses of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick were not 
     <lb/>
     paid for. and why should we receive 
     <lb/>
     remuneration for ours? It is high 
     <lb/>
     time for us to close up this honorable 
     <lb/>
     and straightforward bargain between 
     <lb/>
     this Colony and the Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, as it is best for the interests of 
     <lb/>
     both parties to do so. When all the 
     <lb/>
     contemplated public works of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion for the next fifteen years are 
     <lb/>
     completed, her debt will not probably 
     <lb/>
     be greater per head than it is today, 
     <lb/>
     as her population will have increased 
     <lb/>
     in proportion. In obtaining the con<lb break="no"/>cession of $45 per head as our assumed 
     <lb/>
     Public Debt, we have been highly 
     <lb/>
     favored above all the other Provmces. 
     <lb/>
     The despatch from Lord Dufferin, 
     <lb/>
     stating that better Terms would not 
     <lb/>
     be granted, was couched in the strong<lb break="no"/>est and most positive language. Are 
     <lb/>
     we going to stultify ourselves by send<lb break="no"/>ing another delegation in the face of 
     <lb/>
     that despatch? Lord Dufferin is one 
     <lb/>
     of the most distinguished statesmen in 
     <lb/>
     the British Empire, holds a very high 
     <lb/>
     position in literature and political 
     <lb/>
     life, and was chosen by Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     the Queen to consummate the great 
     <lb/>
     union of all these British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces. I am surprised 
     <lb/>
     that the Government should think that 
     <lb/>
     His Lordship would sit down and pen 
     <lb/>
     a despatch  that he would change at 
     <lb/>
     the request of any, political party that_ 
     <lb/>
     may happen to get hold of the reins of 
     <lb/>
     power in this little Colony. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that Lord Dufferin desires the pros<lb break="no"/>perity of this Island, as well as that of 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
           
     the other Provinces, and: that he will 
     <lb/>
     do all in his power to bring about a 
     <lb/>
     union on just and equitable terms.

     <persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. LEADER OF THE GOVERN<lb break="no"/>MENT</persName>.—I congratulate the hon. junior 
     <lb/>
     member for Murray Harbor on his 
     <lb/>
     very eloquent speech and self display. 
     <lb/>
     Taking him at his own word he is the 
     <lb/>
     greatest orator and statesman that ever 
     <lb/>
     stood upon the floor of this House. 
     <lb/>
     When the hon. .member for Belfast 
     <lb/>
     speaks, there is some little reason in 
     <lb/>
     his remarks, but I take no more notice 
     <lb/>
     of the statements of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Murray Harbor, than I do of a 
     <lb/>
     breeze of wind flowing through the 
     <lb/>
     building. His financial statements 
     <lb/>
     amount to nothing but wind and are 
     <lb/>
     not worthy of serious consideration. 
     <lb/>
     I repeat what I before stated in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the telegram from Lord Duf<lb break="no"/>ferin, that it was suggested by parties 
     <lb/>
     resident in this country ; I know some<lb break="no"/>thing about this affair. There is no 
     <lb/>
     hon. member of this House who en<lb break="no"/>tertains greater respect for the high 
     <lb/>
     position occupied by the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General of the Dominion than I do; 
     <lb/>
     but at the same time, His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     stands in the same position to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada, as our Lieutenant 
     <lb/>
     Governor does to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     Island. Suppose, for illustration, that 
     <lb/>
     one of the other Provinces stood in 
     <lb/>
     the same position to this Colony as 
     <lb/>
     we at present do to the Dominion, and 
     <lb/>
     that after obtaining certain terms of 
     <lb/>
     union, some interested person came 
     <lb/>
     over and said to His Honor the Lieut. 
     <lb/>
    Governor, "I want your Excellency 
     <lb/>to write a despatch stating that these 
     <lb/>are the best terms I can carry through 
     <lb/>Parliament." The telegram from 
     <lb/>Lord Dufferin was obtained in a pre<lb break="no"/>cisely similar manner. The statement 
     <lb/>I made last evening, I put, I think, 
     <lb/>fairly. We should take our position 
     <lb/>as it is, and not as it would be by cut<lb break="no"/>ting and carving it, to suit particular 
     <lb/>purposes. We have at present two

     branches of the Legislature, but if          
     <lb/>
    disposed to do so; we might dlspense 
     <lb/>with the Upper one, and also reduce 
     <lb/>the number of members of this Lower 
     <lb/>House, in order to reduce our Legis<lb break="no"/>lative expenditure, and still retain all 
     <lb/>the power that we really require.  The 
     <lb/>expenditure  of last year,   was, we 
     <lb/>know, an unusually large one, especi<lb break="no"/>ally tbat of the Board of Works! This 
     <lb/>year there has been expended by that 
     <lb/>Board no less than $61,000 since the<lb/>1st of January. Since our popuiation 
     <lb/>has increased, our wants are greater, 
     <lb/>labor is also becoming dearer, and the 
     <lb/>price of timber and other materials 
     <lb/>getting higher, so that it now requires 
     <lb/>a much  larger amount of money to 
     <lb/>meet the requirements of the country, 
     <lb/>than in former years. Our people will 
     <lb/>want steam communication in all 
     <lb/>directions, and this must be main<lb break="no"/>tained.   As fast as one item of ex<lb break="no"/>penditure is struck out, another new 
     <lb/>item will be inserted so that we shall 
     <lb/>require just as much money to meet 
     <lb/>our wants in future as we now do. 
     <lb/>Theré is always something turning up 
     <lb/>which requires an expenditure termed 
     <lb/>" Extraordinary,"and which cannot be 
     <lb/>foreseen. Under the terma now offer<lb break="no"/>ed, we should never receive any larger 
     <lb/>annual allowance than during the first 
     <lb/>year; while our present revenue 
     <lb/>doubles in eyery tweIve years. There 
     <lb/>are now fourteen millions of dollars to 
     <lb/>be distributed among the lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in the shape ofBetter Terms, 
     <lb/>which: shows that their wants are also 
     <lb/>increasing faster than their revenues. 
     <lb/>There are assets for the Dominion, 
     <lb/>set down by the hon. jjunior member 
     <lb/>for Belfast, as réturning.interest, which 
     <lb/>will never return a single cent to the 
     <lb/>Treasury, and which should, there<lb break="no"/>fore, be added to the sixty-two millions.. 
     <lb/>What guarantee have we that the 
     <lb/>construction of the   Bay Verte' Canal 
     <lb/>will not cost more than five millions 
     <lb/>or dollars? The same be may be' asked 
     <lb/>in reference to all the other great 
     <lb/>public works, now proposed by the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     Dominion, for the next fifteen years.    
     <lb/>
    Will they give us one -fortieth part of 
     <lb/>the excess of expenditure over the 
     <lb/>sums estimated as the: cost of those 
     <lb/>works? Not at all. By the Union 
     <lb/>Act we could not claim one shilling 
     <lb/>more than what accrues to us through<lb/>  the   increase of our population, and 
     <lb/>are shut} out from any share of tbe 
     <lb/>sums expended on public works. 
     <lb/>Although we shall form one -fortieth 
     <lb/>part   of the population of  the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, we shal] be cut off from the 
     <lb/>advantages of their Railways, and have 
     <lb/>no communication with Canada in<lb/>Winter, except by our little Icehoat. 
     <lb/>Our population may increase perhaps<lb/>so as to procure for us an addition<lb/>of $1000 per year  to our revenue, 
     <lb/>whereas our present Revenue doubles<lb/>every few years. It is true Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia and New Brunswick received<lb/>nothing for their Lighthouses then in 
     <lb/>existence; but many of ours have been 
     <lb/>built since the Union took place; and 
     <lb/>it is nothing: but fair that we should 
     <lb/>be allowed something for them.The 
     <lb/>same argument will apply to the Drill 
     <lb/>Sheds; we have a perfect right to re<lb break="no"/>ceive remuneration for them as they 
     <lb/>have been built since the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference took placc. I am not one 
     <lb/>who would ask the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for anything unreasonable and 
     <lb/>unfair ; but we should not   hesitate to 
     <lb/>stand up for our rights, and if we can 
     <lb/>obtain a few thousand dollars here and 
     <lb/>a few thousand there, to which we are 
     <lb/>justly entitled, we shall save so much 
     <lb/>in direct taxation.  But since the dele<lb break="no"/>gates have returned, their notions are 
     <lb/>so large that they think four or five 
     <lb/>thousand dollars here and there not 
     <lb/>worth mentioning. We have had a 
     <lb/>hard battle to fight, and have, through<lb/>our industry and perseverance,de<lb break="no"/>veloped, to a considerable extent, one<lb/>of the most productive countries in the <lb/>world. The number of poor people <lb/>among us is very small, and I believe<lb/>there is not a country in the world<lb/>where there is more real home com<lb break="no"/>

     fort than there is on this little Island.<lb/>We have a right to ask for what we<lb/>believe reasonable and fair, and to be <lb/>
     
    placed in as good a position as the <lb/>people of the neighbouring Provinces.<lb/>We should not be placed in such a <lb/>position that we shall be compelled to <lb/>come down upon our people in direct<lb/>taxation immediately after entering 
     <lb/>the Union. I am not sorry to see<lb/>Confederation about to be carried, as <lb/>I have always been in   favor of it, 
     <lb/>and just and equitable terms, and be<lb break="no"/>lieved it would be a great benefit to 
     <lb/>this country. It was generally thought<lb/>that if our delegates at the Quebec 
     <lb/>Conference had signed the Report 
     <lb/>then agreed upon, we should be legis<lb break="no"/>lated into Confederation. I did not 
     <lb/>think this would be the case; but be<lb break="no"/>lieved it possihle that it might be   so. 
     <lb/>I thought that if the $800.000   turned 
               <lb/>out to be a <hi rendition="simple:italic">bona fide</hi> offer, that I was 
     <lb/>satisfied in laying it before the people, 
     <lb/>as it would be the means of makmg 
     <lb/>every farmer in the Colony a free- . 
     <lb/>holder, and would thus settle the land 
     <lb/>question. lf  theIsIand shou}d have 
     <lb/>been legislated into   Confederation 
     <lb/>without obtaining that amount, what 
     <lb/>position would we have been in with 
     <lb/>regard to our lands? I was, after 
     <lb/>consldering the matter fully, prepared 
     <lb/>to place the offer before the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture for discussion, and if found satis<lb break="no"/>factory, to put the question to the 
     <lb/>people at the polls. The basis laid 
     <lb/>down by the Union Association in<lb break="no"/>cluded the eighty cents per head, the 
     <lb/>$800,000, the   Railway, and a fair 
     <lb/>share of the allowance for public works. 
     <lb/>I believe the Government at that time 
     <lb/>got wind of the platform of that As<lb break="no"/>sociation, and that the latter called 
     <lb/>forth the minute of Council to 
     <lb/>which I lately referred.  It has been 
     <lb/>stated that another delegation should 
     <lb/>not be sent without showing good 
     <lb/>grounds for so  doing. Wé should 
     <lb/>have such terms granted us that if the 
     <lb/>Dominion Debt increases   by expendi<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     ture for public works, we shal1 have   
     <lb/>
     one-fortieth part   of that expenditure 
     <lb/>
     
      as long as we are one-fortieth part of<lb/>
     the population. If we have a legiti<lb break="no"/>mate claim to the cost of the Light<lb break="no"/>houses built by us since the Quebec  
     <lb/>
     Scheme was agreed upon ; even if it 
     <lb/>
     be only $40,00 let us have it.   I, 
     <lb/>
     for one, will not attempt to deceive 
     <lb/>
     the people by declaring that   we have 
     <lb/>
     
     plenty for all our wants in the present<lb/>Terms when 1 know we have not. I 
     <lb/>
     feel confident that very large conces<lb break="no"/>sions will yet be made, that Confed<lb break="no"/>oration will, before long; be an accom<lb break="no"/>plished fact, and that it will bethe 
     <lb/>
     happiest day in the history of Prlnce 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island when it is consummat<lb break="no"/>ed. I am prepared to use my humble 
     <lb/>
     efforts to carry out this great question, 
     <lb/>
     and in order to do so in the most satis<lb break="no"/>factory manner, would ask for the 
     <lb/>
     cordial and hearty support of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     members on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House. If a  delegation does go to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, and the hon, members of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition wish to serve the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of their country, 1 think it is 
     <lb/>
     their duty and also that of every hon. 
     <lb/>
     member of this House to give all the 
     <lb/>
     assistance they can to make it success<lb break="no"/>ful. A unanimous vote of this House 
     <lb/>
     would have a much better effect than a 
     <lb/>
     division of parties. It will  not cost 
     <lb/>
     us much to ask for better Terms, and 
     <lb/>
     if they cannot be obtained, we would  
     <lb/>
     be perfectly justified in accepting the 
     <lb/>
     present Terms. Our duty to our<lb break="no"/>selves, our constituents and our child<lb break="no"/>ren, compels us to take the course 
     <lb/>
     proposed. We are about to give up 
     <lb/>
     our right to collect our Import Duties    
     <lb/>
     to Canada, and in exchange want a 
     <lb/>
     fair and reasonable conslderation. I 
     <lb/>
     have good reason to think that we 
     <lb/>
     shall obtain the concessions we ask, 
     <lb/>
     and believe we shall. No effort shall 
     <lb/>
     be wanting on our part in endeavor<lb break="no"/>ing to obtain what we consider justice 
     <lb/>
     at the hands of the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment.

            <p><persName ref="pers:MCNE1">MR. McNEILL</persName>.- Mr. Speaker, the<lb/>hon. member, the Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment said the Terms offered for our<lb/>acceptance now, are not as good as we<lb/>are entitled to. This may be so. For<lb/>my part I was alwaays one of those<lb/>who thought Prince Edward Island,<lb/>under proper management, could raise<lb/>means sufficient to supply all her<lb/>wants. But now I am sorry to ob<lb break="no"/>serve that both sides of this House<lb/>seem to be of the opinion that Con<lb break="no"/>federation is inevitable, either on the<lb/>Terms now offered or better if they<lb/>can be obtained. But let us see what<lb/>has brought about this state of affairs.<lb/>In answering this question I feel<lb/>bound to say that the Government<lb/>which introduced and carried the Rail<lb break="no"/>way Bill through the Legislature, was<lb/>the part at whose door the cause<lb/>producing that which we now deplore,<lb/>must be laid. If the Railway and<lb/>Confederation are to benefit this<lb/>Island, then no man will deserve more<lb/>credit for the measure than the hon.<lb/>member the Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Ever since the time of the<lb/>Quebec Conference the people have<lb/>closely watched their public men, and<lb/>any of them who expressed a desire<lb/>in favor of the Confederation, had no<lb/>chance of being returned. At all their<lb/>public meetings the question had been<lb/>
            <cb/>
            discussed, and their representatives<lb/>understood very well what the feeling<lb/>of their constituents was on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion. In a word, the people were pre<lb break="no"/>pared for everything but that which<lb/>happened. The people of this Island<lb/>never supposed any body of men<lb/>would come into power who would<lb/>pass a measure of such magnitude<lb/>without their consent. But such a<lb/>party did arise. Well do I recollect<lb/>how at that time the prosperity of the<lb/>country was set forth. Not only when<lb/>the road would be building, but ever<lb/>afterwards, was this Colony to be in a<lb/>flourishing condition. How different<lb/>the experience of the reality, with<lb/>what was then so glowingly pictured<lb/>in the speeches of hon. members. It<lb/>was not the paltry outlay upon bridges<lb/>which produced the pressure now felt<lb/>upon the public funds of the Colony.<lb/>I am surprised that the hon. member<lb/>should refer to such matters in the<lb/>manner he did. After listening to his<lb/>speech on Nomination day, I did ex<lb break="no"/>pect to see him coming down with<lb/>better arguments than those which he<lb/>has used in this discussion. On Nomi<lb break="no"/>nation day the hon. member thought a<lb/>branch line of the Railroad was re<lb break="no"/>quired for Rustico, and I did expect<lb/>to hear that he was going to ask this<lb/>of the Dominion Government, instead<lb/>of the small and trifling matters to<lb/>which he referred; such as our Drill<lb/>Sheds, &amp;c. I am inclined to believe<lb/>now, that the speech of the hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber on that occasion was delivered<lb/>more for the purpose of defeating my<lb/>election, than anything he intended to<lb/>do for Rustico. Matters, however,<lb/>have come to such a pass that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple saw no alternative but to enter into<lb/>a union with the Dominion. If better<lb/>Terms can be had, so much the better.<lb/>But this I do not expect. I told my<lb/>constituents that I would not consent<lb/>to lay one dollar more of taxation upon<lb/>them unless the Terms brought down<lb/>were accepted. There are many lease<lb/>holders in my district, and they find<lb/>
           
           <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">105</fw>
           
           the rent tax enough. One great error<lb/>on the part of the former Government<lb/>was the haste with which the Railway<lb/>Bill was pushed through the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. And if there is any value at all<lb/>in the Engineer's Report, it is in the<lb/>information it contains on this point.<lb/>With respect to the rest of their Re<lb break="no"/>port it is not worth the paper it is<lb/>written on. There was no person in<lb/>the Legislature, when the Bill was<lb/>passed, who knew anything about<lb/>Railroads, therefore, the time allowed<lb/>for its consideration was too short.<lb/>With respect to the branch lines, it<lb/>was well understood by my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents that the main Trunk was under<lb break="no"/>taken without the consent of the most<lb/>of the people, and they knew also<lb/>when the main line was undertaken,<lb/>the branches were to follow. It may<lb/>be asked how I know this? I answer<lb/>by saying that when the Railway Bill<lb/>was before the House, petitions, numer<lb break="no"/>ously signed, came in against the<lb/>measure. But when the branch line<lb/>Bill was before us, no petition came in<lb/>against it. This shows that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple knew and understood we would<lb/>have to build the branch lines. It<lb/>was neither the building of the<lb/>branches, nor the effect produced by<lb/>the Engineer's Report, which led to<lb/>the unpopularity of the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. In my district these considera<lb break="no"/>tions did not influence half a dozen of<lb/>votes. It was the School Question<lb/>which caused my majority to be but<lb/>fifty at the last election. I am not<lb/>going to say whether the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment did right or wrong, but this I<lb/>will say: They appealed to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and in so far as their policy on<lb/>Confederation went, have carried the<lb/>country with them. Nor do I doubt<lb/>but that if the hon. member had ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to the country in the same waay<lb/>with his Railwaay measure, though he<lb/>would not have been sustained, at all<lb/>events he would have incurred less<lb/>blame. Considering the smallness of<lb/>the Island, and the limited revenue of<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>the Colony, the measure, to say the<lb/>least of it, amounted to a reckless<lb/>piece of legislation. If we have to<lb/>give up our Statute as a separate<lb/>Colony, and go into Confederation, we<lb/>will require the ability of all our ablest<lb/>men to secure the best Terms we can<lb/>obtain, (hear.) But in attempting to<lb/>re-open negotiations with the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government on this question,<lb/>we had better take care we do not lose<lb/>more thant we will gain. The Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government have to contend<lb/>with an able and vigilant opposition,<lb/>and unless the Government are certain<lb/>that better Terms are to be had, this<lb/>House should not consent to open up<lb/>negotiations again. Under the Terms<lb/>brought down we can get along much<lb/>better in Confederation than out of it.<lb/>But under and circumstances we will<lb/>have to resort to local taxation to meet<lb/>the internal requirements of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. You cannot show me any coun<lb break="no"/>try which can get along without taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. We see at this moment that the<lb/>United States Government have now<lb/>to incur expense in putting down a<lb/>war with the Indians; nor do we know<lb/>but the same may occur in Canaada.<lb/>They are encroaching upon the lands<lb/>long held by the original owners of the<lb/>soil, and when they come to be driven<lb/>out of their possessions and hunting<lb/>grounds, it is hard to say what may<lb/>not take place. I have no special<lb/>benefit to receive or expect from any<lb/>Government, but hope every hon.<lb/>member will use his best efforts to see<lb/>that justice is done to the country at<lb/>large. While I hope and trust there<lb/>will be no ill feeling manifested on<lb/>either side in dealing with this very<lb/>important question, (hear.)<lb/>
