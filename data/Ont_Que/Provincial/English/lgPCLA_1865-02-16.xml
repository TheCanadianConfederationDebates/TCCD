<!--<p>
     distinction between Papists and Protestants. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I never used the terms "Papist," or 
     <lb/>
     " Catholic," or " Protestant." (Hear, hear) 
     <lb/>
     The distinction I drew, and the remarks I 
     <lb/>
     made, were with regard to the English and 
     <lb/>
     the French of Lower Canada. And honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen will remember that I distinctly ad<lb break="no"/>mitted what the Premier had claimed for his 
     <lb/>
     countrymen—namely, their well-known liber<lb break="no"/>ality. I have always admitted that, and have 
     <lb/>
     never had any disposition to deny it. But 
     <lb/>
     my argument was that, in establishing a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, our rights and interests should be 
     <lb/>
     protected by distinct provisions in that Con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     stitution—that these would form the only 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory assurance we could get—that we 
     <lb/>
     could not rest upon the liberality of any class 
     <lb/>
     of men, but must have the assurance of dis<lb break="no"/>tinct guarantees. That was the line of argu<lb break="no"/>ment pursued. (Hear, hear.) I do not 
     <lb/>
     think the Premier should have been so hard 
     <lb/>
     upon me for not stipulating that the ten men 
     <lb/>
     who should, be chosen in the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should be old men, so that they might 
     <lb/>
     not have the advantage of putting in young 
     <lb/>
     men as an offset to our old ones. When I 
     <lb/>
     see, in the case of the Premier himself, at 
     <lb/>
     his advanced years, the youthful fire burn 
     <lb/>
     up so brightly, and that age does not at all 
     <lb/>
     detract from the vigor he manifests, I think 
     <lb/>
     he must excuse me for not having made 
     <lb/>
     an invidious distinction between old men and 
     <lb/>
     young ones. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     HONl. MR. WILSON begged to state that 
     <lb/>
     he was opposed to the amendment, but was 
     <lb/>
     precluded from recording his vote, in conse- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>, in resuming the 
     <lb/>
     adjourned debate on Confederation, said— 
     <lb/>
     I should have desired to make my remarks 
     <lb/>
     to the House in French, but considering the 
     <lb/>
     large number of honorable members who are 
     <lb/>
     not familiar with that language, I think it 
     <lb/>
     my duty to speak at the present time in 
     <lb/>
     English. In rising on this occasion to ad<lb break="no"/>dress the House on the important question 
     <lb/>
     submitted to us, I must say I do so with an 
     <lb/>
     unusual degree of embarrassment, not only 
     <lb/>
     on account of the importance of the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of our deliberations, but also because I 
     <lb/>
     have to differ from many of those with whom 
     <lb/>
     I have been in the habit of acting ever since 
     <lb/>
     I first entered into political life. Yet, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, when I consider the questions 
     <lb/>
     raised by the resolutions submitted by the 
     <lb/>
     Government, I find that whether they be 
     <lb/>
     purely political ones, such as the proposal to 
     <lb/>
     restrict the influence and control of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple over the Legislature of the country by 
     <lb/>
     substituting a Chamber nominated by the 
     <lb/>
     Crown for an Elective Legislative Council, or 
     <lb/>
     whether they are purely commercial in their 
     <lb/>
     character, such as that regarding the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, or the larger question of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation itself, I still hold the same 
     <lb/>
     views that I held, in common with others 
     <lb/>
     who have now changed their opinions, when 
     <lb/>
     the subjects were first mooted. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And as I have not heard, since the first 
     <lb/>
     opening of this debate, any reason for sub<lb break="no"/>stituting a nominated for an elective Upper 
     <lb/>
     Chamber that was not fully argued out in 
     <lb/>
     1856, when, by an overwhelming majority 
     <lb/>
     of this House, it was decided that the elec<lb break="no"/>tive principle should prevail—as I have 
     <lb/>
     not heard any reason why we should pledge 
     <lb/>
     our credit and resources to the construction 
     <lb/>
     of the Intercolonial Railway, even previous 
     <lb/>
     to any estimate of its cost being made, that 
     <lb/>
     was not urged in 1862 when the question was 
     <lb/>
     before the country—nor any reason for inter<lb break="no"/>colonial union that was not raised in 1858, 
     <lb/>
     when the present Hon. Finance Minister 
     <lb/>
    pressed the question on the attention of the 
     <lb/>Imperial authorities—I do not see on what 
     <lb/>ground these several subjects which were 
     <lb/>then so unpopular, and those views which 
     <lb/>were then most universally repudiated, 
     <lb/>should now be more favorably considered by 
     <lb/>the people of this country—I fail to perceive 
     <lb/>why those once unpalatable measures, now 
     <lb/>

     coupled with additions to the burdens of the 
     <lb/>
     people, should have grown into the public 
     <lb/>
     favor. I cannot understand why I or any 
     <lb/>
     members of this House should change our 
     <lb/>
     views merely because certain other members 
     <lb/>
     have, when we do not conscientiously think 
     <lb/>
     such change would be for the benefit of the 
     <lb/>
     country. I say, sir, that I am quite entitled 
     <lb/>
     to maintain the same views now that I have 
     <lb/>
     always entertained. (Hear.) This scheme, 
     <lb/>
     sir, is submitted to us on two grounds ; first, 
     <lb/>
     the necessity for meeting the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     difficulties which have arisen between Upper  
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada, owing to the growing 
     <lb/>
     demands on the part of Upper Canada for 
     <lb/>
     representation by population ; and, secondly, 
     <lb/>
     the necessity for providing more efficient 
     <lb/>
     means for the defence of the country than 
     <lb/>
     now exist. These are the only two grounds 
     <lb/>
     we have heard stated for the propositions 
     <lb/>
     now submitted to us ; and, sir, I shall apply 
     <lb/>
     myself to explain my views on these two 
     <lb/>
     subjects, and also upon the scheme generally. 
     <lb/>
     When on the first question, I trust I shall 
     <lb/>
     be permitted to go a little into the history 
     <lb/>
     of the agitation of representation by pop<lb break="no"/>ulation, for I owe it to myself, to my 
     <lb/>
     constituents and the country. My name 
     <lb/>
     has been used in various ways. It has some<lb break="no"/>times been said that I was entirely favorable 
     <lb/>
     to representation by population—at other 
     <lb/>
     times that I was entirely favorable to the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the provinces, and I will 
     <lb/>
     now endeavor, once more, to state as clearly 
     <lb/>
     as possible what my real views have been and 
     <lb/>
     still are. ( Hear.) The first time represen<lb break="no"/>tation by population was mooted in this 
     <lb/>
     House, on behalf of Upper Canada, was, I 
     <lb/>
     believe, in the Session of 1852, when the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party took it up, and the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Sir ALLAN MACNAB moved resolutions in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of the principle. We then found the con<lb break="no"/>servatives arrayed in support of this constitu<lb break="no"/>tional change. It had been mooted before on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of Lower Canada, but the Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canadians had all opposed it. I think 
     <lb/>
     two votes were taken in 1852, and on one of 
     <lb/>
     these occasions the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West (Hon. J. A. MACDONALD) voted for 
     <lb/>
     it ; it came up incidentally. In 1854 the 
     <lb/>
     MACNAB-MORIN coalition took place, and we 
     <lb/>
     heard no more of representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion from that quarter—that is, as mooted 
     <lb/>
     by the Conservative party, who from that 
     <lb/>
     moment uniformly opposed it on every occa<lb break="no"/>sion. It was, however, taken up by the present 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council, the member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford, and with the energy and 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
          

     vigor he brings to bear on every question he 
     <lb/>
     takes in hand, he caused such an agitation 
     <lb/>
     in its behalf as almost threatened a revolu<lb break="no"/>tion. As the agitation in the country in<lb break="no"/>creased, so did the vote for it in this House 
     <lb/>
     increase, and on several occasions I expressed 
     <lb/>
     my views upon the subject. I never shirked 
     <lb/>
     the question—I never hesitated to say that 
     <lb/>
     something ought to be done to meet the just 
     <lb/>
     claims of Upper Canada, and that represen<lb break="no"/>tation based on population was in the abstract 
     <lb/>
     a just and correct principle. I held, at the 
     <lb/>
     same time, there were reasons why Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada could not grant it ; I entreated Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadian representatives to show themselves 
     <lb/>
     disposed to meet the views of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     by making, at any rate, a counter proposi<lb break="no"/>tion ; and in 1856, when Parliament was 
     <lb/>
     sitting in Toronto, I, for the first time, sug<lb break="no"/>gested that one means of getting over the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty would be to substitute for the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Legislative union a Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     the two Canadas, by means of which all local 
     <lb/>
     questions could be consigned to the delibera<lb break="no"/>tions of local legislatures, with a Central 
     <lb/>
     government having control of commercial 
     <lb/>
     and other questions of common or general 
     <lb/>
     interest. I stated that, considering the 
     <lb/>
     different religious faith, the different lan<lb break="no"/>guage, the different laws that prevailed in 
     <lb/>
     the two sections of the country, this was the 
     <lb/>
     best way to meet the difficulty ; to leave to a 
     <lb/>
     general government questions of trade, cur<lb break="no"/>rency, banking, public works of a general 
     <lb/>
     character, &amp;c., and to commit to the decision 
     <lb/>
     of local legislatures all matters of a local 
     <lb/>
     bearing. At the same time I stated that, if 
     <lb/>
     these views should not prevail, I would cer<lb break="no"/>tainly go for representation by population, 
     <lb/>
     and such checks and guarantees as would 
     <lb/>
     secure the interests of each section of the 
     <lb/>
     country, and preserve to Lower Canada its 
     <lb/>
     cherished institutions. (Hear, hear.) This 
     <lb/>
     speech, sir, has been twisted in all sorts of 
     <lb/>
     ways. I have heard it quoted to prove that 
     <lb/>
     I was in favor of representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion, pure and simple ; that I was in favor 
     <lb/>
     of a Confederation of the provinces and for 
     <lb/>
     several other purposes, just as it suited 
     <lb/>
     the occasion or the purpose of those who 
     <lb/>
    quoted it. (Hear and laughter.) The first 
     <lb/>time the matter was put to a practical test 
     <lb/>was in 1858. On the resignation of the 
     <lb/>MACDONALD-CARTIER Administration, the 
     <lb/>BROWN-DORIAN Government was formed, 
     <lb/>and one of the agreements made between its 
     <lb/>members was that the constitutional question 
     <lb/>should be taken up and settled, either by a 
     <lb/>
           

    
            <pb n="247" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0247.jpg"/>

     Confederation of the two provinces or by 
     <lb/>
     representation according to population, with 
     <lb/>
     such checks and guarantees as would secure 
     <lb/>
     the religious faith, the laws, the language, 
     <lb/>
     and the peculiar institutions of each section 
     <lb/>
     of the country from encroachments on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the other. The subject came up 
     <lb/>
     again in the latter part of 1850, when the 
     <lb/>
     Toronto Convention took place. I should, 
     <lb/>
     however, first say that, when the BROWN- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     DORION Administration was formed, the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. the President of the Council urged 
     <lb/>
     very strongly that representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion should be taken up as the method by 
     <lb/>
     which to settle the constitutional question ; 
     <lb/>
     while, on the contrary, I saw the difficulty 
     <lb/>
     of so taking it up, even with such checks 
     <lb/>
     and guarantees as were spoken of, and made 
     <lb/>
     the counter-proposition that a Confederation 
     <lb/>
     of the two provinces should be formed. Of 
     <lb/>
     course as our Administration was so short- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     lived, the subject was not discussed in all its 
     <lb/>
     bearings ; but if we could have come to an 
     <lb/>
     agreement on one or the other mode, that 
     <lb/>
     one would have been submitted as the solu<lb break="no"/>tion for the evils complained of—it being 
     <lb/>
     however distinctly understood that I would 
     <lb/>
     not attempt to carry any such measure 
     <lb/>
     through without obtaining for it a majority 
     <lb/>
     from Lower Canada. I would never have 
     <lb/>
     tried to make any change in the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     without ascertaining that the people in my 
     <lb/>
     own section of the province were in favor of 
     <lb/>
     such a change. ( Hear.) To return to the 
     <lb/>
     Toronto Convention. I was invited to attend 
     <lb/>
     it, but though I was unable to do so, certain 
     <lb/>
     communications took place, and a meeting 
     <lb/>
     of the liberal members of the House from 
     <lb/>
    Lower Canada was held, and a document 
     <lb/>issued, signed by the present Minister of 
     <lb/>Agriculture (Hon. Mr. MCGEE), Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>DESSAULLES, Hon. Mr. DRUMMOND, and 
     <lb/>myself. The document was given to the 
     <lb/>public for the purpose of setting forth the 
     <lb/>views which we held  as to the settlement of 
     <lb/>the difficulty. Pretended extracts have 
     <lb/>been given from that document, as from my 
     <lb/>speech, to attempt to prove all sorts of things 
     <lb/>as being my views, but I can show most 
     <lb/>clearly that the proposition made in it was 
     <lb/>just that which had been made in 1858, 
     <lb/>viz, the Confederation of the two provinces, 
     <lb/>with some joint authority for both. Both 
     <lb/>at that time, and at the time of the forma<lb break="no"/>tion of the BROWN-DORIAN Administration, 
     <lb/>various suggestions were made as to the 
     <lb/>carrying out of the plan of confederating the 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
         

     two Canadas. Some thought that two 
     <lb/>
     entirely distinct legislatures should be form<lb break="no"/>ed ; one local for Lower Canada, another 
     <lb/>
     local for Upper Canada, with a general 
     <lb/>
     legislature acting for both. Others suggest<lb break="no"/>ed the idea that the same legislature might 
     <lb/>
     fulfil all puposes ; that the same body might 
     <lb/>
     meet and deliberate on questions of common 
     <lb/>
     interest, and that the members for each 
     <lb/>
     section might then separate and discuss all 
     <lb/>
     matters of a sectional character. Others, 
     <lb/>
     again, said the same result might be obtained 
     <lb/>
     by having but one legislature, and insisting 
     <lb/>
     that no laws affecting either section of the 
     <lb/>
     province should be carried, unless with the 
     <lb/>
     support of a majority from the section 
     <lb/>
     affected by them. These three plans were 
     <lb/>
     suggested—the first to have two entirely 
     <lb/>
     distinct legislative bodies, one for general 
     <lb/>
     purposes, others for local ones ; the second, 
     <lb/>
     to have one legislature, of which the parts 
     <lb/>
     should have the right to act separately for 
     <lb/>
     local objects, after general business had been 
     <lb/>
    disposed of ; the third, to have but one body, 
     <lb/>but to resolve that no legislative act of a 
     <lb/>local nature should pass without the consent 
     <lb/>of a majority of the representatives from 
     <lb/>that locality. (Hear, hear.) The document 
     <lb/>to which I have just referred, issued in 
     <lb/>October, 1859, contained this language on 
     <lb/>the subject :—

     Well, Sir, I have not a word of all this 
     <lb/>
     to take back. I still hold to the same 
     <lb/>
     views, the same opinions. I still think that 
     <lb/>
     a Federal union of Canada might hereafter 
     <lb/>
     extend so as to embrace other territories 
     <lb/>
     either west or east ; that such a system is 
     <lb/>
     well adapted to admit of territorial expan<lb break="no"/>sion without any disturbance of the federal 
     <lb/>
     economy, but I cannot understand how this 
     <lb/>
     plain sentence should be considered by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council, or by other 
     <lb/>
     hon. members who have spoken in the 
     <lb/>
     other House, as any indication that I have 
     <lb/>
     ever been in favor of Confederation with 
     <lb/>
     the other British Provinces. There is 
     <lb/>
     nothing I have ever said or written that can 
     <lb/>
     be construed to mean that I was ever in 
     <lb/>
     favor of such a proposition. On the con<lb break="no"/>trary, whenever the question came up I set 
     <lb/>
     my face against it. I asserted that such a 
     <lb/>
     confederation could only bring trouble and 
     <lb/>
     embarrassment, that there was no social, no 
     <lb/>
     commercial connection between the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces proposed to be united—nothing to 
     <lb/>
     justify their union at the present juncture. 
     <lb/>
     Of course I do not say that I shall be 
     <lb/>
     opposed to their Confederation for all time 
     <lb/>
     to come. Population may extend over the 
     <lb/>
     wilderness that now lies between the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces and ourselves, and commer<lb break="no"/><cb/>cial intercourse may increase sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     to render Confederation desirable. My 
     <lb/>
     speeches have been paraded of late in all 
     <lb/>
     the ministerial papers—misconstrued, mis<lb break="no"/>translated, falsified in every way—for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of making the public believe that 
     <lb/>
     in former times I held different views from 
     <lb/>
     those I now do. A French paper has said 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     and as I said in 1861 also, that I am opposed to 
     <lb/>
     this Confederation now. In the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mirror of Par<lb break="no"/>liament</hi> which contains a report, though a 
     <lb/>
     very bad one, of my speech in 1861, I find 
     <lb/>
     that I said on that occasion :—

     This is the speech which has been held 
     <lb/>
     to signify that I was anxious for Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, that I should like nothing better. 
     <lb/>
     Why ? I distinctly said that though the 
     <lb/>
     time might come when it would become 
     <lb/>
     necessary, it was not desirable under existing 
     <lb/>
     circumstances. (Hear, hear.) In 1862 I 
     <lb/>
     was not in Parliament ; the CARTIER-MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD Administration was dismissed, and 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend, the member for Cornwall 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. John S. MACDONALD), was called 
     <lb/>
     upon to form a new one. He applied to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SICOTTE to form the Lower Canada section 
     <lb/>
     while he himself undertook the formation of 
     <lb/>
    the Upper Canada portion. The question of 
     <lb/>representation by population then necessarily 
     <lb/>came up for settlement—this time at the 
     <lb/>hands of the Liberal party who had voted for 
     <lb/>it year after year—and when I came down 
     <lb/>to Quebec, summoned by telegraph, I found 
     <lb/>the arrangements made, the policy of the 
     <lb/>new government was settled, representation 
     <lb/>by population was excluded. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>The Liberal party from Upper Canada, sir, 
     <lb/>to my surprise, had decided that it was not 
     <lb/>to be taken up—that they were going into 
     <lb/>office just as the Conservative party had done 
     <lb/>before on a similar occasion in 1854 ; they 
     <lb/>decided that they would sustain an Adminis 
     <lb/>tration which made it a closed question, and 
     <lb/>whose members all pledged themselves to 
     <lb/>vote against it. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RANK1">MR. RANKIN</persName>—No, no.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—If not, I was mis<lb break="no"/>informed. I certainly understood that the 
     <lb/>
     Administration was formed on the under<lb break="no"/><pb n="249" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0249.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">249</fw>standing that every member of it should 
     <lb/>
     vote against the question of representation 
     <lb/>
     by population whenever it came up, and that 
     <lb/>
     the Upper Canada party would support the 
     <lb/>
     Administration so formed. At any rate the 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada Liberal party supported, for 
     <lb/>
     eleven months, a government pledged to ex<lb break="no"/>clude representation by population from the 
     <lb/>
     category of open questions, and agreed to lay 
     <lb/>
     that question aside. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. MCKENZIE</persName> (Lambton)—No, no. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—I hear an honorable 
     <lb/>gentleman say it was not so, that he did not 
     <lb/>agree to lay aside representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion then, but if he did not then has he not 
     <lb/>done so since ? He declared at a public 
     <lb/>meeting the other day that representation 
     <lb/>by population was no cure for the evils afflict<lb break="no"/>ing Upper Canada. The members from 
     <lb/>Upper Canada who had joined the MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD-SICOTTE Government had certainly 
     <lb/>abandoned representation by population, by 
     <lb/>entering into an Administration which bound 
     <lb/>every one of them to vote against it. The 
     <lb/>Hon. Provincial Secretary had stated pub<lb break="no"/>licly in Ottawa, in January, 1864, that it had 
     <lb/>been abandoned by the Liberal party at the 
     <lb/>Toronto Convention in 1859 ; and although 
     <lb/>he had at the time been soundly abused for 
     <lb/>this by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> and by those of his party 
     <lb/>who look to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> as their political gos<lb break="no"/>pel, he had now the satisfaction of seeing 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Lambton, and some 
     <lb/>others who formerly held very strong views 
     <lb/>on this question, acknowledge, as they had 
     <lb/>done at a public meeting  held at Toronto 
     <lb/>about three weeks ago, that they also con<lb break="no"/>sidered representation by population as ap<lb break="no"/>plied to Canada no remedy for the Upper 
     <lb/>Province, and that it was not a measure the 
     <lb/>liberals ought to insist upon, and that it had 
     <lb/>been abandoned. (Hear, hear and laughter.) 
     <lb/> Yes, the question was in effect abandoned 
     <lb/>when in November, 1859, six hundred 
     <lb/>delegates from all parts of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>attended the Reform Convention at Toronto, 
     <lb/>and agreed to advocate a Confederation of 
     <lb/>the two Canadas, by giving to each province 
     <lb/>a local legislature, with some joint authority, 
     <lb/>to carry on the general business common to 
     <lb/>both. The hon. member on my left was 
     <lb/>present on the occasion— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Yes I was. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—And the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber has told me that he never saw a more 
     <lb/>
     respectable, a more educated, or more intelli<lb break="no"/>gent assemblage brought together in such 
     <lb/>
                        <cb/>
           

     numbers to discuss public questions. But 
     <lb/>
     that scheme did not attract much attention 
     <lb/>
     out of the Convention. It took no hold on 
     <lb/>
     the popular mind. Shortly before that, in 
     <lb/>
     1858, the present Hon. Finance Minister, 
     <lb/>
     who then sat on the cross-benches, made a 
     <lb/>
     speech of two or three hours' duration, in 
     <lb/>
     which, with all that force and ability for 
     <lb/>
     which he is distinguished, he expounded and 
     <lb/>
     advocated the Confederation of the whole of 
     <lb/>
     the British North American Provinces. He 
     <lb/>
     was then assisted in its advocacy by the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Hon. Minister of Agriculture ; and, 
     <lb/>
     subsequently, on becoming a member of the 
     <lb/>
     CARTIER-MACDONALD Administration, he 
     <lb/>
     went to England and drew the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial authorities to the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of all those provinces. The 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Finance Minister received an answer 
     <lb/>
     not very encouraging ; and that which he 
     <lb/>
     received from this country was still less en<lb break="no"/>couraging. There was not even an answer 
     <lb/>
     to his speech, able though it certainly was — 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p>HON. MR. HOLTON—He never ven<lb break="no"/>tured to propose any resolution to Parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON. MR. DORION—Though the Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration was formed with the understand<lb break="no"/>ing of effecting the Confederation of all the 
     <lb/>provinces, and it was the main plank of their 
     <lb/>platform, they never dared to submit the 
     <lb/>question to Parliament at all. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>Subsequently, in 1861, the hon. member 
     <lb/>for South Oxford brought forward a motion 
     <lb/>based on the resolution at the Toronto Con<lb break="no"/>vention. I spoke  and voted for it. It was in 
     <lb/>perfect accord with a notice I had given in 
     <lb/>1856, and which was read here by the Hon. 
     <lb/>President of the Council a few nights ago, 
     <lb/>and with my often-repeated declarations that 
     <lb/>I was willing to adopt some measure calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to remove existing difficulties, without 
     <lb/>doing injustice to either section ; but while 
     <lb/>I was willing to do justice to Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>I always declared that I would not do so by 
     <lb/>sacrificing the interests of Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>or placing her in the position of having to 
     <lb/>beg for justice at the hands of the sister pro<lb break="no"/>vince. (Hear, hear.) I always stated that 
     <lb/>the difference existing in the religious faith 
     <lb/>of the people of the two sections, in their 
     <lb/>language, in their laws, in their prejudices 
     <lb/>even—for there are prejudices which were re<lb break="no"/>spectable and ought to be respected—would 
     <lb/>prevent any member from Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>representing a French constituency, from 
     <lb/>voting for representation by population, pure 
     <lb/>and simple, and thereby placing the people  of

     Lower Canada in the position of having to 
     <lb/>
     trust for the protection of their rights to 
     <lb/>
     the people of Upper Canada, who would 
     <lb/>
     thereby have the majority in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. (Hear) There is at this moment a 
     <lb/>
     movement on the part of the British Pro<lb break="no"/>testants in Lower Canada to have some 
     <lb/>
     protection and guarantee for their educa<lb break="no"/>tional establishments in this province put 
     <lb/>
     into the scheme of Confederation, should it 
     <lb/>
     be adopted ; and far from finding fault with 
     <lb/>
     them, I respect them the more for their 
     <lb/>
     energy in seeking protection for their 
     <lb/>
     separate interests. I know that majorities 
     <lb/>
     are naturally aggressive and how the posses<lb break="no"/>sion of power engenders dispotism, and I 
     <lb/>
     can understand how a majority, animated 
     <lb/>
     this moment by the best feelings, might in 
     <lb/>
     six or nine months be willing to abuse its 
     <lb/>
     power and trample on the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     minority, while acting in good faith, and 
     <lb/>
     on what it considered to be its right. 
     <lb/>
     We know also the ill feelings that might 
     <lb/>
     be engendered by such a course. I think 
     <lb/>
     it but just that the Protestant minority 
     <lb/>
     should be protected in its rights in 
     <lb/>
     everything that was dear to it as a dis<lb break="no"/>tinct nationality, and should not lie at the 
     <lb/>
     discretion of the majority in this respect, 
     <lb/>
     and for this reason I am ready to extend to 
     <lb/>
     my Protestant fellow-citizens in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada of British origin, the fullest justice 
     <lb/>
     in all things, and I wish to see their interests 
     <lb/>
     as a minority guaranteed and protected in 
     <lb/>
     every scheme which may be adopted. With 
     <lb/>
     those views on the question of representa<lb break="no"/>tion, I pronounced in favor of a Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of the two Provinces of Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, as the best means of pro<lb break="no"/>moting the varied interests of the two sec<lb break="no"/>tions. But the Confederation I advocated 
     <lb/>
     was a real confederation, giving the largest 
     <lb/>
     powers to the local governments, and merely 
     <lb/>
     a delegated authority to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment—in that respect differing <hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi> from 
     <lb/>
     the one now proposed which gives all the 
     <lb/>
     powers to the Central Government, and 
     <lb/>
     reserves for the local governments the 
     <lb/>
     smallest possible amount of freedom of 
     <lb/>
     action. There is nothing besides in what I 
     <lb/>
     have ever written or said that can be inter<lb break="no"/>preted as favoring a Confederation of all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces. This I always opposed. 
     <lb/>
     There is no breach of confidence in my say<lb break="no"/>ing that in the conversations I had with the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council, previous to 
     <lb/>
     his accepting office, since he has referred to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          

     them himself in a speech which he made 
     <lb/>
     when reelected at South Oxford, I posi<lb break="no"/>tively declined to support any proposi<lb break="no"/>tion for the Confederation of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Very true, sir, I did not refuse to 
     <lb/>
     vote for it in committee. I did not vote at 
     <lb/>
     all—I was not present when the vote was 
     <lb/>
     taken, but I did not conceal my opposition to 
     <lb/>
     it. In that speech the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council also said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Before the negotiations were gone through 
     <lb/>
     with, I warned the Hon. Messrs. HOLTON and DO<lb break="no"/>RION to take action, but they refused me. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I felt all the pain of a refusal, but they 
     <lb/>
     left me no resource. When the question was 
     <lb/>
     asked me by the Government, I said wanted six 
     <lb/>
     members—four from Upper and two from Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. When asked how many supporters I 
     <lb/>
     could bring from Lower Canada, I replied that 
     <lb/>
     since Hon. Mr. DORION did not act, I could bring 
     <lb/>
     no supporters. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     So, sir, I have the best evidence possible 
     <lb/>
     to repudiate the accusation that I was in 
     <lb/>
     favor of Confederation of all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     in the fact that, before there was any ques<lb break="no"/>tion at all as to who should go into the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, I stated—and that in the hearing 
     <lb/>
     of several honorable members now present— 
     <lb/>
     that I would have nothing to do with it be<lb break="no"/>cause I did not conceive it would be for the 
     <lb/>
     interest of the country to have such a Con<lb break="no"/>federation, at all events at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) Now, sir, I think I have shown 
     <lb/>
     that I neither favored representation by 
     <lb/>
     population pure and simple, nor a Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the provinces ; and when honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen state that the necessity of settling 
     <lb/>
     the question of representation is the origin 
     <lb/>
     of this Federation scheme, they labor under 
     <lb/>
     a grave misapprehension. There is nothing 
     <lb/>
     further from the fact. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     representation question wasalmost altogether 
     <lb/>
     abandoned—was played out ; there was no 
     <lb/>
     agitation about it, and certainly less than 
     <lb/>
     there had been for the last ten years. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for South Oxford, after 
     <lb/>
     adopting the views of the Toronto Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, still persisted in advocating representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population, but so changed was the 
     <lb/>
     feeling that he could hardly get a debate on 
     <lb/>
     the motion he made last session for a com<lb break="no"/>mittee to consider the constitutional difficul<lb break="no"/>ties. There was then another cause for this 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme of which representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population was made the pretext. 
     <lb/>
     It is not so well known, but far more power<lb break="no"/>ful. In the year 1861, Mr. WATKIN was 
     <lb/>
     sent from England by the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="251" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0251.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">251</fw>

     Railway Company . He came with the dis<lb break="no"/>tinct view of making a large claim on the 
     <lb/>
     country for aid, but in the then temper of 
     <lb/>
     the people, he soon found that he could not 
     <lb/>
     expect to obtain that. Thinking that if he 
     <lb/>
     only could put some new scheme afloat which 
     <lb/>
     would give a decent pretext to a well disposed 
     <lb/>
     Government, he would quietly get the assist<lb break="no"/>ance required, he immediately started for 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces, and came back after 
     <lb/>
     inducing people there to resuscitate the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the Intercolonial Railway. Parties 
     <lb/>
     were readily found to advocate it, if Canada 
     <lb/>
     would only pay the piper. (Hear, and a 
     <lb/>
     laugh.) A meeting of delegates took place, 
     <lb/>
     resolutions were adopted, and an application 
     <lb/>
     was made to the Imperial Government for a 
     <lb/>
     huge contribution to its costs, in the shape 
     <lb/>
     of an indemnity for carrying the troops over 
     <lb/>
     the road. Mr. WATKIN and Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     VANKOUGHNET, who was then a member of 
     <lb/>
     the Government, went to England about 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, but the Imperial authorities 
     <lb/>
     were unwilling to grant the required assist<lb break="no"/>ance, and rejected their propositions. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     WATKIN, although baffled in his expectations, 
     <lb/>
     did not give up his project. He returned 
     <lb/>
     again to Canada, and by dint of perseverance, 
     <lb/>
     induced my honorable friend on my right 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. J. S. MACDONALD) and other honor<lb break="no"/>able members of his Cabinet to enter into his 
     <lb/>
     views. As to the advantages of the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, I have not the slightest 
     <lb/>
     idea that my hon. friend had any suspicion 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever of the motives which animated 
     <lb/>
     these Grand Trunk officials, and that their 
     <lb/>
     object was to have another haul at the public 
     <lb/>
     purse for the Grand Trunk—(laughter)— 
     <lb/>
     but this was the origin of the revival of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme for constructing the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">Hon. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—We found 
     <lb/>
     the project then left to us as a legacy by the 
     <lb/>
     CARTIER—MACDONALD Administration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">Hon. MR. DORION</persName>—So it was. The 
     <lb/>
     MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government found the 
     <lb/>
     matter so far advanced that an arrangement 
     <lb/>
     had been made for a meeting of delegates of 
     <lb/>
     the several provinces to consider again this 
     <lb/>
     railway scheme, the other project having 
     <lb/>
     failed.  At this meeting of delegates, which 
     <lb/>
     took place in September, 1862, a new scheme 
     <lb/>
     for building the Intercolonial was adopted, 
     <lb/>
     by which Canada was to pay five-twelfths 
     <lb/>
     and the Lower Provinces seven-twelfths. So 
     <lb/>
    unpopular was this arrangement that when 
     <lb/>its terms were made known, if a vote of the 
     <lb/>
           
    
            <cb/>
            

     people had been taken upon it, not ten out 
     <lb/>
     of every hundred, from Sandwich to Gaspé, 
     <lb/>
     would have declared in its favor, although 
     <lb/>
     Canada was only to pay five-twelfths of its 
     <lb/>
     cost. (Hear, hear.) This project having fail<lb break="no"/>ed, someother scheme had to be concocted for 
     <lb/>
     bringing aid and relief to the unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk—and the Confederation of all 
     <lb/>
     the British North American Provinces 
     <lb/>
     naturally suggested itself to the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk officials as the surest means of bring<lb break="no"/>ing with it the construction of the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     Such was the origin of this Confederation 
     <lb/>
     scheme. The Grand Trunk people are at 
     <lb/>
     the bottom of it ; and I find that at the 
     <lb/>
     last meeting of the Grand Trunk Railway 
     <lb/>
     Company, Mr. WATKIN did in advance 
     <lb/>
     congratulate the shareholders and bond<lb break="no"/>holders on the bright prospects opening 
     <lb/>
     before them, by the enhanced value which 
     <lb/>
     will be given to their shares and bonds, by 
     <lb/>
     the adoption of the Confederation scheme 
     <lb/>
     and the construction of the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     as part of the scheme. (Hear, hear.) I re<lb break="no"/>peat, sir, that representation by population 
     <lb/>
     had very little to do with bringing about 
     <lb/>
     
    this measure. The TACHÉ-MACDONALD 
     <lb/> Government were defeated because the House 
     <lb/>condemned them for taking without author<lb break="no"/>ity $100,000 out of the public chest for the 
     <lb/>Grand Trunk Railway, at a time when there 
     <lb/>had not been a party vote on representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population for one or two sessions. 
     <lb/>Those who had been the loudest in their 
     <lb/>advocacy of it, had let it drop. I was track<lb break="no"/>ed through Lower Canada as being willing 
     <lb/>to sell Lower Canada, grant representation 
     <lb/>by population, and destroy Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>institutions. I thank God, sir, I never in<lb break="no"/>sulted Upper Canada, like some of those 
     <lb/>who reviled me. I never compared the people 
     <lb/>of Upper Canada to so many codfish. I 
     <lb/>showed on the contrary that I was always 
     <lb/>willing to meet the just claims of Upper 
     <lb/>Canada. (Hear, hear.) Well, without any 
     <lb/>demand whatever for the agitation of this 
     <lb/>question, the moment the Government was 
     <lb/>defeated and there was a necessity for resign<lb break="no"/>ing or going before the people, these gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite prepared to embrace their 
     <lb/>greatest opponents and said to themselves, 
     <lb/>" We will make everything smooth, we will 
     <lb/>forget past difficulties, provided we can but 
     <lb/>keep our seats."

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—I hear a voice, sir, 
     <lb/>
     which is well known in this House, the voice 
     <lb/>
     of the Attorney General West, saying "hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear." But what was the course of that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman last year, when the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford had a committee appointed 
     <lb/>
     to whom was referred the despatch written 
     <lb/>
     by his three colleagues, the Minister of Fi<lb break="no"/>nance, the Attorney General East and the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. ROSS, who is now no longer a minis<lb break="no"/>ter. He voted against the appointment of 
     <lb/>
     the committee, and, after it was named, as a 
     <lb/>
     member of it, he voted. against the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of Confederation. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>— 
     <lb/>
     Hear, hear.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—The last vote taken 
     <lb/>
     in that committee was about the middle of 
     <lb/>
     June, the very day of the crisis, and the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman voted against the principle 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation of all the provinces, in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the opinions he again and 
     <lb/>
     again expressed in this House, as being 
     <lb/>
     opposed to all Confederation whatever. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) When I state that these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     only found out that Confederation was a 
     <lb/>
     panacea for all evils, a remedy for all ills, 
     <lb/>
     when their seats as ministers were in danger, 
     <lb/>
     I come to this conclusion quite legitimately, 
     <lb/>
     from facts which are well known to this 
     <lb/>
     House. (Hear, hear.) But, sir, it would 
     <lb/>
    probably be of very little moment whether 
     <lb/>I was formerly in favor of Confederation or 
     <lb/>against it, or whether the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>General West was in favor of Confederation 
     <lb/>or opposed to it, if the scheme proposed to 
     <lb/>us were an equitable one, or one calculated 
     <lb/>to meet the wishes of the people of this 
     <lb/>country ; but, as I said a minute ago, the 
     <lb/>scheme was not called for by any consider<lb break="no"/>able proportion of the population. It is not 
     <lb/>laid before the House as one which was 
     <lb/>demanded by any number of the people ; it 
     <lb/>is not brought down in response to any call 
     <lb/>from the people ; it is a device of men who 
     <lb/>are in difficulties, for the purpose of getting 
     <lb/>out of them. (Hear, hear.) The members 
     <lb/>of the TACHÉ-MACDONALD Government 
     <lb/>could not appeal to the country after their 
     <lb/>defeat upon the question, whether they were 
     <lb/>justified in taking $100,000 out of the pub<lb break="no"/>lic chest, in addition to the millions they 
     <lb/>had previously taken, without the consent of 
     <lb/>Parliament ; so, having either to give up 
     <lb/>their seats or evade that particular issue, 
     <lb/>they abandoned all their previous opinions,  
     <lb/>and joined the hon. member for South Oxford 
     <lb/>in carrying out this Confederation scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
            <cb/>
            <p>
     (Hear.) I come now to another point, viz., 
     <lb/>
     is the scheme presented to us the same 
     <lb/>
     one that was promised to us by the Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration when it was formed ? This, sir, 
     <lb/>
     might be but of slight importance if the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which this proposed Constitution 
     <lb/>
     was framed had not a most unfortunate bear<lb break="no"/>ing on the scheme itself ; but it is a grave 
     <lb/>
     matter, since the scheme is so objectionable, 
     <lb/>
     especially as we are gravely told that it can<lb break="no"/>not be amended in the least, but that it is 
     <lb/>
     brought down as a compact made between 
     <lb/>
     the Government of this country and delegates 
     <lb/>
     from the governments of Nova Scotia, New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island—as a treaty which cannot be 
     <lb/>
     altered or amended in any particular. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) The plain meaning of this is, sir, 
     <lb/>
     that the Lower Provinces have made out a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution for us and we are to adopt it. 
     <lb/>
      This fact will appear the more clearly when 
     <lb/>
     it is considered, as was pointed out much to 
     <lb/>
     my surprise, by the hon. member for Hast<lb break="no"/>ings (Mr. T. C. WALLBRIDGE), that in the 
     <lb/>
     Conference the vote was taken by provinces, 
     <lb/>
     putting Upper and Lower Canada, with 
     <lb/>
     nearly 2,500,000 people, on no higher level 
     <lb/>
     than Prince Edward Island, with its 80,000 
     <lb/>
     —on the same level with New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     with its 250,000—on the same level as Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, with its 330,000.

     There is a vast difference, Mr. SPEAKER, be<lb break="no"/>tween these two propositions. The first was 
     <lb/>
     that the Government would pledge themselves 
     <lb/>
     to seek a Confederation of the British Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Provinces, and if they failed in that to 
     <lb/>
     Federate the two Canadas, and this was reject<lb break="no"/>ed ; the second, which was accepted by the 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council, pledged the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to bring in a measure for the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the two Canadas, with provision for 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
        

     the admission of the other provinces when 
     <lb/>
    they thought proper to enter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD—When 
     <lb/>they were ready.

            </p>
            <p>HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER—Everything

            <p>
     HON. MR. DORION—But, sir, I may be 
     <lb/>
     asked, granting all this, granting that the 
     <lb/>
     scheme brought down is not the scheme pro<lb break="no"/>mised to us, what difference our bringing in 
     <lb/>
     the provinces at once can make ? This 
     <lb/>
     I will endeavor to explain. When they went 
     <lb/>
     into the Conference, honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite submitted to have the votes taken 
     <lb/>
     by provinces. Well, they have now brought 
     <lb/>
     us in, as was natural under the circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     the most conservative measure ever laid before 
     <lb/>
     a Parliament. The members of the Upper 
     <lb/>
     House are no longer to be elected, but nomin<lb break="no"/>ated, and nominated by whom ? By a Tory 
     <lb/>
     or Conservative Government for Canada, by 
     <lb/>
     a Conservative Government in Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     by a Conservative Government in Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, by a Conservative Government 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, the only Liberal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment concerned in the nomination being that 
     <lb/>
     which is controlled by the Liberal party in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, whose fate depends on the result 
     <lb/>
     of the elections that are now going on in that 
     <lb/>
     province. Such a scheme would never have 
     <lb/>
    been adopted if submitted to the liberal peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Upper Canada. When the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment went into that Conference they were 
     <lb/>bound by the majority, especially since they 
     <lb/>voted by provinces, and the 1,400,000 of Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada with the 1,100,000 of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada— together 2,500,000 people—were 
     <lb/>over-ridden by 900,000 people of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces. Were we not expressly told 
     <lb/>that it was the Lower Provinces who would not 
     <lb/>hear of our having an elective Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil ? If, instead of going into Conference with 
     <lb/>the people of the Lower Provinces, our Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had done what they pledged them<lb break="no"/>selves to do, that is, to prepare a Constitution 
     <lb/>themselves, they would never have dared to 
     <lb/>bring in such a proposition as this which is 
     <lb/>now imposed upon us by the Lower Colonies 
     <lb/>—to have a Legislative Council, with a fixed 
     <lb/>number of members, nominated by four Tory 
     <lb/>governments. Why, taking the average time 
     <lb/>each councillor will be in the Council to be 
     <lb/>fifteen to twenty years, it will take a century 
     <lb/>before its complexion can be changed. For 
     <lb/>all time to come, so far as this generation and 
     <lb/>the next are concerned, you will find the 
     <lb/>Legislative Council controlled by the influ<lb break="no"/>ence of the present Government. And is it 
     <lb/>

     to be believed that, as promised in the docu<lb break="no"/>ment we are considering , such a Government 
     <lb/>
     as we have " will take care of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>
     or consider their right to be represented in 
     <lb/>
     the Council ?" (Hear, and laughter.) Sir, I 
     <lb/>
     thank the delegates for their kind solicitude 
     <lb/>
     for the Opposition, but I do not believe they 
     <lb/>
     will do anything of the kind. Have we not 
     <lb/>
     heard the Honorable Attorney General West, 
     <lb/>
     a few nights ago, state, turning to his follow<lb break="no"/>ers, " If I were to advise the nomination, I 
     <lb/>
     should advise the selection of the best men I 
     <lb/>
     could find—and of course of my own party?" 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) So it will be, sir ; and, if this pre<lb break="no"/>cious scheme is carried, we shall have a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council divided in the following pro<lb break="no"/>portion :—For Upper Canada, we should pro<lb break="no"/>bably have liberals in the proportion of three 
     <lb/>
     to nine ; for I suppose the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford has made sacrifices enough 
     <lb/>
     to deserve at least that consideration, and, as 
     <lb/>
     his friends compose one-fourth of the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive Council, I dare say we should get one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     fourth of the Upper Canada Legislative

     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Just 25 per cent. of 
     <lb/>
     liberals for Upper Canada. Then, in addi<lb break="no"/>tion, we should get from Nova Scotia ten 
     <lb/>
     conservatives, from Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     four more, and four from Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Thus we shall have eighteen conservatives 
     <lb/>
     from the Lower Provinces, which, added to 
     <lb/>
     thirty-six from Canada, would make fifty-four 
     <lb/>
     conservatives against twenty-two liberals, 
     <lb/>
     taking the ten New Brunswick councillors to 
     <lb/>
     be liberals. Now, supposing three per 
     <lb/>
     cent. as the average number of deaths per 
     <lb/>
     annum—the average proportion of change— 
     <lb/>
     it would take nearly thirty years to bring 
     <lb/>
     about a change in the character of a majority 
     <lb/>
     of the Council, even supposing all the addi<lb break="no"/>tions made to it to be from the liberal ranks. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, that will hardly be the case. In 
     <lb/>
     some of the Lower Provinces there will be 
     <lb/>
     Conservative governments now and then, and 
     <lb/>
     there may occasionally be conservative gov<lb break="no"/>ernments in Canada. (Hear, and laughter.) So 
     <lb/>
     this generation will certainly pass away before 
     <lb/>
     the views of the Liberal party will ever find 
     <lb/>
     expression in the decisions of the Upper House.

     makes no difference, as between the two mea<lb break="no"/>sures.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName> — The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Lambton says that makes no dif<lb break="no"/><cb/>ference. It makes just the difference that 
     <lb/>
     we are to be bound by the scheme or by a 
     <lb/>
    Constitution enabling the Council to stop all 
     <lb/>measures of reform, such as would be 
     <lb/>desired by the Liberal party ; if the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Lambton thinks that 
     <lb/>makes no difference, I beg to differ from 
     <lb/>him, and I believe the Liberal party generally 
     <lb/>will. The Government say they had to in<lb break="no"/>troduce certain provisions, not to please them<lb break="no"/>selves, but to please the provinces below, 
     <lb/>and they have pledged themselves to those 
     <lb/>provinces that this House will carry out the 
     <lb/>scheme without amendment. Does not the 
     <lb/>honorable member see the difference now ? 
     <lb/>If the two Canadas were alone interested, the 
     <lb/>majority would have its own way—would look 
     <lb/>into the Constitution closely—would scan its 
     <lb/>every doubtful provision, and such a proposal 
     <lb/>as this about the Legislative Council  would 
     <lb/>have no chance of being carried, for it is not 
     <lb/>very long since the House, by an overwhelm<lb break="no"/>ing majority, voted for the substitution of an 
     <lb/>elected for a nominated Upper Chamber. In 
     <lb/>fact, the nominated Chamber had fallen so 
     <lb/>low in public estimation—I do not say it was 
     <lb/>from the  fault of the men who were there, 
     <lb/>but the fact is, nevertheless, as I state it— 
     <lb/>that it commanded no influence. There was 
     <lb/>even a difficulty in getting a quorum of it 
     <lb/>together. So a change became absolutely 
     <lb/>necessary, and up to the present moment the 
     <lb/>new system has worked well ; the elected 
     <lb/>members are equal in every respect to the 
     <lb/>nominated ones, and it is just when we see 
     <lb/>an interest beginning to be felt in the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings of the Upper House that its Constitution 
     <lb/>is to be changed ,to return back again to the one 
     <lb/>so recently condemned. Back again, did I 
     <lb/>say ? No, sir, a Constitution is to be substi<lb break="no"/>tuted, much worse than the old one, and such 
     <lb/>as is nowhere else to be found. Why, even 
     <lb/>the British House of Lords, conservative as 
     <lb/>it is, is altogether beyond the influence of the 
     <lb/>popular sentiment of the country. Their 
     <lb/>number may be increased on the recommen<lb break="no"/>dation of the responsible advisers of the 
     <lb/>Crown, if required to secure united action or 
     <lb/>to prevent a conflict between the two Houses. 
     <lb/>From the position its members occupy, it is a 
     <lb/>sort of compromise between the popular ele<lb break="no"/>ment and the influence or control of the 
     <lb/>Crown. But the new House for the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration is to be a perfectly independent body 
     <lb/>—these gentlemen are to be named for life— 
     <lb/>and there is to be no power to increase their 
     <lb/>number. How long will the system work 
     <lb/>without producing a collision between the

     two branches of the Legislature ? Suppose the 
     <lb/>
     Lower House turns out to be chiefly Liberal, 
     <lb/>
     how long will it submit to the Upper House, 
     <lb/>
     named by Conservative administrations which 
     <lb/>
     have taken advantage of their temporary nu<lb break="no"/>merical strength to bring about such a change 
     <lb/>
     as is now proposed ? Remember, sir, that, af<lb break="no"/>ter all, the power, the influence of the popular 
     <lb/>
     branch of the Legislature is paramount. We 
     <lb/>
     have seen constitutions like that of England 
     <lb/>
     adopted in many countries, and where there ex<lb break="no"/>isted a nobility, such as in France in 1830, 
     <lb/>
     the second chamber was selected from this 
     <lb/>
     nobility. In Belgium, where the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion is almost a <hi rendition="simple:italic">fac-simile</hi> of that of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, but where there are no aristocracy, they 
     <lb/>
     adopted the elective principle for the Upper 
     <lb/>
     House, and no where in the world is there a 
     <lb/>
     fixed number for it, unless it is also elective. 
     <lb/>
     It must be fresh in the memory of a great 
     <lb/>
     many members of this House how long the 
     <lb/>
     House of Lords resisted the popular demand 
     <lb/>
     for reform, and great difficulties were threat<lb break="no"/>ened. At last in 1832 the agitation had 
     <lb/>
     become so great that the Government de<lb break="no"/>termined to nominate a sufficient number of 
     <lb/>
     peers to secure the passage of the Reform 
     <lb/>
    Bill. The members of the House had to 
     <lb/>choose between allowing the measure to be<lb break="no"/>come law, or see their influence destroyed by 
     <lb/>the addition of an indefinite number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers. They preferred the first alternative, and 
     <lb/>thereby quieted an excitement, which if not 
     <lb/>checked in time, might have created a revo<lb break="no"/>lution in England. The influence of the 
     <lb/>Crown was then exerted in accordance with 
     <lb/>the views of the people ; but here we are to 
     <lb/>have no such power existing to check the ac<lb break="no"/>tion of our Upper Chamber, and no change 
     <lb/>can be made in its composition except as 
     <lb/>death might slowly remove its members. I 
     <lb/>venture to prophesy, sir, that before a very 
     <lb/>short time has elapsed a dead-lock may arise, 
     <lb/>and such an excitement be created as has 
     <lb/>never yet been seen in this country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Now, if this Constitution had been 
     <lb/>framed by the members of our Government, 
     <lb/>we could change some of its provisions—this 
     <lb/>provision would  most certainly be altered— 
     <lb/>there is not a man in the Liberal ranks who 
     <lb/>dare vote for such a proposition as this, that 
     <lb/>could go before his constituents and say, " I 
     <lb/>have taken away the influence and control of 
     <lb/>the people over the Upper Chamber, and I 
     <lb/>have created an entirely independent body, to 
     <lb/>be chosen by the present governments of the 
     <lb/> several provinces." But no, the Constitution 
     <lb/>is in the nature of a compact, a treaty, and 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          

     cannot be changed. (Hear.) But, sir, the 
     <lb/>
     composition of the Legislative Council be<lb break="no"/>comes of more importance when we consider 
     <lb/>
     that the governors of the local legislatures  
     <lb/>
     are to be appointed by the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, as well as the Legislative Council ; 
     <lb/>
     their appointment is to be for five years, and 
     <lb/>
     they are not to be removed without cause. I 
     <lb/>
    will venture upon another prediction and say 
     <lb/>we shall find there will be no such thing as 
     <lb/>responsible government attached to the local 
     <lb/>legislatures.

     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—There will be two, 
     <lb/>
     three, or four ministers chosen by the lieute<lb break="no"/>nant-governors and who will conduct the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of the country, as was formerly 
     <lb/>
     done in the times of Sir FRANCIS BOND HEAD,  
     <lb/>
     Sir JOHN COLBORN, or Sir JAMES CRAIG.  You 
     <lb/>
     will have governments, the chief executives 
     <lb/>
     of which will be appointed and hold office at 
     <lb/>
     the will of the Governor. If that is not to 
     <lb/>
     be the case, why do not honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     lay their scheme before us? (Hear.) Is this 
     <lb/>
    House, sir, going to vote a Constitution with 
     <lb/>the Upper House as proposed, without knowing 
     <lb/>what sort of local legislatures we are to have 
     <lb/>to govern us ? Suppose, after we have adopt<lb break="no"/>ed the main scheme, the Government come 
     <lb/>down with a plan for settling the local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures upon which great differences of opinion 
     <lb/>will arise, may it not happen then that the 
     <lb/>majority from Lower Canada will unite with a 
     <lb/>minority from Upper Canada and impose upon 
     <lb/>that section a local Constitution distasteful to 
     <lb/>a large majority of the people of Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>The whole scheme, sir, is absurd from begin<lb break="no"/>ning to end. It is but natural that gentlemen 
     <lb/>with the views of honorable gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site want to keep as much power as possible 
     <lb/>in the hands of the Government—that is the 
     <lb/>doctrine of the Conservative party everywhere 
     <lb/>—that is the line which distinguishes the 
     <lb/>tories from the whigs—the tories always 
     <lb/>side with the Crown, and the liberals always 
     <lb/>want to give more power and influence to the 
     <lb/>people. The instincts of honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>opposite, whether you take the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>General East or the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>West, lead them to this—they think the hands 
     <lb/>of the Crown should be strengthened and the 
     <lb/>influence of the people, if possible, diminish<lb break="no"/>ed—and this Constitution is a specimen of 
     <lb/>their handiwork, with a Governor-General 
     <lb/>appointed by the Crown ; with local govern<lb break="no"/>ors also, appointed by the Crown ; with legis<lb break="no"/>lative councils, in the General Legislature,

            <p>

     <lb/>
     one of the delegates. (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—I now come to an<lb break="no"/>other point. It is said that this Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is necessary for the purpose of providing 
     <lb/>
     a better mode of defence for this country. 
     <lb/>
     There may be people who think that by add<lb break="no"/>ing two and two together you make five. I 
     <lb/>
     am not of that opinion. I cannot see how by 
     <lb/>
     adding the 700,000 or 800,000 people, the 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants of the Lower Provinces, to 
     <lb/>
     the 2,500,000 inhabitants of Canada, you 
     <lb/>
     can multiply them so as to make a much 
     <lb/>
     larger force to defend the country than you 
     <lb/>
     have at present. Of course the connection 
     <lb/>
     with the British Empire is the link of com<lb break="no"/>munication by which the whole force of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire can be brought together for defence. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But the position of this coun<lb break="no"/>try under the proposed scheme is very evident. 
     <lb/>
     You add to the frontier four or five hundred 
     <lb/>
     more miles than you now have, and an extent 
     <lb/>
     of country immeasurably greater in pro<lb break="no"/>portion than the additional population you 
     <lb/>
     have gained; and if there is an advantage at 
     <lb/>
     all for the defence of the country, it will 
     <lb/>
     be on the part of the Lower Provinces and 
     <lb/>
     not for us. And as we find that we are 
     <lb/>
     about to enter into a very large expendi<lb break="no"/>ture for this purpose of defence—this having 
     <lb/>
     been formally announced in a speech deliv<lb break="no"/>ered by the President of the Council at To<lb break="no"/>ronto—and as Canada is to contribute to 
     <lb/>
     that expenditure to the extent of ten-twelfths 
     <lb/>
     of the whole, the other provinces paying only 
     
            <cb/>
           

     two-twelfths, it follows that Canada will pay 
     <lb/>
     ten-twelfths also of the cost of defence, which, 
     <lb/>
     to defend the largely extended country we 
     <lb/>
     will have to defend, will be much larger than 
     <lb/>
     if we remained alone. I find in the speech 
     <lb/>
     delivered by the President of the Council on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion, this statement :—

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I cannot conclude without referring to some 
     <lb/>
     other things which have received the grave atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Conference. And the first point 
     <lb/>
     which I desire to call attention is the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the delegates have unanimously resolved that the 
     <lb/>
     united provinces shall be placed at the earliest 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     away with this false impression and place our<lb break="no"/>selves on a firm and secure footing in the eyes of 
     <lb/>
     the world, our course must be to put our country 
     <lb/>
     in such a position of defence that we may fear<lb break="no"/>lessly look our enemies in the face.  It is a 
     <lb/>
     pleasure to me to state, and I am sure it must be 
     <lb/>
     a pleasure to all present to be informed, that the 
     <lb/>
     Conference at Quebec did not separate before 
     <lb/>
     entering into a pledge to put the military and 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—It appears then that 
     <lb/>
     our course is to put " the military and naval 
     <lb/>
     defences" into "a most complete and satis<lb break="no"/>factory condition." Now I find that, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to these resolutions, the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment is to have control of " the military and 
     <lb/>
     naval defences," but, of course, the cost of 
     <lb/>
     them is not stated. - This I contend, then, 
     <lb/>
     that if the military and naval defences of all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces are to be provided for by the 
     <lb/>
     General Government, and if you have to in<lb break="no"/>crease the militia for this purpose, the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces will pay only their proportion of 
     <lb/>
     two-twelfths, and Canada, while obtaining no 
     <lb/>
     greater defensive force than at present, will 
     <lb/>
     have to pay five times as much as we are now 
     <lb/>
     paying. (Hear, hear.) Why , sir, take the 
     <lb/>
     line dividing New Brunswick from Maine and 
     <lb/>
     you find it separates on the one side 250,000, 
     <lb/>
     thinly scattered over a vast territory, from 
     <lb/>
     750,000 on the other, compact and powerful. 
     <lb/>
     These 250,000 Canada will have to defend, 
     <lb/>
     and it will have to pledge its resources for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of providing means of defence along 
     <lb/>
     that extended line. (Hear, hear.) And, if

     rumor be true, the Intercolonial Railway, this

     so-called great defensive work, is not to pass

     along Major Robinson's line. The statement

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—In 1862, when the 
     <lb/>
     question of the construction of this road was 
     <lb/>
     before the country. what was the cry raised 
     <lb/>
     by honorable gentlemen opposite ? Why, that 
     <lb/>
     the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government had 
     <lb/>
     pledged itself to build a railway at whatever 
     <lb/>
     cost it might come to ; and those who were 
     <lb/>
     loudest in these denunciations, were the very 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have now undertaken to build 
     <lb/>
     the road without knowing or even enquiring 
     <lb/>
     what the cost of it will be.  (Hear, hear. ) 
     <lb/>
     This, if I remember right, was the purport of 
     <lb/>
     a speech made by the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West at Otterville.  (Hear, hear. ) I was 
     <lb/>
     satisfied, sir, at that time, to press my objec<lb break="no"/>tions to the scheme and retire from the 
     <lb/>
     Government ; but my colleagues were de<lb break="no"/>nounced without stint for having undertaken 
     <lb/>
     to build the railway and pay seven-twelfths of 
     <lb/>
     its cost, and now the House is asked by the 
     <lb/>
     very men who denounced them to pay ten- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
    twelfths of it, without even knowing whether 
     <lb/>the work is practicable or not.  (Hear, hear. ) 
     <lb/>We have heard for some time past that the 
     <lb/>engineer, Mr. FLEMING, is prepared to make 
     <lb/>his report. Why is it not forthcoming ?— 
     <lb/>why has it been kept back? The represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the people in this House will show 
     <lb/>utter disregard of their duty if they do 
     <lb/>not insist upon having that report, and full 
     <lb/>explanations respecting the undertaking, as 
     <lb/>well as the scheme for the constitution of the 
     <lb/>local governments, before they vote upon the 
     <lb/>resolutions before the House.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>It is folly to suppose that this Intercolonial 
     <lb/>Railway will in the least degree he con<lb break="no"/>ducive to the defence of the country. We 
     <lb/>have expended a large sum of money—and 
     <lb/>none voted it more cordially and heartily than 
     <lb/>myself-for the purpose of opening a military 
     <lb/>highway from Gaspé to -Rimouski ; 
     <lb/>and that road, in case, of hostilities with our 
     <lb/>neighbors, would be found of far greater ser<lb break="no"/>vice, for the transport of troops, cannon and 
     <lb/>all kinds of munitions of war, than any rail<lb break="no"/>way following the same or a more southern 
     <lb/>
                      <cb/>
         

     
     route possibly can be. That road cannot be 
     <lb/>
     effectually destroyed; but a railway lying in 
     <lb/>
     some places not more than fifteen or twenty 
     <lb/>
     miles from the frontier, will be of no use 
     <lb/>
     whatever, because of the readiness with which 
     <lb/>
     it may be attacked and seized. An enemy 
     <lb/>
     could destroy miles of it before it would be 
     <lb/>
     possible to resist him, and in time of difficulty 
     <lb/>
     it would be a mere trap for the troops passing 
     <lb/>
     along it, unless we had almost an army to keep 
     <lb/>
     it open. Upon this question of defence, 
     <lb/>
     we have heard so much during the past two 
     <lb/>
     or three years that I think it is time now 
     <lb/>
     we should have some plain explanations about 
     <lb/>
     it. We heard the other day from the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for West Montreal—and I am 
     <lb/>
     always glad to quote him, he is usually so 
     <lb/>
     correct—(laughter—that in less than a year 
     <lb/>
     the American army, the army of the North<lb break="no"/>ern States, was increased from 9,000 to 800,<lb break="no"/>000 men ready for service, and that in less 
     <lb/>
     than four years they were able to put to sea 
     <lb/>
     a fleet which, in point of numbers—I do not 
     <lb/>
     say in armament or value—was equal to the 
     <lb/>
     entire naval force of England. Well, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman might have gone further 
     <lb/>
     and shown that within a period of four years 
     <lb/>
     the Northern States have called into the field 
     <lb/>
     2,300,000 men—as many armed men as we 
     <lb/>
     have men, women and children in the two 
     <lb/>
     Canadas—and that we hear every day of more 
     <lb/>
     being raised and equipped. It is stated that, 
     <lb/>
     in view of these facts, it is incumbent upon 
     <lb/>
     us to place ourselves in a state of defence. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, 1 say it here candidly and honestly, that 
     <lb/>
     we are bound to do everything we can to pro<lb break="no"/>tect the country—(hear, hear,)—but we are 
     <lb/>
     not bound to ruin ourselves in anticipation of 
     <lb/>
     a supposed invasion which we could not repel 
     <lb/>
     even with the assistance of England. The 
     <lb/>
     battles of Canada cannot be fought on the 
     <lb/>
     frontier, but on the high seas and at the great 
     <lb/>
     cities on the Atlantic coast; and it will be 
     <lb/>
     nothing but folly for us to cripple ourselves by 
     <lb/>
     spending fifteen or twenty millions a year to 
     <lb/>
     raise an army of 50,000 men for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of resisting an invasion of the country. The 
     <lb/>
     best thing that Canada can do is to keep 
     <lb/>
     quiet, an to give no cause for war.  (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.)  Let the public opinion of this country 
     <lb/>
     compel the press to cease the attacks it is 
     <lb/>
     every day making upon the Government and 
     <lb/>
     people of the United States ; and then if war 
     <lb/>
     does come between England and the States— 
     <lb/>
     even if from no fault of ours—we will cast 
     <lb/>
     our lot with England and help her to fight the 
     <lb/>
     battle; but in the meantimw it is no use what<lb break="no"/><pb n="258" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0258.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">258</fw>ever to raise or keep up anything like a stand<lb break="no"/>ing army.

            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON ATT. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—Will 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend let me ask him how we can 
     <lb/>
     assist England in a war on the high seas un<lb break="no"/>less we have a naval force ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Peterborough stated the other day, and 
     <lb/>
     correctly I believe, that the place for our mili<lb break="no"/>tia was behind the fortifications of our forti<lb break="no"/>fied places, where they would count for some<lb break="no"/>thing to be of some use. No doubt of this. 
     <lb/>
     Why, sir, it is absurd to ak of defending 
     <lb/>
     this country with such a force as we could 
     <lb/>
     maintain when we have the recent example 
     <lb/>
     before our eyes of a country in Europe pos<lb break="no"/>sessing as large a defensive force, literally 
     <lb/>
     wiped off the map by an invading army of 
     <lb/>
     some 75,000 or 80,000 men. The kingdom 
     <lb/>
     of Denmark consists now of only two small 
     <lb/>
     islands—less by far, in extent, than one of 
     <lb/>
     our large counties; and this dismemberment 
     <lb/>
     has been forced upon it, although it had a 
     <lb/>
     standing army of 30,000 men, and the feel<lb break="no"/>ing of the whole pulation was in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the war. (Hear, ear.) I do not use this 
     <lb/>
     argument for the purpose of showing that 
     <lb/>
     something ought not to be done respecting our 
     <lb/>
     militia. I am willing that we should make 
     <lb/>
     sacrifices, if necessary, for the purpose of or<lb break="no"/>ganizing it thoroughly ; but I am decidedly 
     <lb/>
     opposed to a standing army, and do not 
     <lb/>
     believe we could raise an army now that 
     <lb/>
     would be able to withstand the force that 
     <lb/>
     could be sent against it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We have sent to the frontier 2,000 men, 
     <lb/>
     whose services for a year will cost us a 
     <lb/>
     million and a-half ; and at the same rate 
     <lb/>
     of expenditure, 50,000 men would cost us 
     <lb/>
     over thirty millions of money. Now, if the 
     <lb/>
     whole defence of'the country is to rest upon 
     <lb/>
     us, I ask again what would such a force 
     <lb/>
     amount to ? (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, when 
     <lb/>
     I look into the provisions of this scheme, I 
     <lb/>
     find another most objectionable one. It is that 
     <lb/>
     which gives the General Government control 
     <lb/>
     over all the acts of the local legislatures. What 
     <lb/>
     dificulties may not arise under this system ? 
     <lb/>
     Now, knowing that the General Government 
     <lb/>
     will be party in its character, may it not for 
     <lb/>
     party purposes reject laws passed the 
     <lb/>
    by the local legislatures and demanded by a majority 
     <lb/>of the people of that locality. This power 
     <lb/>conferred upon the General Government 
     <lb/>has been compared to the veto wer that 
     <lb/>exists in. England in respect to our legislation; 
     <lb/>but we know that the statesmen of England 
     <lb/>are not actuated by the local feelings and 
     <lb/>
         

    
            <cb/>
           

     prejudices, and do not partake of the local 
     <lb/>
     jealousies, that prevail in the colonies. The 
     <lb/>
     local governments have therefore confidence 
     <lb/>
     in them, and respect for their decisions; and 
     <lb/>
     generally, when a law adopted by a colonial 
     <lb/>
     legislature is sent to them, if it does not 
     <lb/>
     clash with the licy of the Empire at large, 
     <lb/>
     it is not disallowed, and more especially of 
     <lb/>
     late has it been the policy of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government to do whatever the colonies de<lb break="no"/>sire in this respect, when their wishes are 
     <lb/>
     constitutionally expressed. The axiom on 
     <lb/>
     which they seem to act is that the less they 
     <lb/>
     hear of the colonies the better. (Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
     But how different will be the result in this 
     <lb/>
     case, when the General Government exercises 
     <lb/>
     the veto power over the acts of local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures. Do you not see that it is quite possible 
     <lb/>
     for a majority in a local government to be 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the General Government; and in 
     <lb/>
     such a case the minority would call upon the 
     <lb/>
     General Government to disallow the laws en<lb break="no"/>acted by the majority? The men who shall 
     <lb/>
     compose the General Government will be de<lb break="no"/>pendent for their su port upon their political 
     <lb/>
     friends in the local egislatures, and it may so 
     <lb/>
     happen that, in order to secure this support, 
     <lb/>
     or in order to serve their own purposes or 
     <lb/>
     that of their supporters, they will veto laws 
     <lb/>
     which the ma'onty of a local legislature find 
     <lb/>
     necessary and (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     know how high party feeling runs sometimes 
     <lb/>
     upon local matters even of trivial importance, 
     <lb/>
     and we may find parties so hotly opposed to 
     <lb/>
     each other in the local legislatures, that the 
     <lb/>
     whole power of the minority may be brought 
     <lb/>
     to bear upon their friends who have a ma<lb break="no"/>jority in the General Legislature, for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of preventing the passage of some law 
     <lb/>
     objectionable to them but desired by the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of their own section. What will be 
     <lb/>
     the result of such a state of things but bit<lb break="no"/>terness of feeling, strong litical acrimony 
     <lb/>
     and dangerous agitation? ( ear, hear.) Then 
     <lb/>
     sir, I find that in addition to all the other 
     <lb/>
     sums that are to be paid by the general to 
     <lb/>
     the local governments, there are revisions 
     <lb/>
     in favor of New Brunswick and Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, which must strike the House as being 
     <lb/>
     of a rather extraordinary nature. In the 
     <lb/>
     document which was sent by the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary to the members of this House 
     <lb/>
     marked "Private," there appears to have been 
     <lb/>
     a mistake. It was therein stated that the 
     <lb/>
     General Government would have no right to 
     <lb/>
     impose an export duty on timber, logs, 
     <lb/>
     masts, spars, deals and sawn lumber ; but that 
     <lb/>
     the local governments would have the power 
     <lb/>

        <fw type="num">259</fw>

     to impose export duties on these articles. 
     <lb/>
    This provision, it seems, was too favorable to 
     <lb/>Lower Canada ; for it would have allowed 
     <lb/>Lower Canada to impose an export duty upon    
     <lb/>Upper Canadian timber.<lb/>

     <lb/>
     This mistake seems to have been corrected, 
     <lb/>
     for, in this respect, the resolutions before the 
     <lb/>

    <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>— The clause of the 
     <lb/>
     resolution to which I refer now reads, that 
     <lb/>
     the General Parliament shall have power to 
     <lb/>
     make laws " respecting the imposition or regu<lb break="no"/>lation of duties of customs on imports and 
     <lb/>
     exports—except on exports of timber, logs, 
     <lb/>
     masts, spars, , deals and sawn lumber from 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, and of coal and other min<lb break="no"/>erals from Nova Scotia." That is, the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government may impose a tax for its 
     <lb/>
     own benefit upon all timber and minerals ex<lb break="no"/>ported from Upper or Lower Canada, but not 
     <lb/>
    New Brunswick or Nova Scotia.  (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Then, among the powers granted to 
     <lb/>local legislatures, we find the power to pass 
     <lb/>by-laws imposing direct taxation.  (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.)  That is the first power they have, 
     <lb/>and I have no doubt that, before many 
     <lb/>months have passed after they are consti<lb break="no"/>tuted, they will find it necessary to resort 
     <lb/>to it. But, in addition to this, find that 
     <lb/>New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, which, no 
     <lb/>doubt, are the favored children of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, have powers not granted to the other 
     <lb/>provinces.  New Brunswick, the resolution 
     <lb/>declares, shall have the power to impose an export duty on timber, logs, masts, spars, deals and sawn lumber, and Nova Scotia on coal and other materials, for local, purposes ; 
     <lb/>so that while our timber and minerals export<lb break="no"/>ed from Upper and Lower Canada will be 
     <lb/>taxed by the General Government for  general 
     <lb/>purposes, the timber and minerals of New 
     <lb/>Brunswick and Nova Scotia will be exempt, 
     <lb/>
               the revenue derived from them going to the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of the local governments, to be ex<lb break="no"/>pended on local objects.  (Hear, hear.)  This 
     <lb/>
     is one of the results of the Conference in 
     <lb/>
     ,which, of course, New Brunswick counted as 
     <lb/>
     much as Upper and Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia and the other Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     the balance of influence.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Now, among the other powers granted to the
<lb/>
            <cb/>
         

     General Government is its control over agri<lb break="no"/>culture and immigration, as well as the fish<lb break="no"/>eries. An honorable member from Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada (MR. MACKENZIE of Lambton), en<lb break="no"/>quired very anxiously, yesterday, if it was 
     <lb/>
     possible that any act respecting agriculture 
     <lb/>
     could be affected by the General Government ? 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, it is as plain as can be that agri<lb break="no"/>culture and immigration are to be under the 
     <lb/>
     control of both the local and the general le<lb break="no"/>gislatures. And the forty- fifth resolution 
     <lb/>
     says : —"In regard to all subjects over which 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction belongs to the general and local 
     <lb/>
     legislatures, the laws of the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment shall control and supersede those made by 
     <lb/>
     the Local Legislature, and the latter shall be 
     <lb/>
     void so far as they are repugnant to or incon<lb break="no"/>sistent with the former."  What will be the 
     <lb/>
     operation of this provision ? The Local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature will pass a law which will then go to the 
     <lb/>
     General Government ; the latter will put its 
     <lb/>
     veto upon it, and if that does not answer, it 
     <lb/>
    will pass a law contrary to it, and you have 
     <lb/>at once a conflict.  ( Hear, hear.) .

            <p><persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Oh ! none what<lb break="no"/>ever. I may pass now perhaps to the consid<lb break="no"/>eration of a portion ofthe financial part of the 
     <lb/>scheme. I shall certainly not attempt to follow 
     <lb/>the Hon. Finance Minister in what I admit 
     <lb/>was the able statement, or rather able mani<lb break="no"/>pulation of figures, he made the other day. 
     <lb/>When that honorable gentleman was able to 
     <lb/>prove to the satisfaction of the BARINGS , the 
     <lb/>GLYNS, and the leading merchants of England 
     <lb/>that the investment they would make in the 
     <lb/>Grand Trunk Railway would yield them at 
     <lb/>least 11 per cent., it is not astonishing that he 
     <lb/>was able to show to this House that the finan<lb break="no"/>ces of the Confederation will be in a most 
     <lb/>flourishing condition, and that we shall have 
     <lb/>a surplus every year of at least a million dollars. 
     <lb/>(Laughter.)   From what I knew of former 
     <lb/>prophecies, I imagined he would make it eleven 
     <lb/>or twelve millions at any rate, but he is mo<lb break="no"/>dest and puts it down at only a million. But 
     <lb/>how does he make out even this moderate sur<lb break="no"/>plus? He takes, in the first place, the re<lb break="no"/>venue of Newfoundland for 1862. I had the 
     <lb/>curiosity to look for the reason, and what do 
     <lb/>you suppose it is ? The revenue for 1862 
     <lb/>was the highest he could find, except 1860. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Then he takes the revenue of 
     <lb/>New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Canada, 
     <lb/>or 1863—the highest figures again  (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.)  Taking all this, he still finds a de<lb break="no"/><pb n="260" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0260.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">260</fw>ficiency of $827,512, which he provides for 
     <lb/>
     by adding a supposed increase for 1864 of 
     <lb/>
     $100,000 for each of the Provinces of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick, and $1,500,000 
     <lb/>
     for Canada.  (Hear, hear.)  And this leaves 
     <lb/>
     a surplus of just $872,488.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Well, even granting that on the 31st of De<lb break="no"/>cember he had a surplus of a million, if at the 
     <lb/>
     end of the present financial year it is not dimi<lb break="no"/>nished to half a million by his militia and 
     <lb/>
     other expenditure, I shall be very agreeably 
     <lb/>
     surprised.  (Hear.)  This, then, is the in<lb break="no"/>ducement he offers to the country to adopt 
     <lb/>
     this scheme. I have a million more than I 
     <lb/>
     want, he exclaims, and I will reduce the du<lb break="no"/>ties to 15 per cent. But the honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman forgets that he has the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway to provide for, as well as that military 
     <lb/>
     and naval defensive force which we are going 
     <lb/>
     to raise.  (Hear, hear.)  He forgets all this, 
     <lb/>
     but the promise is there; and just as he held 
     <lb/>
     out to the expected shareholders of the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk Railway the 11 per cent. divi<lb break="no"/>dends upon their investments, he now tells 
     <lb/>
     the people of these several colonies that the 
     <lb/>
     customs duties will be reduced to 15 per cent. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)  I do not desire to go over the 
     <lb/>
     figures the honorable gentleman has laid before 
     <lb/>
     the House, for I have not the talent of group<lb break="no"/>ing them together, so as to present an attrac<lb break="no"/>tive, but deceptive, whole, that he possesses 
     <lb/>
     in such an eminent degree. I find in the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions now proposed a few propositions 
     <lb/>
     to which I would call the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House.  The first thing that the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration will have to provide for is the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, which will certainly cost 
     <lb/>
     twenty millions of dollars, the interest upon 
     <lb/>
     which, at 5 per cent., will amount to one 
     <lb/>
     million of dollars annually.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Then to Newfoundland we are bound to pay 
     <lb/>
     $150,000 a year, for all time to come, to 
     <lb/>
     purchase the mineral lands of that colony ; 
     <lb/>
     while, as regards the other provinces, all the 
     <lb/>
     public lands are given up to the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments. But that is not all, for, in order to 
     <lb/>
     manage these "valuable lands" in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, we shall have to establish a Crown 
     <lb/>
     Lands department under the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment ; and if honorable gentlemen desire 
     <lb/>
     to learn something of the probable expense of 
     <lb/>
     such an establishment, they need only refer 
     <lb/>
     to a return brought down last night, by which 
     <lb/>
     they will see that there are no less than sixty 
     <lb/>
     or seventy officers in the Crown Lands de<lb break="no"/>partment, and that some eight or ten new 
     <lb/>
     appointments have been made since March 
     <lb/>
     last, when the present Government was formed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     (Hear, hear.)  This return is a highly in<lb break="no"/>structive one in other respects. It shows 
     <lb/>
     that within that period there is not a depart<lb break="no"/>ment of the Government that has not increased 
     <lb/>
     its force of employés, except that of the 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General East, who is satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     the three officers it contained before he re<lb break="no"/>turned to the Government.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I may state, however, that in the return 
     <lb/>
     there is an omission which ought to be sup<lb break="no"/>plied. The honorable gentleman has made a 
     <lb/>
     large number of appointments connected with 
     <lb/>
     the administration of justice in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     that are not mentioned. This return is, how<lb break="no"/>ever, instructive as showing the additional 
     <lb/>
     number of appointments that have been made 
     <lb/>
     within the past year in all the departments— 
     <lb/>
     several of whom have been taken from their 
     <lb/>
     seats in this House and appointed to offices 
     <lb/>
     to make room for others here.

     grant of $63,000 a year, beyond the subsidy 
     <lb/>
     of 80 cents per head of the population for the 
     <lb/>

     its necessities.  (Hear, hear.)  Under these

     circumstances, there need be no direct taxation 
     <lb/>
     in that province. The whole speech of Hon.

     <lb/>
     very instructive if I could read it all, but I

     <lb/>
     what he wanted.  (Hear, hear.)  It is not New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick alone that is to get something 
     <lb/>
     handsome over and above its necessities. I 
     <lb/>
     have here a letter from the Charlottetown

     (P. E. I.) <hi rendition="simple:italic">Examiner</hi>, wherein Mr. WHELAN,

     the editor, and one of the delegates at the

     Quebec Conference, sums up the advan<lb break="no"/>tages to be obtained b Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>pretty much as Hon. Mr. TILLEY does for New

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     By this arrangement the debt of Prince Edward

     <lb/>
     $2,025,00—the interest of which, at five per

     <lb/>(Hear, hear.)

            </p></quote>


            <p>The general expenses he alludes to are the 
     <lb/>salaries of the governor, judges, and so on, 
     <lb/>which the General Government will pay. Thus, 
     <lb/>sir, we have Mr. WHELAN, one of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates, and Hon. Mr. TILLEY, another, chuck<lb break="no"/>ling over the good bargains they have made at 
     <lb/>the expense of Canada, and endeavoring in this 
     <lb/>manner to carry the scheme of Confederation 
     <lb/>by showing that New Brunswick is to have 
     <lb/>$34,000 over and above its necessities, and 
     <lb/>Prince Edward Island $48,000.  I would 
     <lb/>advise the Hon. Finance Minister, when he is 
     <lb/>indistress for want of money, to go down there 
     <lb/>and borrow this surplus which we will have 
     <lb/>to pay to these provinces ; they will no doubt, 
     <lb/>be willing tolend on favorable terms. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.)  I have entered into a short calcula<lb break="no"/>tion to show what proportion Upper and Low<lb break="no"/>er Canada will respectively have to bear of 
     <lb/>these additional burdens, - $63,000 a year for 
     <lb/>ten years to New Brunswick, would make a 
     <lb/>capital at five per cent. of about $350,000. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—More near $400,<lb break="no"/>000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—My calculation is 
     <lb/>rather under than over the mark, but let us 
     <lb/>take $350,000 as the capitalized value of this 
     <lb/>annuity for ten years. That gives an interest 
     <lb/>of $17,500 per annum forever. Now, sup<lb break="no"/>posing the increased extent of territory to be 
     <lb/>
        

    
            <cb/>
           

     defended under the Confederation augments 
     <lb/>
     the militia expenditure to the extent of a 
     <lb/>
     million a-year—this, I think, is a very rea<lb break="no"/>sonable estimate, and will not go very far to<lb break="no"/>wards carrying out the intentions of the Con<lb break="no"/>ference respecting military and naval defence, 
     <lb/>
     as explained by the President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     to his Tomato audience. Then add the in<lb break="no"/>terest of the sum required to build the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway, five per cent. on $20,000,000, 
     <lb/>
     and we have an annual payment of $1,000,000 
     <lb/>
     more, which is increased by $150,000, the in<lb break="no"/>demnity paid to Newfoundland for its valuable 
     <lb/>
     mineral lands. Then we have to pay the local 
     <lb/>
     governments, at the rate of 80 cents per head, 
     <lb/>
     $3,056,849. The interest on the debt of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, $8,000,000, will amount to $400,<lb break="no"/>000; on that of New Brunswick, $7,000,000, 
     <lb/>
     to $350,000; on that of Newfoundland, $3,<lb break="no"/>250,000, to $162,000; and on the debt of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, $2,021,425, to $101,<lb break="no"/>071. Adding all these sums together, we find 
     <lb/>
     that the annual expenditure, in addition be it 
     <lb/>
     remembered to the burdens which we now bear, 
     <lb/>
     will be $6,237,920—( hear, hear)—represent<lb break="no"/>ing a capital of $124,758,400.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The share of Canada in this annual expendi<lb break="no"/>ture will be $1.89 head, amounting to the 
     <lb/>
     sum of $4,725,000. This is altogether irres<lb break="no"/>pective of the debt of $62,500,000 with which 
     <lb/>
     Canada enters the union. The share of Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada, according to population, will be 
     <lb/>
     $2,646,000 ; but Upper Canadians have long 
     <lb/>
     claimed that they paid upwards of two-thirds 
     <lb/>
     of the expenditure, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> lately 
     <lb/>
     said that this was the proportion ten years ago, 
     <lb/>
     but that the disparity had greatly increased 
     <lb/>
     since.  If Upper Canada really pays two-thirds 
     <lb/>
     of the expenditure, its share in the additional 
     <lb/>
     but necessary expenditure will be $3,183,334 
     <lb/>
     per annum.  (Hear, hear.) This is taking 
     <lb/>
     or granted that the Lower Provinces should 
     <lb/>
     pay their share according to po ulation. I 
     <lb/>
     have my doubts about that, and believe that 
     <lb/>
     the city of Montreal pays a little more duty on 
     <lb/>
     imports than Prince Edward, and more, per<lb break="no"/>haps than Prince Edward Island and New<lb break="no"/>foundland put together, and that the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of the District of Montreal pay a good

     as to the relative contribution of Upper and

     Lower Canada to the revenue, as given by the

     <lb/>
     sir, we have been told, for ten years past, that 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada wanted representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation for nothing else but because Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada was spending the money of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince lavishly—two-thirds of it coming from 
     <lb/>
     the pockets of the people of Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
     We have been told that it was not to interfere 
     <lb/>
     with the institutions, language, or laws of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, but merely to give Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada proper control over the finances. 
     <lb/>
     That was the only thing to be gained by it.

     Well, sir, this was the advice given to Upper

     Canada in 1861, by one of the leaders, the   
     <lb/>
     present Hon. Minister of Agriculture.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—It has much to do 
     <lb/>
     with it.  It shows that representation by pop<lb break="no"/>ulation was put forth as a remedy for the 
     <lb/>
     financial evils of our present system of gov<lb break="no"/>ernment.  Under this adviceUpper Canada 
     <lb/>
     gave a large majority against the Government 
     <lb/>
    of the day, and the members elected turned 
     <lb/>round, and by abandoning, for a time at least, 
     <lb/>representation by population, they acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged that the financial question was para<lb break="no"/>mount to it. I have shown, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>I think, the proportion which Upper Canada 
     <lb/>would have to pay of the increased expendi<lb break="no"/>ture which must immediately ensue from the 
     <lb/>adoption of Confederation which is proposed to 
     <lb/>free Upper Canada from a larger expenditure 
     <lb/>by Lower Canada than what she contributes to 
     <lb/>the revenue.  Now, let us see what that ex<lb break="no"/>penditure is.  The whole expenditure of the 
     <lb/>province exclusive of interest on public debt, 
     <lb/>costs of legislation, militia, subsin to ocean 
     <lb/>steamers and collection of revenue, which 
     <lb/>will have to be paid even with Confederation, 
     <lb/>if it takes place, does not amount to more 
     <lb/>than $2,500,000, or one dollar per head of 
     <lb/>the whole population.   Then supposing that 
     <lb/>
                      
 <pb n="263" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0263.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">263</fw>

     Upper Canada pays two-thirds of that sum, 
     <lb/>
     or $1,666,666, and Lower Canada one-third, 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada would only pay $266,666 
     <lb/>
     more than her share according to population. 
     <lb/>
     And it is, I say, to get rid of this expenditure 
     <lb/>
     of a couple of hundred thousand dollars that 
     <lb/>
     the Upper Canadian members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment repose that their section of the country 
     <lb/>
     should pay an additional yearly expenditure 
     <lb/>
     of $3,181,000, yielding no return whatsoever 
     <lb/>
     —(hear, hear)—and to saddle on Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada an additional expenditure of from $1,<lb break="no"/>500,000 to $2,000,000 a year—the amount 
     <lb/>
     depending on the proportion which they res<lb break="no"/>pectively contribute to the revenue of the 
     <lb/>
     country. And, Mr. SPEAKER, this is only 
     <lb/>
     the immediate and necessary expenditure that 
     <lb/>
     will fall on the people of Canada at the very 
     <lb/>
     outset.  There is not a single sixpence in this 
     <lb/>
     estimate for any improvements to be made in 
     <lb/>
     the eastern or western portion of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eracy.   (Hear, hear.)  But, sir, respecting 
     <lb/>
     the defences of the country, I should have said 
     <lb/>
     at an earlier stage of my remarks that this 
     <lb/>
     scheme proposes a union not only with Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island, and Newfoundland, but also with 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia and Vancouver's Island. 
     <lb/>
     Although I have not been able to get the 
     <lb/>
     information from the Government—for they 
     <lb/>
     do not seem to be very ready to give informa<lb break="no"/>tion—yet I understand that there are des<lb break="no"/>patches to hand, stating that resolutions have 
     <lb/>
     adopted in the Legislature of British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia asking for admission into the Con<lb break="no"/>federation at once. I must confess, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, that it looks like a burlesque to 
     <lb/>
     speak as a means of defence of a scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation to unite the whole country 
     <lb/>
     extending from Newfoundland to Vancouver's 
     <lb/>
     Island, thousands of miles intervening without 
     <lb/>
     any communication, except through the United 
     <lb/>
     States or around Cape Horn.    (Oh ! )

     is another necessity of Confederation, to which

     we may soon look forward.  Some western

     extension of this Grand Trunk scheme for

     <lb/>
     Lower Canada is concerned, I need hardly 
     <lb/>
     stop to point out the objections to the scheme. 
     <lb/>
     It is evident, from what has transpired, that 
     <lb/>
     it is intended eventually to form a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union of all the provinces. The local govern<lb break="no"/>ments, in addition .to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will be found so burdensome, that a

            <cb/>
          

     majority of the people will appeal to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government for the formation of a le<lb break="no"/>gislative union. (Hear, hear.)     I may well 
     <lb/>
     ask if there is any member from Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada, of French extraction, who is ready to 
     <lb/>
     vote for a legislative union. What do I find in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the agitation of this scheme ?

     Honorable members from Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     are made aware that the delegates all desired 
     <lb/>
     a legislative union, but it could not be accom<lb break="no"/>plished at once. This Confederation is the 
     <lb/>
     first necessary step towards it.  The British 
     <lb/>
     Government is ready to grant a Federal union 
     <lb/>
     at once, and when that is accomplished the 
     <lb/>
     French element will be completely over<lb break="no"/>whelmed by the majority of British repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives What then would prevent the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government from passing a set of 
     <lb/>
     resolutions in a similar way to those we are 
     <lb/>
     called upon to pass, without submitting them 
     <lb/>
     to the people, calling upon the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to set aside the Federal form of gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and give a legislative union instead 
     <lb/>
     of it ? (Hear, hear.)  Perhaps the people 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada think a legislative union a 
     <lb/>
     most esirable thing. I can tell those gentle<lb break="no"/>men that the people of Lower Canada are 
     <lb/>
     attached to their institutions in a manner that 
     <lb/>
     defies any attempt to change them in that 
     <lb/>
     way. They will not change their religious 
     <lb/>
     institutions, their laws and their language, for 
     <lb/>
     any consideration whatever.  A million of 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants may seem a small affair to the 
     <lb/>
     mind of a philosopher who sits down to write 
     <lb/>
     out a constitution. He may think it would 
     <lb/>
     be better that there should be but one religion, 
     <lb/>
     one language and one system of laws, and he 
     <lb/>
    goes to work to frame institutions that will 
     <lb/>bring all to that desirable state; but I can 
     <lb/>tell honorable gentlemen that the history of   
     <lb/>every country goes to show that not even by 
     <lb/>the power of the sword can such changes be 
     <lb/>

     accomplished. (Hear, hear.) We have the 
     <lb/>
     history of the Greek race, having at one time 
     <lb/>
     a population of six millions, dwindling down 
     <lb/>
     to seven hundred thousand, and we find them 
     <lb/>
     even then, after several centuries of oppres<lb break="no"/>sion, rising up and asserting their rights. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We have the same circum<lb break="no"/>stance in the history of Belgium, which was 
     <lb/>
     united to Holland with a view to secure the 
     <lb/>
     assimilation of the two countries, but fifteen 
     <lb/>
     years of trial had hardly elapsed when the 
     <lb/>
     whole of the Belgium people and Government 
     <lb/>
     rose <hi rendition="simple:italic">en masse</hi> to protest against that union, 
     <lb/>
     and to assert their separate nationality. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Sir, it is not only from the history of 
     <lb/>
     the past we may derive the lesson, but we 
     <lb/>
     have the circumstances of the present gener<lb break="no"/>ation to guide us. I am astonished to see the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Montreal West helping 
     <lb/>
     a scheme designed to end in a legislative union, 
     <lb/>
     the object of which can only be to assimilate 
     <lb/>
     the whole people to the dominant population. 
     <lb/>
     In that honorable gentleman's own country 
     <lb/>
     the system has produced nothing but a dis<lb break="no"/>satisfied and rebellious people. Is it desirable 
     <lb/>
     that in this country then we should pass a 
     <lb/>
     measure calculated to give dissatisfaction to a 
     <lb/>
     million of people ? You may ascertain what the 
     <lb/>
     cost of keeping down a million of dissatisfied 
     <lb/>
     people is by the scenes that have been and are 
     <lb/>
     now transpiring on the other side of the line, 
     <lb/>
     where a fifth of the people of the United 
     <lb/>
     States has risen and has caused more misery 
     <lb/>
     and misfortune to be heaped upon that 
     <lb/>
     country than could have been wrought in cen<lb break="no"/>turies of peaceful compromising legislation. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, if a legislative union of the British 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces is attempted, there will 
     <lb/>
     be such an agitation in this portion of the 
     <lb/>
     province as was never witnessed before—you 
     <lb/>
     will see the whole people of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     clinging together to resist by all legal and con<lb break="no"/>stitutional means, such an attempt at wresting 
     <lb/>
     from them those institutions that they now 
     <lb/>
     enjoy. They would go as a body to the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, voting as one man, and caring 
     <lb/>
     for nothing else but for the protection of their 
     <lb/>
     beloved institutions and law, and making gov<lb break="no"/>ernment all but impossible. The ninety Irish 
     <lb/>
     members in the British House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     composed as it is of nearly seven hundred 
     <lb/>
     members, by voting together have caused their 
     <lb/>
     influence to be felt, as in the grants to the 
     <lb/>
     Maynooth College and some other questions. 
     <lb/>
     It would be the same way with the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, and a more deplorable state of 
     <lb/>
     things would be the inevitable result. The 
     <lb/>
     majority would be forced by the minority to 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            

     do things they would not, under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances, think of doing. This is a state so 
     <lb/>
     undesirable that, although I am strongly op<lb break="no"/>posed to the proposed Federal union, I am 
     <lb/>
     still more strongly opposed to a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union. Those who desire a legislative union 
     <lb/>
     may see from this what discordant elements 
     <lb/>
     they would have to deal with in undertaking 
     <lb/>
     the task, and what misery they would bring 
     <lb/>
     upon the country by such a step. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I know there is an apprehension 
     <lb/>
     among the British population in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     that, with even the small power that the Local 
     <lb/>
     Government will possess, their rights will not 
     <lb/>
     be respected. How, then, can it be expected 
     <lb/>
     that the French population can anticipate any 
     <lb/>
     more favorable result from the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, when it is to possess such enormous 
     <lb/>
     powers over the destinies of their section of 
     <lb/>
     the country ? Experience shows that majori<lb break="no"/>ties are always aggressive, and it cannot well 
     <lb/>
     be otherwise in this instance. It therefore 
     <lb/>
     need not be wondered at that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, of British origin, are ready to 
     <lb/>
     make use of every means to prevent their 
     <lb/>
     being placed at the mercy of a preponderating 
     <lb/>
     population of a different origin. I agree with 
     <lb/>
     them in thinking that they ought to take 
     <lb/>
     nothing on trust in this matter of entering 
     <lb/>
     upon a new state of political existence, and 
     <lb/>
     neither ought we of French origin to do so, 
     <lb/>
     in relation to the General Government, how<lb break="no"/>ever happy our relations to each other may be 
     <lb/>
     at present.

     <lb/>
     When my honorable friend makes a contract

     with a friend and neighbor to be filled even 
     <lb/>
     a few months in the future, does he not have 
     <lb/>
     it put in legal form, in black and white ? Of 
     <lb/>
     course he does. And when we are making 
     <lb/>
     arrangements calculated to last for all time to 
     <lb/>
     come, is it not vastly more important that the 
     <lb/>
     same safe and equitable principle should be 
     <lb/>
     recognized ? (Hear, hear.) The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman recognized it himself in the most 
     <lb/>
     marked manner, by placing in the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     guarantees respecting the educational institu<lb break="no"/>tions of the two sections of Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics of Upper Canada were 
     <lb/>
     anxious to have their rights protected against 
     <lb/>
     the hand of the Protestant majority, and, 
     <lb/>
     where the Protestants are in a minority, they 
     <lb/>
     are just as anxious to have their rights per<lb break="no"/>manently protected. But, sir, the whole 
     <lb/>
     scheme, since it must be taken or rejected as 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>to speak his sentiments freely. I see nothing 
     <lb/>in it but another railway scheme for the benefit

     If our Government were to rush into the rail<lb break="no"/>way project, expend a large sum of money upon

     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, both the alliance and the road 
     <lb/>
     would be carried out mainly for the benefit of the 
     <lb/>
     dominant power in this province at this moment ; 
     <lb/>
     we need hardly say we mean Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The important question to Upper  Canada—her 
     <lb/>
     connection with the North-West Territory—would 
     <lb/>
     be altogether ignored, Quebec would be made 
     <lb/>
     the capital of the Federation, representation by

     population would form no part of the compact, 
     <lb/>
     and, instead of having one leech draining her of 
     <lb/>
     her resources, Upper Canada would have three. 
     <lb/>
     Before entering into new alliances. it should be 
     <lb/>
     the effort of Upper Canadians to regulate the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of their own province, to obtain represen<lb break="no"/>tation by population, and to open the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territory, so that when the Federation of all the 
     <lb/>
     British American provinces does come, it may be 
     <lb/>
     found with Upper Canada as the central figure of 
     <lb/>
     the group of states, with western adjuncts as well 
     <lb/>
     as eastern. Not even the most ardent supporter 
     <lb/>
     of the union of all the provinces can allege that 
     <lb/>
     there is any absolute necessity for haste in carry<lb break="no"/>ing out the project. Nobody is being hurt by

     the provinces remaining in their present condition ;

     no one single material interest, either in Canada

     The line, in fact, will leave us just where we

            <p>Sir, I agree with the statement, that to go 
     <lb/>into the construction of this road without 
     <lb/>knowing what it is to cost, or over what par<lb break="no"/>ticular route it is to be built, is a thing not 
     <lb/>to be thought of by any prudent member of 
     <lb/>this House, and that such a proposal ought to 
     <lb/>be resisted at every stage. I think, too, that 
     <lb/>the whole scheme, apart from the construction 
     <lb/>of the railway, is worse than the railway 
     <lb/>scheme itself, and ought to be still more 
     <lb/>strongly opposed. It is a mere revival of a 
     <lb/>scheme that has been rejected by the people 
     <lb/>on every occasion on which it has been 
     <lb/>presented to them during the past seven years. 
     <lb/>Independent of various other considerations 
     <lb/>the mere question of its expense ought to 
     <lb/>cause it to be rejected by the representatives 
     <lb/>of the people. When the duties on imports 
     <lb/>were raised to twenty and twenty-five per 
     <lb/>cent., what was the cry we heard from the 
     <lb/>lower portion of the province ? It was that 
     <lb/>the people were quite unable to pay such a 
     <lb/>serious tax, and the result was the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of a free port at Gaspé. We have not, 
     <lb/>for several years, collected a single cent of 
     <lb/>income from that large section of country, but 
     <lb/>have, from year to year, paid out large sums 
     <lb/>of money for the opening up of roads, for the 
     <lb/>administration of justice, and for keeping up 
     <lb/>

     a steam summer communication with the ex<lb break="no"/>treme eastern section of the province. More 
     <lb/>
     money has been squandered in that section of 
     <lb/>
     the country than on any other, yet it has 
     <lb/>
     produced no revenue. And that was the 
     <lb/>
     character of the country through which the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial road was to run, both in Canada 
     <lb/>
     and in New Brunswick. For we are asked to 
     <lb/>
     add, at one stroke, to our debt of sixty —two 
     <lb/>
     and a half millions of dollars, an annual c harge 
     <lb/>
     representing in capital the moderate sum of 
     <lb/>
     one hundred and twenty-four millions—for 
     <lb/>
     that is the financial nature of the proposition, 
     <lb/>
     and this for the purpose of adding 900,000 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants to our population, most of whom 
     <lb/>
     are not in a better position, if they are in as 
     <lb/>
     good, as the people of the district of Gaspé. 
     <lb/>
    Hear, hear.) Sir, in 1841, nearly twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>five years ago, Lower Canada entered into the 
     <lb/>union of the provinces with a debt of £133,<lb break="no"/>000. That was a debt created by the Special 
     <lb/>Council, for the Legislature of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>under the old Constitution owed not a penny 
     <lb/>when it ceased to exist. That debt was 
     <lb/>created between 1837 and 1840. Since the 
     <lb/>union there have been expended in Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, for the Beauharnois canal, the en<lb break="no"/>largement of the Lachine canal, the works 
     <lb/>on Lake St. Peter, and the Chambly canal, 
     <lb/>about four millions of dollars. Besides, we 
     <lb/>have three hundred and fifty miles of the 
     <lb/>Grand Trunk Railway—about a hundred less 
     <lb/>than Upper Canada. Taking one-half the 
     <lb/>cost to the province of that railway ——two 
     <lb/>million pounds currency, or eight millions of 
     <lb/>dollars—we have four millions for canals and 
     <lb/>eight millions for railways. Twelve millions 
     <lb/>of dollars have, therefore, been expended for 
     <lb/>public works in Lower Canada, with perhaps 
     <lb/>another million for other small works—in all, 
     <lb/>thirteen millions of dollars.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—The Montreal har<lb break="no"/>bor will pay for itself. The Government will 
     <lb/>
     not be called upon to pay a single sixpence of 
     <lb/>
     its indebtedness. The province only guaran<lb break="no"/>tees a small portion of its debentures, and will 
     <lb/>
     never have to pay a copper of it, any more 
     <lb/>
     than it will of the municipal indebtedness of 
     <lb/>
     the city of Montreal, the interest of which is 
     <lb/>
    regularly paid every year. Twelve or thirteen 
     <lb/>millions of dollars' worth of public works is 
     <lb/>all we are able to show for an increase of our 
     <lb/>debt from £133,000 at the time of the union, 
     <lb/>to $27,500,000, which, on going out of the 
     <lb/>union to enter into the Confederation, is the 
     <lb/>Lower Canada proportion of the $62,500,<lb break="no"/><cb/>000 of public debt we are bringing into it. 
     <lb/>I do not take into consideration the Municipal 
     <lb/>Loan Fund indebtedness, nor the Seigniorial 
     <lb/>Tenure redemption, because if we have re<lb break="no"/>ceived any benefit from the outlay, we are 
     <lb/>going to be charged for those items separately 
     <lb/>over and above our share in the $62,500,000. 
     <lb/>If I am not right in thus stating the case, I 
     <lb/>hope honorable gentlemen on the other side 
     <lb/>of the House will correct me. From the ex<lb break="no"/>planations given the other day by the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Finance Minister, I infer that by putting 
     <lb/>the Seigniorial Tenure to the charge of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, and by Upper Canada abandoning 
     <lb/>its indemnity or the Seigniorial Tenure ex<lb break="no"/>penditure, there is no necessity for taking 
     <lb/>those items into account as part of the 
     <lb/>liability of Canada in the Confederation; 
     <lb/>that the charge for the redemption of the 
     <lb/>Seigniorial Tenure, the township indemnity 
     <lb/>under the Seigniorial Act of 1859, the interest 
     <lb/>on that indemnity, the liability of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince to the Superior Education Fund, and 
     <lb/>the loss on the Lower Canada Municipal Loan 
     <lb/>Fund, amounting in all to about $4,500,000, 
     <lb/>will have to be paid by Lower Canada alone, the 
     <lb/>interest on which, at five per cent, will be 
     <lb/>$225,000, which sum will be retained out of 
     <lb/>the $880,000 to be paid the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to Lower Canada or local purposes, 
     <lb/>leaving something less than 60 cents per head 
     <lb/>for carrying on the Local Government. Upper 
     <lb/>Canada came into the union with a debt of 
     <lb/>£1,300,000. Immediately after the union 
     <lb/>£1,500,000 sterling was borrowed for public 
     <lb/>works, most of which amount was expended in 
     <lb/>Upper Canada. And yet Upper Canada goes 
     <lb/>out of the union by simply abandoning its 
     <lb/>claim for indemnity under the Seigniorial 
     <lb/>Tenure Act, having nothing to assume but its 
     <lb/>Municipal Loan Fund and its share in the 
     <lb/>Federal debt; while Lower Canada, on the 
     <lb/>contrary, goes out with a load of $4,500,000 
     <lb/>of local debt, besides the $27,500,000 
     <lb/>which falls to its share to be paid through 
     <lb/>the General Government. And this, too, 
     <lb/>after paying for twenty-five years a highly 
     <lb/>increase taxation, for all which it has 
     <lb/>nothing to show except public improvements 
     <lb/>to the amount of about $13,000,000. Sir, 
     <lb/>if such a scheme as this, on being submit<lb break="no"/>ted to the people, would be approved by them, 
     <lb/>I am very much mistaken. I submit that no 
     <lb/>such project ought to be voted by the House, 
     <lb/>before we have the fullest information neces<lb break="no"/>sary to enable us to come to right conclusions. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) It is for the security of the 
     <lb/>majority, as well as of the minority, I make 
     <lb/>

     this demand. Honorable gentlemen who cry 
     <lb/>
     "hear! hear !" may find themselves very much 
     <lb/>
     disappointed, if, after this portion of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     is passed, the local constitutions proposed 
     <lb/>
     were quite unsatisfactory. I contend that 
     <lb/>
     the local constitutions are as much an essential 
     <lb/>
     part of the whole as the general Constitution, 
     <lb/>
     and that they both should have been laid at 
     <lb/>
     the same time before the House. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) We ought, besides, to have a clear 
     <lb/>
     statement of what are the liabilities specially 
     <lb/>
     assigned to Upper and Lower Canada. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It is well that Upper Canada should 
     <lb/>
     know if she has to pay the indebtedness 
     <lb/>
     of Port Hope, Cobourg, Brockville, Nia<lb break="no"/>gara, and other municipalities which have 
     <lb/>
     borrowed from the municipal loan fund, 
     <lb/>
     and what these liabilities are; and it is 
     <lb/>
     important for Lower Canada to be told 
     <lb/>
     what are the amounts they will be required 
     <lb/>
     to tax themselves for. We ought, besides, to 
     <lb/>
     obtain some kind of information upon the 
     <lb/>
     subject of the Intercolonial Railway, what is 
     <lb/>
     the proposed cost, and what route is to be 
     <lb/>
     followed; and before these facts are before the 
     <lb/>
     House, we ought not to take it upon ourselves 
     <lb/>
     to legislate on the subject. Still further, the 
     <lb/>
     people of the country do not understand the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. (Hear, hear.) Many members of 
     <lb/>
     this House, before hearing the explanations 
     <lb/>
     which have been offered, were, and others are 
     <lb/>
     still, in doubt as to the bearing of many of 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions. In the Upper House doubts 
     <lb/>
     were expressed as to who should recommend 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of the members composing 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council. It was thought in 
     <lb/>
     many quarters that the appointment of these 
     <lb/>
     members was to be made by the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments after the scheme should come into 
     <lb/>
     operation. But this it seems is a mistake. 
     <lb/>
     here are many other matters with which we 
     <lb/>
     are unacquainted, particularly as regards the 
     <lb/>
     assets and liabilities. There is a provision 
     <lb/>
     that the nomination of the judges of the 
     <lb/>
     superior courts shall be vested in the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, but it would seem that the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the courts is to be left to the 
     <lb/>
     local governments; and I put the question, 
     <lb/>
     What does this mean? Do you mean that 
     <lb/>
     the local governments are to establish as many 
     <lb/>
     courts as they please, declare of how many 
     <lb/>
     judges they will be composed, and that the 
     <lb/>
     General Government will have to pay for 
     <lb/>
     them? Is a local government to say, here is a 
     <lb/>
     court with three judges; we want five, and those 
     <lb/>
     five must be appointed and paid by the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government ? I have received no answer 
     <lb/>
     to this and to several other questions. I can 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         

     well understand what is meant by the regula<lb break="no"/>tion of the law of divorce; but what is meant 
     <lb/>
     by the regulation of the marriage question ? 
     <lb/>
     Is the General Government to be at liberty 
     <lb/>
     to set aside all that we have been in the habit 
     <lb/>
     of doing in Lower Canada in this respect ? 
     <lb/>
     Will the General Government have the power 
     <lb/>
     to determine the degree of relationship and 
     <lb/>
     the age beyond which parties may marry, 
     <lb/>
     as well as the consent which will be required 
     <lb/>
     to make a marriage valid? (Hear, ear.) 
     <lb/>
     Will all these questions be left to the General 
     <lb/>
     Government? If so, it will have the power 
     <lb/>
     to upset one of the most important portions 
     <lb/>
     of our civil code, and one affecting more 
     <lb/>
     than any other all classes of society. The 
     <lb/>
     adoption, for instance, of the English rule, 
     <lb/>
     whereby females at the age of twelve, and 
     <lb/>
     males at the age of fourteen, can contract a 
     <lb/>
     valid marriage without the consent of parents, 
     <lb/>
     tutors or guardians, would be looked to by the 
     <lb/>
     mass of the people of Lower Canada as a most 
     <lb/>
     objectionable innovation in our laws, as would 
     <lb/>
     also any provision to allow such marriages to 
     <lb/>
     take place before any common magistrate 
     <lb/>
     without any formality whatsoever. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Yet is there no danger that such 
     <lb/>
     measures might be carried, when you see the 
     <lb/>
     different feelings existing on these questions 
     <lb/>
     among the people of the different provinces ? 
     <lb/>
     There is another question to which I must 
     <lb/>
     refer before closing. It is said that the 
     <lb/>
     division of the debt is a fair one. We have 
     <lb/>
     given, say the Government, $25 of debt to 
     <lb/>
     each inhabitant—that is, in those provinces 
     <lb/>
     where it was less, they have increased it to 
     <lb/>
     that amount, charging it to the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and thereb they have made a present to 
     <lb/>
     the several provinces of the difference between 
     <lb/>
     their present indebtedness and the 425 per 
     <lb/>
     head. (Laughter.) This $25 per head, 
     <lb/>
     when compared to the debt of England, is a 
     <lb/>
     heavier burden upon our own people than the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial debt upon the people of England, 
     <lb/>
     taking into consideration the greater wealth 
     <lb/>
     per individual in England and the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the greater part of that debt bears three per 
     <lb/>
     cent. interest. (Hear, hear.) There is an<lb break="no"/>other aspect in which this question of debt is 
     <lb/>
     to be considered. To equalize it, the Con<lb break="no"/>ference have increased it on the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     present pulation for the several provinces. 
     <lb/>
     This is fair enough at present, supposing that 
     <lb/>
     each province contribute the same proportion 
     <lb/>
     to the general revenue, and would continue to 
     <lb/>
     be so if their population progressed in the 
     <lb/>
     same ratio of increase; but, from the 
     <lb/>
    natural advantages of Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>

     Canada, and their greater area of arable lands, 
     <lb/>
     there is no doubt they will increase in popu<lb break="no"/>lation and wealth in a much greater ratio than 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces, and in ten years hence, 
     <lb/>
     this proprtion, which this day appears a fair 
     <lb/>
     one, will have much increased for Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, while it will have diminished 
     <lb/>
     for the Lower Provinces. (Hear, hear.)  I 
     <lb/>
     owe an apology to the House for having of<lb break="no"/>fered such lengthened remarks on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and I have to thank honorable members 
     <lb/>
     for having so kindly listened to them. (Cries 
     <lb/>
     of "go on.")  I will simply content myself 
     <lb/>
     with saying that for these reasons which I 
     <lb/>
     have so imperfectly exposed, I strongly fear 
     <lb/>
     it would be a dark day for Canada when she 
     <lb/>
     adopted such a scheme as this. (Cheers.) It 
     <lb/>
     would be one marked in the history of this 
     <lb/>
     country as having had a most depressing and 
     <lb/>
     crushing influence on the energies of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in both U per and Lower Canada—(hear 
     <lb/>hear) — for I consider it one of the worst 
     <lb/>schemes that could be brought under the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the House ; and if it should be 
     <lb/>adopted without the sanction of the people, 
     <lb/>the country would never cease to regret it. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.)  What is the necessity for all 
     <lb/>this haste ? The longer this Constitution is 
     <lb/>expected to last, the greater the necessity for 
     <lb/>the fullest consideration and dehberation. I 
     <lb/>find, sir, that when, in 1839, Lord JOHN RUS<lb break="no"/>SELL brought into the House of Commons his 
     <lb/>first measure for the union of the provinces, 
     <lb/>he announced his intention to lay his measure 
     <lb/>before the House, have it read a second time, 
     <lb/>and postpone it till next session, to give a 
     <lb/>year to the people of Canada to consider it 
     <lb/>and make such representations as they would 
     <lb/>think proper. (Hear, hear.) And it was only 
     <lb/>in the subsequent session, and after under<lb break="no"/>going considerable modifications in the mean 
     <lb/>time, that the measure was passed.  Nothing 
     <lb/>could be more reasonable than such delay. 
     <lb/>But here it seems the people are to be treat<lb break="no"/>ed with less respect than they were when their 
     <lb/>Constitution was suspended , and this meas<lb break="no"/>ure is to be pushed with indecent haste. 
     <lb/>There are three modes of obtaining the views 
     <lb/>of the people upon the question now under 
     <lb/>discussion.  The most direct one would be, 
     <lb/>after debating it in this House, to submit it 
     <lb/>to the people for their verdict, yea or nay. 
     <lb/>The second is to dissolve the House and 
     <lb/>appeal to the people.  The third is to discuss 
     <lb/>and pass the resolutions or address to a 
     <lb/>second reading,and afterwards leave it open 
     <lb/>to the ublic to judge of its merits, by meet<lb break="no"/>ing an discussing it, and sending in petitions 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          

     and instructing their representatives how to 
     <lb/>
     vote upon it when they came to Parliament 
     <lb/>
     at the next session.  Any one of these 
     <lb/>
     methods would elicit the views of the people. 
     <lb/>
     But to say that the opinions of the people 
     <lb/>
     have been ascertained on the question, I say 
     <lb/>
     it is no such thing.  (Hear, hear.)  We 
     <lb/>
     have heard one side of the question discussed, 
     <lb/>
     but we have heard none of the views on the 
     <lb/>
     other side ; and yet the feeling, as exhibited 
     <lb/>
     in some parts of the country, has been un<lb break="no"/>mistakeably in favor of an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people.  Some fifteen counties in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada have held meetings and declared for 
     <lb/>
     an appeal before the scheme is allowed to 
     <lb/>
     pass ; and when honorable gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     other side have held second meetings, they 
     <lb/>
     have been condemned more conclusively than 
     <lb/>
     at first.  (Hear, hear.)  In the county of 
     <lb/>
     Rouville, the hon. member representing that 
     <lb/>
     county , not satisfied with the first expression 
     <lb/>
     of opinion, held a second meeting , but the 
     <lb/>
     decision was still more emphatic than at the 
     <lb/>
     first. (Hear, hear.) Then meetings have 
     <lb/>
     been held, all tending to the same conclusion, 
     <lb/>
     in St. Maurice, Maskinongé, Berthier, Joli<lb break="no"/>ette, Richelieu, Chambly, Vercherès, Bagot, 
     <lb/>
     St. Hyacinthe, Iberville, St. John's, Napier<lb break="no"/>ville, Drummond and Arthabaska, Two 
     <lb/>
     Mountains, Vaudreuil, and also in the city of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal.

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Yes, a meeting was 
     <lb/>called, and called without the requisite 
     <lb/>notice ; the notice having been given at the 
     <lb/>church doors on a Friday for a meeting on 
     <lb/>the next day; but notwithstanding, when 
     <lb/>the meeting was held, the hon. gentleman did 
     <lb/>not dare press a resolution in favor of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, but simply one of confidence in 
     <lb/>himself. (Hear, hear.) His friends co<lb break="no"/>lected together, and all they did was to 
     <lb/>express confidence in him. There was no 
     <lb/>resolution in favor of Confederation, nor of 
     <lb/>passing such a measure without submitting 
     <lb/>it to the people. (Hear, hear.) I have now 
     <lb/>to thank the House for the patience with 
     <lb/>which they have listened to my remarks. 
     <lb/>In the terms of the paragraph I have quoted 
     <lb/>from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, I shall feel it my duty to 
     <lb/>resist the passage of the measure at every 
     <lb/>stage, with a view that the scheme should 
     <lb/>go to the people in some shape or other. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) There is no hurry in regard 
     <lb/>to the scheme.  We are now legislating for 
     <lb/>the future as well as for the present, and 
     <lb/>feeling that we ought to make a Constitution 
     <lb/>as perfect as possibe, and as far as possible 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">269</fw>

     in harmony with the views of the people, I 
     <lb/>
     maintain that we ought not to pass this 
     <lb/>
     measure now, but leave it to another year, in 
     <lb/>
     order to ascertain in the meantime what the 
     <lb/>
     views and sentimentsof the people actually 
     <lb/>
     are. (The honorablc gentleman was loudly 
     <lb/>
     cheered on resuming his seat.) 
     <lb/></p>

<p>
    After some discussion as to the mode of 
     <lb/>continuing the debate, the House adjourned 
     <lb/>at ten minutes past twelve.

     HON. MR. CURRIE said—Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, with the consent of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     opposite (Hon. Mr. DICKSON) who is en<lb break="no"/>titled to the floor, in consequence of having 
     <lb/>
     moved the adjournment of the debate, I 
     <lb/>
     rise for the purpose of proposing the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion which for some length of time has been 
     <lb/>
     before the House, on the notice-paper. It is 
     <lb/>
     one which, I think, should commend itself 
     <lb/>
     to the good sense and impartial iudgment 
     <lb/>
     of the members of this Honorable House; 
     <lb/>
     and I shall be surprised if it shall meet any 
     <lb/>
     degree of opposition from the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men representing the Government in this 
     <lb/>
     branch of the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The resolution is as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That upon a matter of such great importance 
     <lb/>
     as the purposed Confederation of this and certain 
     <lb/>
     other British colonies, this House is unwilling to 
     <lb/>
     assume the responsibility of assenting to a mea<lb break="no"/>sure involving so many important considerations, 
     <lb/>
     without further manifestation of the public will 
     <lb/>
     than has yet been declared. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not aimed at either the destruction 
     <lb/>
     or the defeat of 'the resolutions before the 
     <lb/>
     House. It simply asks for delay until such 
     <lb/>
     time as the people of the country can more 
     <lb/>
     fully express their views on the matter than 
     <lb/>
     they have hitherto had an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     doing Hon. gentlemen, I stated, when I 
     <lb/>
     first addressed this Chamber in reference to 
     <lb/>
     the proposed address, that I was not opposed 
     <lb/>
     "? the Confederation of the British Pro- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     mess in itself, but that I was opposed to 
     <lb/>
     many of the details embraced in the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions upon which this House is asked to 
     <lb/>
     found an Address to Her Majesty the 
     <lb/>
     Queen. The hon. gentleman (Hon. Mr. ROSS) 
     <lb/>
     who followed me upon that occasion, stated 
     <lb/>
     among other things, that I had attempted 
     <lb/>
     to decry the Lower Provinces, and that I 
     <lb/>
     had attempted also to decry the credit of 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     
    Canada. I appeal to hon. members present, 
     <lb/>who were good enough to listen to me on that 
     <lb/>occasion, to point out a single word which I 
     <lb/>said, reflecting upon the credit of the people 
     <lb/>of the eastern provinces. Instead of having 
     <lb/>said anything to their discredit, I thought 
     <lb/>I had paid them a very high compliment. 
     <lb/>So far from reflecting upon the character of 
     <lb/>the public men of those provinces, I alluded 
     <lb/>to but one of them by name, the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>TILLEY, and I paid him the compliment, 
     <lb/>which he fully merits, of stating that he 
     <lb/>must be ranked among the leading and most 
     <lb/>prominent of British American statesmen. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) As to my decrying the credit 
     <lb/>of Canada—if, to tell the truth—if, to speak 
     <lb/>the honest convictions of one's mind—if, to 
     <lb/>state to the world what the Public Accounts 
     <lb/>of our country tell us—if this be to decry 
     <lb/>the credit of our country—then I am guilty 
     <lb/>of the charge. But the hon. gentleman went 
     <lb/>on and told us, that my speech was so illo<lb break="no"/>gical that it was unworthy of notice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     HON. MR. ROSS—I did not say that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. CURRIE—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man said what amounted to that. And yet 
     <lb/>
     to my astonishment be found it necessary to 
     <lb/>
     reply to me in a speech four columns in 
     <lb/>
     length—a speech, however, in which he 
     <lb/>
     failed to controvert a single position which 
     <lb/>
     I had the honor to take on that occasion. 
     <lb/>
     Then I was charged with having attacked 
     <lb/>
     statements of fact made by our public men. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. ROSS—Hear! hear ! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. CURRIE-The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man from Toronto says " Hear, hear." But 
     <lb/>
     I ask, is it not the duty of hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, standing on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House, to correct misstatements which have 
     <lb/>
     been sent to the country? Was I doing 
     <lb/>
     anything more than my duty, when, in 
     <lb/>
     my humble way, I endeavored to correct 
     <lb/>
     what, if not misstatements, were at least 
     <lb/>
     evidently incorrect statements? We have 
     <lb/>
     had too much of that kind of thing in this 
     <lb/>
     country. And since my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Hon. Mr. ROSS) has chosen to 
     <lb/>
     remind me of it, I must say that I think it 
     <lb/>
     is much to be regretted that certain state<lb break="no"/>ments have been made in this country, and 
     <lb/>
     sent from this country, which, instead of 
     <lb/>
     helping to build up our credit, have done 
     <lb/>
     much to injure it. (Hear, hear.) Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     I could not allude to anything more forcibly 
     <lb/>
     in point, than the flaming prospectus sent to 
     <lb/>
     the world under the auspices of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Toronto, in which he promised 
     <lb/>
    the confiding capitalists of England a
