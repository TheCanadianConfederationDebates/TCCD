<!--            <p>
     to prevent, for example, a Squatter's bill— 
     <lb/>
     (laughter)—being passed at the very first 
     <lb/>
     opportunity in the Local Parliament, demol- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ishing all the rights of property. I see my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend opposite (Hon. Mr. CRAWFORD) 
     <lb/>
     look melancholy, because he foresees that, 
     <lb/>
     when the new Constitution is adopted, twelve 
     <lb/>
     months will not pass before that becomes 
     <lb/>
     law in Lower Canada, and all protection for 
     <lb/>
     proprietors, so far as that is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     brought to an end. But this is only one 
     <lb/>
     instance, significant of what will take place. 
     <lb/>
     It is perfectly well known, and none can 
     <lb/>
     realize it better than those who have a much 
     <lb/>
     greater horror of the progress of popular 
     <lb/>
     sentiments than I have, that the tendency 
     <lb/>
     in the popular mind is to break down mon- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     opolies of every kind, and to go to extremes 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with vested rights, even those 
     <lb/>
     which are established and founded on sub- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     stantial principles of justice. Now, these 
     <lb/>
     rights, at the very least, ought certainly to 
     <lb/>
     be confided to the highest legislative author- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ity. I go further and maintain that guaran- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tees for those rights ought to be placed in the 
     <lb/>
     written Constitution, that they ought to be 
     <lb/>
     beyond the power of interference by the 
     <lb/>
     legislative authority, and that they should 
     <lb/>
     be guarded by the judicial decisions of the 
     <lb/>
     highest courts in the country. In that case 
     <lb/>
     there would be a protection for property, but 
     <lb/>
     in this Constitution there is no such protec- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tion for property either in Upper or Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. And here is the point to which 
     <lb/>
     I ask the attention of my honorable friends 
     <lb/>
     of all parties—a point which I think all of 
     <lb/>
     them have been too little concerned about, 
     <lb/>
     and which applies just as well to Upper as 
     <lb/>
     to Lower Canada. For I say that, if some 
     <lb/>
     security is not given to the people in one of 
     <lb/>
     these ways for maintaining vested rights 
     <lb/>
     and interests of this character, the most 
     <lb/>
     disastrous results will arise in every Local 
     <lb/>
     Parliament ; because, when these parlia- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ments are constructed, they will neces- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sarily consist of a different class of men from 
     <lb/>
     those who now compose the legislatures of 
     <lb/>
     the various provinces. There will be such 
     <lb/>
     inducements to men of the highest order to 
     <lb/>
     get elected to the Central Parliament, that 
     <lb/>
     the consequence will necessarily and natur- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ally be the result to which I point. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I should like to refer to one argu- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment which was used by my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Saugeen (Hon. Mr. MACPHERSON)—who is 
     <lb/>
     not now in his place—that the appointment 
     <lb/>
     of members of the Legislative Council in 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     the proposed Federal Parliament is not in 
     <lb/>
     fact an abandonment of the elective prin- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ciple, because the appointments are to be by 
     <lb/>
     the Ministry of the day, who must have the 
     <lb/>
     confidence of the people. That is certainly 
     <lb/>
     a most extraordinary argument. If it held 
     <lb/>
     good at all, it should apply equally to both 
     <lb/>
     Houses, and the Legislative Assembly should 
     <lb/>
     be appointed by the Ministry, because the 
     <lb/>
     Ministry have been selected by those who 
     <lb/>
     have been elected by the people. This is 
     <lb/>
     the clear, logical deduction from my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's argument, if it is good for anything 
     <lb/>
     —because, if appointment by the Ministry 
     <lb/>
     is not an abandonment of the elective prin- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ciple, you would still have an elective Legis- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     lative Assembly, although its members were 
     <lb/>
     appointed by the Government (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) But this was also well answered on 
     <lb/>
     a former occasion by my hon. friend behind 
     <lb/>
     me (Hon. Mr. AIKINS.) It is not simply 
     <lb/>
     the first appointment that we oppose. It is 
     <lb/>
     the appointments afterwards, as the first 
     <lb/>
     members die out or resign, and their suc- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cessors are appointed on the nomination of 
     <lb/>
     the future local governments. Instead of 
     <lb/>
     this producing a favorable result, it appears 
     <lb/>
     to me it will have just the opposite effect. 
     <lb/>
     The reason is plain. If, in the very first 
     <lb/>
     instance, the prerogative is exercised, not by 
     <lb/>
     the Sovereign or the Sovereign's representa- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tive, unbiassed, but is exercised by a party 
     <lb/>
     government, you have a House constituted 
     <lb/>
     at its very first meeting of a party character. 
     <lb/>
     In the other branch that particular Govern- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment has a majority. But it is possible, 
     <lb/>
     that that party may not long retain power. 
     <lb/>
     In the nature of things it is not probable 
     <lb/>
     that they will. No party does. But the 
     <lb/>
     Upper House remains permanent, and you 
     <lb/>
     provide by your very first operation for that 
     <lb/>
     dead-lock—that conflict between the Upper 
     <lb/>
     and the Lower House, which has been spoken 
     <lb/>
     of. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On motion of HON. MR. MOORE, the

     <lb/>
     Constitution of the country, the laying aside 
     <lb/>
     of the old Constitution and the adoption of a 
     <lb/>
     new and very different one, we all ought to 
     <lb/>
     endeavor to find common ground of agree<lb break="no"/>ment. It is important that no party, or at 
     <lb/>
     least no sectional interest among political 
     <lb/>
     parties, should betray itself in the discussion 
     <lb/>
     of so important a subject. I shall now en<lb break="no"/>deavor to take a brief view of the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     as it is presented, and endeavor to give an 
     <lb/>
     exposition of the views which I entertain 
     <lb/>
     with regard to this matter. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     It appears to me, in the first place, that the 
     <lb/>
     origin of this scheme was not what it ought 
     <lb/>
     to have been. It did not emanate from the 
     <lb/>
     people, but from the fact that certain politi<lb break="no"/>cal difficulties existed in Canada, in conse<lb break="no"/>uence of the political parties being so equally 
     <lb/>
    divided that it was found impracticable to get 
     <lb/>on with the government of this province. 
     <lb/>The scheme emanated from the Government 
     <lb/>of this country in consequence of those politi<lb break="no"/>cal difficulties, and had not its origin with 
     <lb/>any movement among the masses of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. It is very well known that at the last 
     <lb/>general election, in 1863, this was not among 
     <lb/>the questions that were brought before the 
     <lb/>country. It was not one of those questions 
     <lb/>that the people were called upon to decide in 
     <lb/>returning members to represent them in the 
     <lb/>Legislature. It is very true that the scheme 
     <lb/>of a Federal union of all the provinces has 
     <lb/>been spoken of for a quarter of a century by 
     <lb/>eminent men of all shades of politics. We 
     <lb/>may refer to the convention that was held at 
     <lb/>Kingston, at which the British American 
     <lb/>League was formed. That convention was 
     <lb/>convened by the Conservative party of Upper 
     <lb/>Canada. Subsequently, the great meeting— 
     <lb/>if I may use that expression—that was con<lb break="no"/>vened in the city of Toronto, referred to the 
     <lb/>same question. But I go back and appeal to 
     <lb/>the fact that at the last general election, it 
     <lb/>was not one of those questions that were re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the arbitrament of the people to 
     <lb/>decide by their votes as to the desirability of 
     <lb/>union. I think every honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>will agree with me that this was the fact. 
     <lb/>Now, honorable gentlemen, I desire to speak 
     <lb/>in a temperate tone and manner in regard to 
     <lb/>this scheme. I believe the gentlemen that 
     <lb/>now constitute the Government of Canada, as 
     <lb/>well as the gentlemen who constitute the dif<lb break="no"/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     ferent governments of the Lower Provinces, are 
     <lb/>
     all able men, and I believe they are all honest 
     <lb/>
     and practical men, and it was by and through 
     <lb/>
     the instrumentality of honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     constituting the Government of Canada in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the governments of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces that this scheme, if it had not 
     <lb/>
     its origin, at least was by them put before the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country in the shape in which 
     <lb/>
     it now presents itself in these resolutions. I 
     <lb/>
     therefore observe that this is a measure 
     <lb/>
     emanating from the minds of the foremost 
     <lb/>
     men in Canada, and probably the foremost 
     <lb/>
     men on the continent of America. Still, it is 
     <lb/>
     not a measure that has emanated from the 
     <lb/>
     people, and I would ask you all, honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, in reference to the change of 
     <lb/>
     a country's Constitution, if history does not 
     <lb/>
     bear me out in asserting that all such changes 
     <lb/>
     are preceded by a rising of the people in favor 
     <lb/>
     of the change. The people, feeling oppressed 
     <lb/>
     by the existing state of things, rise in their 
     <lb/>
     majesty and put an end to its continuance, 
     <lb/>
     and demand a new Constitution. But in re<lb break="no"/>gard to a change effected in the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which this is proposed, by the united 
     <lb/>
     wisdom of the several governments, without 
     <lb/>
     any convulsion, I hold that under those cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances the people of the whole country to 
     <lb/>
     be affected by the change ought to have an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of considering the great change. 
     <lb/>
     It is not sufficient in my mind that a few of 
     <lb/>
     the leading spirits of the land should be able 
     <lb/>
     to control and bring about so great a change 
     <lb/>
     without the initiatory steps being taken on 
     <lb/>
     the part of the people. Now, honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, I would refer to the representation in 
     <lb/>
     the first conference—the conference in which 
     <lb/>
     the initiatory steps were taken—at Charlotte<lb break="no"/>town. All honorable gentlemen are aware 
     <lb/>
     that the governments of the several Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces had decreed by resolutions passed 
     <lb/>
     during former sessions of their several par<lb break="no"/>liaments, that they were to send delegates to 
     <lb/>
     meet at Charlottetown, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     uniting their several governments under one 
     <lb/>
     government ; in other words, to consolidate 
     <lb/>
     their governments into what would be termed 
     <lb/>
     a legislative union. We could all understand 
     <lb/>
     from the position of those several local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments that it was a matter of very great 
     <lb/>
     importance that they should unite their gov<lb break="no"/>ernments under one to obviate the necessity 
     <lb/>
     of having different rates of duty ; and in fac 
     <lb/>
     their interests were so blended that we can 
     <lb/>
     understand that union was of very great im 
     <lb/>
     portance to them. The Government of Can 
     <lb/>
     ada met the delegates at Charlottetown, and 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="227" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0227.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">227</fw>
     by the representations that were made to the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the Lower Provinces, they 
     <lb/>
     abandoned their project of meeting together 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of consolidating their govern<lb break="no"/>ments, and took up the larger question of a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union of all the provinces. I believe, 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen, that if the inducements 
     <lb/>
     held out to the delegates convened at Char<lb break="no"/>lottetown to abandon their first scheme were 
     <lb/>
     fully known, it would be found that chief 
     <lb/>
     among them was the construction of the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway. It strikes me very for<lb break="no"/>cibly from all that I heard in the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces during a recent tour, that if there 
     <lb/>
     was one thing more than another to which 
     <lb/>
     the people gave prominence, it was the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway. Now, with reference to this 
     <lb/>
     subject, the plan previously adopted was, that 
     <lb/>
     Canada was to furnish five-twelfths of the 
     <lb/>
     money, and the Maritime Provinces seven- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     twelfths. It appears by the resolutions laid 
     <lb/>
     on the table of this House, that if the Con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme is carried out, the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway is to be built. I admit it is 
     <lb/>
     a matter of necessity that it should be built 
     <lb/>
     in that case. There is no doubt about it. 
     <lb/>
     We cannot have union without it. But the 
     <lb/>
     fact does exist, that instead of Canada con<lb break="no"/>tributing five-twelfths of the cost of construc<lb break="no"/>tion, it will be called upon to contribute 
     <lb/>
     about ten-twelfths. (Hear, hear.) I merely 
     <lb/>
     mention the fact to show that it appears to 
     <lb/>
     me that some strong inducement must have 
     <lb/>
     been held out to the delegates from the Low<lb break="no"/>er Provinces to enter into this great scheme, 
     <lb/>
     when we find, as it is very well known, that 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway has been one of those 
     <lb/>
     objects that has been first and foremost in 
     <lb/>
     the minds of the people of almost all the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces. It would open up for 
     <lb/>
     them a vast section of new country, and the 
     <lb/>
     benefits to be derived would certainly be par<lb break="no"/>amount to them above anything Canada could 
     <lb/>
     derive from its construction. It is therefore 
     <lb/>
     evident to my mind that this inducement has 
     <lb/>
     been held out in order to induce those prov<lb break="no"/>inces to come into the proposed union. Again, 
     <lb/>
     with regard to representation in the Confer<lb break="no"/>ference—I refer now to the Conference at 
     <lb/>
     Quebec — there were twenty-one honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen constituting the delegation from 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces. Am I correct ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—I believe that 
     <lb/>
     is correct. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MOOR1">HON. MR. MOORE</persName>
—There were twelve 
     <lb/>
     delegates from the Province of Canada. We 
     <lb/>
     were told by my honorable friend the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Crown Lands that they did not vote 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     by numbers but by provinces. Well, in vot<lb break="no"/>ing by provinces, I think there was nothing 
     <lb/>
     to be gained, so far as the advocacy of certain 
     <lb/>
     measures in the interests of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada was concerned in this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     For if they voted by provinces, the little 
     <lb/>
     Island of Prince Edward, and Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     would equal the votes of the Province of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. Now, honorable gentlemen, when we 
     <lb/>
     consider the position of Canada, our resources, 
     <lb/>
     and the amount that this province will bring 
     <lb/>
     into the common treasury, it does appear to 
     <lb/>
     me that Canada was not equitably represented 
     <lb/>
     in the Convention. I would not for one mo<lb break="no"/>ment attribute to the delegates from Canada 
     <lb/>
     neglect of their duty in any particular, but 
     <lb/>
     when there became a necessity that certain 
     <lb/>
     arrangements were to be made with the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, then I can understand that if they 
     <lb/>
     were more favorable to the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     than to Canada, the vote would preponderate 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the former. There is another 
     <lb/>
    point, honorable gentlemen, to which I would 
     <lb/>like to draw your attention, namely, the in<lb break="no"/>crease of the expense of government under 
     <lb/>the new arrangement. It does appear to me, 
     <lb/>that if the scheme is adopted, it will neces<lb break="no"/>sarily increase the burdens of the people, and, 
     <lb/>I believe that we will be obliged to resort to 
     <lb/>direct taxation to sustain the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments. It appears to me impossible to have 
     <lb/>so many local governments, and, also, a Gene<lb break="no"/>ral Government, without greatly adding to the 
     <lb/>expense. There is yet another point on which 
     <lb/>I feel more deeply than on any of the preced<lb break="no"/>ing. It places Lower Canada in a false posi<lb break="no"/>tion. The Anglo-Saxon race of Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da is nearly one-fourth of the population, and 
     <lb/>in the Local Government they will be com<lb break="no"/>pletely under the control of the people of 
     <lb/>French origin ; not that I believe but that the 
     <lb/>latter would endeavor to give all their just 
     <lb/>due, but still it does appear to me that it 
     <lb/>places the people of Anglo-Saxon origin in a 
     <lb/>false position. Then the French population 
     <lb/>in the Federal Government is placed in a false 
     <lb/>position, for there they will be in a very small 
     <lb/>minority—in the same position, relatively, as 
     <lb/>the Anglo-Saxon race in the Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The honorable gentleman who ad<lb break="no"/>dressed the House so very ably and eloquent<lb break="no"/>ly last evening—the honorable member for 
     <lb/>Erie—said he preferred taking the scheme as 
     <lb/>it was rather than risk any alteration. It has 
     <lb/>also been said by honorable gentlemen of the 
     <lb/>Government, that they could not permit any 
     <lb/>alteration, or suggestion of amendment, to be 
     <lb/>made in the resolutions now before the House. 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="228" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0228.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">228</fw>  
     But it does appear to me, honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, that inasmuch as there are five different 
     <lb/>
     legislatures to take those resolutions into con<lb break="no"/>sideration, if any one branch of either of those 
     <lb/>
     legislatures should be able to suggest any im<lb break="no"/>provements, and the resolutions should be 
     <lb/>
     changed before their adoption by that branch, 
     <lb/>
     such a step would not defeat the whole scheme. 
     <lb/>
     It would be only offering so many suggestions 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the representatives of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. Of course any alterations suggested in 
     <lb/>
     this manner, would go before the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament as a basis upon which to con<lb break="no"/>struct an Act of Union. It would afford 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Parliament an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of knowing the people's sentiments, and 
     <lb/>
     would not in any way really interfere 
     <lb/>
     with the proposed union being carried out. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I think that any amendment that 
     <lb/>
     may be made in this branch of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, or in the other branch, or in either of 
     <lb/>
     the branches of the legislatures of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces, would only go before the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament as so many suggestions that 
     <lb/>
     might very properly be considered by the Im<lb break="no"/>perial authorities in dealing with so very im<lb break="no"/>portant a subject. Now, admitting, as I do 
     <lb/>
     admit, that the gentlemen who constituted 
     <lb/>
     the delegation from Canada in the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, were the first men of our land—I be<lb break="no"/>lieve men of patriotism, and who desired to 
     <lb/>
     do only that which was for the best interests 
     <lb/>
     of the country—still they are not infallible. 
     <lb/>
     They may have made mistakes, and may have 
     <lb/>
     omitted some things that, even if they were 
     <lb/>
     again to go into conference after six months 
     <lb/>
     had elapsed, might be placed in the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions that would |very much improve them. 
     <lb/>
     My honorable friend from Peel has stated 
     <lb/>
     that although he approved of most of the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, he desired to see amendments 
     <lb/>
     made, but inasmuch as he saw their intro<lb break="no"/>duction by this House would be fatal to the 
     <lb/>
     whole measure, he would take the whole as 
     <lb/>
     it stood. I disagree with that honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, and with the position taken by 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentlemen representing the 
     <lb/>
     Government in this House. I think it is a 
     <lb/>
     mistake, and it is insulting to both the House 
     <lb/>
     and the country to suppose that, because a 
     <lb/>
     certain number of men met together and de<lb break="no"/>liberated for fifteen or eighteen days, there 
     <lb/>
     should be no improvement made upon the 
     <lb/>
     result of their deliberations. Now, hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen, I am one of those who, if 
     <lb/>
     I can be convinced that a Federal union is 
     <lb/>
    going to promote the stability or welfare of  
     <lb/>Canada, will go with it most heartily, but I 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     do think it becomes necessary not to make 
     <lb/>
     out altogether an <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex parte</hi> case, because I think 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions that were passed by the dele<lb break="no"/>gates, though sent out to the country, ought 
     <lb/>
     to be accompanied by the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     question, which has not been fairly heard. 
     <lb/>
    There is still another matter to which I wish 
     <lb/>to refer, and in doing so I might remark that 
     <lb/>I am aware that this is looking at the darkest 
     <lb/>side of the picture. I think that the engraft<lb break="no"/>ing of this system of government upon the 
     <lb/>British Constitution has a tendency to at 
     <lb/>least introduce the republican system. It is 
     <lb/>republican so far as it goes, and that is an<lb break="no"/>other reason why I do not approve of it. If 
     <lb/>we commence to adopt the republican system, 
     <lb/>we shall perhaps get the idea of continuing 
     <lb/>the system until we go too far. It is also 
     <lb/>said that we are to have a new nationality. 
     <lb/>I do not understand that term, honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen. If we were going to have an in<lb break="no"/>dependent sovereignty in this country, then I 
     <lb/>could understand it. I believe honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen will agree with me, that after this 
     <lb/>scheme is fully carried into operation, we shall 
     <lb/>still be colonies. 
     <lb/>

—Now, that being the 
     <lb/>
     case, I think our Local Government will be 
     <lb/>
     placed in a lower position than in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment we have now. Every measure resolved 
     <lb/>
     upon in the Local Government will be subject 
     <lb/>
     to the veto of the Federal Government—that 
     <lb/>
     is, any measure or bill passing the Local

—I beg to differ slightly 
     <lb/>
     with the honorable gentleman. Any measure 
     <lb/>
     passed by this province may be disallowed 
     <lb/>
     within two years thereafter by the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government. But the local governments, 
     <lb/>
     under Confederation, are to be subjected to 
     <lb/>
     having their measures vetoed within one year 
     <lb/>
     by the Federal Government, and then the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government has the privilege of 
     <lb/>
     vetoing anything the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     may do, within two years. The veto power 
     <lb/>
     thus placed in the hands of the Federal Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, if exercised frequently, would be 
     <lb/>
     almost certain to cause difficulty between the 
     <lb/>
     local and general governments. I observe 
     <lb/>
     that my honorable friend, Sir ETIENNE P. 
     <lb/>

—It will be conceded 
     <lb/>
     that the question of the veto power was very 
     <lb/>
     ably discussed, at one time, in the United 
     <lb/>
     States Congress, and that discussion led to a 
     <lb/>
     qualification of the veto power in the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the United States, so that now any 
     <lb/>
     bill passed by both Houses may be vetoed by 
     <lb/>
     the President within ten days thereafter, by 
     <lb/>
     assigning reasons for doing so. Both Houses 
     <lb/>
     may then, however, again take up the measure, 
     <lb/>
     and if they pass it by a two-third vote, it 
     <lb/>
     becomes the law of the land, independent of 
     <lb/>
     the President's will. Now, I would have the 
     <lb/>
     veto power applied in a similar way in our 
     <lb/>
     new Constitution. Exercising it in an arbi<lb break="no"/>trary manner, as the Federal power is privileged 
     <lb/>
     to do, it must, from the very nature of things, 
     <lb/>
     create dissatisfaction and difficulty between 
     <lb/>
     the two governments. Again, honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, it is said that by this union we are to 
     <lb/>
     strengthen our defensive capacity. I really 
     <lb/>
     cannot see the force of this argument, unless 
     <lb/>
     it were possible that in uniting with the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces their population was to be brought 
     <lb/>
     nearer to us. If nature were to make the 
     <lb/>
     necessary effort and move their territory up 
     <lb/>
     alongside of us, and thus make a compact mass 
     <lb/>
     of people, I would at once agree that it would 
     <lb/>
     strengthen us in a military point of view. But 
     <lb/>
     the fact is, the union will give an extension of 
     <lb/>
     territory far greater in proportion to the num<lb break="no"/>bers of the population than now exists in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. From that circumstance, I argue 
     <lb/>
     that it will weaken instead of strengthen us. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Unfortunately, if a war should 
     <lb/>
     take place between the United States and 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, the Lower Provinces have a 
     <lb/>
     thousand miles of sea coast open to attack, 
     <lb/>
     and I apprehend they would be very jealous 
     <lb/>
     about having their militiamen sent to Canada 
     <lb/>
     for our defence from border incursions. And 
     <lb/>
     it would be very natural for them to desire 
     <lb/>
     that all their own force should be kept at home 
     <lb/>
    for their protection ; and the same with regard 
     <lb/>to Canada. If a considerable portion of the 
     <lb/>militia of Canada were ordered to proceed to 
     <lb/>the Lower Provinces, it would most certainly 
     <lb/>weaken and cause dissatisfaction in Can<lb break="no"/>ada. But, setting that aside, does it increase 
     <lb/>our numbers and our means of defence ? Have 
     <lb/>we not the same territory exposed ? We shall 
     <lb/>have no additional men by the union for the 
     <lb/>defence of Canada. Perhaps, after the union 
     <lb/>takes place, emigration will flow into the 
     <lb/>country, but I do not know that there would be 
     <lb/>any very great inducement, after a union, 
     <lb/>above the inducements that now exist. It 
     <lb/>appears to me that that question and fact 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     would remain in very much the same state as 
     <lb/>
     at present. Honorable gentlemen, in conclu<lb break="no"/>sion, I would say that I have thus endeavored 
     <lb/>
     to point out some of the objections to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme as presented that have occurred to 
     <lb/>
     me. We have all a common interest in this 
     <lb/>
     matter. (Hear, hear.) I think that no po<lb break="no"/>litical or party feeling should have any bear<lb break="no"/>ing upon its consideration, and if, after a free 
     <lb/>
     and full discussion of its merits and demerits, 
     <lb/>
     and the people and the members of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment come to fully understand the question, 
     <lb/>
     it is found that it is going to be an advan<lb break="no"/>tage to the country, I will certainly give it 
     <lb/>
     my cheerful support. But I do wish to have 
     <lb/>
     some things respecting it made more clear to 
     <lb/>
     my comprehension than they are at present, 
     <lb/>
     and it is for these reasons that I have taken 
     <lb/>
     up the time of the House in making these 
     <lb/>
     few remarks. (Cheers) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCMA2">HON. MR. MCMASTER</persName> said—The reso<lb break="no"/>lutions before the House have been so ably 
     <lb/>
     discussed in nearly all their different bearings, 
     <lb/>
     that it appears to me that but little can be ad<lb break="no"/>vanced on either side in addition to what has 
     <lb/>
     been already said. I shall therefore only oc<lb break="no"/>cupy the time of the House for a very few 
     <lb/>
     moments in explaining my reasons for the 
     <lb/>
     vote I intend to give on the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Wellington. When 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation of the provinces was first 
     <lb/>
     proposed, I, although favorable to the princi<lb break="no"/>ple of the scheme, entertained grave doubts 
     <lb/>
     as to whether, if carried, it would be of any 
     <lb/>
     real benefit to that section of the country in 
     <lb/>
     which I am more immediately interested. 
     <lb/>
     Much, however, depended upon the details, 
     <lb/>
     and after giving them a good deal of consid<lb break="no"/>eration, I have been unable to come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that the scheme, as a whole, will 
     <lb/>
     be a remedy for all the evils complained of 
     <lb/>
     by the people of Upper Canada. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The appropriations to be made annually to 
     <lb/>
     the local legislatures out of the general rev<lb break="no"/>enue I regard as being most objectionable. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) This, I believe will go far to 
     <lb/>
     neutralize some of the advantages which 
     <lb/>
     would have resulted from the scheme had the 
     <lb/>
     governments of the different provinces been 
     <lb/>
     obliged to provide for all expenditure of a 
     <lb/>
     strictly local character. The building of the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway must also be regarded 
     <lb/>
     as a very questionable part of the project ; 
     <lb/>
     indeed to my mind it is the most objection<lb break="no"/>able of the whole. (Hear, hear.) We are 
     <lb/>
     told by honorable gentlemen that the abro<lb break="no"/>gation of the Reciprocity Treaty renders this 
     <lb/>
     road an indispensable necessity in order to 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="230" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0230.jpg"/>
               <fw type="num">230</fw>
     secure an independent outlet to the seaboard ; 
     <lb/>
     but, if this view of the case be correct, why 
     <lb/>
     do not our merchants and millers forward 
     <lb/>
     their produce during the winter months to 
     <lb/>
     New York, Boston or Portland, by our or 
     <lb/>
     any of the other different railway lines which 
     <lb/>
     have long been open to these points ? The 
     <lb/>
     reason is obvious. The freight by railway is 
     <lb/>
     so expensive that they find it to for their 
     <lb/>
     advantage to pay interest, storage and in<lb break="no"/>surance on their wheat and flour until the 
     <lb/>
     opening of the navigation. And if they do 
     <lb/>
     not now avail themselves of the shipping ports 
     <lb/>
     referred to, neither of which are more than 
     <lb/>
     six hundred miles from Toronto, will they 
     <lb/>
     send their produce double that distance over 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial road to Halifax? Most as<lb break="no"/>suredly not. (Hear, hear.) If the Recipro<lb break="no"/>city Treaty even should be abrogated, the 
     <lb/>
     great bulk of our produce in the west will 
     <lb/>
     will then, as now, continue to be stored at the 
     <lb/>
     different places of shipment along our canals 
     <lb/>
     and lakes until the opening of navigation, so 
     <lb/>
     that whatever may be said in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial road in a military point of view, 
     <lb/>
     or however it may be urged as a necessity in 
     <lb/>
     order to furnish easy and convenient inter<lb break="no"/>course between the provinces in the event of 
     <lb/>
     their being united, I hold that as a commer<lb break="no"/>cial speculation it will prove an entire failure, 
     <lb/>
     which must necessarily add greatly to our al<lb break="no"/>ready large unproductive investments. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And how the honorable gentleman from 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Hon. Mr. ROSS) could say as he 
     <lb/>
     did the other day, that Upper Canada alone 
     <lb/>
     had better build the Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>
     than be without it, is what I cannot compre<lb break="no"/>hend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>
—I say so again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCMA2">HON. MR. MCMASTER</persName>—Well, if the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman would resign his seat and 
     <lb/>
     present himself to any constituency west of 
     <lb/>
    Kingston, giving the views he has enunciated 
     <lb/>about this railroad a prominent place in his 
     <lb/>address to the electors, I fear this House 
     <lb/>would be deprived of his valuable services. 
     <lb/>(Laughter. ) The change proposed in the 
     <lb/>constitution of the Legislative Council, by 
     <lb/>which the nominative is to be substituted for 
     <lb/>the elective system, I cannot but regard as a 
     <lb/>retrograde movement ; and were the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions providing change, and authorizing the 
     <lb/>building of the Intercolonial Railway, and the 
     <lb/>annual subsidy to the different local legislatures, 
     <lb/>submitted separately, and under ordinary cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, I should, if standing alone in the 
     <lb/>House, feel it to be my duty to record my 
     <lb/>vote against them ; but when viewed as part 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     of a general scheme, embracing other provis<lb break="no"/>ions, which may have an important bearing 
     <lb/>
     upon the future interests, the peace and pros<lb break="no"/>perity of the province, I feel bound to consider 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions in that spirit of compromise 
     <lb/>
     which is absolutely necessary in framing any 
     <lb/>
     measure or constitution that will be at all 
     <lb/>
     likely to remedy our sectional difficulties. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I need hardly remind honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen that nothing could be more 
     <lb/>
     unsatisfactory than the state of our public 
     <lb/>
     affairs for a long time past. The Legislature 
     <lb/>
     has been called together year after year, and the 
     <lb/>
     usual sessional expenditure incurred—which 
     <lb/>
     is always very large—but the sectional major<lb break="no"/>ities arrayed against each other in the other 
     <lb/>
     Chamber, rendered useful legislation almost, if 
     <lb/>
     not altogether, impossible. Whatever govern<lb break="no"/>ment was in power lived, as it were, by the 
     <lb/>
     day, and being engaged in a constant struggle 
     <lb/>
     for existence, the very natural desire to ob<lb break="no"/>tain increased strength frequently led to the 
     <lb/>
     distribution of patronage and the expenditure 
     <lb/>
     of public money in a way that could not be 
     <lb/>
     justified. All admit we cannot go along as 
     <lb/>
     we have been doing, and that some change is 
     <lb/>
     necessary ; and in the absence of anything bet<lb break="no"/>ter being submitted, I feel inclined to give the 
     <lb/>
    scheme proposed a trial, believing that there 
     <lb/>are reasonable grounds to hope that the 
     <lb/>Constitution which is to be based on the 
     <lb/>resolutions before the House will, at least to 
     <lb/>some extent, remedy those sectional difficul<lb break="no"/>ties which have operated so much to the pre<lb break="no"/>judice of the country. (Hear, hear.) It will 
     <lb/>secure to the people of Upper Canada the entire 
     <lb/>control of their local affairs, which I regard as 
     <lb/>being of the utmost importance. It will put 
     <lb/>an end to the system of duplicating in one 
     <lb/>section of the province large amounts of money 
     <lb/>granted to the other for colonization roads and 
     <lb/>other local objects, on which vast sums have 
     <lb/>been squandered. It will secure to the people 
     <lb/>of Upper Canada representation by population 
     <lb/>in that branch of the Federal Legislature 
     <lb/>which controls the purse-strings. It will also 
     <lb/>give to them all the unsold Crown lands in the 
     <lb/>western section of the province. And I trust 
     <lb/>the promises made with reference to the 
     <lb/>widening and deepening of our canals, and the 
     <lb/>opening up of the North-West Territory will 
     <lb/>be carried out in good faith. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Indeed no Government can afford to treat with 
     <lb/>entire neglect works of so much importance to 
     <lb/>Upper Canada, and at the same time incur the 
     <lb/>large expenditure required for the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>Railroad. (Hear, hear.) When I look at 
     <lb/>these advantages, and think of the critical 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="231" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0231.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">231</fw>
            
     position in which the province is now placed, 
     <lb/>
     and the serious consequences that might pos<lb break="no"/>sibly follow, should the Confederation scheme 
     <lb/>
     be rejected, I shrink from the responsibility of 
     <lb/>
     becoming a party to any amendment which 
     <lb/>
     may have the effect of defeating the measure. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Holding these views, and 
     <lb/>
     looking upon the resolutions of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Conference in the light of a treaty entered 
     <lb/>
     into by five provinces, which must be either 
     <lb/>
     approved as a whole or rejected, I feel that in 
     <lb/>
     giving them my support, I am, all things con<lb break="no"/>sidered, acting in the interest of the province 
     <lb/>
     generally, and doing what is best for my con<lb break="no"/>stituents. (Cheers.)

     <persName ref="pers:SIMP1">Hon. MR. SIMPSON</persName> said—I think it 
     <lb/>
     was said by a wise man that there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     new under the sun. But had SOLOMON 
     <lb/>
     the scheme now before the House presented 
     <lb/>
     to him, he would probably have changed his 
     <lb/>
     opinion. Possibly nothing new can be said 
     <lb/>
     on the subject of representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion, or even on the scheme now before the 
     <lb/>
     House ; but representing, as I do, one of the 
     <lb/>
    and wealthiest constituencies in 
     <lb/>Upper Canada, I think it necessary for me 
     <lb/>to give my reasons for the position I have 
     <lb/>felt it my duty to take in reference thereto. 
     <lb/>It has been stated that the elections which 
     <lb/>have lately taken place have gone in favor 
     <lb/>of the Government ; but, even if such were 
     <lb/>the case, how could it possibly be otherwise, 
     <lb/>seeing that men of all shades of politics have 
     <lb/>united in forming a happy family. We have 
     <lb/>seen those who have been for almost a life<lb break="no"/>time antagonistic to each other opening their 
     <lb/>arms, as was so well and eloquently depicted 
     <lb/>the other evening by the honorable member 
     <lb/>from Montreal (Hon. Mr. FERRIER), and 
     <lb/>embracing each other; and we have been 
     <lb/>led to imagine that the millennium, so long 
     <lb/>predicted and anxiously looked for, has, 
     <lb/>so far as Canada is concerned at all events, 
     <lb/>at length arrived. (Laughter.) We are to 
     <lb/>have no more discord and no more strife, but 
     <lb/>are henceforth to live in harmony the one 
     <lb/>with the other. It has been asserted that 
     <lb/>in regard to myself I owe my return without 
     <lb/>opposition to the fact that I avowed myself 
     <lb/>in favor of the Confederation of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces on the basis submitted. This is not 
     <lb/>correct. I held no meetings—I made no 
     <lb/>speeches—and in no instance was I asked 
     <lb/>what were my views in regard to the scheme; 
     <lb/>and, if honorable gentlemen will permit me, 
     <lb/>I will read a portion of my short address to 
     <lb/>the electors. It is as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            <!-- GL Comment, above paragraph should end and next paragraph nested inside the <quote> element -->

    
            <cb/>
            
     <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">You will reasonably expect me to give my 
     <lb/>
    views on the important constitutional changes 
     <lb/>that are now contemplated. No one at all ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with the effects produced upon our legis<lb break="no"/>gislation and on the general prosperity of the 
     <lb/>country, by the unhappy sectional difficulties 
     <lb/>existing between Upper and Lower Canada but 
     <lb/>must have felt that some remedy should be found 
     <lb/>for those evils. Whether the very able gentle<lb break="no"/>men who have so strangely united to solve and 
     <lb/>remove these difficulties will be able to accomplish 
     <lb/>their praiseworthy task, time alone can tell. We 
     <lb/>need the details before being able to pronounce 
     <lb/>an opinion; but heartily (and I hope in common 
     <lb/>with every well-wisher of their country) I most 
     <lb/>earnestly pray that they may succeed.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>It will be seen that here I simply state 
     <lb/>that the gentlemen who had so strangely 
     <lb/>come together would be entitled to the thanks 
     <lb/>of the country if they were able to agree 
     <lb/>upon a scheme which would solve the ad<lb break="no"/>mitted difficulties between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>Canada. But as I have read from my 
     <lb/>address, so I still maintain that, before we 
     <lb/>can be expected to express an intelligent 
     <lb/>opinion, we ought not simply to have half a 
     <lb/>scheme, but the details of the scheme in its 
     <lb/>entirety. If we refer to the election in 
     <lb/>North Ontario, where the Honorable Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary had been the representative, 
     <lb/>and who returned for re-election after accept<lb break="no"/>ing ofiice in the present Government, we 
     <lb/>find that he was defeated by a gentleman 
     <lb/>(Mr. M. C. CAMERON). who is known to be 
     <lb/>an opponent to the project. And if we take 
     <lb/>the more recent election which occurred in 
     <lb/>South Ontario, we find the contest between 
     <lb/>two gentlemen, both personal friends of my 
     <lb/>own, and both of whom were favorable to 
     <lb/>the principle, but who pledged themselves 
     <lb/>that before it became an accomplished fact, 
     <lb/>it should, so far as their vote would extend, 
     <lb/>be submitted for the approval of the people. 
     <lb/>And I would be greatly deceived if the gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who has now the honor to represent 
     <lb/>that riding in the other branch of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature (Mr. GIBBS) shall be found support<lb break="no"/>ing the scheme unless that course be first 
     <lb/>taken. We need the details before it is 
     <lb/>possible that we can pronounce upon the 
     <lb/>scheme and consider it on its merits.

     <lb/>
     no confidence in it as a cure for the evils

    we complained of, and I then, and have 
     <lb/>ever since, felt that it would be better 
     <lb/>for the two provinces to separate than 
     <lb/>to create sectional jealousies and strife by 
     <lb/>the demand for an increased representation, 
     <lb/>and the religious cries associated with it. 
     <lb/>For my part, I have never, like some honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen of this House, attended and 
     <lb/>presided over that kind of political organi<lb break="no"/>zations known as conventions, not believing 
     <lb/>these to be the proper means of redressing 
     <lb/>the grievances under which the country 
     <lb/>labored. The effect of those conventions 
     <lb/>was to add fuel to the agitation which was 
     <lb/>already sundering the country. That such 
     <lb/>should be the result I deeply regret, inasmuch 
     <lb/>as some of the dearest friends I have in the 
     <lb/>world are not only Lower Canadians, but 
     <lb/>adherents of a different faith. The fruit 
     <lb/>of this sectional hostility and discord we now 
     <lb/>see in the demand which has sprung up for 
     <lb/>Federation with all its concomitant burdens. 
     <lb/>I can lay no blame to my conscience for 
     <lb/>having assisted to bring about so unnatural 
     <lb/>a state of things, and whatever may be the 
     <lb/>consequences of the new condition of politi<lb break="no"/>cal existence towards which we are appa<lb break="no"/>rently drifting, my skirts, I rejoice to say, 
     <lb/>are clear, for I have had no hand or part in 
     <lb/>it. We are told that if this scheme is car<lb break="no"/>ried out, Upper Canada will be entitled to the 
     <lb/>great advantage of having in the House of 
     <lb/>Commons of the Federal Government 17 
     <lb/>additional members. But what real advan<lb break="no"/>tage is this to be to the country ? Do we desire 
     <lb/>17 additional members for the purpose of 
     <lb/>crushing Lower Canada—is that what is 
     <lb/>meant? I answer, no. But even supposing we 
     <lb/>have 17 additional members—supposing re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population is conceded in the 
     <lb/>new order of things—what will be the gain 
     <lb/>to Upper Canada? Will these 17 new 
     <lb/>members cure the evils of which we 
     <lb/>complain ? Will they be able to reduce the 
     <lb/>excessive expenditures under which we are 
     <lb/>now laboring, and which have been one of 
     <lb/>the causes of the agitation for constitutional 
     <lb/>changes? I do not believe a word of it. 
     <lb/>Supposing Upper Canada has a larger repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by that number than Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, you must remember that Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, with the eastern provinces, is en<lb break="no"/>titled to 112 members ; so that Upper 
     <lb/>Canada would still be in a large minority of 
     <lb/>the whole House. My honorable friend the 
     <lb/>member for Niagara (Hon. Mr. CURRIE) has 
     <lb/>brought before the House a number of valu<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     able statistics bearing on this question, and 
     <lb/>
     I must say I deeply regret that the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Government sitting in this Chamber 
     <lb/>
     have not attempted to refute them. If 
     <lb/>
     these figures were wrong, they were easily 
     <lb/>
     susceptible of being so proved, especially 
     <lb/>
     by so able a gentleman as the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner of Crown Lands. But he has 
     <lb/>
     not attempted the task, inasmuch as he 
     <lb/>
     knows it would be a hopeless one. I hold in 
     <lb/>
     my hands a statement furnished by the 
     <lb/>
     Auditor General to the Minister of Finance, 
     <lb/>
     from which it appears that our debt amounts 
     <lb/>
     to $75,578,000, and deducting sinking fund 
     <lb/>
     and bankers' balances, 87,132,000, leaves 
     <lb/>
     a balance of 868,446,000 as the actual debt 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, to be borne by the people of this 
     <lb/>
     province under any scheme that can be con<lb break="no"/>cocted. If we assume that the cost of the 
     <lb/>
     International Railway will be $20,000,000 
     <lb/>
     —and from the experience afforded by the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk there is too much reason to 
     <lb/>
     fear it will be double that amount—the pro<lb break="no"/>portion which Upper Canada would have to 
     <lb/>
     bear would be $15,000,000, and this added 
     <lb/>
     to the already existing debt, would make our 
     <lb/>
     direct debt 883,446,000. This increase in 
     <lb/>
     our debt will be one of the fruits of Con<lb break="no"/>federation. But it may be said that the road 
     <lb/>
     will yield a revenue, though 'every member 
     <lb/>
     of the House who knows anything of rail<lb break="no"/>way statistics, and the character of the coun<lb break="no"/>try to be traversed by the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way, must know that this is impossible. 
     <lb/>
     My honorable friend from Toronto (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ross) when he issued his flaming pro<lb break="no"/>spectus to the capitalists of England fondly 
     <lb/>
     hoped that the Grand Trunk would pay 11 1/4 
     <lb/>
     per cent. on the investment. But we know 
     <lb/>
    how these expectations have been disap<lb break="no"/>pointed by the actual result, and so far from 
     <lb/>there being grounds to hope that the Inter 
     <lb/>colonial Railway will occupy a better position, 
     <lb/>there is too much reason to fear that it will 
     <lb/>.be still worse. Why, the cost of its main<lb break="no"/>tenance could hardly be less than $500,000 
     <lb/>per annum beyond all its receipts. How 
     <lb/>then could such a work be considered to be 
     <lb/>of benefit to the country?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>
—In the same way as the 
     <lb/>
     canals—by cheapening the cost of transport<lb break="no"/>ation.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIMP1">HON. Mr. SIMPSON</persName>—This is impossible. 
     <lb/>
     It costs two cents per ton per mile to move 
     <lb/>
     freight by rail, and as the distance from To<lb break="no"/>ronto to Halifax is 1168 miles, it would cost 
     <lb/>
     $2.23 per barrel to move flour from Toronto
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="233" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0233.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">233</fw>
            
     to that port ; while a barrel of flour can now 
     <lb/>
     be sent <hi rendition="simple:italic">via</hi> the St. Lawrence at 50 cents or 
     <lb/>
     under, and <hi rendition="simple:italic">via</hi> New York at 53 cents. Tak<lb break="no"/>ing another view of the scheme, in its finan<lb break="no"/>cial aspect, we find that Canada now con<lb break="no"/>tributes, in all forms, to the support of the 
     <lb/>
     General Government, over $10,000,000 per 
     <lb/>
     annum. No one will say that we shall be 
     <lb/>
     called upon to contribute less under Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. And if we add to this sum the in<lb break="no"/>terest, at five per cent., on the additional debt 
     <lb/>
     of $15,000,000 created by the proposed rail<lb break="no"/>way and the expense of two local govern<lb break="no"/>ments, assuming them to cost $1,000,000 
     <lb/>
     each, which is below the mark, with $1,000,<lb break="no"/>000 to be expended annually on the militia, 
     <lb/>
     as well as our share of maintaining and run<lb break="no"/>ning the railway, we will find that the people 
     <lb/>
     of the two Canadas will be called upon to 
     <lb/>
     contribute $14,200,000 annually, instead of 
     <lb/>
     the $10,000,000, as at present. And I would 
     <lb/>
     ask honorable gentlemen if the country is in 
     <lb/>
     a position to bear this additional burden ? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Really, looking at the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of expense, I am not sure whether I 
     <lb/>
     would not be in favor of returning to the 
     <lb/>
     primitive system of administering the affairs 
     <lb/>
     of the country—in preference to having this 
     <lb/>
     scheme—by a Governor in Council. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) For there is no question that our an<lb break="no"/>nual expenditure will be, under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, at least many millions more than at 
     <lb/>
     present, with the cost added thereto of main<lb break="no"/>taining and running the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way—a work which can never pay.

     <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—It was predicted

     when it was proposed to build the Rivière

     would never pay, but the fact is that for the

     last two years it has not only paid expenses, 
     <lb/>
     but has given a profit.

     respected friend, Mr. FREER, who was the

     lessee of that section during two or three 
     <lb/>
     years, told me that, while receiving a subsidy

     the free use of four engines, and with a

     all I can state is, that a premium was offered

     for the lease of the line, but the company 
     <lb/>
     determined to take possession of it.

     <persName ref="pers:SIMP1">HON. MR. SIMPSON</persName>
—But the real ques<lb break="no"/>tion is, what was the cost of original con<lb break="no"/>struction, the interest on that amount, and 
     <lb/>
     the  cost of maintenance ? Take these charges

     into account, and it would require a pretty

     large rental to cover them, much larger, I 
     <lb/>
     think, than any responsible person would

     offer for a lease of the line. As to the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway, we have no information

     from the government respecting the route

     to be followed or the length or cost of the

     The total length of road from Rivière du 
     <lb/>
     Loup is 548 miles ; add from Rivière du 
     <lb/>
     Loup to Quebec, 120 miles ; Quebec to Mont<lb break="no"/>real, 170 miles ; Montreal to Toronto, about 
     <lb/>
     330 miles ; so that we have a total of 1,168 
     <lb/>
     miles over which it is gravely proposed to 
     <lb/>
     send flour and other heavy produce during 
     <lb/>
     the winter months. (Hear, hear.) As has 
     <lb/>
     been already stated, before a barrel of flour 
     <lb/>
     could reach Halifax from Toronto, it would 
     <lb/>
     be nearly eaten up in expenses. [An honor<lb break="no"/>able member—There would be nothing 
     <lb/>
     left but the hoops. (Laughter).] It has 
     <lb/>
     been urged that under Confederation an 
     <lb/>
     active trade would spring up between Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the Maritime Provinces. A trade in 
     <lb/>
     what ? What have we to send them ex<lb break="no"/>cepting flour and the coarser grains ? The 
     <lb/>
     former, as has been shown, cannot be sent, 
     <lb/>
     and the latter they do not require. The 
     <lb/>
     principal articles of export from the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces are fish, timber and ships. We 
     <lb/>
     can take a moderate quantity of fish ; but 
     <lb/>
     our forests supply us with an abundance of 
     <lb/>
     timber, and the ship yards of Quebec turn 
     <lb/>
     out some of the finest sailing ships in the 
     <lb/>
     world. The true markets for the principal 
     <lb/>
     staples of export for these provinces are 
     <lb/>
     New York and Boston. Small vessels from 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="234" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0234.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">234</fw>
            
     thirty to fifty tons, laden with fish, run from 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces to these ports, 
     <lb/>
     where they dispose of their cargoes and 
     <lb/>
     purchase with the proceeds, corn meal, flour, 
     <lb/>
     pork, molasses and other necessaries. But 
     <lb/>
     it has been left for our Canadian statesmen 
     <lb/>
     to propose new political alliances in order 
     <lb/>
     to divert trade and commerce from their 
     <lb/>
     natural channels. It is yet further said in 
     <lb/>
     favor of Confederation that it will increase 
     <lb/>
     our power of defence. In the ordinary ac<lb break="no"/>ceptance of the term, union undoubtedly is 
     <lb/>
     strength; but there are cases in which 
     <lb/>
     union, instead of being a source of strength, 
     <lb/>
     is in reality an element of weakness. If we 
     <lb/>
     could attach the territory possessed by the 
     <lb/>
     moon to these provinces, and obtain the as<lb break="no"/>sistance for our joint defence of the man 
     <lb/>
     who is popularly supposed to inhabit that 
     <lb/>
     luminary, we might derive strength from 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation. (Laughter.) But al<lb break="no"/>though John Bull is accused of doing many 
     <lb/>
     foolish things, I am persuaded that the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country is far too wise to entrust 
     <lb/>
     the lives of her valuable soldiers when sent 
     <lb/>
     to our defence—as in case of need I feel 
     <lb/>
     well assured they would be—in passing over 
     <lb/>
     a road so liable to attack and so easy of 
     <lb/>
     destruction by our neighbors on the other 
     <lb/>
     side, should we unfortunately ever become 
     <lb/>
     involved with them in war, which I sincerely 
     <lb/>
     pray may never occur. (Hear, hear.) In 
     <lb/>
     conclusion I have simply to say that I cannot 
     <lb/>
     possibly vote for the scheme before the 
     <lb/>
    House, and thereby deprive the wealth and 
     <lb/>intelligent freeman, who have twice elected 
     <lb/>me unanimously, of a Constitution obtained 
     <lb/>by long years of struggle, without knowing 
     <lb/>what we have to offer them in its stead.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—Before the 
     <lb/>
     question is put, I have a few remarks to make 
     <lb/>
     on the general question, and particularly on 
     <lb/>
     the motion of amendment which is now before 
     <lb/>
     the House. I have copious notes which I 
     <lb/>
     will not refer to now, but which I will make 
     <lb/>
     use of at another stage of the debate. Ques<lb break="no"/>tions have been put to me by several members, 
     <lb/>
     which I will answer in due season; and ex<lb break="no"/>planations have been asked, which I hope also 
     <lb/>
     to be able to give. But, at present, my object 
     <lb/>
     is merely to make a few remarks in reference 
     <lb/>
     to the amendment which has been brought 
     <lb/>
    forward by my honorable friend from Wel<lb break="no"/>lington ( Hon. Mr. SANBORN). When the 
     <lb/>gentlemen who composed the onference met, 
     <lb/>they had to lay down a broad basis, as it were, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     for the foundation of their superstructure. 
     <lb/>
     Well, it so happened that the corner-stone 
     <lb/>
     was that which concerned the representation 
     <lb/>
     in both Houses. It was agreed on the one 
     <lb/>
     hand that in the House of Commons of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederate Government representation should 
     <lb/>
     be according to numbers, and that in the other 
     <lb/>
     branch of the Legislature it should be fixed 
     <lb/>
     that this representation should be equal for all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces—that is to say, Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada, and the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, grouped into one, should each be 
     <lb/>
     allowed to send the same number of represen<lb break="no"/>tatives, so as to secure to each province its 
     <lb/>
     rights, its privileges , and its liberties. We 
     <lb/>
     acted upon this principle, because we felt that 
     <lb/>
     if the House of Commons' representation was 
     <lb/>
     based upon population, equality should be 
     <lb/>
     secured in the other branch of the Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     My honorable friend from Wellington has 
     <lb/>
     gone over almost every detail of the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Federation, and he thought also he would try 
     <lb/>
     his hand a little at constitution-making, by 
     <lb/>
     improving that part which has particular 
     <lb/>
     reference to the Legislative Council. Well, 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen, I think the saying is 
     <lb/>
     pretty correct that it is easy to find fault, but 
     <lb/>
     it is not so easy to do better. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The honorable gentleman no doubt thought 
     <lb/>
     in his own mind that he was going to improve 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of the Conference, but I think he 
     <lb/>
     has made it so bad that I believe I can shew 
     <lb/>
     in the course of the few observations I have 
     <lb/>
     to offer, even if we had the power to make a<lb break="no"/>mendments, no member of this House either 
     <lb/>
     from Upper or Lower Canada would consent to 
     <lb/>
     them for a moment. I have just said the agree<lb break="no"/>ment was that there should be equality in the 
     <lb/>
     representation in the Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     But the honorable gentleman has moved that 
     <lb/>
     the elective members as they now stand should 
     <lb/>
     form the Legislative Council in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government, and that also the life members 
     <lb/>
     should continue for the remainder of their 
     <lb/>
     days; and, as a set-off against the life mem<lb break="no"/>bers, he proposes to allow the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     a certain number of new members who should 
     <lb/>
     have the right to sit in the Legislative Council 
     <lb/>
     of the Federal Government. But what does 
     <lb/>
     he do ? Does he preserve the proportion as 
     <lb/>
     laid down at the Convention ? Not a bit of 
     <lb/>
     it. The proportion agreed upon at the Con<lb break="no"/>vention was one-third to the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces; the Lower Provinces grouped together 
     <lb/>
     had a right to send one-third of the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives. The honorable gentleman, however, 
     <lb/>
     I suppose out of the fulness of his good dis<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="235" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0235.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">235</fw>
            
     position—I am sure it was not pressed upon 
     <lb/>
     him by the delegates from the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—comes forward and says, " I will give 
     <lb/>
     you ten members as a set-off against the 
     <lb/>
     twenty-one members who are now members 
     <lb/>
     for life in the Canadian Legislative Council." 
     <lb/>
     If I am not wrong in my arithmetic, ten are 
     <lb/>
     not a third of twenty-one. If the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman had given seven members to the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces as a set-off against the life 
     <lb/>
     members of this House he would have acted 
     <lb/>
     with strict justice, but he is generous enough 
     <lb/>
     to give them three more—ten, or nearly one half. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. Mr. SANBORN</persName>—Ten are nearer 
     <lb/>
     one third than the seven you propose.

            <p>
    <persName ref="pers:TACH1">Hon. Sir E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—I think the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman is wrong in his calcula<lb break="no"/>tion. I say we have 21 members sitting here 
     <lb/>
     for life, and if the other provinces are entitled 
     <lb/>
     to one-third of that number, it is clear to my 
     <lb/>
     mind that they would have a right to no 
     <lb/>
     more than seven. (Cries of "no, no," and 
     <lb/>
     "yes, yes") . 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—They are entitled

     to a third of the whole. Do you refer to the

     elective members ?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—The elective

     members are a fact accomplished. On the

     elective principle it is proposed to give a third 
     <lb/>
     of the members of the Legislative Council of 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Government to the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. But there are twenty-one life 
     <lb/>
     members of this House, and you want to give 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces an equivalent for them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—But not one-half.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">Hon. Sir. E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—You should

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">Hon. Mr. SANBORN</persName>—No, ten.

     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. Sir E. P. TACHÉ</persName> —We will have 
     <lb/>
     to get a schoolmaster. (Laughter.) If seven 
     <lb/>
     is not a third of twenty-one, I do not know 
     <lb/>
     what a third is. (Laughter.) I am not 
     <lb/>
     very fluent in speaking the English language, 
     <lb/>
     and when I am met right and left, behind 
     <lb/>
     and before, with interruptions like this, I 
     <lb/>
     assure you I feel it a hard trial, and if hon<lb break="no"/>arable gentlemen have remarks to make, I 
     <lb/>
     trust they will wait until I have delivered 
     <lb/>
     mine. (Hear, hear.) Well, honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, admitting that the third of twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     one are not seven - (laughter)—I say admit<lb break="no"/>ting, for the sake of argument, that ten are 
     <lb/>
     the third of twenty-one—(laughter)—I have 
     <lb/>
     another objection, and a very serious objection, 
     <lb/>
     which I do not think will advance very much 
     <lb/>
     the case of the honorable gentleman who has 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     moved this amendment. Many of us have 
     <lb/>
     been appointed for life in this House, and 
     <lb/>
     some of us were so appointed many years 
     <lb/>
     back. Here, for instance, is my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend on the left (Hon. Mr. HAMILTON) 
     <lb/>
     who has been a member of the House some 
     <lb/>
     twenty-four years—who was among the first 
     <lb/>
     appointed by Lord SYDENHAM ; and I see 
     <lb/>
     on the other side, honorable gentlemen also 
     <lb/>
     far advanced in years—men who, in the or<lb break="no"/>dinary course of life, cannot expect to be very 
     <lb/>
     long with us. Will the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     propose to give to the provinces below the 
     <lb/>
     right to appoint old gentlemen ? Not a bit of 
     <lb/>
     it. They would send here young men—men 
     <lb/>
     who are in the prime of life—and when we 
     <lb/>
     shall have gone to our last home, these 
     <lb/>
     young men from below will be found sitting 
     <lb/>
     in your places and in my place. Where, 
     <lb/>
     then, would be the equilibrium ? The equi<lb break="no"/>librium would be lost, and lost for ever. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     thinks that his amendment would be a great 
     <lb/>
     improvement to the scheme of the Conference. 
     <lb/>
     Well, for my part, honorable gentlemen, I 
     <lb/>
     believe it is a great failure in the way of im<lb break="no"/>proving the scheme of the Confederation— 
     <lb/>
     a very great failure indeed. The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has had the opportunity of speak<lb break="no"/>ing several times in this House, and very 
     <lb/>
     often he has made allusion to me since the 
     <lb/>
     opening of Parliament. He has endeavored 
     <lb/>
     to place me in contradiction to myself. He 
     <lb/>
     has stated that, in 1856, I was a member of 
     <lb/>
     the Government conducting the affairs of the 
     <lb/>
     House, and that I was the party who brought 
     <lb/>
     in the measure to extend the elective princi<lb break="no"/>ple to this honorable House, and he says that 
     <lb/>
    I am here again, nine ears later, endeavoring 
     <lb/>to destroy that which I had a hand in erect<lb break="no"/>ing so long ago as I have stated. But, hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen, I think that when I shall 
     <lb/>have explained the circumstances which then 
     <lb/>forced the Government to bring forward the 
     <lb/>measure to render this House elective, you 
     <lb/>will agree with me that it was not on account 
     <lb/>of any fancy or predilection on their part that 
     <lb/>the elective system was proposed, but that it 
     <lb/>was necessitated by the circumstances in 
     <lb/>which the country found itself placed. It is 
     <lb/>from no levity in the minds of the members 
     <lb/>of the Government, or in my own mind; nor 
     <lb/>is there any inconsistency in what I then did 
     <lb/>and in what I am now doing. But we will 
     <lb/>have something more on that point in the 
     <lb/>course of a few moments. The honorable 
     <lb/>gentleman, the other day, said we ought to 
     <lb/>speak freely on this subject, the measure 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="236" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0236.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">236</fw>
            
     being one of very great importance. He did 
     <lb/>
     speak freely himself, and gave expression to 
     <lb/>
     the fear that the Protestant English element 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada would be in danger if this 
     <lb/>
     measure should pass. He said as much as 
     <lb/>
     this, that in the Legislature of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     acts might be passed which would deprive 
     <lb/>
     religious educational institutions there of 
     <lb/>
     their rights, and even of their property. 
     <lb/>
     Another honorable gentleman, who spoke yes<lb break="no"/>terday , also gave expression to the fear that 
     <lb/>
     vested rights and privileges might be wrested 
     <lb/>
     from the hands of the English-speaking popu<lb break="no"/>lation of Lower Canada—that there was no<lb break="no"/>thing secure to them under the new Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. Well, the honorable gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     could see, in the future, such dreadful conse<lb break="no"/>quences flowing from this union, and who 
     <lb/>
     make such sinister predictions, must make 
     <lb/>
     them upon some <hi rendition="simple:italic">data</hi>. But I would ask hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen if since 1791, when the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution was given to Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     there is, in all the records of the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada, a single act to be found in 
     <lb/>
     which it can be shown that the Lower Canadians 
     <lb/>
     —the Papists of Lower Canada—ever attempt<lb break="no"/>ed to commit a single injustice towards their fel<lb break="no"/>low subjects of English origin professing the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant religion ? I say, honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, that the act is not to be found. But 
     <lb/>
     acts of generosity, acts of liberality, acts of 
     <lb/>
     tolerance are to be found everywhere. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) When you predict things of the future 
     <lb/>
     you ought to have at least an inch of ground 
     <lb/>
     to stand upon. You ought to be able to say 
     <lb/>
    that at such and such a time you did such 
     <lb/>and such unlawful acts. But I defy the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman to point to one such act. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) As it was well asked by my 
     <lb/>honorable friend, Sir NARCISSE F. BELLEAU,  
     <lb/>who was it that emancipated the Jews in 
     <lb/>1808 much earlier than they were emanci<lb break="no"/>pated in England ? Why, a Lower Canada 
     <lb/>House of Assembly. Who gave Protestant 
     <lb/>dissenters the right to keep records of mar<lb break="no"/>riages and burials ? Well, it was a French 
     <lb/>Canadian—a Papist—House of Assembly. 
     <lb/>And that House had a great deal of difficulty, 
     <lb/>and why ? Because they were opposed in 
     <lb/>the Legislature of Lower Canada by the 
     <lb/>Protestant English minority. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. MR. SANBOBN</persName>—Not by an elec<lb break="no"/>tive majority. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—Perhaps it is 
     <lb/>
     well that we have now responsible government, 
     <lb/>
     because responsible government is a cure for 
     <lb/>
     many evils. Well, the bill to give Protestant 
     <lb/>
     dissenters in Lower Canada certain rights was 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     opposed again and again in the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council of Lower Canada, and opposed by 
     <lb/>
     English Protestants. But this was no less a 
     <lb/>
     proof of the liberality of the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians. (Hear, hear.) The honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man behind me is not at all satisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     electoral divisions as they stand in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. He says there is no security what<lb break="no"/>ever afforded by them to the Protestant com<lb break="no"/>munity. But I wish that honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman had taken the trouble to look a little 
     <lb/>
     into the facts upon which he had based his 
     <lb/>
     conclusions in regard to these very electoral 
     <lb/>
     divisions. Honorable gentlemen, I feel warm 
     <lb/>
     on this subject. And why ? Because the 
     <lb/>
     limits of the counties in Lower Canada were 
     <lb/>
     devised by one of the most intelligent, upright 
     <lb/>
     and liberal men it has ever been my fortune 
     <lb/>
     to meet with. If a model of human per<lb break="no"/>fection can be found in Canada, it must be 
     <lb/>
     in the person of the honorable Judge MORIN. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Before laying his project be<lb break="no"/>fore the Executive Council, that gentleman 
     <lb/>
     did me the honor to consult me in the matter, 
     <lb/>
     and on two occasions I attended by appoint<lb break="no"/>ment at his office to advise with him on the 
     <lb/>
     details of his scheme. The divisions of the 
     <lb/>
     other branch of the Legislature were worked 
     <lb/>
     out so as to give our Protestant English fel<lb break="no"/>low subjects everything which could be con<lb break="no"/>sidered fair in every sense of the word. I 
     <lb/>
     say also that the same spirit was manifested 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the working out of the divisions 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislative Council. I assisted to 
     <lb/>
     work them out in conjunction with the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. CAUCHON, and I do assert here most 
     <lb/>
     solemnly that our whole trouble and study 
     <lb/>
     was to try and devise some means so as to 
     <lb/>
     give the English portion of the community 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada something like fair play. 
     <lb/>
     And when I am conscious of having done 
     <lb/>
     these things, I feel it comes hard on me to hear 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen say that there is no se<lb break="no"/>curity for them in the future, but that the 
     <lb/>
     French—the Papists—may do anything they 
     <lb/>
     choose in the lower branch of the Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     But, honorable gentlemen, if the lower branch 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislature were insensate enough and 
     <lb/>
     wicked enough to commit some flagrant act of 
     <lb/>
     injustice against the English Protestant por<lb break="no"/>tion of the community, they would be checked 
     <lb/>
     by the General Government. But the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman argues that that would raise 
     <lb/>
     an issue between the local and the general 
     <lb/>
     governments. We must not, however, for<lb break="no"/>get that the General Government is composed 
     <lb/>
    of representatives from all portions of the 
     <lb/>country— that they would not be likely to 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="237" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0237.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">237</fw>
            
     commit an unjust act—and that if they did 
     <lb/>
     so they would be met by such a storm of 
     <lb/>
     opposition as would sweep them out of their 
     <lb/>
     places in a very short time. But, honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, to come back to the electoral di<lb break="no"/>visions—I wish to look at them a little more 
     <lb/>
     closely, to show the results already produced. 
     <lb/>
     I will be obliged to make a comparison, but 
     <lb/>
     believe me, I do not wish to make invidious 
     <lb/>
      comparisons. When, however, honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen complain that they have no guarantee 
     <lb/>
     for the preservation of their rights and liber<lb break="no"/>ties, I act on the suggestion of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman and speak my mind freely. Now, 
     <lb/>
     how does the population of both Canadas 
     <lb/>
     stand in reference to religious creeds? We 
     <lb/>
     have in Upper Canada 1,396,090 souls, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the last census, and of that num<lb break="no"/>ber there are 258,141 Roman Catholics. I 
     <lb/>
     should like to know how many Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic representatives these 258,000 Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholics return to this House? I don't know 
     <lb/>
     one. I say that there are 258,000 Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics in Upper Canada who are not rep<lb break="no"/>resented by one of their own faith on the 
     <lb/>
     floor of this House—except, indeed, there 
     <lb/>
     are those of the Roman Catholic faith of 
     <lb/>
     whom I am not aware. (Laughter) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">HON. MR. CRAWFORD</persName> was understood 
     <lb/>
     to my in a jocose way that he was a Catholic. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">Hon. SIR E. P. TACHÊ</persName> said—No; you 
     <lb/>
     are an Orangeman—we have shaken hands 
     <lb/>
     together already, and I hope we may shake 
     <lb/>
     hands again, but when the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man says he is a Catholic, I fancy he must be 
     <lb/>
     joking. (Laughton) I wish, honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, for you to pay a little attention to 
     <lb/>what I am saying, because it is facts that 
     <lb/>always tell. A tree is known by its fruits, and 
     <lb/>it is the fruit I wish to place before this House 
     <lb/>and before the country. The total population 
     <lb/>In Lower Canada at the last census was 
     <lb/>1,110,000, and of these 942,7 24 were Roman 
     <lb/>Catholics, leaving of all other religious per<lb break="no"/>suasions, know-nothings, if any there are, 
     <lb/>heathens and other unbelievers, 167,940. 
     <lb/>That is to say, honorable gentlemen, that the 
     <lb/>Protestants in Lower Canada are less in num<lb break="no"/>ber than the Catholics in Upper Canada, by 
     <lb/>91,201. Here, then, we have Protestants in 
     <lb/>Lower Canada to the number of 167,000, and 
     <lb/>the question arises how are they represented 
     <lb/>in this House ? Well, they are represented 
     <lb/>by three members; besides, there are two other 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen from Lower Canada who 
     <lb/>have English names, but I really do not know 
     <lb/>Whether they are Protestants or Catholics. I 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     do however know, as I before stated, that 
     <lb/>
     there are three honorable gentlemen, Protes<lb break="no"/>tants, representing in this Council the 167,000 
     <lb/>
     Protestants of Lower Canada. The honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman by my side, who has moved 
     <lb/>
     these amendments, is one of them; an honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman who sits opposite to me is 
     <lb/>
     another, and an honorable gentleman who sits 
     <lb/>
     behind me, is the third; and there are two 
     <lb/>
     other honorable gentlemen with English names 
     <lb/>
     whom I do not know whether to classify as 
     <lb/>
     Protestants or Catholics. I therefore say that 
     <lb/>
     in comparing the representation of the two 
     <lb/>
     sections of the province, the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has no cause to complain. I have ever 
     <lb/>
     labored to secure to my fellow subjects of 
     <lb/>
     English origin, of the Protestant faith, in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, their rights and their liber<lb break="no"/>ties; and that my labors have not been in vein 
     <lb/>
     is proved by the fruits I have adduced. But 
     <lb/>
     that is not all.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—I speak of the 
     <lb/>
     elective members, because the argument has 
     <lb/>
     reference to the electoral divisions. Now let 
     <lb/>
     us look at the other branch of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture; and I assert that the principle has 
     <lb/>
     worked equally well there. There are 258,000 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics in Upper Canada represented 
     <lb/>
     in the other branch of the Legislature by only 
     <lb/>
     two Roman Catholics, and one of these, I am 
     <lb/>
     told, like my honorable friend opposite who 
     <lb/>
     has avowed himself a Roman Catholic, never 
     <lb/>
     goes to mass. (Laughter.) He is, however, 
     <lb/>
     a good Catholic, because he has an accom<lb break="no"/>plished and charming wife and most beautiful 
     <lb/>
     daughters, the whole of whom are zealous 
     <lb/>
     Christians and good Catholics, who go to 
     <lb/>
     church and confess regularly; so that I am 
     <lb/>
     bound to take the head of the family as a 
     <lb/>
     good Catholic also. (Laughter.) Then, how 
     <lb/>
     does the case stand for the Protestants in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada ? In Upper Canada we have 
     <lb/>
     just seen that 258,000 Catholics are repre<lb break="no"/>sented by just two members of their own faith 
     <lb/>
     in the lower branch of the Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     How are the 160,000 Protestants in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada represented ? Well, honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, they are represented by no less than 14 
     <lb/>
     members. (Hear, hear.) That is to say 
     <lb/>
     more by fifty per cent. than they would be 
     <lb/>
     entitled to according to strict rule of three. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I would ask are all these 
     <lb/>
     things more matters of accident ? Is it 
     <lb/>
     chance or Dame Fortune that brings about 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="238" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0238.jpg"/>
               <fw type="num">238</fw>
     all these things ? I believe not. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Causes invariably produce effects ; and they 
     <lb/>
     are the effects mainly—I do not say entirely— 
     <lb/>
     of the pains we have taken to give our fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     subjects of English origin the whole of their 
     <lb/>
     rights and fair play in every respect. The 
     <lb/>
     rest is due to French Canadian liberality. 
     <lb/>
     After stating these facts, I really do not think 
     <lb/>
    the honorable gentleman who represents the 
     <lb/>division of Wellington has much cause to 
     <lb/>complain. We judge of the tree, by its fruit, 
     <lb/>and the fruit I have endeavored to place be<lb break="no"/>fore you. If I have made any mistakes in 
     <lb/>my facts, I am ready to be corrected. But 
     <lb/>besides these 14 gentlemen representing the 
     <lb/>Protestant element in Lower Canada in the 
     <lb/>other branch of Legislature, I find three other 
     <lb/>English names, but whether they are Catho<lb break="no"/>lics or Protestants I cannot say, and therefore, 
     <lb/>not being certain of their creed, I have classed 
     <lb/>them as doubtful ; but added to the 14, they 
     <lb/>would make the number 17. I think all this 
     <lb/>is pretty good proof of the liberality and the 
     <lb/>spirit of justice of the Lower Canadians ; and 
     <lb/>if they have acted so for three quarters of a 
     <lb/>century, how is it to be supposed, now that 
     <lb/>they are about to form the majority again in 
     <lb/>the Lower Canada Legislature, they will all at 
     <lb/>once change their mode of acting, and become 
     <lb/>ready to tyrannize over and commit acts of 
     <lb/>injustice on their fellow-subjects of English 
     <lb/>origin in Lower Canada ? I do not believe 
     <lb/>it. I do not believe there is such a thing as 
     <lb/>vandalism in their minds, and I believe they 
     <lb/>are as ready as ever to render equal and im<lb break="no"/>partial justice to their fellow-men and fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>subjects. (Hear, hear.) I must now pass 
     <lb/>to another portion of my remarks.  Honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen say I was inconsistent in that at 
     <lb/>one time I erected a monument, and since then 
     <lb/>I have been trying to pull it down. Well, 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen, to understand how we 
     <lb/>stood in 1856 it is necessary we should take 
     <lb/>the history of the Legislative Council a little 
     <lb/>further back—from the time of its formation 
     <lb/>immediately after the union. We had not 
     <lb/>responsible government at the time of the 
     <lb/>union, but then it was that the whole system 
     <lb/>was put in practice. The first batch of coun<lb break="no"/>cillors were appointed in 1841, and were 25 
     <lb/>in number ; but two of them never attended. 
     <lb/>Out of these 25 there were 18 conservatives 
     <lb/>and five reformers. In 1842 seven new 
     <lb/>councillors were added, five conservatives and 
     <lb/>two reformers. In 1843 the Government 
     <lb/>changed, and the change made a little differ<lb break="no"/>ence in the political bearing of the appoint<lb break="no"/>ments, so that in 1843, there were appointed 
     <lb/>
         
<cb/>
         
     one conservative and five reformers. In 1844- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     45 there were two appointments—two re<lb break="no"/>formers. In 1846 there was one conservative. 
     <lb/>
     In 1847 there were four conservatives. There<lb break="no"/>fore, in 1848, when the Liberal Government 
     <lb/>
     came into power—the LAFONTAINE-BALDWIN 
     <lb/>
     Administration—the fact was that their parti<lb break="no"/>sans in the Legislative Council were fifteen 
     <lb/>
     less than the opposite party. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     What were the Reform Government to do ? 
     <lb/>
     They were forced to appoint a large batch 
     <lb/>
     this time. They appointed no less than 
     <lb/>
     twelve gentlemen. But still it left a majority 
     <lb/>
     to the conservative party of three. And if 
     <lb/>
     the conservatives had been true to themselves 
     <lb/>
     —and I wish to God they had been, and I 
     <lb/>
     will tell you, by and by, why—they could 
     <lb/>
     have prevented a good deal of trouble and a 
     <lb/>
     good deal of agitation in the country. Sup<lb break="no"/>posing that what is called the  Rebellion 
     <lb/>
     Losses Bill had not been passed in 1849, 
     <lb/>
     would the country have suffered a great deal 
     <lb/>
     from it ? But if the conservatives had been 
     <lb/>
     true to themselves they would have stopped 
     <lb/>
     the bill. It would have been discussed in 
     <lb/>
     all the public prints. The Montrealers would 
     <lb/>
     not have been entirely reconciled to the mea<lb break="no"/>sure, but they would have waived their opin<lb break="no"/>ions as dutiful subjects of the Queen, and we 
     <lb/>
     should not have witnessed the scandal we had 
     <lb/>
     in Montreal—the burning of the Parliament<lb break="no"/>ary buildings and the Representative of the 
     <lb/>
     Queen pelted with stones and almost murder<lb break="no"/>ed, followed by the annexation movement. 
     <lb/>
     But I say if the conservatives had resisted 
     <lb/>
     and just postponed the bill for another year, 
     <lb/>
     all this trouble might have been avoided. 
     <lb/>
     Now, honorable gentlemen, what was the 
     <lb/>
     spirit which actuated the appointments to the 
     <lb/>
     Council from 1841 to 1848 ? It was a spirit 
     <lb/>
     of partisanship, and where there is partisan<lb break="no"/>ship there can be no justice. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Where there is partisanship there can be no 
     <lb/>
     stability — you can depend upon nothing. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is only when justice is ren<lb break="no"/>dered to all parties that you can reckon upon 
     <lb/>
     stable and permanent governmental institu<lb break="no"/>tions. (Hear, hear.) To shew the difference 
     <lb/>
     between the spirit which actuated these nom<lb break="no"/>inations, from 1841 to 1847, and the spirit 
     <lb/>
     which exists now, it is only necessary to refer 
     <lb/>
    to the resolutions of the Conference. The 
     <lb/>fourteenth resolution says :

            <p>
     This shows you the spirit in which these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions were framed. Certainly the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who composed the Conference were, like our<lb break="no"/>selves, liable to err, but there is no doubt in 
     <lb/>
     my mind that they acted conscientiously from 
     <lb/>
     beginning to end. Well, honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     after the burning of the Parliament House in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal, the greatest possible excitement was 
     <lb/>
     created all over the province. Those who 
     <lb/>
     were most displeased at the passing of the 
     <lb/>
     Rebellion Losses Bill, condemned in the most 
     <lb/>
     violent terms the swamping, as they called it, 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislative Council, though after all it 
     <lb/>
     was nothing to be condemned, seeing that it 
     <lb/>
     simply, to some extent, re-established the 
     <lb/>
     equilibrium. But it was called, in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">furor</hi> 
     <lb/>
    of the moment, the disgraceful swamping of 
     <lb/>the Legislative Council, and there was great 
     <lb/>agitation all over the country. Well, by 
     <lb/>means of the press constantly hammering 
     <lb/>any upon what had been done by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and representing those who had 
     <lb/>been appointed as mere machines and tools 
     <lb/>of the Executive, although they were really 
     <lb/>among the most respectable and intelligent in 
     <lb/>Canada—but party passion does not reason— 
     <lb/>the people were led to believe that the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council had been disgraced by the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of these twelve additional members. 
     <lb/>But during the time that the conservatives 
     <lb/>were, on  hand, thus battering down 
     <lb/>the Legislative Council, what had we on the 
     <lb/>other hand? We had the old Reform party 
     <lb/>in Lower Canada beginning to recall their old 
     <lb/>hatred to the Legislative Council. Although 
     <lb/>there was no reason to complain after the 
     <lb/>introduction of responsible government, yet 
     <lb/>people followed not their reason but their pre<lb break="no"/>judice. So that the LegislativeCouncil re<lb break="no"/>ceived cross-fire from both sides. It was 
     <lb/>being battered down by public opinion on 
     <lb/>either hand, and what could it do ? Nothing, 
     <lb/>but come down lower and lower in public esti<lb break="no"/>mation. Although the consciences of the 
     <lb/>members reproached them nothing—although 
     <lb/>they could walk the streets with their heads 
     <lb/>erect, yet the Legislative Council had been so 
     <lb/>much reduced in public  opinion, that those 
     <lb/>gentlemen were really, I will not say ashamed 
     <lb/>but reluctant to attend their places. But, 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     by besides, they came not to receive remuneration 
     <lb/>
    or salary. From the time they were appointed 
     <lb/>in 1841, they sacrificed their time and their 
     <lb/>money, and gave their services gratuitously to 
     <lb/>the public ; and they were met, as I have 
     <lb/>already stated, by this universal deluge of 
     <lb/>abuse which was levelled against them. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) There was therefore no great en<lb break="no"/>couragement for them to attend in their 
     <lb/>in the Legislative Council. But what 
     <lb/>have we seen since? Session after session, 
     <lb/>day after day, week after week we saw the 
     <lb/>Speaker come into the Council with great 
     <lb/>pomp,  as the Speaker always does come into 
     <lb/>the Council—(hear, hear, and a laugh)—pre<lb break="no"/>ceded by the mace ; and after the Speaker 
     <lb/>had made his usual dutiful bow to the Throne, 
     <lb/>he would take his seat and remain quietly in 
     <lb/>the chair for the space of one hour. At the 
     <lb/>end of the hour, he would consult his watch, 
     <lb/>and saying there was no quorum present— 
     <lb/>although surely the quorum was a very small 
     <lb/>one, being ten members only—he would 
     <lb/>declare the House adjourned until the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It being six o'clock, the SPEAKER left the 
     <lb/>Chair.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p/>
   
            <p>
     After the dinner recess, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">Hon. SIR E. P. TACHÈ</persName> continued his 
     <lb/>
     remarks. He said—Honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     when the clock struck six, I was stating that, 
     <lb/>
     in one session after another, the SPEAKER of 
     <lb/>
     this honorable House had day after day to 
     <lb/>
     declare that there was no quorum, and the 
     <lb/>
     Government of the day had to employ all sorts 
     <lb/>
     of means to induce honorable gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     attend in their places. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">prestige</hi> of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council had gone, and the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, notwithstanding the offer to pay their 
     <lb/>
     expenses, &amp;c., remained at home, and the 
     <lb/>
     business of the country suffered very much. 
     <lb/>
     Towards the end of the session, we, could  
     <lb/>
     muster a few gentlemen. But they did not 
     <lb/>
     take much interest in the business of the 
     <lb/>
     country—in fact, they were disgusted with it, 
     <lb/>
     and they got through legislation at railroad 
     <lb/>
     speed. Under those circumstances, what had 
     <lb/>
     the Government to do? They were obliged 
     <lb/>
     to resort to some means to restore, if possible, 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">status</hi> and <hi rendition="simple:italic">prestige</hi> of this House. There 
     <lb/>
     was one unanimous cry on the subject from 
     <lb/>
     one end of Lower Canada to the other—both 
     <lb/>
     conservatives and reformers being as one in 
     <lb/>
     pointing to the elective principle as a cure for 
     <lb/>
     the state of things in which this province was 
     <lb/>
     placed; and the Government, in consequence, 
     <lb/>
     consulted with the English authorities with a 
     <lb/>
     view of obtaining leave to extend to this House 
  

            <pb n="240" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0240.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">240</fw>
           

     the elective principle. This was not, as I 
     <lb/>
     have stated already, because of any predilection 
     <lb/>
     on our part for the elective principle. It was 
     <lb/>
     not because we thought that the elective prin<lb break="no"/>ciple was much better than the stem of 
     <lb/>
     appointment by the Crown—at all events 
     <lb/>
     before the introduction of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Before that, the gentlemen who no<lb break="no"/>minated members of this House were respon<lb break="no"/>sible to no one. The appointments then were 
     <lb/>
     all made on one side. Even after the union, 
     <lb/>
     but before responsible government was estab<lb break="no"/>lished, or before it was put in a thoroughly 
     <lb/>
    tactical working state, the appointments had 
     <lb/>been made in a partial manner. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>And it is not surprising that we experienced 
     <lb/>the difficulties we did until that period. After 
     <lb/>the establishment of responsible government 
     <lb/>the position was very different—the resolutions 
     <lb/>of the 3rd September, 1841, having declared 
     <lb/>that no Government could be carried on except 
     <lb/>by heads of departments having the confidence 
     <lb/>of the representatives of the people in the 
     <lb/>lower branch of the Legislature. If, from 
     <lb/>that moment, bad appointments happened to 
     <lb/>be made to the Legislative Council, then the 
     <lb/>Government for the time being was responsible 
     <lb/>to the people for those apporntments. And, 
     <lb/>when the people wanted an elective Council at 
     <lb/>that time, they did not base the demand upon 
     <lb/>constitutional principles, but were led by their 
     <lb/>passions, which had been excited by their 
     <lb/>recollections of the past. They did not reason 
     <lb/>the thing out; and, in fact, the great majority 
     <lb/>of the people here, as everywhere else, are not 
     <lb/>able to reason out constitutional points—they 
     <lb/>are led by those who are at the head of the 
     <lb/>different parties. In saying this, I have no 
     <lb/>wish to be unjust to my countrymen. For 
     <lb/>even in countries like the United States, which 
     <lb/>boast much of their education, the immense 
     <lb/>mass of the people are led by prominent men. 
     <lb/>They do not reflect, they do not think for 
     <lb/>themselves—and so it was with our people. 
     <lb/>The Government for the time being were thus, 
     <lb/>by the force of circumstances, obliged to bring 
     <lb/>forward the measure for altering the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Legislative Council. The measure 
     <lb/>was passed by a pretty large majority ; and 
     <lb/>I think that until now the elective principle 
     <lb/>has worked remarkably well indeed, and that 
     <lb/>the electors have sent to this House gentlemen 
     <lb/>who would do honor to any deliberative body 
     <lb/>in the world—I care not where, whether in 
     <lb/>England, or on the continent of Europe, or in 
     <lb/>America. But difficulties have arisen since 
     <lb/>the passing of the Act of 1856, and the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the country came almost to a 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     dead-lock. Some remedy had to be found, 
     <lb/>
     and gentlemen of opposite parties wisely 
     <lb/>
     came together with the view of devising a 
     <lb/>
     plan which would not only cure our domestic 
     <lb/>
    difficulties, but give greater power and force 
     <lb/>to the British North American colonies. To 
     <lb/>bring this about we determined that we would 
     <lb/>endeavor to obtain a Federal union of all the 
     <lb/>British American Provinces. Delegates from 
     <lb/>below, and the gentlemen composing the Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of Canada met together. Some 
     <lb/>of us might have preferred still to retain the 
     <lb/>elective principle, but then we had to meet 
     <lb/>those gentlemen from below, and we had to 
     <lb/>give and take. We could not carry every<lb break="no"/>thing our own way. (Hear, hear.) The gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen from the Lower Provinces were op<lb break="no"/>posed to the elective principle, and went 
     <lb/>strongly for the system of appointments by 
     <lb/>the Crown. At the same time some among 
     <lb/>ourselves were not very much enamoured 
     <lb/>with the present system—(hear, hear)—and 
     <lb/>those who were anxious. to retain the elective 
     <lb/>principle, were obliged to yield. Thus, hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen, what is now proposed comes 
     <lb/>before you, not as the act of the Government 
     <lb/>of Canada— (hear, hear)—but as the mixed 
     <lb/>work of the delegates from all the provinces, 
     <lb/>in the form, as it were, of a treaty. I do 
     <lb/>not think, after the explanations I have given 
     <lb/>that I can be accused of a great deal of in<lb break="no"/>consistency, or of that levity which would 
     <lb/>make a man build up something to-day which 
     <lb/>he would be anxious to demolish to-morrow. 
     <lb/>No, honorable gentleman—but circumstances 
     <lb/>forced the Government in 1856 to bring on 
     <lb/>their measure for rendering this House elect<lb break="no"/>ive; and the circumstances of the country in 
     <lb/>1864 required that we should have recourse 
     <lb/>to some other means to put an end to the 
     <lb/>dead-lock in which the Province was placed. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I am sorry that I do net see 
     <lb/>the honorable gentleman from Grandville 
     <lb/>(Hon. Mr. LETELLIER) in his place. The 
     <lb/>Hon. Sir NARCISSE F. BELLEAU the other 
     <lb/>night made some remarks as to the difficulty 
     <lb/>of finding candidates for the Legislative 
     <lb/>Council. Now, for my own part, I should be 
     <lb/>exceedingly sorry to say anything that would 
     <lb/>wound the feeling of any one. And where 
     <lb/>could I look—before me, or behind me, or at 
     <lb/>my side—to find. any one against whom I 
     <lb/>could bring the least reproach? No—I re<lb break="no"/>peat it again—that those whom the elective 
     <lb/>principle has sent here are gentlemen who 
     <lb/>would come well with the members of any 
     <lb/>legislative body that could be mentioned. But 
     <lb/>then there are difficulties inherent to the 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="241" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0241.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">241</fw>
            
     working of the principle itself. I would es<lb break="no"/>pecially mention the difficulty which arises 
     <lb/>
     from the constituencies being so large. I 
     <lb/>
     know not whether this has been felt in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, but I know that it has been felt in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. Many of you, honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, have spent laborious days and 
     <lb/>
     laborious nights in canvassing these immense 
     <lb/>
     divisions, where sometimes the internal com<lb break="no"/>munications are exceedingly difficult. You 
     <lb/>
     know the wear and tear thus imposed on 
     <lb/>
     the human body, and that some gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     after canvassing these immense divisions, 
     <lb/>
     have found their graves in consequence of 
     <lb/>
     the exhaustion brought on by these efforts. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But, honorable gentlemen, it 
     <lb/>
     is not merely this tear and wear of the human 
     <lb/>
     constitution which you have had to encounter. 
     <lb/>
     This country, I need not say, is not very 
     <lb/>
     wealthy. In point of wealth it does not re<lb break="no"/>semble the Mother Country. There are gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen there with £200,000 or £300,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year, who think nothing of spending several 
     <lb/>
     thousand pounds, provided that by that ex<lb break="no"/>penditure they can put themselves in a con<lb break="no"/>spicuous position before the country. But 
     <lb/>
     here our fortunes are limited. That is the 
     <lb/>
     case in Lower Canada. I hope it is not so 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—It is worse 
     <lb/>
     there. (Laughter) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—Your fortunes 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada may be much greater than 
     <lb/>
     ours. (Cries of "no, no.") But I can tell 
     <lb/>
     you how it is generally among ourselves— 
     <lb/>
     speaking not so much for the district of Mon<lb break="no"/>treal as for the portion of the country in which 
     <lb/>
     I live myself, the district of Quebec. Where 
     <lb/>
     I reside, some forty or fifty miles below Que<lb break="no"/>bec, the fortunes are not very large, and the 
     <lb/>
     farmer who by his industry has been able 
     <lb/>
     to accumulate some £8,000 or £10,000 is a 
     <lb/>
    very wealthy) man. My honorable friend 
     <lb/>beside me ( Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL) suggests 
     <lb/>that it is the Ottawa gentlemen who are able 
     <lb/>to afford a contest. (Laughter.) If so, I 
     <lb/>tell honorable gentlemen that we cannot afford 
     <lb/>it below. It is but few whose fortunes reach 
     <lb/>£6,000 or £8,000—perhaps half a dozen in a 
     <lb/>large parish. It is true that some of our 
     <lb/>merchants in Lower Canada, by their in<lb break="no"/>dustry and aptitude in trade, have accumu<lb break="no"/>lated very handsome fortunes—but these are 
     <lb/>the  exceptions. Well, a man who, after fifteen 
     <lb/>or twenty years of hard labor, has accumulated 
     <lb/>£6,000 or £8,000 for his family, or for his 
     <lb/>old  age— knowing how a candidate is bled— 
     <lb/>(laughter)—is not very willing to go and 
     <lb/>
            
<cb/>
            
     spend half of it in an election. You cannot 
     <lb/>
     persuade such a man to come forward—but 
     <lb/>
     you may engage other parties who have not 
     <lb/>
     got much money to lose to do so. These men 
     <lb/>
     will be ready to promise a great deal, though 
     <lb/>
     they may not be able to fullfil their promises, 
     <lb/>
     an are thus more likely to be elected than 
     <lb/>
     those who have fortunes. My honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from Grandville, I think misapprehended the 
     <lb/>
     honorable Knight on his left (Hon. Sir N. F. 
     <lb/>
     BELLEAU,) when he understood him to speak 
     <lb/>
     slightingly of the talent of honorable members 
     <lb/>
     of this House. We have no aristocracy here 
     <lb/>
     in the sense of a family aristocracy, but we 
     <lb/>
     have an equally influential aristocracy, that of 
     <lb/>
     intellect. (Hear, hear.) And a man of 
     <lb/>
     intellect and education, though not a rich man, 
     <lb/>
     I consider is in every way worthy of respect, 
     <lb/>
     and would be a most desirable addition to this 
     <lb/>
     House. But, suppose we have a man of 
     <lb/>
     respectability, of education, and of intellect, 
     <lb/>
     and one who is highly esteemed by his neigh<lb break="no"/>bors—suppose he has a little fortune besides, 
     <lb/>
     he is not the worse man for that. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LETE1">HON. MR. LETELLIER DE ST. JUST</persName>— 
     <lb/>
     He is so much the better. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—But, as I was 
     <lb/>
     remarking, what I am afraid of is, that men 
     <lb/>
     who are well qualified for the position, after 
     <lb/>
     having gone through one or two elections, in 
     <lb/>
     which they have lost one-half, or two-thirds, 
     <lb/>
     or the whole of their fortune, are not likely to 
     <lb/>
     stand another contest, and we lose the happi<lb break="no"/>ness of meeting them here again. And I fear 
     <lb/>
     that the longer the elective system is continued, 
     <lb/>
     the greater would be the difficulty in that 
     <lb/>
     respect. Let us take a lesson from history, 
     <lb/>
     and from what goes on around us. I recol<lb break="no"/>lect that, in 1855, when on board the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canada</hi>, going to Europe, I made the 
     <lb/>
     acquaintance of some most respectable Amer<lb break="no"/>ican families, and particularly of a most in<lb break="no"/>teresting American woman. (Hear, hear, and 
     <lb/>
     laughter.) <hi rendition="simple:italic">Boni soit qui mal y pense</hi>. (Con<lb break="no"/>tinued laughter.) I met with a very inter<lb break="no"/>esting American woman, and, as she was con<lb break="no"/>versing with me and mentioning some very 
     <lb/>
     preposterous laws that had been passed in her 
     <lb/>
     state, I said—" Madame, have you not some 
     <lb/>
    people of good common sense and respecta<lb break="no"/>bility to oppose such absurd laws ?" She re<lb break="no"/>plied, " Sir, I am an American woman, and 
     <lb/>—I am ashamed to say it—the respectable 
     <lb/>people, the people of standing in our state, 
     <lb/>have no voice in the government of their 
     <lb/>country." (Hear, hear.) Many of you, 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen, are familiar with the 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="242" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0242.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">242</fw>
            
     state of things in the United States, which 
     <lb/>
     has resulted from carrying the elective prin<lb break="no"/>ciple too far ; and the fact that that principle, 
     <lb/>
     carried too far has worked much mischief, 
     <lb/>
     ought to place us on our guard. Some years 
     <lb/>
     ago, in Canada, there was quite a rage for the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle, and an agitation was got up 
     <lb/>
     with the view of rendering the judiciary 
     <lb/>
     elective. Well, a statesman of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, with whom I am well acquainted, and 
     <lb/>
     who now occupies a high position in that 
     <lb/>
     country, once remarked to me: " You have 
     <lb/>
     quite enough of the democratic element in 
     <lb/>
     your Constitution already, and, above all, do 
     <lb/>
     not make your judiciary elective, for that 
     <lb/>
     would be one of the greatest curses you could 
     <lb/>
     inflict on your country." (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     elective principle, kept within proper bounds, 
     <lb/>
     is very good indeed, and hitherto, no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     has worked well in this House. But I doubt 
     <lb/>
     whether, in the course of time, this House 
     <lb/>
     would not lose its present high <hi rendition="simple:italic">status</hi> if the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle was continued in it for ever. 
     <lb/>
     As regards this, however, I merely state 
     <lb/>
     my own opinion, and other honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men may hold contrary opinions, as they are 
     <lb/>
     perfectly entitled to do. (Hear, hear.) Hav<lb break="no"/>ing thus, honorable gentlemen, explained the 
     <lb/>
     reasons which induced the Government, in 
     <lb/>
     1856, to propose that the elective principle 
     <lb/>
     should be extended to this House, with the 
     <lb/>
     concomitant circumstances which assisted in 
     <lb/>
     bringing that about—and having also ex<lb break="no"/>plained the reasons which have induced the 
     <lb/>
     Government now to look for another state of 
     <lb/>
    political existence, as we may call it, by Con<lb break="no"/>ederation with the Maritime Provinces, I 
     <lb/>think I am clear from any imputation of 
     <lb/>inconsistency or levity of purpose. Before 
     <lb/>sitting down I have a personal explanation to 
     <lb/>make. When I speak, honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>I speak with sincerity, but, like any other 
     <lb/>man, I may commit a mistake. The moment, 
     <lb/>however, that I find I have committed a mis<lb break="no"/>take, I am ready to admit it, as any honest 
     <lb/>man should do. (Hear, hear.) I find that 
     <lb/>I took a wrong view of the proportions of ap<lb break="no"/>pointed members that were to be allotted to 
     <lb/>each province, in case the amendment of my 
     <lb/>honorable friend from the Wellington Divis<lb break="no"/>ion should pass. I have since been convinced 
     <lb/>that I was wrong, and that it was really car<lb break="no"/>rying out the principle of distribution .adopt<lb break="no"/>ed in the scheme, to allot to the Lower Prov<lb break="no"/>inces other ten members. I am glad to admit 
     <lb/>that my honorable friend was right in cor<lb break="no"/>recting me. But I still maintain that he was 
     <lb/>wrong—very wrong—in bartering old men 
     <lb/>
            
<cb/>
            
     for young ones, because, no doubt, the old 
     <lb/>
     men would soon disappear from their seats, 
     <lb/>
     while the young men from below would long 
     <lb/>
     retain their places, and we would thus destroy 
     <lb/>
     the equilibrium upon which the whole fabric 
     <lb/>
     of the proposed Constitution is based. I say 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman was wrong in that, 
     <lb/>
     and that, if his proposal were adopted, it 
     <lb/>
     would certainly be no improvement on the 
     <lb/>
     scheme as it has come from the Conference. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SKEA1">HON. Mr. SKEAD</persName> said—Honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, I claim the indulgence of the House 
     <lb/>
     for a few moments while I state from my point 
     <lb/>
     of view, as one of the representatives from 
     <lb/>
     Central Canada, the way in which I regard 
     <lb/>
     the measure now under consideration. I am 
     <lb/>
     an advocate of the union of the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces. (Hear, hear.) When I 
     <lb/>
     came here a few weeks ago, my mind was 
     <lb/>
     scarcely made up as to the course I should 
     <lb/>
     pursue. At the same time I was desirous of 
     <lb/>
     taking that course which should be approved 
     <lb/>
     by the majority of my constituents. In No<lb break="no"/>vember last I received the document which 
     <lb/>
     was sent to members of both Houses through<lb break="no"/>out the province; but as it was marked " Pri<lb break="no"/>vate," I felt bound by every consideration of 
     <lb/>
     propriety not to make it public. Having at 
     <lb/>
     that time been reelected by my constituents, 
     <lb/>
     I had no occasion to use it in connection with 
     <lb/>
     securing my return to this House. But, 
     <lb/>
     speaking of my reelection a few months ago, 
     <lb/>
     I may remark that a number of my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents felt disposed at that time to pledge me to 
     <lb/>
     oppose this union of the British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ican colonies. For my own part I felt it 
     <lb/>
     would be wrong for me to do so, not knowing 
     <lb/>
     what was the programme that was about to 
     <lb/>
     be laid; I refused, therefore, to give a pledge. 
     <lb/>
     Probably I felt more independent on account 
     <lb/>
     of there being no opposition. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     But be that as it may, I have the same de<lb break="no"/>sire to act in accordance with the deliberate 
     <lb/>
     views of my constituents as if I had canvassed 
     <lb/>
     every vote in the division. I pledged myself 
     <lb/>
     on the hustings on the day of my election, 
     <lb/>
     that as soon as the scheme was published. I 
     <lb/>
     would give it my earnest attention, and form 
     <lb/>
     a judgment upon it to the best of my ability. 
     <lb/>
     After the document was formally laid on the 
     <lb/>
     table of the House, I waited til1 it was put 
     <lb/>
     in type, and having ordered two thousand 
     <lb/>
     copies of it, I sent them, some fiteen days 
     <lb/>
     ago, to my constituents, with a circular call<lb break="no"/>ing upon them to state any objections they 
     <lb/>
     might have to the scheme if they con<lb break="no"/>sidered it objectionable, and to indicate what 


            <pb n="243" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0243.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">243</fw>
          

     course they wished me to pursue with re<lb break="no"/>ference to it. I am up to this evening with<lb break="no"/>out any answers to that circular, with one 
     <lb/>
     or two exceptions which I need not take up 
     <lb/>
     the time of the House by further alluding to. 
     <lb/>
     I now take it for granted, having given such 
     <lb/>
     an ample opportunity to my constituents to 
     <lb/>
     express their opinions, that I am at full liberty 
     <lb/>
     to pursue that course which I think myself 
     <lb/>
     to be for the interests of the country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) My feeling in the first instance was 
     <lb/>
     that the matter was being pressed too rapidly in 
     <lb/>
     this House—that we might have waited for a 
     <lb/>
     little—that we should have allowed the other 
     <lb/>
     House to go on and adopt the resolutions first, 
     <lb/>
     if they did adopt them, before we were called 
     <lb/>
     on to pronounce a final decision upon them. 
     <lb/>
     But I have somewhat changed my mind from 
     <lb/>
     hearing the able speeches of honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men both for and against the amendment 
     <lb/>
     now under the consideration of the House ; 
     <lb/>
     and I have come to the conclusion to give an 
     <lb/>
     independent vote, according to the best judg<lb break="no"/>ment I can form, since my constituents, after 
     <lb/>
     being invited to express their opinions, up to 
     <lb/>
     this hour have not responded to the request. I 
     <lb/>
     speak here as a representative of Central Can<lb break="no"/>ada, and particularly of the Ottawa country. 
     <lb/>
     The people there are engaged mainly in one 
     <lb/>
     trade, the lumber trade ; and, with reference to 
     <lb/>
     that trade, the promulgation of this scheme has 
     <lb/>
     caused us some feelings of apprehension, not 
     <lb/>
     to say gloom. Till within the last few hours, 
     <lb/>
     as late as yesterday, I was still in the dark 
     <lb/>
     as to the bearings of the scheme in that 
     <lb/>
     respect. But I have now had assurances from 
     <lb/>
     the Government—and particularly from one 
     <lb/>
     or two members of it—that the scheme is not 
     <lb/>
     going to inflict that injury upon the lumbering 
     <lb/>
     interest which we imagined. In fact the 
     <lb/>
     clause relating to that subject has been so ex<lb break="no"/>plained to me, that I am now perfectly satis<lb break="no"/>fied. (Hear, hear.) My feeling formerly 
     <lb/>
     was that our trade was treated in a manner 
     <lb/>
     which it did not deserve. Here we have a 
     <lb/>
     trade employing many thousands of people— 
     <lb/>
     employing a large amount of shipping to carry 
     <lb/>
     away the produce of our forests, which 
     <lb/>
     exceeds the amount of the exported agricul<lb break="no"/>tural produce of the country by a value of 
     <lb/>
     some two millions of dollars. We naturally 
     <lb/>
     felt that such a trade had some right to be 
     <lb/>
     considered. (Hear, hear.) However, accept<lb break="no"/>ing the assurances of honorable gentlemen, in 
     <lb/>
     whom I have the utmost confidence, who 
     <lb/>
     compose the present Government, I am now 
     <lb/>
     quite prepared, as one of the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the Ottawa section of country, to leave that 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     matter in their hands. A great deal has been 
     <lb/>
     said in this debate on the general question of 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation of these provinces, and as 
     <lb/>
     to that I shall say but little. As I have already 
     <lb/>
     stated, I am an advocate of union. I would 
     <lb/>
     even say that the scheme of the delegates to the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Confererence does not go far enough. 
     <lb/>
     I contend that, instead of merely taking in 
     <lb/>
     the provinces to the east of us, the scheme 
     <lb/>
     should have embraced British Columbia and 
     <lb/>
     the whole of the territory to the west. An 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend near me says that will come 
     <lb/>
     in good time. But I am afraid that some 
     <lb/>
     Downing-street or other influence may prevent 
     <lb/>
     it. (Cries of "no, no !") I should like to 
     <lb/>
     see the Pacific as the western boundary of this 
     <lb/>
     young Confederation, in the same way as the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic is its eastern limit, so that we should 
     <lb/>
     have one country stretching from ocean to 
     <lb/>
     ocean. (Hear, hear.) A great deal has been 
     <lb/>
     said in this debate on the subject of railways. 
     <lb/>
     Honorable gentlemen have spoken of the cost 
     <lb/>
     of building our railways, of the damage the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk has done, and of the profits 
     <lb/>
     certain gentlemen have made out of it. For 
     <lb/>
     the life of me, I cannot see the force of their 
     <lb/>
     arguments. True, the Grand Trunk has cost 
     <lb/>
     a great deal of money, but how should we 
     <lb/>
     feel if we had to go back to the state of 
     <lb/>
     things which existed when we had no railroad? 
     <lb/>
     What should we do if the Grand Trunk were 
     <lb/>
     now taken from us ? I believe we could not 
     <lb/>
     do without it. It has become a necessity. 
     <lb/>
     Every man within the range of its influence, 
     <lb/>
     has had his land enhanced in value—and the 
     <lb/>
     debt of $15,000,000 or $16,000,000, while of 
     <lb/>
     course in itself a great deal of money, is noth<lb break="no"/>ing when we reflect on the ability of the prov<lb break="no"/>inces to bear it. If spared to continue here dur<lb break="no"/>ing my term of eight years, I shall still advo<lb break="no"/>cate the Intercolonial Railway as a line neces<lb break="no"/>sary to connect us with the seaboard. It will 
     <lb/>
     cost us some little money no doubt, but it will 
     <lb/>
    yield us compensating advantages. There are 
     <lb/>large forests to the east of us, which have 
     <lb/>still to yield up their wealth, and no one can 
     <lb/>tell how much may come out of that country, 
     <lb/>when its resources are developed. The subsidy 
     <lb/>we are now paying the ocean steamships will 
     <lb/>go a good way to pay the interest on our share 
     <lb/>of the cost of the railway. Besides we 
     <lb/>are new spending a great deal of money to 
     <lb/>bring population into these provinces—an 
     <lb/>object that will be promoted to a large extent 
     <lb/>by the building of that road. To build it 
     <lb/>will take some four or five years, and we can<lb break="no"/>not tell how much that section of the country 
     <lb/>will be settled in that time. It will no doubt 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="244" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0244.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">244</fw>
            
     prove of great advantage to us. We shall 
     <lb/>
     then be ready, I hope, to commence the rail<lb break="no"/>road to British Columbia, and the improve<lb break="no"/>ment of the Ottawa river to the upper lakes— 
     <lb/>
     (hear, hear)—and the navvies and others who 
     <lb/>
     have been employed on these works will find 
     <lb/>
     employment on the road-leading to the Pacific, 
     <lb/>
     and will ultimately become settlers in the 
     <lb/>
     great Red River country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Such are my sentiments in connection with 
     <lb/>
     the subject now before the House. My ex<lb break="no"/>perience may not have been as great as that 
     <lb/>
     of some honorable members, but I have been 
     <lb/>
     in the habit of observing what was going on 
     <lb/>
     around me, and I have come to the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that the union of these provinces is desirable 
     <lb/>
     and necessary. (Hear, hear.) It has been 
     <lb/>
     said that the gentlemen forming the present 
     <lb/>
     Ministry have held such opposite opinions 
     <lb/>
     that no good can be expected to result from 
     <lb/>
     their coalition. I have not such a poor opinion 
     <lb/>
     of human nature as to feel disposed to question 
     <lb/>
     in any way the sincerity and patriotism of 
     <lb/>
     those honorable gentlemen. The have seen 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of some change being brought 
     <lb/>
     about, if the good of the country was to be 
     <lb/>
     promoted. Whatever may have been the 
     <lb/>
     antagonism of their views formerly, they now 
     <lb/>
     occupy the same wigwam, and, it is said, the 
     <lb/>
     same blanket covers them—(laughter)—and, 
     <lb/>
     so long as the country receives the benefit, I 
     <lb/>
     am satisfied to support them, no matter what 
     <lb/>
     their politics may have been during the last 
     <lb/>
     twenty years. (Hear, hear.) No doubt the 
     <lb/>
     country has been suffering—a cure had to be 
     <lb/>
     found, and I think we are now on the highway 
     <lb/>
     to get it. (Hear, hear.) Honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men composing the Government will permit 
     <lb/>
     me to repeat that our lumber trade deserves 
     <lb/>
     their earnest and best attention on account of 
     <lb/>
     the employment it gives to so large a number 
     <lb/>
     of persons, the way in which it swells the 
     <lb/>
     exports of the country,  the market it affords 
     <lb/>
      for the produce of the agricultural portion of 
     <lb/>
     the community, and the manner in which it 
     <lb/>
     forwards the settlement of our wild lands. 
     <lb/>
     To the Ottawa district it is, of course, of 
     <lb/>
     special importance, but it has an interest for 
     <lb/>
     the whole province, inasmuch as it makes for 
     <lb/>
     us a back country. A country that is all 
     <lb/>
     frontier must always be a little country. 
     <lb/>
    (Hear, hear.) If a check is in any way put  
     <lb/>upon the lumber trade, as the consequence of 
     <lb/>its being placed under the separate control of 
     <lb/>each local government, it would be a result 
     <lb/>much to be regretted. But it is to be hoped 
     <lb/>that the Government will give this matter 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     their most earnest consideration, and that they 
     <lb/>
    will do what in their opinion is best for the 
     <lb/>interests of all concerned. It has been said by 
     <lb/>some in our section that Central Canada is to 
     <lb/>be made the footstool of Upper Canada, and 
     <lb/>that it is also to be made the footstool of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada. For my own part I am quite 
     <lb/>unable to see how we can be made the foot<lb break="no"/>stool of both. (Hear, hear.) That was the 
     <lb/>idea expressed in a letter sent me the other 
     <lb/>day, begging me to give the scheme all the 
     <lb/>opposition in my power. It may be true that 
     <lb/>the western part of the province is a little 
     <lb/>covetous, and a little ambitious of controlling  
     <lb/>everything ; still, I have that faith in the 
     <lb/>good feeling of the western people, and in our 
     <lb/>ability to protect ourselves, that I do not be<lb break="no"/>lieve our lumbering interest is to be destroyed 
     <lb/>all at once, even though the Local Government 
     <lb/>of Upper Canada should have its seat in To<lb break="no"/>ronto. Whoever may compose the Local Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, I think they must see the import<lb break="no"/>ance of the lumber trade, and will do what 
     <lb/>they can to foster and encourage that which 
     <lb/>is essential to the good of the whole country. 
     <lb/>I do not believe they will adopt the policy of 
     <lb/>killing the goose that lays the golden egg. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I see there is a disposition to 
     <lb/>have the vote taken, and I will not detain the 
     <lb/>House longer. (Cries of " go on.") I have 
     <lb/>only this to say in conclusion, that when these 
     <lb/>scattered provinces are united together, as is 
     <lb/>now proposed, and when the bond of that 
     <lb/>union has been sealed with the great Imperial 
     <lb/>seal of Great Britain—with the blessing and 
     <lb/>favor of an all-ruling Providence—I, for one, 
     <lb/>have no fear of the result. (Cheers) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. MR. SANBORN</persName> said—I desire, be<lb break="no"/>fore the vote is taken, to offer a single explan<lb break="no"/>ation. The Honorable Premier ( Hon. Sir E. 
     <lb/>
     P. TACHE) attributed to me certain remarks 
     <lb/>
     on which he based the early portion of his 
     <lb/>
     speech. He said I complained of the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment of the electoral divisions in Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada. I made no such complaint. I made no 
     <lb/>
     allusion to that. What I had reference to 
     <lb/>
     was the appointment of Legislative Council<lb break="no"/>lors for divisions, and their having property 
     <lb/>
     qualifications in those divisions. I am sure 
     <lb/>
     the Honorable Premier did not desire to at<lb break="no"/>tribute to me anything I did not say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—If my honora<lb break="no"/>ble friend says he did not use the argument, 
     <lb/>
     of course my remarks upon it go for nothing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. MR. SANBORN</persName> —Another point, 
     <lb/>
     too, I may notice. The Honorable Premier 
     <lb/>
    based his argument on my having drawn a<lb/>
       

            <pb n="245" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-16_Page_0245.jpg"/>
               <fw type="num">245</fw>
         

     distinction between Papists and Protestants. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I never used the terms "Papist," or 
     <lb/>
     " Catholic," or " Protestant." (Hear, hear) 
     <lb/>
     The distinction I drew, and the remarks I 
     <lb/>
     made, were with regard to the English and 
     <lb/>
     the French of Lower Canada. And honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen will remember that I distinctly ad<lb break="no"/>mitted what the Premier had claimed for his 
     <lb/>
     countrymen—namely, their well-known liber<lb break="no"/>ality. I have always admitted that, and have 
     <lb/>
     never had any disposition to deny it. But 
     <lb/>
     my argument was that, in establishing a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, our rights and interests should be 
     <lb/>
     protected by distinct provisions in that Con<lb break="no"/>stitution—that these would form the only 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory assurance we could get—that we 
     <lb/>
     could not rest upon the liberality of any class 
     <lb/>
     of men, but must have the assurance of dis<lb break="no"/>tinct guarantees. That was the line of argu<lb break="no"/>ment pursued. (Hear, hear.) I do not 
     <lb/>
     think the Premier should have been so hard 
     <lb/>
     upon me for not stipulating that the ten men 
     <lb/>
     who should, be chosen in the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should be old men, so that they might 
     <lb/>
     not have the advantage of putting in young 
     <lb/>
     men as an offset to our old ones. When I 
     <lb/>
     see, in the case of the Premier himself, at 
     <lb/>
     his advanced years, the youthful fire burn 
     <lb/>
     up so brightly, and that age does not at all 
     <lb/>
     detract from the vigor he manifests, I think 
     <lb/>
     he must excuse me for not having made 
     <lb/>
     an invidious distinction between old men and 
     <lb/>
     young ones. (Hear, hear, and laughter.)

     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">HONl. MR. WILSON</persName> begged to state that

            <!-- TY, 2017-07-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day --> 
     <!--<p>HON. MR. DORION, in resuming the 
     <lb/>
     adjourned debate on Confederation, said— 
     <lb/>
     I should have desired to make my remarks 
     <lb/>
     to the House in French, but considering the 
     <lb/>
     large number of honorable members who are 
     <lb/>
     not familiar with that language, I think it 
     <lb/>
     my duty to speak at the present time in 
     <lb/>
     English. In rising on this occasion to ad<lb break="no"/>dress the House on the important question 
     <lb/>
     submitted to us, I must say I do so with an 
     <lb/>
     unusual degree of embarrassment, not only 
     <lb/>
     on account of the importance of the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of our deliberations, but also because I 
     <lb/>
     have to differ from many of those with whom 
     <lb/>
     I have been in the habit of acting ever since 
     <lb/>
     I first entered into political life. Yet, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, when I consider the questions 
     <lb/>
     raised by the resolutions submitted by the 
     <lb/>
     Government, I find that whether they be 
     <lb/>
     purely political ones, such as the proposal to 
     <lb/>
     restrict the influence and control of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple over the Legislature of the country by 
     <lb/>
     substituting a Chamber nominated by the 
     <lb/>
     Crown for an Elective Legislative Council, or 
     <lb/>
     whether they are purely commercial in their 
     <lb/>
     character, such as that regarding the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, or the larger question of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation itself, I still hold the same 
     <lb/>
     views that I held, in common with others 
     <lb/>
     who have now changed their opinions, when 
     <lb/>
     the subjects were first mooted. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And as I have not heard, since the first 
     <lb/>
     opening of this debate, any reason for sub<lb break="no"/>stituting a nominated for an elective Upper 
     <lb/>
     Chamber that was not fully argued out in 
     <lb/>
     1856, when, by an overwhelming majority 
     <lb/>
     of this House, it was decided that the ele<lb break="no"/>tive principle should prevail—as I have 
     <lb/>
     not heard any reason why we should pledge 
     <lb/>
     our credit and resources to the construction 
     <lb/>
     of the Intercolonial Railway, even previous 
     <lb/>
     to any estimate of its cost being made, that 
     <lb/>
     was not urged in 1862 when the question was 
     <lb/>
     before the country—nor any reason for inter<lb break="no"/>colonial union that was not raised in 1858, 
     <lb/>
     when the present Hon. Finance Minister 
     <lb/>
    pressed the question on the attention of the 
     <lb/>Imperial authorities—I do not see on what 
     <lb/>ground these several subjects which were 
     <lb/>then so unpopular, and those views which 
     <lb/>were then most universally repudiated, 
     <lb/>should now be more favorably considered by 
     <lb/>the people of this country—I fail to perceive 
     <lb/>why those once unpalatable measures, now 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
