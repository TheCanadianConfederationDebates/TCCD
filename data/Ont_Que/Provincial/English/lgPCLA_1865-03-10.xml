     ponsibility that attaches to the vote I will 
     <lb/>
     shortly be called upon to give. I have 
     <lb/>
     weighed well this matter, and taking all 
     <lb/>
     things into account, I can arrive at no other 
     <lb/>
     conclusion than that it is my duty to vote 
     <lb/>
     for the resolutions in your hands, and I am 
     <lb/>
     now prepared to do so, believing that I am 
     <lb/>

     On the Order, for resuming the debate 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> rose to a point of 
     <lb/>
     order, objecting that the "previous question" 
     <lb/>
     was in the nature of an amendment, and that 
     <lb/>
     no member could move an amendment to his 
     <lb/>
     own motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After some discussion, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">MR. SPEAKER</persName> decided as follows:—<lb/>
     " The original motion, made by the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General for Upper Canada, is that 
     <lb/>
     the House should concur in certain resolu<lb break="no"/>tions relating to a Federal union of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Debate having arisen thereon, 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Attorney General for Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada moves, not in amendment in my Opinion, 
     <lb/>
     ' that that question be now put.' The sub<lb break="no"/>stance of   an amendment is to alter the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal question. Does this motion alter the 
     <lb/>
     original question? So far from that, it is a 
     <lb/>
     proposal to bring that question before the 
     <lb/>
     House for immediate decision. The autho<lb break="no"/>rities cited to show that this motion is an 
     <lb/>
     amendment sustain the contrary view in my 
     <lb/>
     judgment, because they only state that the 
     <lb/>
     previous question is 'in the nature of an 
     <lb/>
     amendment.' If it were really an amend<lb break="no"/>
            
     <cb/>
            
     ment, or were to be used as an amendment 
     <lb/>
     it would be stated that it was in fact an 
     <lb/>
     amendment. The motion to adjourn is also 
     <lb/>
     spoken of as being in the nature of an amend<lb break="no"/>ment, but it is not an amendment, and like 
     <lb/>
     'The previous question,' does not displace 
     <lb/>
     the original proposition, if carried. Hence 
     <lb/>
     I conclude that 'The previous question' is 
     <lb/>
     not an amendment. The objection that the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General for Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     cannot move it, on account of having pro<lb break="no"/>posed the original motion, in my opinion is 
     <lb/>
     not valid."

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TASC1">Mr. TASCHEREAU</persName> said—It is not 
     <lb/>
     without hesitation, Mr. SPEAKER, that I 
     <lb/>
     rise at this late period of the debate to offer 
     <lb/>
     a few observations on the measure before 
     <lb/>
     us—the plan of Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     British North American Provinces; and my 
     <lb/>
     hesitation is the greater that I am under the 
     <lb/>
     necessity, not only of speaking on a question 
     <lb/>
     which has been so long and skilfully dis-   
     <lb/>
     cussed, that it would appear almost impos<lb break="no"/>sible to say anything which may interest hon. 
     <lb/>
     members, but also and more especially that 
     <lb/>
     after long and deliberate consideration—after 
     <lb/>
     carefully weighing the gist and tendency of 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions, and tracing out the effects 
     <lb/>
     which cannot fail, I believe, to result from 
     <lb/>
     the measure of which they are the exponents<lb break="no"/>I feel myself bound, Mr. SPEAKER, to aban<lb break="no"/>don, on this question, those with whom I 
     <lb/>
     have always acted hitherto, to differ in 
     <lb/>
     opinion from those whose talents and judg<lb break="no"/>ment I have never ceased to admire, and to 
     <lb/>
     record my vote against the new Constitution 
     <lb/>
     which is proposed to us in these resolutions.

     Hear ! hear ! from the left.) It could not 
     <lb/>
     fail to be to me a particular cause of regret 
     <lb/>
     that I felt compelled to come to this con<lb break="no"/>clusion. I could not understand that this 
     <lb/>
     measure was a simple party matter—one of 
     <lb/>
     those questions on which those party feelings 
     <lb/>
     which have prevailed in Canada so many 
     <lb/>
     years ought to influence any body. I could 
     <lb/>
     not conceive how, in considering a question 
     <lb/>
     which, in my opinion, imperils all that we 
     <lb/>
     hold most dear, and opens to us, if it is 
     <lb/>
     carried, the prospect of a future, dark with 
     <lb/>
     clouds, portending evil not only to us Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, but perhaps no less to all British 
     <lb/>
     North America—I could not conceive, I say, 
     <lb/>
     how I could be unmindful of my convictions, 
     <lb/>
     and lay aside my fears and the sense of duty 
     <lb/>
     which binds me here, to yield blind obedience 
     <lb/>
     and submission to the influence of political 
     <lb/>
     party. I thought myself at liberty to think 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="894" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0894.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">894</fw>
           
     for myself, even on so important a question; 
     <lb/>
     and I am persuaded that if there are 
     <lb/>
     members of this House who consider 
     <lb/>
     themselves authorized to doubt the sanity 
     <lb/>
     of those who do not always think as they 
     <lb/>
     do, they are not in a majority here. 
     <lb/>
     For my own part, Mr. SPEAKER, I re<lb break="no"/>spect every man's opinion. I am willing 
     <lb/>
     to allow all who are so disposed to think 
     <lb/>
     diflerently from me, and do not, on that 
     <lb/>
     account, hold them to be either prejudiced 
     <lb/>
     or dishonest; on the contrary, I am willing 
     <lb/>
     to believe that they act according to their 
     <lb/>
     convictions, and with perfect good faith. I 
     <lb/>
     desire that others will judge me in the same 
     <lb/>
     manner, and that those from whom I am 
     <lb/>
     now dissentient on the subject of the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions in your hand, Mr. SPEAKER, will 
     <lb/>
     believe, at least, that I too am acting in this 
     <lb/>
     matter according to my honest convictions 
     <lb/>
     and with good faith; that I, too, am anima<lb break="no"/>ted by love for my country and my nation<lb break="no"/>ality ; that I, too, have at heart the 
     <lb/>
     preservation of that nationality and those 
     <lb/>
     institutions which have been transmitted to 
     <lb/>
     us by our fathers, as the reward of so many 
     <lb/>
     struggles and sacrifices. (Hear, hear.) At 
     <lb/>
     this advanced stage of the debate, it is not 
     <lb/>
     my intention to combat or discuss all the 
     <lb/>
     arguments which have been urged in favor 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation. I must, however, observe 
     <lb/>
     that I have not been convinced by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     . gentlemen who have spoken before me, that 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution oflered to us embodies 
     <lb/>
    guarantees sufficient to protect our rights. 
     <lb/>I am of opinion, therefore, that the vote 
     <lb/>which I shall give against Confederation 
     <lb/>would be given by a large majority of my 
     <lb/>constituents, and a large majority of the 
     <lb/>people of Lower Canada ; and my opinion 
     <lb/>on this subject is so firmly grounded, that I 
     <lb/>should despise myself if, for the sake of not 
     <lb/>separating from my party, I were to vote for 
     <lb/>Confederation, my convictions being so strong 
     <lb/>and so sincere. (Hear, hear.) We were taught 
     <lb/>to believe, till within the last two or three 
     <lb/>days, that the most ample discussion of the 
     <lb/>question would be allowed ; but, by the moving 
     <lb/>of the previous question, the face of things 
     <lb/>has undergone a change. This House, and all 
     <lb/>Lower Canada, supposed that before being 
     <lb/>called upon to vote on the main question, we 
     <lb/>should have had an opportunity of obtaining 
     <lb/>an expression of the opinion of the people. 
     <lb/>I am persuaded that if, after a full and 
     <lb/>complete discussion of the measure in this 
     <lb/>House, the people were called upon for their 
     <lb/>
           <cb/>
               opinion, they would be more decidedly 
     <lb/>opposed to Confederation than they ever 
     <lb/>were to any measure. (Hear.) Unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately, as the previous question has been 
     <lb/>moved, we must vote on the resolutions as 
     <lb/>they stand, without being able even to move 
     <lb/>amendments which might render them less 
     <lb/>objectionable to the country. I now come 
     <lb/>to the appeal to the people. Well, I main<lb break="no"/>tain that in voting to change the constitution 
     <lb/>of the Government, without consulting the 
     <lb/>people on the subject, the members of this 
     <lb/>House are exceeding their powers ; and that 
     <lb/>even if the people were in favor of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, they ought not to pass it, as they 
     <lb/>are now about to do, without special authority. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) The hon. member for South 
     <lb/>Lanark (Mr. MORRIS) has told us that this 
     <lb/>is no new question—that it has been for a 
     <lb/>long time a subject of discussion—that the 
     <lb/>people understood it thoroughly, and that 
     <lb/>the members of this House were privileged 
     <lb/>to vote on it without referring it to their 
     <lb/>constituents. I am quite aware that much 
     <lb/>has been written on the subject of the 
     <lb/>Confederation of the provinces ; but has the 
     <lb/>question ever been discussed before the 
     <lb/>people at elections? I am fully convinced 
     <lb/>and perfectly certain this question was never 
     <lb/>brought up at any election, nor the question 
     <lb/>of any Confederation at all. It has never 
     <lb/>been laid before the people, and the people 
     <lb/>have never expressed an opinion on the 
     <lb/>subject. (Hear, hear.) It appears to me 
     <lb/>that the amendment which is to be moved 
     <lb/>by the hon. member for Peel (Hon. J. 
     <lb/>H. CAMERON), after the present resolutions 
     <lb/>have been voted by the House, will be in a 
     <lb/>singular position. (Hear, hear.) I have 
     <lb/>understood the explanations given by the 
     <lb/>Honorable Attorney General for Upper 
     <lb/>Canada (Hon. J. A. MAODONALD), re<lb break="no"/>lative to the resolution of the honorable 
     <lb/>member for Peel—that the resolutions before 
     <lb/>the House would be passed first, and that 
     <lb/>afterwards, when the House went into com<lb break="no"/>mittee, the hon. member for Peel would 
     <lb/>move his amendment, namely, " that the 
     <lb/>House will vote the Address to Her Majesty 
     <lb/>this evening, in order that the Government 
     <lb/>may despatch it to England to-morrow, if 
     <lb/>they please, and that on Monday afternoon 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Peel will come and 
     <lb/>move. an Address to His Excellency, praying 
     <lb/>that he will refer these resolutions to the 
     <lb/>people." (Hear, hear.) I confess that I do 
     <lb/>not understand how the members of this 
     <lb/>
         

    
            <pb n="895" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0895.jpg"/>

     House, who are in favor of the appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people, can vote for Confederation after the 
     <lb/>
     previous question has been decided, any 
     <lb/>
     more than I can understand how the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Peel can move the appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people after the resolutions have been passed. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member has said that he would 
     <lb/>
     endeavor to move his resolutions before the 
     <lb/>
     Address is presented to His Excellency, or 
     <lb/>
     before it is referred to a committee of the 
     <lb/>
     whole House ; but I think I understood like<lb break="no"/>wise that the Hon. Attorney General for 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada will not allow this, and has 
     <lb/>
     said that the hon. member for Peel is not 
     <lb/>
     entitled to do so. (Hear, hear.) I am not 
     <lb/>
     alone in feeling the apprehensions which I 
     <lb/>
     have expressed relative to the new Consti<lb break="no"/>tution intended for us. A member of this 
     <lb/>
     House, who wrote, now a long time since, on 
     <lb/>
     the subject of Confederation, has allowed us 
     <lb/>
     to see indistinctly that the resolutions as 
     <lb/>
     presented to us did not afford sufficient 
     <lb/>
     guarantees to settle all our sectional difficul<lb break="no"/>ties at once. The honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmorency could not, in his pamphlet 
     <lb/>
     written in 1865, avoid saying as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">But, nevertheless, it is clearly evident that con<lb break="no"/>current legislation is full of danger for the future; 
     <lb/>
     that is plainly laid down even in the clause that 
     <lb/>
     we are now discussing, since, to obviate it, 
     <lb/>
     central legislation has invariably been made to 
     <lb/>
     predominate over local legislation. Will it be 
     <lb/>
     possible to avoid the points of contact likely to 
     <lb/>
    be produced by concurrent legislation, or to define 
     <lb/>them with such precision that these conflicts 
     <lb/>would be impossible, or nearly so ? Without 
     <lb/>harmony the system would be worth nothing, 
     <lb/>and would soon destroy itself ; and the harmony 
     <lb/>of the system cannot be found exclusively in the 
     <lb/>predominant power of the Government and of the 
     <lb/>Federal Parliament. It is necessary that this 
     <lb/>harmony should also exist in the inferior machi<lb break="no"/>nery, and be felt throughout the whole system.

            <p>
     And afterwards, in the same chapter, he

     adds:-<lb/>

     Federal Parliament ? And this local power which 
     <lb/>
     it has been their object to compress will react 
     <lb/>
     dangerously on the whole system. At one time 
     <lb/>
     it may be Lower Canada that will be punishing

     or perhaps the Atlantic Provinces, that may make

     similar complaints. This should not be, and to

            <p>
     While the hon. member for Montmorency 
     <lb/>
     was writing that article, he naturally saw 
     <lb/>
     that Confederation would have some very com<lb break="no"/>plicated parts in its machinery, and that the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties which might occur would not be 
     <lb/>
     easily surmounted—that the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     would need to be amended. That was, no 
     <lb/>
     doubt, the opinion of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmorency when he wrote those articles, 
     <lb/>
     but since he has found that the Ministry 
     <lb/>
     are resolved not to allow any amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions, the honorable member has 
     <lb/>
     thought it better to take them as they are, 
     <lb/>
     with all their imperfections, than to risk 
     <lb/>
     losing Confederation altogether. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I believe, Mr. SPEAKER, that we 
     <lb/>
     needed a remedy for the constitutional dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties in which we were involved, but I 
     <lb/>
     believe also that the remedy proposed would 
     <lb/>
     be worse than the disease sought to be 
     <lb/>
     cured. (Hear, hear.) I believe that the 
     <lb/>
     country has suffered from those difficul<lb break="no"/>ties, but on the other hand I see in Con<lb break="no"/>federation internal strife in the local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures, not to speak of that strife which will 
     <lb/>
     infallibly spring up at an early day between 
     <lb/>
     the federal and the local legislatures. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It is evident that the federal will 
     <lb/>
     never be able to satisfy the local legislatures. 
     <lb/>
     In Lower Canada, for instance, we shall have 
     <lb/>
     a pretty strong party—the English party, 
     <lb/>
     Protestants, who will carry their complaints 
     <lb/>
     to the Federal Government, just as, in Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada, they made complaints relative 
     <lb/>
     to representation based on population, and 
     <lb/>
     that party being a minority in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     will seek a remedy for their evils, real or 
     <lb/>
     imaginary, at the hands of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government. Moreover, we shall have con<lb break="no"/>stant contests and sectional heart-burnings 
     <lb/>
     between the local legislatures themselves, on 
     <lb/>
     all those subjects on which their interests 
     <lb/>
     may come into collision. (Hear, hear.) Let 
     <lb/>
     us suppose, for instance, that the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture of Lower Canada should make some 
     <lb/>
     perfectly just demand, something to which 
     <lb/>
     that province is clearly entitled, and that 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of Upper Canada and 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces should combine to 
     <lb/>
     hinder it from obtaining its demand—would 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Canadians be well satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     such treatment ? And this might easily 
     <lb/>
     happen. The hon. member for Vaudreuil 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. HARWOOD) has spoken in pompous 
     <lb/>
     language of the prosperous future which 
     <lb/>
     awaits us under Confederation. To hear 
     <lb/>
     him we are not only to have coal mines, 
     <lb/>

     but lakes of gold at our disposal. I think 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member's figures of rhetoric 
     <lb/>
     have carried him rather too far; and I sin<lb break="no"/>cerely believe that instead of that prosperous 
     <lb/>
     and happy future foreseen by him, we are 
     <lb/>
     preparing for ourselves a state. of things 
     <lb/>
     which will cause us to repent in ten years of 
     <lb/>
     what we are now doing. I believe that we 
     <lb/>
     are commencing Confederation ten years too 
     <lb/>
     soon. (Hear, hear.) We should have an 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway at least five or six 
     <lb/>
     years before thinking of Confederation. At 
     <lb/>
    present we are as much strangers to New 
     <lb/>Brunswick and Nova Scotia as we were 
     <lb/>previous to last autumn. We may perhaps 
     <lb/>know them a little better than we did before 
     <lb/>we began to discuss Confederation ; and we 
     <lb/>ought, in the first place, to establish easy me<lb break="no"/>thods of communication between those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and ourselves, as a means of bringing 
     <lb/>about Confederation at some future day, if it 
     <lb/>he practicable. I say that the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>Railway ought first to be built, and that 
     <lb/>Confederation might be put off even several 
     <lb/>years after that. (Hear, hear.) Article 41 
     <lb/>of the resolutions before us says as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The Local Government and Legislature of each 
     <lb/>province shall be constructed in such manner as 
     <lb/>the existing Legislature of each such province 
     <lb/>shall provide.   
     <lb/>
            </quote>
            <p>If I understand that article right, the local 
     <lb/>constitution of Lower Canada will be settled 
     <lb/>by the present Legislature ; just as in New 
     <lb/>Brunswick, Nova Scotia, &amp;c., the present 
     <lb/>legislatures will decide on the constitution of 
     <lb/>their legislatures under Confederation. Very 
     <lb/>well; but in that case Upper Canada will 
     <lb/>give us a constitution, as we may give her 
     <lb/>one. The effect of that clause will be, that 
     <lb/>in order to the organization of its local con<lb break="no"/>stitution, Lower Canada will stand with 47 
     <lb/>French-Canadian votes, against 83 votes of 
     <lb/>members of other origins. We shall there<lb break="no"/>fore not stand on the same footing as New 
     <lb/>Brunswick or Nova Scotia in this respect; 
     <lb/>the difference will be very great. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) We have only 47 French-Can<lb break="no"/>adian votes out of 130, and we could 
     <lb/>not count on Upper Canadian members 
     <lb/>for the safety of our interests—either local 
     <lb/>or religious—whereas they would have the 
     <lb/>support of all the English and Protestant 
     <lb/>members from Lower Canada. (Hear.) And 
     <lb/>in Confederation the English minority of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada will not make common cause 
     <lb/>with the French-Canadian party, but, on the 
     <lb/>contrary, with the Upper Canadian party ; 
     <lb/>
       <cb/>
      
     for they will look to Upper Canada for pro<lb break="no"/>tection. (Hear, hear.) We are told that all 
     <lb/>
     our interests and institutions are protected, 
     <lb/>
     and that the clergy are in favor of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. I, for my own part, have seen no 
     <lb/>
     proof of the truth of that assertion ; I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the clergy have not made any 
     <lb/>
     display of their opinions on this question. 
     <lb/>
    I am moreover convinced that those of that 
     <lb/>body who have considered the question, 
     <lb/>have looked upon it as fraught with danger 
     <lb/>for us—as pregnant with evils, the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of which may be grievous to us as a 
     <lb/>nation hereafter. Another part of the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions which we should not adopt without 
     <lb/>consideration, is that contained in the 34th 
     <lb/>article of clause 29. It reads as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The General Parliament shall have power to 
     <lb/>
     make laws for the establishment of a General 
     <lb/>
     Court of Appeal for the Federated Provinces.

            <p>
     We have a guarantee that we are to have our

     own local tribunals, that our judges will be

     taken from the bar of Lower Canada, and that 
     <lb/>
     our civil laws will be maintained. Why 
     <lb/>
     then establish a Federal Court of Appeals, 
     <lb/>
     in which appeals will lie from the decisions 
     <lb/>
     of all our judges? We are told, it is true, 
     <lb/>
     by the Hon. Minister of Finance, that the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions did not create a Court of Appeals, 
     <lb/>
     but only gave the Federal Parliament the 
     <lb/>
     power to create it. But what difference is 
     <lb/>
     there between creating the court forthwith 
     <lb/>
     and granting a right to create it hereafter? 
     <lb/>
     The principle is the same. If the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment may lawfully create such a court, no one 
     <lb/>
     can prevent the Federal Goverhment from 
     <lb/>
     establishing it whenever they think fit. Would 
     <lb/>
     this tribunal be an advantage to us French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians, who are so attached to our civil 
     <lb/>
     code? It will be composed of judges from 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces—from New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, Upper Canada, &amp;c. ; and not<lb break="no"/>withstanding the talents and the learning 
     <lb/>
     of all those judges, we Lower Canadians 
     <lb/>
     cannot hope to find the same justice from 
     <lb/>
     such a tribunal as we should receive from 
     <lb/>
     one consisting of judges from Lower Canada; 
     <lb/>
     for our laws being different from the laws of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces, they will not be able to 
     <lb/>
     understand and appreciate them as Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadians would. (Hear, hear.) And, 
     <lb/>
     moreover, when this new Court of Appeals 
     <lb/>
     is instituted, the appeal to England will not 
     <lb/>
     be abolished, so that we shall have one more 
     <lb/>
     means of producing delay and increasing 
     <lb/>
     the costs of suitors. Lower Canadians will 
     <lb/>

     assuredly be less satisfied with the decisions 
     <lb/>
     of a Federal Court of Appeals than with 
     <lb/>
     those of Her Majesty's Privy Council. In 
     <lb/>
     good truth, I do not see why this clause was 
     <lb/>
     imposed upon our delegates. I do not 
     <lb/>
     suppose that the delegates of the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces can have very strongly insisted on it ; 
     <lb/>
     but even if they had, I do not see why ours 
     <lb/>
     submitted to it. Of course our laws would 
     <lb/>
     not be understood in such a court, and most 
     <lb/>
     of the judges would render their decisions 
     <lb/>
     according to principles of jurisprudence 
     <lb/>
     unknown to Lower Canada. I am convinced 
     <lb/>
     that those Lower Canadian members who 
     <lb/>
     are in favor of Confederation are not in 
     <lb/>
     favor of a legislative union; but have they 
     <lb/>
     not read the speech made at Toronto by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BROWN)? And did they not hear that of 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for South Leeds (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     FORD JONES), and the speeches of the 
     <lb/>
     members from Upper Canada generally, who 
     <lb/>
     nearly all spoke in favor of a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union, declaring that they accept Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation as an instalment—a first step—towards 
     <lb/>
     a legislative union, which we shall have in a 
     <lb/>
     few years? It is not necessary for me to 
     <lb/>
     discuss, on this occasion, the advantages or 
     <lb/>
     disadvantages of a legislative union, for all 
     <lb/>
     the members are perfectly well acquainted 
     <lb/>
     with the question; but I am well convinced 
     <lb/>
     that the Confederation will be convert<lb break="no"/>ed into a legislative union in a few 
     <lb/>
     years. I believe that the Hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance and the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     Leeds were sincere in saying that, and that 
     <lb/>
     they were perfectly convinced of its truth. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It has been said, as a reason 
     <lb/>
     for hurrying on the passing of the measure, 
     <lb/>
     that if we wish for Confederation, now is 
     <lb/>
     the time to obtain it ; that if we wait another 
     <lb/>
     year it will be too late ; that the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces are ready for Confederation, and 
     <lb/>
     that England is disposed to grant us a new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. I believe that the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces have proved to be a little slack 
     <lb/>
     in fulfilling their engagements, and that the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the Government might therefore, 
     <lb/>
     with great safety, undergo some modification. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But if we must absolutely 
     <lb/>
     have Confederation, if there is no getting on 
     <lb/>
     without it, why was not an appeal made to 
     <lb/>
     the people last autumn, when the scheme 
     <lb/>
     was quite prepared? (Hear, hear.) For 
     <lb/>
     my part, I think that the want of the mea<lb break="no"/>sure of Confederation is not so urgent as it 
     <lb/>
     is said to be, and that time should be taken 
     <lb/>
     to mature the plan. Does anybody believe 
     <lb/>
     
       
            <cb/>
          
     that the question of Confederation would 
     <lb/>
     have been thought of if the TACHE-MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD Ministry had not been overthrown 
     <lb/>
     last summer? No; we should not have 
     <lb/>
     heard a word about it. (Hear, hear.) So 
     <lb/>
     that Confederation was not so very pressing 
     <lb/>
     at that time! And if the want of it was 
     <lb/>
     so little felt in the Constitutional Committee 
     <lb/>
     appointed last year at the instance of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for South Oxford (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BROWN), that many members who this day 
     <lb/>
     vote themselves, and induce others to vote 
     <lb/>
     for Confederation, thought themselves au<lb break="no"/>thorised to oppose it then, and to vote 
     <lb/>
     against any proposition of the kind, I 
     <lb/>
     think that it is not so needful to unite 
     <lb/>
     us by Confederation as we are told it 
     <lb/>
     is. I believe that if the adoption of the 
     <lb/>
     measure is urged forward so anxiously, it is 
     <lb/>
     only because there is fear of public opinion 
     <lb/>
     being roused to examine it, and fear especi<lb break="no"/>ally of its not being accepted hereafter, 
     <lb/>
     when the people have pronounced upon it. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And, I repeat, I believe in 
     <lb/>
     my heart, if the Government had not been 
     <lb/>
     overthrown on the 14th June last, we should 
     <lb/>
     never have heard a word about Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion this year. (Hear, hear.) As I said 
     <lb/>
     when I commenced speaking, I will not 
     <lb/>
     discuss every question connected with this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, because the House must be tired of 
     <lb/>
     such a long discussion. I am bound, how<lb break="no"/>ever, to declare again, that all the reasons 
     <lb/>
     hitherto alleged in favor of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
    and all the magnificent pictures presented to 
     <lb/>our view of the prosperity we are to enjoy 
     <lb/>under its auspices, have entirely failed to 
     <lb/>convince me that it is our bounden duty to 
     <lb/>adopt the resolutions laid before us; and 
     <lb/>notwithstanding the eloquent speech made 
     <lb/>to us yesterday by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Vaudreuil (Mr. HARWOOD), I cannot say, as 
     <lb/>he does, that our posterity will be grateful 
     <lb/>to us for having opened the way for them to 
     <lb/>become members of the great empire of the 
     <lb/>Provinces of British North America. I 
     <lb/>shall say, on the contrary, what will be soon 
     <lb/>found out, that this Confederation is the 
     <lb/>ruin of our nationality in Lower Canada<lb break="no"/>that on the day when Confederation is 
     <lb/>voted, a death-blow will have been dealt on 
     <lb/>our nationality, which was beginning to take 
     <lb/>root in the soil of British North America. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Our children, far from feel<lb break="no"/>ing grateful for what we are now doing, will 
     <lb/>say that we made, a great mistake when we 
     <lb/>imposed Confederation on them. (Cheers.)

     cannot permit the vote to be taken on this 
     <lb/>
     important measure, without placing on re<lb break="no"/>cord some of the reasons which induce me 
     <lb/>
     to give it my support, and to show why, to 
     <lb/>
     some extent, I have changed my views on a 
     <lb/>
     few of the leading details of the scheme. 
     <lb/>
     When, sir, the people of the first commercial 
     <lb/>
     city in Western Canada elected me to repre<lb break="no"/>sent them on the floor of this House, I 
     <lb/>
     publicly stated that by every legitimate 
     <lb/>
     means I would oppose the construction of a 
     <lb/>
     railroad between Canada and the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces—then, as I do now, believing 
     <lb/>
     that in a commercial point of view, that 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial road would never pay, nor be 
     <lb/>
     even beneficial to Upper Canada. But at 
     <lb/>
     the same time, sir, I pledged myself to urge 
     <lb/>
     upon the Ministers of the Crown and this 
     <lb/>
     House the vast importance to the country of 
     <lb/>
     an enlargement of our canals and the exten<lb break="no"/>sion of our canal system. Since then, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, our political and commercial posi<lb break="no"/>tions are very much changed. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Threatened with the abrogation of the Reci<lb break="no"/>procity treaty, a very serious loss will be 
     <lb/>
     entailed on Canada—if the threat be carried 
     <lb/>
     into execution—without any advantage ac<lb break="no"/>cruing to the United States. Indeed, 
     <lb/>
     from the nature of our commercial rela<lb break="no"/>tions with the United States—the natural 
     <lb/>
     result of a trade fostered and carried on 
     <lb/>
     between the United States and Canada for 
     <lb/>
     years—the abrogation of the Reciprocity 
     <lb/>
     treaty cannot be otherwise than attended 
     <lb/>
     with great distress and serious loss to the 
     <lb/>
     business men of this country. In addition 
     <lb/>
     to this, sir, we are threatened with the abro<lb break="no"/>gation of the bonding system. Surely this 
     <lb/>
     is much to be deplored. To every thinking 
     <lb/>
     mind a resort to such measures must seem 
     <lb/>
     absurd, and what could induce a people so 
     <lb/>
      thoroughly commercial as the people of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, to desire the abrogation of a 
     <lb/>
     treaty which, while it benefits us by per<lb break="no"/>mitting the transit of goods through their 
     <lb/>
     territory, also benefits them largely by in<lb break="no"/>creasing their carrying trade, and fosters an 
     <lb/>
     immense trade in the purchase of goods of 
     <lb/>
     all descriptions in bond—I must declare my 
     <lb/>
     inability thoroughly to understand. But, 
     <lb/>
     however strange, Mr. SPEAKER, all this may 
     <lb/>
     seem to us, angry men, it must be admitted, 
     <lb/>
     frequently do indulge in strange antics, and 
     <lb/>
     it need not surprise us that a nation plunged 
     <lb/>
     in all the horrors of civil war should, under 
     <lb/>
     the excitement of some real or fancied 
     <lb/>
     wrong, do the same thing; as has been exem<lb break="no"/>plified in the adoption of the despotic system 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     of passports, the abrogation of the Reciprocity 
     <lb/>
     treaty, and the annulling of the treaty for the 
     <lb/>
    extradition of criminals. Yet, Mr. SPEAKER 
     <lb/>I cannot believe that the United States will 
     <lb/>abrogate either the one or the other, and I 
     <lb/>do not believe that the great and high-minded 
     <lb/>and honorable men who control the moneyed 
     <lb/>institutions of the United States will permit 
     <lb/>it. But, sir, it is only right on our part to 
     <lb/>do the next best, and only thing we can, to 
     <lb/>protect ourselves from the loss and inconve<lb break="no"/>nience to our trade in winter, and that is, to 
     <lb/>build the Intercolonial Railroad—for we 
     <lb/>must have a highway to the ocean at all 
     <lb/>seasons for our mails and our merchandise. 
     <lb/>But, Mr. SPEAKER, while I admit that I 
     <lb/>have changed my mind with regard to the 
     <lb/>Intercolonial Railroad in voting for the 
     <lb/>scheme in which it is a prominent measure, 
     <lb/>I am more and more convinced of the par<lb break="no"/>amount necessity of immediately setting about 
     <lb/>the enlargement of our canals. We hear of 
     <lb/>schemes to connect the Georgian Bay with 
     <lb/>Ottawa by way of the French River route 
     <lb/>and the Trent route, and sir, perhaps the 
     <lb/>only practicable and shortest route via 
     <lb/>Toronto and Lake Simcoe ; but all these only 
     <lb/>divert attention from what really can and 
     <lb/>ought to be done, at a very trifling cost in 
     <lb/>comparison with any other scheme—I mean 
     <lb/>the enlargement of the canals we now have. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) We have now nine feet of 
     <lb/>water in the St. Lawrence canals, and ten 
     <lb/>feet in the Welland, and the cost of increasing 
     <lb/>the depth of those canals to twelve feet, I am 
     <lb/>told by men competent to judge, would be 
     <lb/>trifling indeed—probably not over two or 
     <lb/>three millions of dollars. But if it cost as 
     <lb/>many pounds, I contend that it would not 
     <lb/>really cost the country one cent. If the toll 
     <lb/>of one cent per bushel on grain outward and 
     <lb/>a proportionate rate on inward merchandise 
     <lb/>were enacted, the canals would not only be 
     <lb/>self-sustaining, but would become a source of 
     <lb/>revenue to the provinces. Take for instance, 
     <lb/>what I believe a small estimate, one hundred 
     <lb/>millions of bushels outward, and an equal 
     <lb/>amount inward for other merchandise, and 
     <lb/>you would have a revenue of two millions of 
     <lb/>dollars—a sum more than sufficient to pay 
     <lb/>interest and working expenses. Then, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, see the impetus it would give to 
     <lb/>our inland shipping trade, if we could—and 
     <lb/>we could then do so—attract to the St. Law<lb break="no"/>rence route the immense grain crops of the 
     <lb/>Great West. I might also refer, Mr. SPEAKER   
     <lb/>to the ship-building suited to the wants of 
     <lb/>our country, and the immense advantage 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="899" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0899.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">899</fw>
         
     shippers of grain would have if their vessels 
     <lb/>
     proceeded to sea without the ruinous 
     <lb/>
     delay of transhipment, and the mixing 
     <lb/>
     and destroying of property round the 
     <lb/>
     wharves and storehouses at the different 
     <lb/>
     points at which grain, under the present 
     <lb/>
     system, has to be transhipped. I only wish 
     <lb/>
     I had the eloquence of the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West ; with the little practical 
     <lb/>
     knowledge I have of those things, I think I 
     <lb/>
     would be able to interest both western and 
     <lb/>
     eastern members alike on the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     improving, and at once, this great and vital 
     <lb/>
     avenue to our future prosperity. (Hear. 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Now, sir, with regard to our defences : 
     <lb/>
     while I do not object to some expenditure to 
     <lb/>
     please the English people if you choose ; I 
     <lb/>
     am of opinion our best defence is to culti<lb break="no"/>vate with the United States friendly com<lb break="no"/>mercial and political relations, and then, sir, 
     <lb/>
     I do not fear that if we do what is right, 
     <lb/>
     they will do us any wrong. Sound and 
     <lb/>
     honorable conduct on our part is of more 
     <lb/>
     strength than all the forts of masonry or 
     <lb/>
     earthwork that we shall ever see. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, the prompt and 
     <lb/>
     manly course that our Government has pur<lb break="no"/>sued with regard to the Alien Bill, and call<lb break="no"/>ing out a portion of our volunteers to repress 
     <lb/>
     raiding and piracy, will entitle them to the 
     <lb/>
     gratitude of every right-minded man in this 
     <lb/>
     country. Sir, had they commenced to build 
     <lb/>
     forts and arm ships, instead of the manly 
     <lb/>
     and honorable course which they did pursue, 
     <lb/>
     they would, in my Opinion, have found use 
     <lb/>
     for their volunteers and their forts too; 
     <lb/>
     while I hope that in a very short time they 
     <lb/>
     will not require either. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     wish now to say a few words about this great 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, from which so much is ex<lb break="no"/>pected, commercially and politically. I am 
     <lb/>
     of opinion that the advantages will be very 
     <lb/>
     evenly divided—they taking our grain and 
     <lb/>
     flour, while we buy their fish and oil. We will 
     <lb/>
     have an open market for our manufactures 
     <lb/>
     with them, and they will have the same 
     <lb/>
     for theirs with us, so that it is a mere mat<lb break="no"/>ter of who gives most. But at present the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces import from the United 
     <lb/>
     States flour and grain, if I am correct, to 
     <lb/>
     the amount of three or four millions of dol<lb break="no"/>lars' worth per annum, which our political 
     <lb/>
     and more intimate relations would in a more 
     <lb/>
     or less degree attract to Canada ; and I have 
     <lb/>
     no doubt our merchants would know how to 
     <lb/>
     turn those advantages to account. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, these are some of the reasons 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     why I gave this Confederation scheme my 
     <lb/>
     hearty support, believing that the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have brought this treaty 
     <lb/>
     before this House have no other motive, 
     <lb/>
     and can have no other motive, but the pro<lb break="no"/>motion of the best interests of this our 
     <lb/>
     adopted land. (Hear, hear.) I think the 
     <lb/>
     scheme as proposed is, as near as it can be, 
     <lb/>
     fair to all the provinces Before I close, I 
     <lb/>
     would just say a word with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     course pursued by my respected and honora<lb break="no"/>ble colleague from Toronto West (Mr. J. 
     <lb/>
     MACDONALD). I have no hesitation in saying 
     <lb/>
     that I am confident that he is sincere in his 
     <lb/>
     opposition, and he may be right ; but I am 
     <lb/>
     not so sure that he represents the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     his constituents. I attended a large and influ<lb break="no"/>ential meeting of the citizens of the city of 
     <lb/>
     Toronto before the meeting of this House, 
     <lb/>
     and a gentleman there proposed that the 
     <lb/>
     scheme should not be carried into effect 
     <lb/>
     until it was referred to the peeple, but he 
     <lb/>
     could not get even a seconder to his resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. For myself, I feel justified by the 
     <lb/>
     result of that meeting in supporting this 
     <lb/>
     scheme throughout. The meeting was ex<lb break="no"/>tensively advertised—all had an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to attend, and both sides of the question were 
     <lb/>
     ably argued. I shall record my vote for 
     <lb/>
     the scheme, and shall be happy to see it 
     <lb/>
     carried into early consummation. (Cheers.)

     <persName ref="pers:SHAN1">MR. SHANLY</persName> said—In rising to address 
     <lb/>
     the House on the great question under 
     <lb/>
     debate, it is not my intention to go minutely 
     <lb/>
     into the subject ; for after all that has been 
     <lb/>
     said, and the great length to which the 
     <lb/>
     debate has dragged on, I cannot expect to be 
     <lb/>
     able to fix the attention of my hearers for 
     <lb/>
     very long, even were the subject one to 
     <lb/>
     which I could speak authoritatively, instead 
     <lb/>
     of being, as it is, one that the ablest and 
     <lb/>
     most statesmanlike among us must in a great 
     <lb/>
     measure accept upon faith—trusting to the 
     <lb/>
     future to develope the excellencies claimed 
     <lb/>
     for it on the one hand, or to establish the 
     <lb/>
     faults that are charged on it on the other. 
     <lb/>
     But though I do not pretend to be able to 
     <lb/>
     say anything new on the subject, or to throw 
     <lb/>
     any light on the uncertain future that lies 
     <lb/>
     before us, still I would be unwilling that in, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, the most important division ever 
     <lb/>
     taken in a Colonial Legislature, my vote 
     <lb/>
     should be recorded without my first stating 
     <lb/>
     some, at all events, of the reasons that 
     <lb/>
     actuate me in voting as I intend to vote. 
     <lb/>
     One feature has been strikingly observable 
     <lb/>
     in the debate, and that is, that from first to 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="900" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0900.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">900</fw>
           
     last, as far as it has yet gone, no new thing 
     <lb/>
     has been offered or suggested. The pro<lb break="no"/>gramme of Confederation stands now exactly 
     <lb/>
               as it was presented in a <hi rendition="simple:italic">quasi</hi> private form 
     <lb/>
     to the representatives of the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country some four months ago. The 
     <lb/>
     promoters of the scheme have added nothing 
     <lb/>
     to, taken nothing from the original bill of 
     <lb/>
     fare, and they have as good as told us, 
     <lb/>
     frankly and squarely, that they would add 
     <lb/>
     nothing to, take nothing from it if they could. 
     <lb/>
     The opponents of the project on the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, while giving it a sweeping condem<lb break="no"/>nation, offer nothing, suggest nothing to 
     <lb/>
     replace that which they so summarily reject. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing is easier than to find fault with 
     <lb/>
     other men's work ; it is a talent that we all 
     <lb/>
    possess, and that few of us ever think to 
     <lb/>hide under a bushel. For myself, though 
     <lb/>in favor of the scheme, being equally at a 
     <lb/>loss with other honorable members to say 
     <lb/>anything new upon it, I, too, will have to 
     <lb/>turn to my fault-finding instincts in the first 
     <lb/>instance. The honorable member for Mon<lb break="no"/>treal Centre (Hon. Mr. ROSE has said in his 
     <lb/>able speech that if we could not improve on 
     <lb/>the project, we should forbear to find fault 
     <lb/>with it. I do not agree with him. On the 
     <lb/>contrary, I conceive that even though ap<lb break="no"/>proving of the resolutions as a whole, it is 
     <lb/>the duty of members speaking to the question 
     <lb/>to point out and place on record the faults 
     <lb/>that strike them as likely to require correc<lb break="no"/>tion by and by. And first of all—coming to 
     <lb/>discuss Confederation from my own stand<lb break="no"/>point—I would say that I have long looked 
     <lb/>forward to the time when the whole of the 
     <lb/>British North American Provinces would be 
     <lb/>united under one stable government ; believ<lb break="no"/>ing, as I always have believed ever since I 
     <lb/>came to know this country well, that we pos<lb break="no"/>sess all the elements, in natural resources and 
     <lb/>endowments, and in distinctive geographical 
     <lb/>position, to form the ground-work of a power 
     <lb/>on this continent. I feared, nevertheless, 
     <lb/>when the project was foreshadowed here last 
     <lb/>year, that the time was not yet full for 
     <lb/>bringing about the desired combination. I 
     <lb/>feared that the almost total separation, poli<lb break="no"/>tical and social, which had heretofore existed 
     <lb/>between ourselves and the provinces below, 
     <lb/>might possibly cause a premature union to 
     <lb/>result in permanent estrangement. It ap<lb break="no"/>peared to me that we should first  have 
     <lb/>cultivated social and commercial relations 
     <lb/>with our kindred on the seaboard before 
     <lb/>uniting, for better for worse, in a political 
     <lb/>alliance. These were the views which I took 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     of the Confederation project when it was so 
     <lb/>
     suddenly sprung upon us at the close of last 
     <lb/>
     session ; and I confess that I still entertain 
     <lb/>
     grave apprehensions that we may be about to 
     <lb/>
     come together upon too short an acquaint<lb break="no"/>ance, before we have an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     knowing one another, and learning to adapt 
     <lb/>
     ourselves the one to the other. In this con<lb break="no"/>sists my broad and general objection, not to 
     <lb/>
     the principle of Confederation, but to the 
     <lb/>
     hastiness with which it is sought to be car<lb break="no"/>ried out—threatening, as I fear, to mar our 
     <lb/>
     destiny in striving to overtake it. To the 
     <lb/>
     details of the scheme itself I hold one strong 
     <lb/>
     and marked objection, which I desire to 
     <lb/>
     record, though I know that this is not the 
     <lb/>
     time or place for remedying defective details. 
     <lb/>
     I allude to the Federal feature of the pro<lb break="no"/>ject. I own to a rooted dislike, if not to 
     <lb/>
     the Federal principle or Federal theory, at 
     <lb/>
     all events to the practical results of the 
     <lb/>
     working of the system ; and neither the 
     <lb/>
     warm eulogium which the Hon. President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN) has passed 
     <lb/>
     upon the system as illustrated by its work<lb break="no"/>ing in the United States, nor the milder 
     <lb/>
     defence of the system pronounced by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the Hon. Minister of Agricul<lb break="no"/>ture (Hon. Mr. MCGEE), has served to 
     <lb/>
     clothe it in other than most distasteful 
     <lb/>
     colors in my sight. However the Federal 
     <lb/>
     system of government may have tended to 
     <lb/>
     promote the material growth of the United 
     <lb/>
     States—and it would not be safe to assert 
     <lb/>
     that such a country, with such a people, 
     <lb/>
     would have failed to attain to early greatness 
     <lb/>
     under any form of free government—how<lb break="no"/>ever, I repeat, the Federal form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment may have promoted the material 
     <lb/>
     progress of the United States, it does not 
     <lb/>
     seem to me to have elevated, politically 
     <lb/>
     speaking at all events, the moral standard 
     <lb/>
     of the people of the United States. One 
     <lb/>
     most marked and evil result of the system 
     <lb/>
     has been to produce politicians rather than 
     <lb/>
     statesmen—swarms of the former to a very 
     <lb/>
     limited proportion of the latter ; and I would 
     <lb/>
     much fear, if we are to see Canada redivided, 
     <lb/>
     that the petty parliaments of the separated 
     <lb/>
     provinces will prove to be but preparatory 
     <lb/>
     schools for that class of politicians who take to 
     <lb/>
     politics as to a trade, and whose after-presence 
     <lb/>
     in the greater Assembly—to which they would 
     <lb/>
     all aspire—would serve to depress the standard 
     <lb/>
     of political worth, to lower the tone of poli<lb break="no"/>tical morality, which we might hope to see 
     <lb/>
     prevail in a Confederated Parliament of 
     <lb/>
     British North America under a purely legis<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="901" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0901.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">901</fw>
         
     lative union, which is the description of 
     <lb/>
     union into which I trust to see the present 
     <lb/>
     imperfect Constitution, or proposed Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, eventually merge. For the reasons 
     <lb/>
     stated I have looked upon this Federal 
     <lb/>
     scheme of union with dislike and distrust. 
     <lb/>
     But the promoters of the scheme, most of 
     <lb/>
     whom, it must be admitted, have appeared 
     <lb/>
     here rather as its apologists than as its 
     <lb/>
     upholders, tell us that it is a necessity of 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, an unavoidable consequence 
     <lb/>
     of difference in language, laws and local 
     <lb/>
     interests between Upper and Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     on the one part, and an absence of commu<lb break="no"/>nity of local interests between us here in 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the Maritime Provinces on the 
     <lb/>
     other hand. The latter part of the argument 
     <lb/>
     is undoubtedly correct ; but, admitting the 
     <lb/>
     whole of the premises, for argument sake, 
     <lb/>
     the other question naturally suggests itself : 
     <lb/>
     Is Confederation, even in the faulty form in 
     <lb/>
     which it is laid before us, to be accepted as 
     <lb/>
     a likely remedy for the evils under which 
     <lb/>
     we now labor in Canada, and as a possible 
     <lb/>
     antidote against the greater evils which 
     <lb/>
     threaten us in the near future? I would 
     <lb/>
     answer that question in my own way, and 
     <lb/>
     from my own point of view by and by ; 
     <lb/>
     meanwhile I would ask to be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     say a word in respect of the financial phase 
     <lb/>
     of the Confederation project ; and upon that 
     <lb/>
     point I feel it difficult to agree with my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the Hon. Finance Minister, in assum<lb break="no"/>ing that the joint expenses of the two local 
     <lb/>
     governments here in Canada may be kept 
     <lb/>
     so much below what we are now paying for 
     <lb/>
     our single form of government, as to leave a 
     <lb/>
     wide margin towards defraying, if not wholly 
     <lb/>
     to cover, our proportion of the expenses of 
     <lb/>
     the General Government. I can hardly 
     <lb/>
               venture to take such a <hi rendition="simple:italic">couleur-de-rose</hi> view 
     <lb/>
     of our position as that. I will not weary the 
     <lb/>
     House with estimates and figures, which, 
     <lb/>
     after all, can be but problematical and 
     <lb/>
     conjectural ; but, I would venture to predict 
     <lb/>
     that under our new condition of existence, 
     <lb/>
               with its <hi rendition="simple:italic">quasi</hi> national obligations, our 
     <lb/>
     expenditure must increase largely beyond 
     <lb/>
     the present limits that we have hitherto 
     <lb/>
     been accustomed to. I believe that to be 
     <lb/>
     an inevitable result of the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion ; but I also believe that there is a future 
     <lb/>
     looming upon us—Confederation or no Con<lb break="no"/>federation—which will involve us in duties 
     <lb/>
     and responsibilities which we must not 
     <lb/>
     shirk—which, in fact, we cannot shirk if we 
     <lb/>
     would. The signs of the times are not to be 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     mistaken, and I fear we have an expensive 
     <lb/>
     future before us for some time to come. 
     <lb/>
     But if, in bringing about a union of all these 
     <lb/>
     provinces, we were in reality laying the sure 
     <lb/>
     foundation of social, commercial, and politi<lb break="no"/>cal prosperity—if we felt that in reality we 
     <lb/>
     were laying the ground-work, as it were, of 
     <lb/>
     a new nation on this continent—we might 
     <lb/>
     justly, along with the great benefits we be<lb break="no"/>queath to posterity—benefits which we, in 
     <lb/>
     our generation, cannot hope to enjoy in their 
     <lb/>
     fulness—bequeath to them also the financial 
     <lb/>
     burden which would seem to be the ordained 
     <lb/>
     and inevitable accompaniment of progressive 
     <lb/>
     nationality. And if I felt assured in my 
     <lb/>
     own mind that this measure of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     faulty as it is, promised even a fair chance for 
     <lb/>
     successfully solving a great political difficulty, 
     <lb/>
     I for one would not fear to take my share 
     <lb/>
     of the responsibility of increasing the ex<lb break="no"/>penses of government and adding to the 
     <lb/>
     debt of the country. I have alluded to the 
     <lb/>
     expenses attendant on Confederation as 
     <lb/>
     being, to a certain extent, conjectural and 
     <lb/>
     problematical ; but there is one item of its 
     <lb/>
     cost which is not of that character. The 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway is a vital part of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation project—the latter could have 
     <lb/>
     no useful, practical existence without the 
     <lb/>
     former. As a commercial undertaking, the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway presents no attrac<lb break="no"/>tions, it offers no material for a flattering 
     <lb/>
     prospectus ; we could not invite to it the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of European capitalists as presenting an 
     <lb/>
     eligible investment for their surplus funds. 
     <lb/>
     But for the establishing of those intimate 
     <lb/>
     social and commercial relations indispensable 
     <lb/>
     to political unity between ourselves and the 
     <lb/>
     sister provinces, the railway is a necessity. It 
     <lb/>
     will, therefore, have to be undertaken and 
     <lb/>
     paid for purely as a national work, and it is 
     <lb/>
     right that the people of Canada should know 
     <lb/>
     and understand in the outset what the pro<lb break="no"/>bable addition to our public debt would be 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the 68th resolution. I 
     <lb/>
     do not think the proportion of the cost of the 
     <lb/>
     railway falling to the share of Canada can 
     <lb/>
    'be much short of what we have already 
     <lb/>given towards the construction of the Grand 
     <lb/>Trunk Railway—at all events from twelve to 
     <lb/>fourteen millions of dollars. If it shall come 
     <lb/>about that the sense of the people is to be 
     <lb/>taken on the Confederation question, the 
     <lb/>Intercolonial Railway feature in the plan 
     <lb/>will prove the most difficult to reconcile the 
     <lb/>people to, and especially the people of Upper 
     <lb/>Canada. In my own constituency—and I 
     <lb/>
      
            <pb n="902" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0902.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">902</fw>
     
    may venture to assert that there are not 
     <lb/>many honorable members in the House 
     <lb/>stronger in their constituencies than I am 
     <lb/>—if I were to come before my electors 
     <lb/>purely on the Confederation issue, and as 
     <lb/>the advocate of Confederacy, I know that 
     <lb/>denunciation of the 68th resolution would 
     <lb/>be a tower of strength in the hands of any 
     <lb/>anti-Confederate opponent who might choose 
     <lb/>to measure swords with me in the electoral 
     <lb/>field ; but I would be prepared to face that 
     <lb/>difficulty, and in the fullest confidence that 
     <lb/>I could do so successfully and triumph<lb break="no"/>antly, if satisfied that I could—and I think 
     <lb/>I could— show to my people that the 
     <lb/>scheme of Confederation, even with the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway inseparately interwoven 
     <lb/>in its web, is essential to our existence as a 
     <lb/>British people. (Hear, hear.) Reverting 
     <lb/>to the objectionable features I have alluded 
     <lb/>to in the resolutions before us, I have asked 
     <lb/>myself this question—Is Confederation, as 
     <lb/>offered to us, faulty, as the plan may be 
     <lb/>likely to work well for the future of the 
     <lb/>country? Is it likely to prove a satisfactory 
     <lb/>solution of the very grave political difficul<lb break="no"/>ties that beset us ? It would be in vain to 
     <lb/>attempt to conceal from ourselves that 
     <lb/>Canada is at this moment approaching the 
     <lb/>most critical period of her hitherto existence. 
     <lb/>Threatened with aggression from without, 
     <lb/>we are not in a gratifying condition of pros<lb break="no"/>perity within, let blue books and census 
     <lb/>returns say what they will to the contrary. 
     <lb/>Great and momentous events are transpiring 
     <lb/>just beyond our frontier—events which have 
     <lb/>already seriously and injuriously affected us 
     <lb/>commercially, and which must inevitably, in 
     <lb/>some way or other, affect us politically. A 
     <lb/>people until recently devoted only to indus<lb break="no"/>trial pursuits and the development of their 
     <lb/>country, have suddenly expanded into a 
     <lb/>great military power. To use their own 
     <lb/>expression, the Americans are " making 
     <lb/>history very fast," and it is impossible that 
     <lb/>that eventful history can be manufactured in 
     <lb/>a territory separated from our own by little 
     <lb/>more than an imaginary line, without our 
     <lb/>having eventually some part in its pages, 
     <lb/>for good or for evil. In fact we cannot 
     <lb/>conceal from ourselves that some great change 
     <lb/>is impending over the destinies of our 
     <lb/>country—a change that will present itself to 
     <lb/>us in some form or other, and that before 
     <lb/>long, without its being in our power to avert, 
     <lb/>though it may be in our power to shape it. 
     <lb/>There is fast growing up in England a feel<lb break="no"/>ing of want of confidence in Canada. We 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     see it in the tone of the press, in the par<lb break="no"/>liamentary debates and elsewhere. We are 
     <lb/>
     told that we are giving more trouble to the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country than we are worth. A simi<lb break="no"/>lar feeling of want of confidence, amounting 
     <lb/>
     almost to contempt, has always prevailed 
     <lb/>
     towards us in the United States. The 
     <lb/>
     ignorance of everything relating to Canada 
     <lb/>
     —of our political and social condition<lb break="no"/>of our resources and our commerce—our 
     <lb/>
     growth and our progress—that exists among 
     <lb/>
     our kindred across the border, cannot fail to 
     <lb/>
     have surprised those who have mingled 
     <lb/>
     much among them, and if not altogether 
     <lb/>
     creditable to them is certainly very humi<lb break="no"/>liating to us ; but, great as the ignorance is 
     <lb/>
     there, it is fully equalled by that which 
     <lb/>
     exists with respect to Canada, and all per<lb break="no"/>taining to Canada, among our nearer and 
     <lb/>
     dearer kindred in the old world. What can 
     <lb/>
     we do to remedy this unfortunate and humi<lb break="no"/>liating state of things ? What can we do 
     <lb/>
     to inspire confidence in us abroad ; to 
     <lb/>
     command respect ; to defy contempt? These 
     <lb/>
     appear to me to be the practical questions 
     <lb/>
     with which we have to deal. We are plainly 
     <lb/>
     told by England that we must rely more 
     <lb/>
     upon our own resources in the future than 
     <lb/>
     we have done in the past, and it is right and 
     <lb/>
     just we should do so. It appears to me that 
     <lb/>
     there are just three states of political 
     <lb/>
     existence possible for us here, when we 
     <lb/>
     emerge from the chrysalis-form in which we 
     <lb/>
     have hitherto existed. First, there is the 
     <lb/>
     attempt to stand alone as a separate nation<lb break="no"/>ality on this continent—that is one alterna<lb break="no"/>tive. Secondly, there is the prospect held 
     <lb/>
     out to us in the resolutions—namely, a union 
     <lb/>
     of all the British North American Colonies, 
     <lb/>
     under the flag of England, becoming more 
     <lb/>
     and more every year a homogeneous British 
     <lb/>
     people, and building up a consolidated British 
     <lb/>
     power on this continent. The last and 
     <lb/>
     inevitable alternative, if we reject the other 
     <lb/>
     two, is exactly that stated by my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from South Lanark (Mr. MORRIS)<lb break="no"/>absorption into the United States. It is in 
     <lb/>
     vain to shut our eyes to that fact, or that 
     <lb/>
     the time is at hand when we will have to 
     <lb/>
     make our selection. I know that the latter 
     <lb/>
     alternative—and I can speak from as 
     <lb/>
     thorough an acquaintance with the 
     <lb/>
     wants, feelings and wishes of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada as any honorable gentleman in 
     <lb/>
     this House possesses—would be most dis<lb break="no"/>tasteful to the great mass of the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country. (Loud cheers.) To myself 
     <lb/>
     personally, it would be so distasteful that it 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="903" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0903.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">903</fw>
          
     would amount to a sentence of expatriation, 
     <lb/>
     rupturing the ties and associations of a quarter 
     <lb/>
     of a century. (Hear, hear.) When my hon<lb break="no"/>orable friend the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     for Upper Canada introduced the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     to the House, he gave us to understand that 
     <lb/>
     the question, or the details of the question, 
     <lb/>
     were scarcely to be considered as open for 
     <lb/>
     debate. He told us plainly and squarely 
     <lb/>
     that the project must be viewed as a treaty 
     <lb/>
     already sealed and signed between the con<lb break="no"/>tracting parties, and would have to be accepted 
     <lb/>
     as a whole or rejected as a whole. I felt the 
     <lb/>
     force of the situation then, and when the 
     <lb/>
     same honorable gentleman came down here a 
     <lb/>
     few days since, and, in reference to the new 
     <lb/>
     phase of difficulty resulting from the turn 
     <lb/>
     taken by the elections in New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     announced that prompt and vigorous action 
     <lb/>
     was necessary, in a somewhat different direc<lb break="no"/>tion from that originally contemplated, I felt 
     <lb/>
     the force of the situation even more fully 
     <lb/>
     than at first. (Hear, hear.) And I would 
     <lb/>
     here ask to be allowed to digress a moment 
     <lb/>
     from the main question. I wish to take this 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of saying that I never had more 
     <lb/>
     than a sort of a half-confidence in the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment as now constituted. When the 
     <lb/>
     leaders of the Conservative party, with whom 
     <lb/>
     I have always acted, saw fit last year to make 
     <lb/>
     certain political combinations which, even 
     <lb/>
     they must admit, astonished and startled the 
     <lb/>
     country—combinations resulting in the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Coalition Ministry—I claimed that I 
     <lb/>
     and every member of the Conservative party, 
     <lb/>
     in this House or out of it, who chose 
     <lb/>
     to dissent from the course adopted by our 
     <lb/>
     leaders, had a right to hold ourselves absolved 
     <lb/>
    from all party ties and obligations whatever. 
     <lb/>I claimed then as I claim now, that from 
     <lb/>thenceforward I owed no political allegiance, 
     <lb/>no party fealty, to any man or any body of 
     <lb/>men on the floor of this House. ln electing 
     <lb/>to adopt for myself the anomalous and 
     <lb/>hybrid position of an " independent member," 
     <lb/>I knew full well that it was to " burn my 
     <lb/>ship "—to cast away from me all chances of 
     <lb/>political advancement ; but I never had 
     <lb/>political aspirations that warred with my own 
     <lb/>notions of political honor and consistency, or 
     <lb/>with my love of personal independence. But 
     <lb/>when great changes in our political relations 
     <lb/>are taking place ; when all feel, as I be<lb break="no"/>lieve all do feel, that a great and momentous 
     <lb/>event is impending ; when, under such 
     <lb/>circumstances, my hon. friend the Honorable 
     <lb/>Attorney General for Upper Canada announ<lb break="no"/>
            <cb/>
               
     ces, as he has done, in a frank, bold, manly 
     <lb/>
     and statesmanlike manner, prompt and vig<lb break="no"/>orous policy on the part of the Government 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with an unlooked-for difficulty—I 
     <lb/>
    allude to the difficulty growing out of the 
     <lb/>New Brunswick elections—I will tell that 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman that he and his colleagues 
     <lb/>may now—and always when boldly grappling 
     <lb/>with the political emergencies of the country 
     <lb/>—count on a cordial, earnest and admiring sup<lb break="no"/>port from me. (Hear, hear.) Without further 
     <lb/>discussion or debate, I cast my vote for and 
     <lb/>my lot with the Confederation, and this I do 
     <lb/>in the fullest confidence and belief that, how<lb break="no"/>ever faulty may be certain of the details of 
     <lb/>the scheme, and however awkward it may 
     <lb/>be to work out some of its provisions suc<lb break="no"/>cessfully, the resources of the people of these 
     <lb/>provinces, their innate adaptation for self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>government, will be found fully equal to 
     <lb/>overcoming all the difficulties and obstacles 
     <lb/>that may beset their path. I fully believe 
     <lb/>that the faults which I now object to in the 
     <lb/>plan of Confederation will, like the diseases 
     <lb/>incident to childhood, grow out of our 
     <lb/>system as we advance in political strength 
     <lb/>and stature, and that when another decade 
     <lb/>has passed over us we will be found a strong, 
     <lb/>united British people, ready and able, in 
     <lb/>peace or in war, to hold our own upon this 
     <lb/>continent. (Cheers) 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SHAN1">MR. SHANLY</persName>, resuming his remarks, 
     <lb/>
     said—Before the House rose, I had expres<lb break="no"/>sed my belief that the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     would be found equal to any emergency that 
     <lb/>
     might arise in working out the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     embraced in the resolutions, and would 
     <lb/>
     prove themselves capable of altering or 
     <lb/>
     amending it until it worked effectually and 
     <lb/>
     well for the benefit of the whole country. 
     <lb/>
     And in making the choice which I know 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country will make—as 
     <lb/>
     between annexation to the United States and 
     <lb/>
     connection with Great Britain—as between 
     <lb/>
     republicanism and monarchy—as between 
     <lb/>
     Canada our country, or Canada our state 
     <lb/>
     —I believe they will be choosing that 
     <lb/>
     which will best advance the material pros<lb break="no"/>pects, and best ensure the future happiness 
     <lb/>
     and greatness of the country. If we were 
     <lb/>
     to be absorbed into the republic, and become 
     <lb/>
     a state of the union, that would in no way 
     <lb/>
     relieve us of the great undertakings that 
     <lb/>
     are before us for the improvement and de<lb break="no"/>
          
            <pb n="904" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0904.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">904</fw>
               
          velopment of our resources. We would 
     <lb/>
     still have a large debt on our hands, of 
     <lb/>
     which, unaided, we would have to bear the 
     <lb/>
     burden ; our canals and other public works 
     <lb/>
     would be treated, not as national, but as 
     <lb/>
     state enterprises, and the expense of en<lb break="no"/>larging or extending them would have to be 
     <lb/>
     charged upon a diminished revenue, for 
     <lb/>
     nearly the whole of the revenue we now 
     <lb/>
     raise from customs and excise would go, not 
     <lb/>
     to the improvement of this state of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but would be poured into the coffers of the 
     <lb/>
     General Government at Washington. I can 
     <lb/>
     not understand how any patriotic Canadian, 
     <lb/>
     even of those who regard political matters 
     <lb/>
     from a material point of view only, can ad<lb break="no"/>vocate annexation to the United States. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve there are many persons in Canada who, 
     <lb/>
     though entertaining feelings of true loyalty to 
     <lb/>
     the Crown of England, imagine that in some 
     <lb/>
     way or other—they cannot exactly tell how<lb break="no"/>annexation would bring about an extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     and sudden state of prosperity. I differ 
     <lb/>
     entirely, even in the material and practi<lb break="no"/>cal points of view, from the theorists and 
     <lb/>
     visionaries who entertain so false a convic<lb break="no"/>tion. How, I would ask, is this country, 
     <lb/>
     with diminished means at its command, to be 
     <lb/>
     enabled to carry out those great works 
     <lb/>
     through which alone it could hope to become 
     <lb/>
     great, but the ways and means for construct<lb break="no"/>ing or   improving which still puzzle our 
     <lb/>
     financiers ? I have always been of opinion, 
     <lb/>
     since I first came to ponder carefully the 
     <lb/>
     future of Canada, that that future does not 
     <lb/>
     depend so much upon our lands as upon our 
     <lb/>
               waters. The land— the <hi rendition="simple:italic">terra firma</hi>—of 
     <lb/>
     Canada is not inviting to those who have 
     <lb/>
     tilled the soil of Great Britain or explored 
     <lb/>
     the vast fertile plains to the west of Lake 
     <lb/>
     Michigan. Our country is just on a par 
     <lb/>
     with the northern part of the State of New 
     <lb/>
     York, and with the States of Vermont and 
     <lb/>
     New Hampshire in respect of climatic condi<lb break="no"/>tions and conditions of soil. But we possess 
     <lb/>
     one immense advantage over those countries, 
     <lb/>
     an advantage which gives us a distinctive 
     <lb/>
     position on this continent—the possession of 
     <lb/>
     the noble river which flows at our feet. It 
     <lb/>
    is through that river and our great chain of 
     <lb/> inland waters that the destiny of this country 
     <lb/>is to be worked out. But we cannot fulfil 
     <lb/>our destiny—or the destiny of this country 
     <lb/>rather—by standing idle in the market 
     <lb/>place ; by, as one honorable member has 
     <lb/>suggested, doing nothing to improve our 
     <lb/>natural highways or create artificial ones, 
     <lb/>trusting to fortune or to Providence for the 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     development of our resources. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that we have a high and honorable des<lb break="no"/>tiny before us, but that it has to be worked 
     <lb/>
     out by hard toil and large expenditure ; and 
     <lb/>
     we certainly would not be in a better condi<lb break="no"/>tion to work it out were we to be united to a 
     <lb/>
     country that would at once absorb four-fifths 
     <lb/>
     of the revenue on which we now depend for 
     <lb/>
     our very existence. The improvement of 
     <lb/>
     our internal navigation is the first great 
     <lb/>
    undertaking we should consider, whether for 
     <lb/>commercial purposes or for purposes of de<lb break="no"/>fence. And as regards the promoting of our 
     <lb/>commercial interest in the improvement of 
     <lb/>our navigation, what advantage, I would ask, 
     <lb/>could we expect to gain by becoming a state  
     <lb/>of the American union ? There is not one 
     <lb/>of the seaboard states but would be in every 
     <lb/>way interested in diverting the western trade 
     <lb/>from our into their own channels, and in 
     <lb/>endeavoring to obstruct the improvements 
     <lb/>calculated to attract that trade to the St. 
     <lb/>Lawrence. The Western States, doubtless, 
     <lb/>would have interests in common with us, but 
     <lb/>they are not in a position to render us mate<lb break="no"/>rial aid for the construction of our works, 
     <lb/>being themselves borrowers for the means of 
     <lb/>carrying out their own internal improve<lb break="no"/>ments. I believe, then, that even from a 
     <lb/>material point of view, every unprejudiced 
     <lb/>thinker must admit that our future pros<lb break="no"/>perity and importance lie in preserving our 
     <lb/>individuality, and in making the most of our 
     <lb/>heritage for our own special advancement. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I feel quite certain that nine- 
     <lb break="yes"/>tenths of the people of Canada would not be 
     <lb/>deterred from taking their chance as a nation 
     <lb/>though the fear that they may some day 
     <lb/>have to strike a blow in defence of their 
     <lb/>country ; and of all else, whether of reality 
     <lb/>or of sentiment, that should be dear to a 
     <lb/>brave and loyal people. We stand here the 
     <lb/>envied possessors of, take it all in all, the 
     <lb/>greatest river in the world ; the keepers of 
     <lb/>one of the great portals to the Atlantic ; and 
     <lb/>I trust that Canadians will never be found to 
     <lb/>yield possession of their heritage till wrested 
     <lb/>from them by force ! And that must be a 
     <lb/>force, they may rest assured, not merely suf<lb break="no"/>ficient to over-match the people of these 
     <lb/>provinces, but all the power of the Empire 
     <lb/>besides. (Hear, hear.) Now, though I have 
     <lb/>said I would not enter into details, I must 
     <lb/>claim the attention of the House for a few 
     <lb/>moments longer, while I touch upon one 
     <lb/>very important point. I refer to the 69th 
     <lb/>resolution, foreshadowing the colonizing 
     <lb/>by Canada, and at the expense of Canada, 
     <lb/>
       
    
            <pb n="905" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0905.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">905</fw>
         
     of the North-West territory. There is 
     <lb/>
     not in this House one hon. member who 
     <lb/>
     appreciates more fully than I do the great 
     <lb/>
     natural resources and great future value of 
     <lb/>
     that territory ; but I am not of that class of 
     <lb/>
     sanguine and visionary politicians who would 
     <lb/>
     risk losing all by grasping too much, and in 
     <lb/>
     the vast dominion extending from Lake Su<lb break="no"/>perior to the shores of Newfoundland, the 
     <lb/>
     Confederacy will have ample scope for the 
     <lb/>
     energy and enterprise of her people for a 
     <lb/>
     long time to come. The North-West terri<lb break="no"/>tory, from its geographical position as regards 
     <lb/>
     us, is very difficult of access. A broad tract 
     <lb/>
     of barren and inhospitable country inter<lb break="no"/>venes between Lake Superior and the fertile 
     <lb/>
     plains of the Red River and the Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, which for seven months out of the 
     <lb/>
     twelve are, in fact, wholly inaccessible to us 
     <lb/>
     save through a foreign country, rendering it 
     <lb/>
     next to impossible for us alone to effect 
     <lb/>
     close connection with and colonization of 
     <lb/>
     that country. We cannot jump all at once 
     <lb/>
     from the position of colonists to that of 
     <lb/>
     colonisers. That great territory can only be 
     <lb/>
     developed, colonized and preserved to us by 
     <lb/>
     the exercise of that fostering care which the 
     <lb/>
     Empire has ever bestowed upon her colonies 
     <lb/>
     in their infancy . The Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council ( Hon. Mr. BROWN), in the 
     <lb/>
     course of the debate, said he hoped to see 
     <lb/>
     the day when our young men would go forth 
     <lb/>
     from among us to settle the North-West 
     <lb/>
     territory. I harbor no such wish. On the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, one of the fondest hopes I cherish 
     <lb/>
     as a result of Confederation is, that it will 
     <lb/>
     so attract capital and enterprise to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, so tend to develope our internal 
     <lb/>
     resources, as to offer to the youth of the 
     <lb/>
     country a field for the exercise of that 
     <lb/>
     laudable energy and ambition which  now 
     <lb/>
     cause so many of them to leave their own 
     <lb/>
     hearths and cast their lot with strangers. 
     <lb/>
     One of the greatest ills that Canada now suffers 
     <lb/>
     from is, that the young men born and brought 
     <lb/>
     up in her midst look abroad for their future, 
     <lb/>
     and bestow their energies and talents on 
     <lb/>
     another land ; and, although an immigrant 
     <lb/>
     myself, I know and admit that a man born 
     <lb/>
     and brought up here is worth any two immi<lb break="no"/>grants for the arduous task of clearing and 
     <lb/>
     settling what remains to us of the public 
     <lb/>
     domain. I hope and trust that the Confede<lb break="no"/>ration of the Provinces will create sufficient 
     <lb/>
     inducements to keep the young men of the 
     <lb/>
     country at home. (Hear, hear.) It is in 
     <lb/>
     that hope that I support the measure. I 
     <lb/>
     trust at the same time that the great North-<lb break="yes"/>
            <cb/>
               
     West territory will be preserved to our flag, 
     <lb/>
     and that, fostered by the Mother Country, it 
     <lb/>
     will in time become great and populous, and 
     <lb/>
     finally extend the British American nation 
     <lb/>
     to the shores of the Pacific. It would be 
     <lb/>
     unfair, at this late stage of the debate, to 
     <lb/>
     enter further into details. I promised that 
     <lb/>
     I would not do so. With details, indeed, it 
     <lb/>
     has all along appeared to me we had little to 
     <lb/>
     do now. If the project as a whole be good, 
     <lb/>
     surely means will be found, as we go on, to 
     <lb/>
     remedy objectionable details. With all its 
     <lb/>
     defects—and I admit there are many defects 
     <lb/>
     —there never was a written Constitution but 
     <lb/>
     had its defects—I feel confident that the 
     <lb/>
     general design set forth in the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     meets with the approval of a large majority 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Canada at all events ; and it 
     <lb/>
     would be an insult to the sound common 
     <lb/>
     sense of a people that have so long proved 
     <lb/>
     themselves capable of judging for them<lb break="no"/>selves and of governing themselves, to 
     <lb/>
     suppose them incapable of adjusting, from 
     <lb/>
     time to time, as occasion arises, the 
     <lb/>
     minor details or defects of a system 
     <lb/>
     of government to which they have resolved 
     <lb/>
     on according a fair trial. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And now, Mr. SPEAKER, what I had to say 
     <lb/>
     on this important subject of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     I have said. I promised that I would not 
     <lb/>
     weary the House by entering into details ; 
     <lb/>
     I trust that I have not done so ; but I may 
     <lb/>
     be permitted to express a hope—a hope 
     <lb/>
     founded in a deep and abiding belief—that 
     <lb/>
     the people of these provinces are and will 
     <lb/>
     prove themselves equal to the great under<lb break="no"/>taking that is before them ; that aided by 
     <lb/>
     all the commercial power of Britain in time 
     <lb/>
     of peace, by all her military and maritime 
     <lb/>
     power in war, should war unhappily come 
     <lb/>
     about, we will show to the world that we 
     <lb/>
     are not unworthy scions of the noble races 
     <lb/>
     of which we come, but that we are compe<lb break="no"/>tent to successfully work out to a great end 
     <lb/>
     the task that is intrusted to us—the noblest 
     <lb/>
     and worthiest task that can be intrusted to 
     <lb/>
     an intelligent and enlightened people—that 
     <lb/>
     of making for themselves a name and a 
     <lb/>
     place among the nations of the earth ; that 
     <lb/>
     of building up—to borrow a quotation aptly 
     <lb/>
     introduced into his able speech by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from South Lanark—a quotation from 
     <lb/>
     the speech of a renowned British statesman, 
     <lb/>
     when speaking on a great colonial question 
     <lb/>
     —that of building up " one of those great 
     <lb/>
     monuments with which England marks the 
     <lb/>
     records of her deeds— not pyramids and 
     <lb/>
     obelisks, but states and commonwealths, 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">906</fw>
        
     whose history shall be written in her lan<lb break="no"/>age." (Cheers.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOB1">MB. SCOBLE</persName>—If I were to consult my own 
     <lb/>
     feelings or my convenience, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I should certainly not rise at this advanced 
     <lb/>
     period of the debate, to offer any observations 
     <lb/>
     on the great question which has now been 
     <lb/>
     so long under discussion ; but having some<lb break="no"/>what altered the opinions that I entertained 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme submitted to the House by 
     <lb/>
     the Government, I feel it necessary to make 
     <lb/>
     a few remarks in explanation and vindi<lb break="no"/>cation of the vote I intend to give. In 
     <lb/>
     approaching the consideration of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, I shall divest myself, as far as possible, 
     <lb/>
     of all party predilections, of all personal 
     <lb/>
     preferences, and of all sectional jealousies, 
     <lb/>
     and shall endeavor to discuss it upon its 
     <lb/>
     merits, fairly and impartially— first, with 
     <lb/>
     reference to the great difficulties which un<lb break="no"/>happily exist between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada ; and, secondly, in relation to the pro<lb break="no"/>posed union of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces for purposes and objects common 
     <lb/>
     to them all. These branches of the main 
     <lb/>
     question, or rather these two questions, are 
     <lb/>
     not necessarily connected, and may, there<lb break="no"/>fore, be discussed separately ; for it is possible 
     <lb/>
     we may not be able immediately to secure 
     <lb/>
     the union of the provinces, and in that case 
     <lb/>
     we shall still have to deal with the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties of our own position, and try, if possible, 
     <lb/>
     to find a satisfactory solution for them. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And first, sir, with reference 
     <lb/>
     to the difficulties which have so long dis<lb break="no"/>tracted and disturbed us, and which hitherto 
     <lb/>
     we have in vain attempted to remove. If 
     <lb/>
     we may believe the hon. member for Brome 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. DUNKIN), whom I regret to see is not 
     <lb/>
     in his place, the difficulties to which I 
     <lb/>
     have referred are imaginary, not real. 
     <lb/>
     He told us, in his elaborate and exhaus<lb break="no"/>tive speech, that in Lower Canada the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic and non-Catholic, the English 
     <lb/>
     and French-speaking populations, were liv<lb break="no"/>ing in the most entire harmony with each 
     <lb/>
     other ; and this statement was confirmed by 
     <lb/>
     the honorable and learned gentleman the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Atty. Gen. East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER), 
     <lb/>
     who declared that so great was that har<lb break="no"/>mony, that he enjoyed the confidence not 
     <lb/>
     only of the Catholic, but the Protestant sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the community, and in fact repre<lb break="no"/>sented them both. Now, sir, I am not 
     <lb/>
     disposed to question the fact proclaimed by 
     <lb/>
     these honorable gentlemen ; on the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     I fully believe it, and ascribe the circum<lb break="no"/>
            <cb/>
               
     stance to their having common objects to 
     <lb/>
     pursue, and common interests to maintain. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Brome went further. He affected to believe 
     <lb/>
     that no difficulties of any moment existed 
     <lb/>
     between Upper and Lower Canada, and that. 
     <lb/>
     any dissatisfaction that had been manifested 
     <lb/>
     by the upper section of the province, might 
     <lb/>
     be easily removed without resorting to an 
     <lb/>
     organic change in our present Constitution. 
     <lb/>
     At least, so I understood the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man. On this point I am at issue with him, 
     <lb/>
     for I believe those difficulties to be of a most 
     <lb/>
     formidable character, and that they threaten 
     <lb/>
     at no distant day, unless they be adjusted, 
     <lb/>
     the peace and the prosperity of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince—perhaps its disintegration—perhaps 
     <lb/>
     its annexation to the United States. Every 
     <lb/>
     lover of his country must deprecate such 
     <lb/>
     results, and ought to strive to prevent them, 
     <lb/>
     or either of them. The House and the 
     <lb/>
     country will sustain me in the view I take 
     <lb/>
     of the danger of our position, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently of the importance of the measure 
     <lb/>
     now under consideration, as one means of 
     <lb/>
     removing it. (Hear, hear.) If, sir, we can 
     <lb/>
     ascertain the true cause of our difficulties, we 
     <lb/>
     shall not have to seek far or long for their 
     <lb/>
     remedy. In what do they originate? Some 
     <lb/>
     tell us in difference of nationality, of religi<lb break="no"/>ous creed, of civil institutions, and of language. 
     <lb/>
     I am not disposed to ignore these, or to deny 
     <lb/>
     that they may be made to play a conspicuous 
     <lb/>
     part in the non-settlement of sectional ques<lb break="no"/>tions ; but I utterly deny that they are the 
     <lb/>
     cause of our difficulties. Take the question of 
     <lb/>
     nationality, for instance. Those among us 
     <lb/>
     who are of French extraction may be justly 
     <lb/>
     proud of their ancestry, of their traditions, 
     <lb/>
     and of their history. They can boast of 
     <lb/>
     the mighty empire which those of kindred 
     <lb/>
     blood with themselves have founded in 
     <lb/>
     Europe, and of the vast influence which it 
     <lb/>
     exerts over the civilization and politics of 
     <lb/>
     the world ; but as they are no longer subject 
     <lb/>
     to France, but are within the allegiance of 
     <lb/>
     the British Crown, and enjoy all the fran<lb break="no"/>chises of British freemen, it appears to me 
     <lb/>
     that the question of French nationality dis<lb break="no"/>appears, whilst that of origin only remains ; 
     <lb/>
     and that now the only nationality that 
     <lb/>
     can be recognized among us is a British 
     <lb/>
     nationality, unless indeed we are pre<lb break="no"/>pared to sever our connection with the 
     <lb/>
     parent state, commence a new nationality of 
     <lb/>
     our own, or merge our political existence in 
     <lb/>
     the neighboring republic. But who, sir, 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="907" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0907.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">907</fw>
         
     among us is prepared for either of these 
     <lb/>
     alternatives ? Am I to suppose that the 
     <lb/>
     people of this province of French origin 
     <lb/>
     are less loyal to the British Crown than 
     <lb/>
     those of Anglo-Saxon descent ? Am I to 
     <lb/>
     believe that were the opportunity afforded 
     <lb/>
     them, they would reunite themselves with 
     <lb/>
     France ? These questions, I am assured, 
     <lb/>
     they will answer indignantly in the negative. 
     <lb/>
     At all events, of this I am satisfied, and I be<lb break="no"/>lieve they are satisfied, that under no govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the world can they enjoy so large an 
     <lb/>
     amount of civil, political and religious liberty 
     <lb/>
     as under British sway. The Scotch have 
     <lb/>
     their history and their traditions as well 
     <lb/>
     as the French, but where is the Scotchman 
     <lb/>
     now that is not proud of his alliance with 
     <lb/>
     England, or that would wish to dissever the 
     <lb/>
     connection, though thereby he might regain 
     <lb/>
     his parliament or his king ? I believe that 
     <lb/>
     every enlightened French-Canadian is of the 
     <lb/>
     same opinion, whatever hot-blooded and hair- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     brained demagogues may assert to the con<lb break="no"/>trary. (Hear, hear.) Take the question of 
     <lb/>
     religious creeds. These are said to present 
     <lb/>
     an insurmountable obstacle in the way of the 
     <lb/>
     settlement of our sectional difficulty. If, 
     <lb/>
     sir, we had established in this province a 
     <lb/>
     non-Catholic or Protestant creed, to which 
     <lb/>
     all would be required to subscribe, or if not 
     <lb/>
     to subscribe, at least to support by compul<lb break="no"/>sory taxation, then, sir, I could conceive 
     <lb/>
     that difference of religious opinion might 
     <lb/>
     operate in the way alleged ; but as among us 
     <lb/>
     the most complete religious liberty is en<lb break="no"/>joyed—yes, a larger amount of religious 
     <lb/>
     liberty than Catholic Christians are allowed 
     <lb/>
     in France—I can see no valid ground for the 
     <lb/>
     supposition that they would suffer in this 
     <lb/>
     respect, or that they ever had the shadow of 
     <lb/>
     a reason to fear that in doing an act of jus<lb break="no"/>tice to Upper Canadians they would be 
     <lb/>
     doing injustice to themselves. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We are, all of us, too much and too deeply 
     <lb/>
     interested in the question of religious liberty, 
     <lb/>
     to trespass on the rights of conscience, or to 
     <lb/>
     allow of state interference in matters of such 
     <lb/>
     transcendent importance as our relations to 
     <lb/>
     the Divine Being, and the service and wor<lb break="no"/>ship we owe to Him. Differing as we do in 
     <lb/>
     our creed and modes of worship, religious 
     <lb/>
     equality is necessary to the peace and good 
     <lb/>
     order of government, as well as to the life of 
     <lb/>
     religion itself among the people. We thus 
     <lb/>
     become the guardians of the most precious 
     <lb/>
     of all liberties, the right to worship God 
     <lb/>
     according to the dictates of our conscience, 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     without let or hindrance from each other or 
     <lb/>
     the state. (Hear, hear.) But it is said that 
     <lb/>
     the civil institutions of Lower Canada would 
     <lb/>
     suffer, were Upper Canada allowed a repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in the Legislature and the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in proportion to its population. I 
     <lb/>
     marvel, sir, much that such a difficulty as 
     <lb/>
     this should ever have been started. It is 
     <lb/>
     well known that the policy of Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     has ever been of the most liberal and com<lb break="no"/>prehensive character in relation to matters 
     <lb/>
     of this kind. Trace her history in connection 
     <lb/>
     with her conquest in any part of the world ; 
     <lb/>
     and when, except with the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     people, has she imposed upon them the body 
     <lb/>
     of her statute laws ? Her Constitution and 
     <lb/>
     her common law of right belong to the 
     <lb/>
     peoples subjected to her sway, and these are 
     <lb/>
     the guardians of personal and public liberty ; 
     <lb/>
     but beyond these she allows the largest free<lb break="no"/>dom in respect of customs, the peculiar insti<lb break="no"/>tutions, and the administration of civil 
     <lb/>
     justice throughout the length and breadth 
     <lb/>
     of her dominious. However desirable the 
     <lb/>
     assimilation of the laws between Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada may be, uniformity would be 
     <lb/>
     purchased at too dear a rate, if it led to dis<lb break="no"/>satisfaction among any considerable class of 
     <lb/>
     the people. Time may accomplish what 
     <lb/>
     force might destroy. As an Englishman, 
     <lb/>
     whilst I believe our laws, in the main, as 
     <lb/>
     well as our whole judicial system, are the 
     <lb/>
     best in the world, I do not believe either the 
     <lb/>
     one or the other to be perfect. To improve 
     <lb/>
     them by importing into them whatever is 
     <lb/>
     more excellent in other systems, is the 
     <lb/>
     dictate of common sense, and will always 
     <lb/>
     have my hearty concurrence. The institu<lb break="no"/>tions of Lower Canada are perfectly safe in 
     <lb/>
     the keeping of Lower Canadians, for practic<lb break="no"/>ally nothing could be gained by Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canadians in changing them, supposing they 
     <lb/>
     had the power to do so, which they neither 
     <lb/>
     have nor desire to have. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And then, sir, with respect to language, I 
     <lb/>
     can hardly suppose Lower Canadians serious 
     <lb/>
     when they imagine that any desire exists to 
     <lb/>
     destroy the use among them of their mother- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     tongue. It may do well enough to excite a 
     <lb/>
     prejudice among ignorant people to say so, 
     <lb/>
     but surely among those that are intelligent 
     <lb/>
     it can have no effect. It remains with 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians themselves to determine 
     <lb/>
     whether they will abandon the use of their 
     <lb/>
     native tongue, and adopt ours, or not. They 
     <lb/>
     are free to use either, or both, at pleasure.  
     <lb/>
     If, sir, in Lower Canada the English are 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="908" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0908.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">908</fw>
      
     compelled to learn the French language for 
     <lb/>
     business purposes and for social intercourse, 
     <lb/>
     and in Upper Canada the French are com 
     <lb/>
     pelled to learn English for similar purposes, 
     <lb/>
     surely that need not be a subject for regret 
     <lb/>
     to the one or to the other, inasmuch as both 
     <lb/>
     will gain by it. And this further advantage 
     <lb/>
     will accrue to those skilled in both languages: 
     <lb/>
     they will have access to the literature, the 
     <lb/>
     philosophy and the science of the two fore<lb break="no"/>most nations of the world. No attempt will 
     <lb/>
     be made to ignore the French language 
     <lb/>
     among us, so long as those who prefer it to 
     <lb/>
     all others shall deem it worthy of preserv<lb break="no"/>ation. (Hear, hear.) Give the people of 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada a common object 
     <lb/>
     to pursue, and common interests to sustain, 
     <lb/>
     an all questions of origin, and creed, and 
     <lb/>
     institutions, and language will vanish in the 
     <lb/>
     superior end to be attained by their closer 
     <lb/>
     union among ourselves, or by their wider 
     <lb/>
     union with other colonists under the proposed 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The great difficulty under which we labor, 
     <lb/>
     and which we seek to overcome, is a political 
     <lb/>
     and not a social one. It has its root in the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution imposed upon the province in 
     <lb/>
     1841 by the Imperial Government and 
     <lb/>
     Legislature. That Constitution was founded 
     <lb/>
     on injustice to Lower Canada, and its fruit, 
     <lb/>
     as was then foreseen, has produced the 
     <lb/>
     grossest injustice to Upper Canada. Had the 
     <lb/>
     principle of representation based on popula<lb break="no"/>tion been then adopted, and the line which 
     <lb/>
     separated Upper from Lower Canada been 
     <lb/>
     obliterated, except for judicial purposes, 
     <lb/>
     we should now be working harmoniously 
     <lb/>
     together, instead of seeking organic changes 
     <lb/>
     in the Constitution, in order to preserve 
     <lb/>
     ourselves from revolution and anarchy. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Bagot (Hon. Mr. LAFRAMBOISE), in his 
     <lb/>
     speech, quoted largely from the report of 
     <lb/>
     Lord DURHAM, to show that that distin<lb break="no"/>guished nobleman was prejudiced against 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadians, and was indisposed to do 
     <lb/>
     them justice. By selecting here and there 
     <lb/>
     passages from that able document, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman gave a colorable appearance to 
     <lb/>
     his accusation, but nothing more. I deem 
     <lb/>
     it an act of justice to Lord DURHAM to 
     <lb/>
     supplement the extracts read by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member, by further extracts which will shew 
     <lb/>
     that His Lordship was governed by exact and 
     <lb/>
     impartial justice in the measures which he 
     <lb/>
     recommended to heal the divisions which 
     <lb/>
     then existed in Canada. With the prescient 
     <lb/>
     sagacity of a true statesman, he said:-<lb/></p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">As the mere amalgamation of the two Houses

     to each, a parliamentary commission should be

     larger population, and was entitled to the 
     <lb/>
     larger representation in the united Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. But the Imperial authorities based 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution which they gave to Canada, 
     <lb/>
     not on representation according to numbers, 
     <lb/>
     but on equality or equal numbers of repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives for the two sections of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and the result we have to deplore this 
     <lb/>
     day. His Lordship goes on to say:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">I am averse to every plan that has been pro<lb break="no"/>posed for giving an equal number of members to 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     think the same object will be attained without 
     <lb/>
     violating the principles of representation, and 
     <lb/>
     without any such appearance of injustice in the

     <lb/>
     to me that any such electoral management, found<lb break="no"/>ed on present provincial divisions, would tend to 
     <lb/>

     idea of disunion.

     These are words of wisdom, but they were

     not listened to at home, and the conse<lb break="no"/>quences have been lamentable. We find

     Upper and Lower Canada in a state of

     find the Legislature brought to a dead-lock,

     and our public men driven to their wit's

     <lb/>
     important province. And then, in reference

     Such were the opinions and such the basis of 
     <lb/>
     that great scheme of union which Lord DUR<lb break="no"/>HAM contemplated, and which he aimed to 
     <lb/>
     secure to Upper and Lower Canada. It con<lb break="no"/>sisted of two parts: representation based on 
     <lb/>
     population in the Legislature; and guarantees 
     <lb/>
     that the peculiar institutions of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     should be protected, and her rights respected. 
     <lb/>
     But His Lordship had larger views before him 
     <lb/>
     than the union of Upper and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     He was anxious that all the British colonies 
     <lb/>
     in North America should be consolidated 
     <lb/>
     under one government. When His Lordship 
     <lb/>
     received his commission from the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown, he was strongly in favor of the Federal 
     <lb/>
    rinciple in its application to the then state of 
     <lb/>Upper and Lower Canada; but a more pro<lb break="no"/>found study of the question when in this 
     <lb/>country, and from consultation with the lead<lb break="no"/>ing men in the several American Colonies, he 
     <lb/>arrived at the conclusion that a Legislative 
     <lb/>would be preferable to a Federal union of 
     <lb/>these colonies. The change in his opinion is 
     <lb/>thus stated in the extracts from his report, 
     <lb/>with which I shall now trouble the House. 
     <lb/>By a legislative union he means " a complete 
     <lb/>incorporation of the provinces included in it 
     <lb/>under one Legislature exercising universal 
     <lb/>and sole legislative authority over all of them, 
     <lb/>exactly in the same manner as the Parliament 
     <lb/>legislates alone for the whole of the British 
     <lb/>Isles." After a careful review of the whole 
     <lb/>subject, Lord DURHAM says:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">I had still more strongly impressed upon me 
     <lb/>the rest advantages of a united government; 
     <lb/>and was gratified by finding the leading minds 
     <lb/>of the various colonies strongly and generally 
     <lb/>inclined to a scheme that would elevate their 
     <lb/>countries into something like a national exist<lb break="no"/>ence. I thought that it would be the tendency 
     <lb/>of a Federation, sanctioned and consolidated by 
     <lb/>a monarchical government, gradually to become 
     <lb/>a complete Legislative union; and that thus, while 
     <lb/>conciliating the French of Lower Canada, by 
     <lb/>leaving them the government of their own pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and their own internal legislation, I might 
     <lb/>provide for the protection of British interests by

     the period of gradual transition is past in Lower

     His Lordship had no fears that such an union

     <lb/>
     means of strengthening the bonds which 
     <lb/>
     united them, and of its proving an advantage 
     <lb/>
     to both. On this point he says:-<lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">I do not anticipate that a colonial legislature

     On the contrary, I believe that the practical

     His Lordship then strongly recommends 
     <lb/>
     the union of the two Canadas under one

     Legislature, and of reconstituting them as one 
     <lb/>
     province; and " the bill," he says, " should 
     <lb/>
     contain provisions by which any or all of the

     <lb/>
     These remarkable passages drawn from Lord

     DURHAM'S report, appear to me to embody the 
     <lb/>
     very spirit of the scheme submitted to our 
     <lb/>
     consideration by the Government, and coming 
     <lb/>
     to as recommended by so high an authority, 
     <lb/>
     merit our best attention; and if realized, 
     <lb/>
     though not in the precise form many of us 
     <lb/>
     might desire, we may hope it will heal our 
     <lb/>
     intestine divisions, and open to us a glorious 
     <lb/>
     future. Representation based on popula<lb break="no"/>tion is denied to Upper Canada, unless coupled 
     <lb/>
     with the Confederation of all the British North 
     <lb/>
     American colonies; the separation of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, pure and simple, is not to be thought 
     <lb/>
     of; to return to the positicn we occupied 
     <lb/>
     only a year ago, would be to plunge once more 
     <lb/>
     into political contests, with feelings embittered 
     <lb/>
     by disappointment; and therefore, with reser<lb break="no"/>vations affecting details only, I shall feel it 
     <lb/>
     to be my duty to give the motion before the

     House my best support. (Hear, hear.) And 
     <lb/>
     now, sir, I propose to consider the scheme 
     <lb/>
     submitted to us in relation to the larger ques~ 
     <lb/>
     tion of the union of all the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces under one government, 
     <lb/>
     for purposes common to them all. I needed 
     <lb/>
     not the arguments or the eloquence of hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen on the Treasury benches to 
     <lb/>
     convince me of the immense importance of 
     <lb/>
     such a junction as shall lead to the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of a new nationality, and secure to 
     <lb/>
    generations yet unborn the advantages of   
     <lb/>unity and power. With the permission of 
     <lb/>the House, I will read an extract from a 
     <lb/>letter which I addressed to the Duke of 
     <lb/>NEWCASTLE in 1859, when that nobleman 
     <lb/>visited this country in the suite of His Roy<lb break="no"/>al Highness the PRINCE of WALES, bearing 
     <lb/>directly on this point. Having briefly stated 
     <lb/>the grounds which induced me to write to 
     <lb/>His Grace, I said:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The possessions of Great Britain in North 
     <lb/>
     America are not only vast in extent and marvel<lb break="no"/>lous in resources, but for facility of internal com<lb break="no"/>munication by lakes and rivers, are unrivalled; 
     <lb/>
     and their geographical position is such as to 
     <lb/>
     make them of the very last importance to the 
     <lb/>
     political and commercial greatness of the British 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
               
     Empire. Possessing the control of this magni<lb break="no"/>ficent part of the American continent, with com<lb break="no"/>paratively easy access through it from the Atlan<lb break="no"/>tic to the Pacific shores, Great Britain need not 
     <lb/>
     fear the rivalry nor dread the reponderance of 
     <lb/>
     the United States. But in order that she may 
     <lb/>
     derive from it all the advantages it is so well cal<lb break="no"/>culated to afford, she must have a fixed and 
     <lb/>
     determinate policy, wisely conceived, practical in 
     <lb/>
     its details, and perseveringly carried out. In 
     <lb/>
     the planting of future colonies in British North 
     <lb/>
     America, care should be taken to make them as 
     <lb/>
     few as possible. I regret, therefore, that it ap<lb break="no"/>pears to have been determined to give the Red 
     <lb/>
     River settlement a distinct political existence. 
     <lb/>
     Canada should have been allowed to expand 
     <lb/>
     westwards to the Rocky Mountains, instead of 
     <lb/>
     being cooped up within her present limits. She 
     <lb/>
     would then have been able to absorb more easily 
     <lb/>
     the outlying colonies of Newfoundland, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island on the Atlantic, and British Columbia and 
     <lb/>
     Vancouver's Island on the Pacific. Consolidated 
     <lb/>
     ultimately under one government, after the model 
     <lb/>
     of the Mother Country, with such modifications 
     <lb/>
     as the circumstances of the case might require, an 
     <lb/>
     empire might be formed over which, hereafter, 
     <lb/>
     some one ranch of the Royal Family might 
     <lb/>
     reign a constitutional monarch, over a free and 
     <lb/>
     united people. In the meantime there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     to hinder the appointment of a Prince of the 
     <lb/>
     blood royal to be Viceroy over all the possessions 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain in North America, and under 
     <lb/>
     him, lieutenant-governors to administer the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of the separate dependencies, until they 
     <lb/>
     could be gradually and permanently united. 
     <lb/>
     Your Grace will perceive from this statement that 
     <lb/>
     I object to the American system of federation, 
     <lb/>
     and would oppose to it the unification of the 
     <lb/>
     British colonies in this part of the world. One 
     <lb/>
     government, one legislature, one judiciary, 
     <lb/>
     instead of many, with their conflicting institu<lb break="no"/>tions, interests, and jurisdictions, is what I 
     <lb/>
     would respectfully venture to recommend as the 
     <lb/>
     true policy of the Mother Country on this side of 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic, it has been with the most 
     <lb/>
     splendid results the other. A Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, such as that of the United States, for 
     <lb/>
     instance, is and must be weak in itself, from the 
     <lb/>
     discordant elements of which it is composed, and 
     <lb/>
     will be found to contain within itself the seeds of 
     <lb/>
     disorganization and dissolution. The multiplica<lb break="no"/>tion of colonies in a new country like this is 
     <lb/>
     tantamount to the multiplication of petty 
     <lb/>
     sovereignties, and the creation of rivalries and 
     <lb/>
     antagonisms which, sooner or later, will manifest 
     <lb/>
     themselves, and prevent the develoment of that 
     <lb/>
     greatness, power and prosperity which an oppo<lb break="no"/>site policy, wisely administered, would, my 
     <lb/>
     judgment, effectually promote and secure. By 
     <lb/>
     unification, however, I do not mean centralization. 
     <lb/>
     I am no friend to the bureaucratic system ot 
     <lb/>
     France, Austria, and Prussia. A government, to 
     <lb/>
     be strong and respected, must leave to the people 
     <lb/>
     the largest amount of liberty consistent with the

           ment of their local affairs. Such a municipal 
     <lb/>
     system as we have in Canada is all that is neces<lb break="no"/>sary to secure that end. With the political fran<lb break="no"/>chise extended to all classes of the community, 
     <lb/>
     whether native-born or naturalized, the national 
     <lb/>
     life could not fail to develope itself in forms that 
     <lb/>
     would give permanence to its institutions, con<lb break="no"/>tentment to its people, and strength to its gov<lb break="no"/>ernment.

     The opinions which I entertained in 1859 I

     entertain now. Now, as then, I am in favor

     formation and practical working of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the United States. The greatest

     and a commanding influence. To diffuse those 
     <lb/>
     powers, or even to share them with state or 
     <lb/>
     local governments, they felt would weaken it 
     <lb/>
     in its most vital parts. They would, there<lb break="no"/>fore, have stripped the States of every attri<lb break="no"/>bute of sovereignty, and confined their action 
     <lb/>
     to matters of a purely local or municipal char<lb break="no"/>acter; but they had not the power, and the

     not be lost upon us; and for myself, I hesitate 
     <lb/>
     not to say that if, in the proposed Feder<lb break="no"/>ation of the British American colonies, we 
     <lb/>
     were to follow the example of the framers of 
     <lb/>
     the Government of the United States, or to 
     <lb/>
     copy its Constitution, it would have my most 
     <lb/>
     determined opposition. The scheme before 
     <lb/>
     us, however, is formed after a different model, 
     <lb/>
     and in its essential features is in perfect con<lb break="no"/>trast to that on which the Constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     United States is based. It is true it creates 
     <lb/>
     local governments with large legislative and 
     <lb/>
     executive powers; it is true it gives those 
     <lb/>
     governments concurrent powers with the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government; it is true it gives them pos<lb break="no"/>session of the public lands within their several 
     <lb/>
     jurisdictions; it is true it allows two of those 
     <lb/>
     governments to levy export duties on lumber, 
     <lb/>
     coal and other minerals,—and looked at in the 
     <lb/>
     light of an advanced political science, this is 
     <lb/>
     to be lamented ; but looked at in the light of 
     <lb/>
     possible and practicable statesmanship, it was 
     <lb/>
     unavoidable. I am, therefore, prepared to 
     <lb/>
     accept it as a whole, as in fact the best that 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     could have been produced under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances in which it was framed. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     A careful analysis of the scheme convinces me 
     <lb/>
     that the powers conferred on the General or 
     <lb/>
               Central Government secures it all the attri<lb break="no"/>butes of sovereignty, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">veto</hi> power 
     <lb/>
     which its executive will possess, and to which 
     <lb/>
     all local legislation will be subject, will pre<lb break="no"/>vent a conflict of laws and jurisdictions in all 
     <lb/>
     matters of importance, so that I believe in its 
     <lb/>
     working it will be found, if not in form yet 
     <lb/>
     in fact and practically, a legislative union. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Taking this general and, as I 
     <lb/>
     believe, correct view of the case, I shall ab<lb break="no"/>stain from all criticism of its minor details, in 
     <lb/>
     the hope that what is found hereafter imma<lb break="no"/>ture or unworkable will be abandoned by 
     <lb/>
     general consent. The Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     will take care, no doubt, that that part of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme which conflicts with the prerogatives 
     <lb/>
     of the Crown will be removed, or, at all events, 
     <lb/>
     be brought into harmony with them. On one 
     <lb/>
     or two points brought out very fully by the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic members of the House in oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to the scheme, I shall venture to 
     <lb/>
     offer a few remarks. They take exception to 
     <lb/>
     the power conferred on the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the matter of marriage and divorce. 
     <lb/>
     I think, sir, the power is very properly placed 
     <lb/>
     there. I respect their religious convictions; 
     <lb/>
     as a Protestant, I ask them to respect mine. 
     <lb/>
     We owe each other mutual toleration. If 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant section of this House and this 
     <lb/>
     province do not regard marriage as a sacra<lb break="no"/>ment, and, therefore, inviolable and indis<lb break="no"/>soluble, I believe they will be found to have as 
     <lb/>
     high an opinion of the sacred obligations in<lb break="no"/>volved in it, and admit it to be as binding upon 
     <lb/>
     the conscience of all who enter upon that holy 
     <lb/>
    and honorable state, as their Catholic fellow- 
               <lb break="yes"/>subjects. But <hi rendition="simple:italic">quod</hi> the state or the civil 
     <lb/>government of the country, Protestants at 
     <lb/>large, regard marriage as a civil contract 
     <lb/>only, and consequently dissoluble on cause 
     <lb/>shown. This view ought not to be offensive 
     <lb/>to the judgment or the conscience of our Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic friends, for it will not and cannot inter<lb break="no"/>fere in the slightest degree, either with the 
     <lb/>form or the continuity of their marriages; 
     <lb/>and surely they, will grant to us, the non- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Catholic section of the province, that liberty 
     <lb/>of conscience in this matter which they claim 
     <lb/>and enjoy themselves. (Hear, hear.) Another 
     <lb/>point touched upon by my honorable friend 
     <lb/>the member for Peterborough (Col. HAUL<lb break="no"/>TAIN) demands from me a passing remark. I 
     <lb/>believe that my honorable friend correctly in<lb break="no"/>terpreted the feelings of Protestants in Lower 
     <lb/>

     Canada, when he referred to the probable effect 
     <lb/>
     of the Pope's encyclical on the Catholic mind 
     <lb/>
     of the country. They think that if the 
     <lb/>
     principles inculcated in that letter were acted 
     <lb/>
     upon, their religious liberties and privileges 
     <lb/>
     would be in peril. But it would appear that 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend had not the true key to 
     <lb/>
     the interpretation of that famous document. 
     <lb/>
     Catholic commentators find it to be perfectly 
     <lb/>
     innocuous when properly understood. Be 
     <lb/>
     that as it may, I rely rather on the good 
     <lb/>
     sense and feeling of Catholics them<lb break="no"/>selves, and above all, on the religious liberty 
     <lb/>
     secured to us in this province, than on the 
     <lb/>
     Pope's encyclical, for the protection of our 
     <lb/>
     liberties, whether civil or religious. Let us 
     <lb/>
     be united in object and in interest as a peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and I have no fear, however diversified 
     <lb/>
     our opinions may be on matters personal 
     <lb/>
     to ourselves, but that we shall grow up to be 
     <lb/>
     a great nation, and that a glorious future 
     <lb/>
     awaits us. (Hear, hear.) As there are yet 
     <lb/>
     several honorable gentlemen to address the 
     <lb/>
     House, I shall not trespass on its attention 
     <lb/>
     much longer, as I am anxious the debate 
     <lb/>
     should be brought to a close as soon as pos<lb break="no"/>sible, in order that the Government may be 
     <lb/>
     able, by its re resentatives in England, to 
     <lb/>
     perform those important duties which are so 
     <lb/>
     urgent and so necessary at the present mo<lb break="no"/>ment. ( Hear, hear.) Before sitting down, 
     <lb/>
     however, I wish to make one or two remarks 
     <lb/>
     on the conflicting opinions entertained by 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen on the permanency of 
     <lb/>
     our relations to the Mother Country. I do 
     <lb/>
     not believe there is any large party there who 
     <lb/>
     desire to separate themselves from us. On 
     <lb/>
     the contrary, I believe the great bulk of the 
     <lb/>
     British people are proud of the connection, 
     <lb/>
     and are prepared to maintain it if we do our part 
     <lb/>
     in cultivating that connection by meeting their 
     <lb/>
     just and reasonable demands. There can be 
     <lb/>
     no doubt that one cause of dissatisfaction ex<lb break="no"/>pressed in England towards us has resulted 
     <lb/>
     from our policy. I shall venture no 
     <lb/>
     opinion on that policy just now, whether it 
     <lb/>
     was wise or otherwise, but it strikes me very 
     <lb/>
     forcibly that we have it now in our power to 
     <lb/>
     set ourselves right on that point, and to it I 
     <lb/>
     would respectfully invite the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     Government. The question of our defences 
     <lb/>
     is very earnestly pressed on our attention by 
     <lb/>
     the authorities at home; but that is undoubt<lb break="no"/>edly an Imperial as well as a provincial ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and might be dealt with in this way. If 
     <lb/>
     the British overnment and people really de<lb break="no"/>sire to maintain their connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Canadas, they are under the obligation, both 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     moral and political, to afford them adequate 
     <lb/>
     defence in money, material and men, in case 
     <lb/>
     of necessity; for it is clear that without these 
     <lb/>
     our position, except at one or two points, is 
     <lb/>
     clearly indefensible. On the other hand, if 
     <lb/>
     we are anxious to continue our relations with 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country, then we are bound by 
     <lb/>
     the highest considerations of policy to adjust 
     <lb/>
     our tariff on imports in such a manner as to 
     <lb/>
     give no real cause of complaint to the people 
     <lb/>
     at home. I am persuaded that if we do this 
     <lb/>
     it will smooth the way for the removal of any 
     <lb/>
     hostility that may have been shown towards 
     <lb/>
     us by any class of politicians in England. 
     <lb/>
     Privileges and duties are reciprocal, and 
     <lb/>
     should be met in a cordial spirit; and let it 
     <lb/>
     be remembered that material interests are, of 
     <lb/>
     all others, the most binding upon nations in 
     <lb/>
     amity with each other, and are the best cal<lb break="no"/>culated to maintain our relations undisturbed 
     <lb/>
     with the parent state. (Hear, hear.) With 
     <lb/>
     me, sir, it is a matter cl extreme importance 
     <lb/>
     that our relations with the Mother Country 
     <lb/>
     should be settled on a firm and permanent 
     <lb/>
     basis. (Hear, hear.) I therefore quite agree 
     <lb/>
     with the hon. gentleman (Mr. SHANLY) who 
     <lb/>
     has just sat down, on the necessity of pressing 
     <lb/>
     this point on the attention of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government. Mr. SPEAKER, my most ear<lb break="no"/>nest desire and prayer is that by a well-con<lb break="no"/>sidered scheme of union—a union that shall 
     <lb/>
     embrace the whole of the British posessions 
     <lb/>
     in North America, from the Atlantic to the 
     <lb/>
     Pacific oceans, under one government—re<lb break="no"/>sults may follow of the most beneficial char<lb break="no"/>acter, both to the colonies and the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country; and that Providence may so guide 
     <lb/>
     the counsels and influence the acts of those 
     <lb/>
     who now direct our affairs, as to secure to the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country, and to succeeding gen<lb break="no"/>erations, the blessings of a well-ordered gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and a wise administration of public 
     <lb/>
     affairs. (Cheers)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RANK1">COL. RANKIN</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, never 
     <lb/>
     has there been an occasion, since I have had 
     <lb/>
     the honor of occupying a seat in this House, 
     <lb/>
     when I have been so deeply impressed with 
     <lb/>
     the importance of the subject under consid<lb break="no"/>eration, as I am to-night. Every honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who has addressed the House 
     <lb/>
     during the course of this debate has told you, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that he rose under some degree of 
     <lb/>
     embarrassment. I, too, might give you the 
     <lb/>
     same assurance, but I shall not dwell upon 
     <lb/>
     it; suffice it to say, I only speak because I 
     <lb/>
     think it my duty to explain the reasons 
     <lb/>
     which induce me to take the view I entertain 
     <lb/>
    of the subject before the House. I have 
     <lb/>
     
            <pb n="913" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0913.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">913</fw>
   
     listened, sir, with great attention to the 
     <lb/>
     speeches which have fallen from honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on both sides ; and it is to me a 
     <lb/>
     matter of congratulation to observe, that at 
     <lb/>
     last, something has arisen which has given 
     <lb/>
     a higher tone to the debates of this House, 
     <lb/>
     and to the utterances of our public men. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I attribute this improvement 
     <lb/>
     in a great measure to the fact that we are 
     <lb/>
     discussing a question of greater importance 
     <lb/>
     than has ever before been brought under 
     <lb/>
     our consideration; that we are at length 
     <lb/>
     taming our attention to something worthy 
     <lb/>
     of the consideration of gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     aspire to establish for themselves the 
     <lb/>
     reputation of statesmen, while it has 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately happened heretofore that too 
     <lb/>
     much of our time has been spent in 
     <lb/>
     discussing questions which ought properly 
     <lb/>
    to be left to the consideration of a municipal, 
     <lb/>rather than of a legislative body. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Inasmuch, sir, as I have reasons, 
     <lb/>which perhaps are somewhat peculiar to 
     <lb/>myself, for entertaining the views which I 
     <lb/>hold upon this question, I trust I may be 
     <lb/>pardoned if I refer to some of the most 
     <lb/>prominent events connected with the progress 
     <lb/>of affairs in Canada for some   years past. 
     <lb/>And here I may remark, that though the 
     <lb/>country has become more important, though 
     <lb/>our population has increased, and our pros<lb break="no"/>perity advanced, in perhaps as rapid a 
     <lb/>degree as any reasonable person could have 
     <lb/>expected, there are still some respects in 
     <lb/>which we have not advanced, but rather 
     <lb/>retrograded than otherwise. I mean that 
     <lb/>the tone of feeling among the prominent 
     <lb/>men of the country has rather deteriorated 
     <lb/>than improved, since the introduction of 
     <lb/>responsible government. I, sir, am old- 
     <lb break="yes"/>fashioned enough to believe, that although 
     <lb/>there may have been some objections to the 
     <lb/>mode of government which existed prior to 
     <lb/>the union, there was a higher tone among 
     <lb/>our public men in those days than has 
     <lb/>prevailed for some years past. Still, no doubt, 
     <lb/>there was much cause of complaint on the part 
     <lb/>of those who originated the agitation, which 
     <lb/>resulted in the rebellion of 1837. And speak<lb break="no"/>ing now in the light of the experience, many 
     <lb/>of us would probably be prepared to admit 
     <lb/>those gentlemen who took a prominent part 
     <lb/>in bringing about that rebellion, and whom 
     <lb/>we then considered it a duty to put down, 
     <lb/>were in reality true benefactors of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. Hear, hear} The result has proved 
     <lb/>that they differed only from those who 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     thought it their duty to oppose them, in that 
     <lb/>
     they were in advance of the men and the 
     <lb/>
     sentiment of that day. They foresaw, indeed, 
     <lb/>
     earlier than their neighbors, that the state 
     <lb/>
     of things which then existed could not long 
     <lb/>
     continue—they appreciated grievances sooner 
     <lb/>
     than others. (Hear, hear.) And thence 
     <lb/>
     arose the political struggles, which resulted, 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately, in a resort to arms. That 
     <lb/>
     insurrection was happily suppressed ; and 
     <lb/>
     the statesmen of the great nation of which 
     <lb/>
     we are proud to be subjects, after the rebel<lb break="no"/>lion was ended, immediately applied them<lb break="no"/>selves to the consideration of the best means 
     <lb/>
     of removing the just causes of complaint 
     <lb/>
     which had led to the revolt. The first step 
     <lb/>
     was to bring about a union of the two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. That union was distasteful to many, 
     <lb/>who were forced reluctantly to accede to it. 
     <lb/>There were at that time gentlemen worthy 
     <lb/>in every way of the respect of their fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>countrymen who denounced the union, and 
     <lb/>predicted evil results from it. But is there 
     <lb/>an intelligent man in this country who will 
     <lb/>now say that those predictions have been 
     <lb/>realized? I do not think there is an hon. 
     <lb/>member of this House, on either side, who 
     <lb/>would expect anybody to believe he spoke 
     <lb/>sincerely if he asserted that the union had 
     <lb/>been attended by disastrous results. The 
     <lb/>time has passed for hostile feelings to exist 
     <lb/>between the people of the two sections of 
     <lb/>this country—I say the two sections, for 
     <lb/>I have never allowed myself to speak of 
     <lb/>Upper and Lower Canada as separate and 
     <lb/>distinct provinces or countries, as has been 
     <lb/>too much the practice. From the moment 
     <lb/>the union was consummated, I felt that we 
     <lb/>should look upon ourselves as inhabitants of 
     <lb/>one country, and not as the people of two 
     <lb/>distinct provinces. In some instances legis<lb break="no"/>lation might operate with greater advantage 
     <lb/>to one section, while in others it would be 
     <lb/>more beneficial to the other section. But 
     <lb/>whatever was for the benefit of one was for the 
     <lb/>good of the whole, inasmuch as it added to the 
     <lb/>importance, the wealth and the influence of 
     <lb/>the whole. (Hear, hear.) But there were 
     <lb/>many people who, for many years after the 
     <lb/>consummation of the union, writhed under 
     <lb/>the state of things thereby brought about, 
     <lb/>and were disposed to sneer at responsible 
     <lb/>government, and to speak of it as a mis<lb break="no"/>fortune rather than as a boon. Sir, we have 
     <lb/>had some severe lessons, such as all indivi<lb break="no"/>duals passing through the period intervening 
     <lb/>between childhood and manhood must to 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="914" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0914.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">914</fw>
        
     some extent be subjected to, and to which 
     <lb/>
     communities rapidly growing from insigni<lb break="no"/>ficance to importance must also submit. The 
     <lb/>
     first lesson we were taught under the system 
     <lb/>
     of responsible government was in the passage 
     <lb/>
     of the bill for the indemnification of losses 
     <lb/>
     sustained during the rebellion in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I, sir, happened to belong to a 
     <lb/>
     class in Upper Canada, at that time, who 
     <lb/>
     would have considered it almost, if not quite, 
     <lb/>
     justifiable to resort to arms in order to resist  
     <lb/>the enforcement of that law. But, as time 
     <lb/>has rolled on, I have become more capable 
     <lb/>of appreciating the course then taken, and 
     <lb/>I am now prepared to admit that it was but 
     <lb/>just and reasonable that that law should be 
     <lb/>enacted. (Hear, hear.) I then sympathised 
     <lb/>with those who burned the Parliament House 
     <lb/>in Montreal, and am willing to admit, that 
     <lb/>if I had been there, I would probably have 
     <lb/>been one of the first to apply the torch to 
     <lb/>that building, while under the influence of 
     <lb/>the feelings which inspired me at that time. 
     <lb/>But experience and reflection have since 
     <lb/>taught me to regard things from a very 
     <lb/>different point of view. We were then 
     <lb/>taught practically to feel that we really did 
     <lb/>govern ourselves. We were made to taste 
     <lb/>the consquences of self-government. We 
     <lb/>were taught that questions like these must 
     <lb/>be decided by the will of the majority of the 
     <lb/>people, as made known through their 
     <lb/>representatives in Parliament. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>There was no mistake in that case as to 
     <lb/>what the will of that majority was; and I 
     <lb/>am free to admit that the rebellious spirit 
     <lb/>then indulged in, on account of the passage 
     <lb/>of that bill, was in some respects more 
     <lb/>worthy of condemnation than the conduct 
     <lb/>of those who resorted to arms to redress the 
     <lb/>real grievances which caused the rebellion; 
     <lb/>and, in course of time, many of those who 
     <lb/>were most incensed at the passage of this 
     <lb/>measure, began to realize the fact that it was 
     <lb/>only one of the natural consequences of the 
     <lb/>new state of things ; and, step by step, the 
     <lb/>people of Canada have come to understand 
     <lb/>and appreciate the advantages of self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>government. They have come now to 
     <lb/>understand that whatever is deliberately 
     <lb/>expressed as the will of the majority of the 
     <lb/>people, ought to be submitted to by the 
     <lb/>minority. (Hear, hear.) And I hope we 
     <lb/>have arrived at that stage in our political 
     <lb/>education, that there is no man in Canada 
     <lb/>who would now justify a resort to violence 
     <lb/>to resist any enactment by this Legislature, 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     no matter how unpalatable it might be to 
     <lb/>
     the minority, and no matter how important 
     <lb/>
     that minority might be. Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     we are now invited to direct our attention 
     <lb/>
     to another union of a different kind, and on 
     <lb/>
     a larger scale: Of that union I have long 
     <lb/>
     been an advocate. I have looked forward to 
     <lb/>
     it for years, as a desirable event; and in 
     <lb/>
     proof that I have done so, I may be per<lb break="no"/>mitted to read two or three lines from the 
     <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and Proceedings</hi> of this House, so far 
     <lb/>
     back as the year 1856. I do not desire to 
     <lb/>
     claim for myself any special credit in the 
     <lb/>
     matter, but merely wish to establish my 
     <lb/>
     consistency, in being now, as I am, the 
     <lb/>
     uncompromising advocate of this measure<lb break="no"/>in being prepared to go so far, as I declared 
     <lb/>
     was my intention the other day, as to vote for 
     <lb/>
     the motion submitted by the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West for the previous question, 
     <lb/>
     which, under ordinary circumstances, I 
     <lb/>
     should look upon as a very high-handed 
     <lb/>
     and objectionable proposal. Sir, in 1856 I 
     <lb/>
     called the attention of the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West—who, if in his place, would 
     <lb/>
     readily recollect the fact—to a scheme such 
     <lb/>
     as that now under consideration. I urged it 
     <lb/>
     upon him, and prayed him to bring his great 
     <lb/>
     abilities to bear upon the attainment of an 
     <lb/>
     end of sufficient importance to be worthy of 
     <lb/>
     his continued exertions. I endeavored to 
     <lb/>
     convince him that, by identifying his name 
     <lb/>
     with the attainment of some great and im<lb break="no"/>portant end, he would establish for himself a 
     <lb/>
     reputation worthy of his talents. I failed, 
     <lb/>
     however, to enlist the sympathies of that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman with my views. His idea 
     <lb/>
     was, that it was premature to entertain any 
     <lb/>
     such project—that it might be well enough, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, at some future period, but that it 
     <lb/>
     was then quite out of the question ; I never<lb break="no"/>theless proceeded to draft a series of resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, and gave notice of them two orthree 
     <lb/>
     weeks in advance of the day I intended 
     <lb/>
     to move them. During the intervening 
     <lb/>
     period, I addressed myself to honorable 
     <lb/>
     members of the House, but, I regret to say, 
     <lb/>
     met with no encouragement from any quar<lb break="no"/>ter, with one single exception—the late Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. MERRITT cordially approving of the 
     <lb/>
     idea. Finding that sufficient support could 
     <lb/>
     not be obtained in the House to commend 
     <lb/>
     the idea to the country, I felt it to be pru<lb break="no"/>dent—as even leaders of parties sometimes 
     <lb/>
     do under similar circumstances—not to make 
     <lb/>
     an exhibition of my own weakness; I came to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that the resolutions would not 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="915" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0915.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">915</fw>
        
     receive favorable consideration from any con<lb break="no"/>siderable number of hon. members, and that 
     <lb/>
     to move them would only be to attract atten<lb break="no"/>tion to what might be looked upon as my 
     <lb/>
     own eccentricities. I accordingly abandoned 
     <lb/>
     the idea of pressing them at that time. But, 
     <lb/>
     with the leave of the House, I will now read 
     <lb/>
     the motion, which is as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><persName ref="pers:RANK1">Mr. RANKIN</persName>—On Wednesday next (30th of

     general state of the province, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     considering the subject of a union of the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Colonies, with a view to an 
     <lb/>
     address to Her Majesty to recommend the same

            <p>This, sir, I am happy to say, is the proposal 
     <lb/>which the Government are now carrying out. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) This was what I proposed nine 
     <lb/>years ago, and I shall have the greatest 
     <lb/>pleasure now in giving them my hearty sup<lb break="no"/>port while they endeavor to carry it into 
     <lb/>effect ; and I congratulate them on having, 
     <lb/>though so long after myself, arrived at the 
     <lb/>same conclusion. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—It was 
     <lb/>
     advocated long ago by Bishop STRACHAN 
     <lb/>
     and other gentlemen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RANK1">MR. RANKIN</persName>—Far be it from me to 
     <lb/>
     deny that these gentlemen are entitled to the 
     <lb/>
     credit of having suggested the idea, long 
     <lb/>
     before I was of an age to think of anything 
     <lb/>
     of the kind. But I may congratulate myself 
     <lb/>
     that I had conceived the same idea—without 
     <lb/>
    borrowing it from them—which had been 
     <lb/>previously advocated by men so distinguished 
     <lb/>and illustrious. (Hear, hear.) The result 
     <lb/>shews, however, that in looking upon the 
     <lb/>movement as then premature, the Hon. Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General was right, and that he correctly 
     <lb/>understood the feelings of the country ; for I 
     <lb/>am willing to admit that the course of events 
     <lb/>has proved that it was premature. But, had 
     <lb/>it not been for certain occurrences which I 
     <lb/>shall not comment upon (since to do so might  
     <lb/>savor of a spirit unbecoming on this occa<lb break="no"/>sion)—had it not been for the extraordinary 
     <lb/>state of things brought about before the 
     <lb/>formation of this Coalition, I am not 
     <lb/>prepared to acknowledge that it would have 
     <lb/>been thought of, as a practical scheme, for 
     <lb/>twenty years to come. But now honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen have taken it up, and it only 
     <lb/>remains for me to congratulate them on 
     <lb/>having done so. When this Coalition was 
     <lb/>proposed, after the vote which resulted in 
     <lb/>the defeat of the CARTIER-MACDONALD 
     <lb/>Ministry, the honorable member for South 
     <lb/>Oxford, the Hon. President of the Council, 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     and then recognized leader of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition, did me the honor to invite me to a 
     <lb/>
     meeting of his supporters. Though I never 
     <lb/>
     was one of his followers—having been all 
     <lb/>
     my life, in the proper sense of the word, a 
     <lb/>
     conservative—still I was associated, for the 
     <lb/>
     time, with the gentlemen forming the party 
     <lb/>
     of which he was chief ; and I think they 
     <lb/>
     will do me the justice to admit, that while 
     <lb/>
     allied with them, I acted in good faith, and 
     <lb/>
     they all knew that, though I was with them, 
     <lb/>
     I was not of them. (Hear, hear.) At the 
     <lb/>
     meeting of the Opposition, called by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council, the project 
     <lb/>
     now under consideration was submitted ; 
     <lb/>
     and in justice to that gentleman, I am 
     <lb/>
     bound to say he made a frank, clear and 
     <lb/>
     intelligible explanation of the terms which 
     <lb/>
     had been agreed upon between himself and 
     <lb/>
     the other section of the Government. He 
     <lb/>
     informed us fully of all that had taken place 
     <lb/>between the negotiating parties, and sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to us the question whether we would 
     <lb/>support him in the step he had taken, and 
     <lb/>support the Government which was to be 
     <lb/>organized for the purpose of carrying out 
     <lb/>this project. Much was said after those 
     <lb/>explanations, and to the best of my recollec<lb break="no"/>tion of what occurred—for I have not since 
     <lb/>refreshed my memory by reading the report 
     <lb/>of the proceedings—there was a general 
     <lb/>assent to the project. Though some hon. 
     <lb/>gentlemen did entertain views peculiar to 
     <lb/>themselves, and expressed opinions that per<lb break="no"/>haps did not convey a hearty or cordial 
     <lb/>assent, yet there was a unanimous consent that 
     <lb/>this Government should be formed. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) I think every one assented to that 
     <lb/>proposal. I, at all events, fully assented to it 
     <lb/>in good faith—(hear, hear)—and in doing so, 
     <lb/>my meaning was to allow the fullest latitude 
     <lb/>to those hon. gentlemen to concoct the best 
     <lb/>scheme they could, and to sustain them in 
     <lb/>working it out. I had no trick in my mind. 
     <lb/>I did not mean, as some honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men seem to have meant, to place them in 
     <lb/>a false position, and afterwards assail them. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I honestly meant to empower 
     <lb/>them to confer with delegates from the other 
     <lb/>provinces, and to endeavor to bring about 
     <lb/>an understanding by which a union of some 
     <lb/>sort might be accomplished. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>It is true that there was one feature in the 
     <lb/>explanations given by the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>the Council which was not acceptable to me, 
     <lb/>but it was not of a character which rendered 
     <lb/>it necessary for me to make any remark at 
     <lb/>the time. To prevent misapprehension, I 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="916" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0916.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">916</fw>
       
     however, will explain what I mean. One 
     <lb/>
     idea suggested was, that failing the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration of all British North America, the 
     <lb/>
     Federation should be carried out with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to Canada alone. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—With provision for 
     <lb/>
     its extension, so as to embrace the other

     provinces, whenever they were prepared to 
     <lb/>
     come in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RANK1">COL. RANKIN</persName>—Certainly ; but though 
     <lb/>
     I did not approve of a Federation of Canada 
     <lb/>
     alone, I did not feel that it was part of my 
     <lb/>
     duty to rise and protest against any such 
     <lb/>
     project. I felt it was right to empower 
     <lb/>
     these hon. gentlemen to frame that scheme, 
     <lb/>
     which they found to be the best and most 
     <lb/>
     practicable—although I certainly had a 
     <lb/>
     mental reservation with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     point I have mentioned ; and I did not then, 
     <lb/>
     nor will I at any future day, assent to a 
     <lb/>
     Federation of the Canadas alone, with a 
     <lb/>
     local government for each section. Rather 
     <lb/>
     than accept such a Constitution, I would pre<lb break="no"/>fer to remain as we are ; for I never 
     <lb/>
     can be a consenting party to the making 
     <lb/>
     of two or three paltry provinces out of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. But I am prepared to give my 
     <lb/>
     hearty support to the project now under 
     <lb/>
     consideration—not because I consider it 
     <lb/>
     perfect ; for if I were so disposed, I might 
     <lb/>
     raise many valid objections to the scheme ; 
     <lb/>
     but I am not so disposed. I really believe 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen who have taken it in hand 
     <lb/>
     have applied themselves to the task com<lb break="no"/>mitted to them in a spirit of patriotism and 
     <lb/>
     faithfulness to their trust, and I shall not 
     <lb/>
     permit myself to indulge in any remark 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the position they occupied 
     <lb/>
     towards each other previous to the Coalition 
     <lb/>
     now established. While on this subject, 1 
     <lb/>
     may remark that the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council seemed most favorable to the idea 
     <lb/>
     of a Federation of the two provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Canada alone, and I am bound to say, when 
     <lb/>
     he made his explanations, he appeared deep<lb break="no"/>ly impressed with the gravity of the step he 
     <lb/>
     was about to take, and perfectly well aware 
     <lb/>
     that he was exposing himself to be assailed 
     <lb/>
     by parties unfriendly to him, on points 
     <lb/>
     where he was, perhaps, open to attack. I do 
     <lb/>
     not say he is not vulnerable, but I, at all 
     <lb/>
     events, shall not assail him now. If I have 
     <lb/>
     any attacks to make upon him, I shall 
     <lb/>
     suspend them till some future time ; and if 
     <lb/>
     he succeeds in carrying out this project, 
     <lb/>
     he will find in me one who will always be 
     <lb/>
     ready to accord to him the highest meed 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     of praise, and, for the good he will do in 
     <lb/>
     bringing this about, I, sir, will be prepared 
     <lb/>
     to forgive him for all the evil he has hereto<lb break="no"/>fore done. (Hear, hear, and laughter.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RANK1">MR. RANKIN</persName>—We ought all to profit 
     <lb/>
     by the lessons of experience. In the course 
     <lb/>
     of this discussion, it has been a pleasure to 
     <lb/>
     me to observe the general spirit of loyalty 
     <lb/>
     which has been displayed by hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who have addressed the House. Even those 
     <lb/>
     who are adverse to the scheme have not 
     <lb/>
     been behind its greatest advocates in their 
     <lb/>
     declarations of attachment to British insti<lb break="no"/>tutions and British rule on this continent 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And I am not disposed to 
     <lb/>
     insinuate that there is a solitary member of 
     <lb/>
     this House who entertains sentiments of 
     <lb/>
     disloyalty to Great Britain. We all have 
     <lb/>
     a right to express our views, and in 
     <lb/>
     fact it is our duty to do so, since we are 
     <lb/>
     sent here to consider what is best for the 
     <lb/>
               interests of Canada <hi rendition="simple:italic">first</hi> ; for though we 
     <lb/>
               owe allegiance to England, Canada is <hi rendition="simple:italic">our</hi> 
     <lb/>
     country, and has the strongest and best 
     <lb/>
     claims to our devotion. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I, sir, am not one of those Canadians who 
     <lb/>
     place the interests of England first, and 
     <lb/>
     hold those of Canada in secondary estima<lb break="no"/>tion. It would be better if we could regard 
     <lb/>
     the interests of both with the same degree 
     <lb/>
     of concern—and I trust they always may 
     <lb/>
     be united ; but we ought not to permit 
     <lb/>
     ourselves to lose sight of the fact, that with 
     <lb/>
     nations as with individuals, the time does 
     <lb/>
     arrive when it becomes each person to be 
     <lb/>
     responsible for himself, and when he can no 
     <lb/>
     longer look to his parents to give him a 
     <lb/>
     standing in the world. Sir, the time must 
     <lb/>
     come, sooner or later, when this country 
     <lb/>
     must cease to be a colony dependant on 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain; and whatever we do, what<lb break="no"/>ever arrangements for the future we may 
     <lb/>
     make, we ought always to keep the fact 
     <lb/>
     plainly before our eyes, that passing events 
     <lb/>
     are calling upon us, either to commence the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of a nationality for ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     or make up our minds to be absorbed in the 
     <lb/>
     republic lying along our southern borders. 
     <lb/>
     I, sir, do not desire to see the latter state of 
     <lb/>
     things brought about. Nothing could be 
     <lb/>
     more distasteful to me than to become what 
     <lb/>
     is called a citizen of the United States , 
     <lb/>
     though I admit the enterprise and intelligence 
     <lb/>
     which characterise the people of that country. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, it is within the recollection 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">917</fw>
            
     of every honorable member of this House, 
     <lb/>
     that some fifteen years since a movement 
     <lb/>
     was set on foot in Montreal, which had as 
     <lb/>
     its avowed object the severance of Canada 
     <lb/>
     from its connection with England, and its 
     <lb/>
     annexation to the United States. The gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who inaugurated that movement 
     <lb/>
     were men of influence and high standing in 
     <lb/>
     the country, and some of them, as we all 
     <lb/>
     know, now occupy prominent positions in 
     <lb/>
     this House ; they claimed then, as they do 
     <lb/>
     now, to be good and loyal British subjects, 
     <lb/>
     and yet they deliberately framed a document 
     <lb/>
     to which they attached their signatures, in 
     <lb/>
     which they prayed their Sovereign to allow 
     <lb/>
     this province to withdraw from its connection 
     <lb/>
     with England, and attach itself to the United 
     <lb/>
     States. Sir, the framers of the document to 
     <lb/>
               which I refer—the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Annexation Manifesto</hi>-<lb/>were not animated by a rebellious feeling 
     <lb/>
     against the Mother Country, but by feelings 
     <lb/>
     of loyalty to the interests of this country ; 
     <lb/>
     their arguments were logical, and founded 
     <lb/>
     upon those material considerations which, 
     <lb/>
     after all, do exercise, and must continue to 
     <lb/>
     exert a more powerful influence over the 
     <lb/>
     minds of intelligent men in the nineteenth 
     <lb/>
     century, than any mere sentiment, or prefer<lb break="no"/>ence for any particular form of government ; 
     <lb/>
     and sir, we, all know that but a short time 
     <lb/>
     after the publication of the annexation mani<lb break="no"/>festo, a new era dawned upon the country. 
     <lb/>
     The Grand Trunk Railway and other im<lb break="no"/>portant public works were inaugurated. 
     <lb/>
     British capital flowed into the province in 
     <lb/>
     copious streams, the pockets of the annexa<lb break="no"/>tionists were replenished, and their loyalty 
     <lb/>
     reestablished, upon a basis which has lasted 
     <lb/>
     ever since. The reciprocity, too, contributed 
     <lb/>
     largely to the removal of the depression 
     <lb/>
     which engendered the annexation movement; 
     <lb/>
     and under the operation of that treaty, the 
     <lb/>
     material interests of the country have pros<lb break="no"/>pered to a degree that will only be fully 
     <lb/>
     appreciated when we have been deprived of 
     <lb/>
     its advantages. Sir, no conceivable state of 
     <lb/>
     things would have induced me to become a 
     <lb/>
     party to that movement in favor of annexa<lb break="no"/>tion, but I am free to confess that the 
     <lb/>
     arguments advanced by the framers of the 
     <lb/>
     document to which I have referred were 
     <lb/>
     sound and logical—regarding them from a 
     <lb/>
     material point of view ; and if they were so 
     <lb/>
     at that time, why should they not be equally 
     <lb/>
     so now? For the last ten years, we have 
     <lb/>
     enjoyed all the advantages of free intercourse 
     <lb/>
     and free trade with our powerful neighbors 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     of the United States. We are now in danger 
     <lb/>
     of being deprived of both—and if we are, 
     <lb/>
     what will be the condition of this country 
     <lb/>
     three years hence ? Shall we not be reduced 
     <lb/>
     to a state more disastrous to our agricultural 
     <lb/>
     and other important interests, than we have 
     <lb/>
     yet experienced ? And am I wrong, sir, in 
     <lb/>
     assuming that similar causes would once 
     <lb/>
     more produce the same effects ? It is all very 
     <lb/>
     well for hon. gentlemen to say " No, no," 
     <lb/>
     but I maintain that I am right ; and, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, it is our duty to look the 
     <lb/>
     existing state of things in the face. The 
     <lb/>
     impulses of mankind have been the same 
     <lb/>
     in all ages. We cannot change human 
     <lb/>
     nature, nor make men honest or disinter<lb break="no"/>ested, by act of Parliament. But, sir, I 
     <lb/>
     have only referred to the past in the hope 
     <lb/>
     that the recollection of the events and the 
     <lb/>
     state of things to which I have alluded, may 
     <lb/>
     have some influence upon the minds of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen—may, perhaps, induce some 
     <lb/>
     modification in the course of even a single 
     <lb/>
     member, who has hitherto been prejudiced 
     <lb/>
     against the scheme of union brought down 
     <lb/>
     by the Government. That we have arrived 
     <lb/>
     at a critical period in the history of this 
     <lb/>
     continent, is universally admitted. Events 
     <lb/>
     of the most momentous character are trans<lb break="no"/>piring upon our borders, and I regret to say 
     <lb/>
     there exists towards us among our republi<lb break="no"/>can neighbors a deep-rooted feeling of hos<lb break="no"/>tility. Occurrences have taken place during 
     <lb/>
     the progress of the war which have tended, 
     <lb/>
     step by step, to intensify that feeling, which 
     <lb/>
     has displayed itself in the stoppage of unre<lb break="no"/>stricted intercourse, and the threatened abro<lb break="no"/>gation of the treaty of reciprocal free trade. 
     <lb/>
     In view of this state of things, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     if we wish either to continue our connection 
     <lb/>
     with England or to maintain a separate 
     <lb/>
     national existence of our own, it is our duty 
     <lb/>
     to devise some means by which we shall be 
     <lb/>
     enabled at all seasons to obtain access to the 
     <lb/>
     seaboard through our own territory ; to 
     <lb/>
     strengthen ourselves numerically ; to increase 
     <lb/>
     our wealth materially, and to add to our 
     <lb/>
     importance territorially. All these results, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, may, in my opinion, be 
     <lb/>
     obtained by the union now proposed. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, it is because I entertain this opinion 
     <lb/>
     that I am prepared to accept the proposition 
     <lb/>
     under consideration without criticising its 
     <lb/>
     details. If I were disposed to enter into de<lb break="no"/>tails, I would most earnestly object to that 
     <lb/>
     part of the project which relates to the 
     <lb/>
     development of the North-West, and the 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="918" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0918.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">918</fw>
         
     uncertain period of the introduction of that 
     <lb/>
     territory into the Confederation ; indeed 
     <lb/>
     I should object to the Federal principle 
     <lb/>
     altogether—for what I would prefer, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, would be a Legislative, rather 
     <lb/>
     than a Federal union ; but, sir, I am willing 
     <lb/>
     to award the highest credit to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for having accomplished as much as 
     <lb/>
     they have done. If we are not to have a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union in name, we shall have 
     <lb/>
     something very closely resembling it. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, to have expected that any body 'of dele<lb break="no"/>gates, representing a number of different 
     <lb/>
     provinces and a great variety of conflicting 
     <lb/>
     interests, could concoct a scheme which 
     <lb/>
     would prove acceptable to everyone, would 
     <lb/>
     have been most unreasonable ; and I think 
     <lb/>
     it ought to be admitted that the Administra<lb break="no"/>tion are entitled to the gratitude of the 
     <lb/>
     country, for the great pains and patient labor 
     <lb/>
     they have evidently devoted to the consider<lb break="no"/>ation of this project. It must be borne in 
     <lb/>
     mind, sir, that the scheme of Federation 
     <lb/>
     agreed upon by the delegates is not final ; 
     <lb/>
     and we should remember that the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons, or Parliament of British America, 
     <lb/>
     will have power to make such modifications 
     <lb/>
     and changes as the interests of the country 
     <lb/>
     may render advisable. If it is found that 
     <lb/>
     the working of the Federal system is 
     <lb/>
     objectionable, that the people would rather 
     <lb/>
     have their local affairs managed by muni<lb break="no"/>cipal councils than by local legislatures, 
     <lb/>
     they can make their wishes known to the 
     <lb/>
    Federal Parliament in a constitutional 
     <lb/>manner, and that body can, and doubtless 
     <lb/>will, find means of abolishing the petty 
     <lb/>provincial parliaments provided for by the 
     <lb/>plan now before the House, and<lb/>replacing 
     <lb/>them by extending the municipal system 
     <lb/>throughout the whole of British America. 
     <lb/>Indeed, sir, the Federal Parliament will 
     <lb/>possess the same power to change, alter or 
     <lb/>amend for the whole country, as we now 
     <lb/>possess for Canada alone, and therefore it is 
     <lb/>that I so willingly accept the present scheme, 
     <lb/>believing it to be the best we can now obtain, 
     <lb/>and leaving to those who are fortunate enough 
     <lb/>to hold seats in the British American Par<lb break="no"/>liament to detect and remedy its defects.<lb break="no"/>And, sir, we have seen that the opponents of 
     <lb/>the union between Upper andLower Canada 
     <lb/>were mistaken in their predictions of the 
     <lb/>disasters which they insisted would flow from 
     <lb/>that union. May we not venture to tell the 
     <lb/>opponents of the larger and more important 
     <lb/>change which we are now discussing, that 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     their predictions will prove still more unsound, 
     <lb/>
     their apprehensions still more groundless ? 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, our destinies are in our own 
     <lb/>
     hands ; by the consummation of this union, 
     <lb/>
     we shall lay the foundation of a great and 
     <lb/>
     important nationality ; while on the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, if we reject this scheme, even if we are 
     <lb/>
     permitted to remain unmolested as we are, 
     <lb/>
     what is there in our present condition that we 
     <lb/>
     can reflect upon with pride or satisfaction, 
     <lb/>
     We are but a province, a dependency at 
     <lb/>
     best ; the reputationof our statesmen is but 
     <lb/>
     local ; their fame is confined to the limits of 
     <lb/>
     the colony ; our Ministers of the Crown, as 
     <lb/>
     it is the practice to call them, are but'the 
     <lb/>
     advisers of a deputy sovereign, upon subjects 
     <lb/>
     purely provincial, wholly unknown to the 
     <lb/>
     rest of the world, and» attracting no attention 
     <lb/>
     beyond our own borders,—while the public 
     <lb/>
     men of the most insignificant European power 
     <lb/>
     would take precedence of them in any other 
     <lb/>
     country—even Mexico, with its mongrel and 
     <lb/>
     semi-barbarous population, enjoys the stand<lb break="no"/>ing of a nation, and has its diplomatic repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, and its foreign relations—and 
     <lb/>
     shall we be content to stand still, while all 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the world is moving on ? Sir, 
     <lb/>
     the most experienced, the most distinguished 
     <lb/>
     statesmen of the Mother Country appreciate 
     <lb/>
     the importance of the proposed change, and 
     <lb/>
     regard the movement as deserving of the 
     <lb/>
     highest commendation ; and a writer in a 
     <lb/>
               recent number of the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> remarks 
     <lb/>
     that the Parliament of British America will 
     <lb/>
     exercise away over a larger portion of the 
     <lb/>
     earth's surface than any other legislative 
     <lb/>body in the world. Some hon. members<lb/>
     
     have objected to this project on the score of 
     <lb/>
     expense ; they have argued that some of the 
     <lb/>
     conditions were too favorable to the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces ; while, on the other hand, the 
     <lb/>
     people of those provinces complain that we 
     <lb/>
     are getting the best of the bargain. I, how<lb break="no"/>ever, shall not detain the House by discussing 
     <lb/>
     the question, of whether we have or have 
     <lb/>
     not undertaken to' pay a few thousands more 
     <lb/>
     than any of the other provinces, than some 
     <lb/>
     may think they were fairly entitled to ; for I 
     <lb/>
     hold that the advantage to be derived from 
     <lb/>
     this union would be cheaply bought at a 
     <lb/>
     cost far greater than any liability we shall 
     <lb/>
     incur in carrying it out. Mr. SPEAKER 
     <lb/>
     the extent of the British possessions which 
     <lb/>
     it is proposed to unite under this scheme 
     <lb/>
     includes some four millions square miles<lb break="no"/>more than the whole of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, North and South together, and 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="919" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0919.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">919</fw>
         
     equal to one-tenth of the surface of the 
     <lb/>
     whole world ; the resources of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces are of incalculable value, while the 
     <lb/>
     boundless prairies of the North-West, with the 
     <lb/>
     fertile soil and genial climate of the Saskat<lb break="no"/>chewan and Red River may be made the 
     <lb/>
     home of millions upon millions of our fellow 
     <lb/>
     beings. Our population, including the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces, is at least equal in 
     <lb/>
     numbers, and far superior in intelligence 
     <lb/>
     and enlightenment, to that of the United 
     <lb/>
     States when they asserted their independ<lb break="no"/>ence ; and under the rule of the proposed 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government we may grow in strength 
     <lb/>
     and importance as rapidly as our republican 
     <lb/>
     neighbors ; for though in some respects they 
     <lb/>
     are more favorably situated than we are, 
     <lb/>
     there are others, and important ones too, in 
     <lb/>
     which we have greatly the advantage over 
     <lb/>
     them—for instance, a far more advantageous 
     <lb/>
     line of communication from the Atlantic to 
     <lb/>
     the Pacific can be established through our 
     <lb/>
     country than through theirs ; indeed so 
     <lb/>
     great is the superiority of our route, that 
     <lb/>
     they never could compete with us for the 
     <lb/>
     through traffic from Asia to Europe, which, 
     <lb/>
     within a few years I trust, will pour 
     <lb/>
     in a continuous stream through British ter<lb break="no"/>ritory from one ocean to the other. Sir, in 
     <lb/>
     support of these views, I trust I may be per<lb break="no"/>mitted to read an extract from an interest<lb break="no"/>ing and instructive pamphlet by an hon. 
     <lb/>
     member on my left ( Mr. MORRIS), in which 
     <lb/>
     he quotes from the words of a distinguished 
     <lb/>
     American statesman as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The route through British America is in some 
     <lb/>
     respects preferable to that through our own ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. By the former, the distance from Europe 
     <lb/>
     to Asia is some thousand miles shorter than by 
     <lb/>
     the latter. Passing close to Lake Superior, trav<lb break="no"/>ersing the water-shed which divides the streams 
     <lb/>
     flowing towards the Arctic sea, from those which 
     <lb/>
     have their exits southward, and crossing the 
     <lb/>
     Rocky Mountains at an elevation of some three 
     <lb/>
     thousand feet less than at the south pass, the 
     <lb/>
     road could be here constructed with comparative 
     <lb/>
     cheapness, and would open up a region abound<lb break="no"/>ing in valuable timber and other natural pro<lb break="no"/>ducts, and admirably suited to the growth of 
     <lb/>
     grain and grazing. Having its Atlantic sea-port 
     <lb/>
     at Halifax and its Pacific depot near Vancouver's 
     <lb/>
     Island, it would inevitably draw to it the com<lb break="no"/>merce of Europe, Asia and the United States. 
     <lb/>
     Thus British America, from a mere colonial de<lb break="no"/>pendency would assume a controlling rank in the 
     <lb/>
     world. To her other nations would be tributary ; 
     <lb/>
     and in vain would the United States attempt to 
     <lb/>
     be her rival, for we could never dispute with her 
     <lb/>
     the possession of the Asiatic commerce, nor the 
     <lb/>
     power which that commerce confers.

            <cb/>
       <p>        
     Sir, this is not the language of an enthusi<lb break="no"/>ast or a visionary, but the opinion of one 
     <lb/>
     perfectly acquainted with the subject, and 
     <lb/>
     eminently capable of discussing it—one, too, 
     <lb/>
     whose judgment was certainly not biased by 
     <lb/>
     national prejudice. And again, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     on a more recent occasion we find the Pre<lb break="no"/>mier of the United States, the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SEWARD, using the following language:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Hitherto, in common with most of my country<lb break="no"/>men, as I suppose, I have thought Canada—or to

     <lb/>mere strip, lying north of the United States, 
     <lb/>easily detachable from the parent state, but in<lb break="no"/>capable of sustaining itself, and therefore ulti<lb break="no"/>mately—nay, right soon—to be taken on by the 
     <lb/>Federal union, without materially changing or 
     <lb/>affecting its own condition or development. I 
     <lb/>have dropt that opinion as a nation conceit. 
     <lb/>I see in British North America, stretching as 
     <lb/>it does across the continent from the shores of 
     <lb/>Labrador and Newfoundland to the Pacific, and 
     <lb/>occupying a considerable belt of the temperate 
     <lb/>zone—traversed, equally with the United States, 
     <lb/>by the lakes, and enjoying the magnificent shores 
     <lb/>of the St. Lawrence, with its thousands of islands 
     <lb/>in the river and gulf, a region grand enough for 
     <lb/>the seat of a great empire. 
     <lb/>
            </quote>
            <p>Mr. SPEAKER, the great consideration with 
     <lb/>me is how can we best preserve for our<lb break="no"/>selves and for our children the essence of 
     <lb/>British institutions ; by what means can we 
     <lb/>best prolong the connection which now so 
     <lb/>happily exists between England and our<lb break="no"/>selves, with mutual advantage and with 
     <lb/>equal satisfaction to both parties ; and how 
     <lb/>can we best prepare, when the time comes, 
     <lb/>as in the natural course of events it most 
     <lb/>assuredly will, to assume the responsibility 
     <lb/>of a separate and independent nationality ? 
     <lb/>Sir, by uniting the scattered and now insig<lb break="no"/>nificant British Provinces under one general 
     <lb/>government, we shall, in the first place, 
     <lb/>consolidate and strengthen British feeling 
     <lb/>and British influence on this continent. By 
     <lb/>the adoption, on the part of the proposed 
     <lb/>Federal Government and Parliament, of a 
     <lb/>bold, enlightened and progressive policy, 
     <lb/>British America may be pushed forward in 
     <lb/> material wealth, in the numbers of her popu<lb break="no"/>lation and in general importance, to a point 
     <lb/>which will qualify her to take her place 
     <lb/>among the nations of the earth, in a manner 
     <lb/>and with a standing alike honorable to our<lb break="no"/>selves and creditable to the great country 
     <lb/>under whose glorious flag we have been 
     <lb/>sheltered, and by whose example we have 
     <lb/>been stimulated, while prosecuting that 
     <lb/>course of political studies which must in

     time qualify us to commence a national 
     <lb/>
     career of our own—as I would fain hope, 
     <lb/>
     under the sway of a constitutional monarch 
     <lb/>
     descended from the illustrious Sovereign 
     <lb/>
     who now so worthily fills the British Throne. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, some honorable members object 
     <lb/>
     to this union from the apprehension that it 
     <lb/>
     will subject us to serious financial embar<lb break="no"/>rassments. If the only effects of the union 
     <lb/>
     were to be the increased extent of our terri<lb break="no"/>tory, and the addition which the inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     of the other provinces would make to the 
     <lb/>
     number of our population, I should be in<lb break="no"/>clined to admit the force of their reasoning ; 
     <lb/>
     but surely no one can anticipate that the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament will be composed of men 
     <lb/>
     incapable of appreciating their responsibili<lb break="no"/>ties, or without the capacity to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the important interests committed to their 
     <lb/>
     charge. Mr. SPEAKER, no one thing has 
     <lb/>
     done so much to attract emigration to the 
     <lb/>
     United States as the great public works that 
     <lb/>
     have been constantly going on in that coun<lb break="no"/>try for the last five and twenty years. We 
     <lb/>
     hear much said about the superiority of 
     <lb/>
     their climate and the other advantages which, 
     <lb/>
     it is alleged, they enjoy in a greater degree 
     <lb/>
     than we do ; but I can assure the House 
     <lb/>
     that those advantages have been greatly 
     <lb/>
     overestimated, and that such considerations 
     <lb/>
     have had but little weight in the minds of 
     <lb/>
     emigrants, compared with the knowledge of 
     <lb/>
     the more important fact, that in that country 
     <lb/>
     the demand for labor was always greater 
     <lb/>
     than the supply, and that the emigrant ar<lb break="no"/>riving without a shilling in his pocket need 
     <lb/>
     be under no apprehension about the main<lb break="no"/>tenance of his family, knowing that he could 
     <lb/>
     always find employment at rates of com<lb break="no"/>pensation sufficiently liberal to enable him 
     <lb/>
     in a few years not only to secure a home 
     <lb/>
     of his own, but to surround himself with 
     <lb/>
     comforts which would have been far be<lb break="no"/>yond his reach in his own country. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     the construction of the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way will afford employment to thousands 
     <lb/>
     of laborers, it will open up vast tracts for 
     <lb/>
     settlement, and render accessible an exten<lb break="no"/>sive region abounding in mineral wealth 
     <lb/>
     and other natural resources of incalculable 
     <lb/>
     value. Then, Mr. SPEAKER, the next great 
     <lb/>
     public work that should be undertaken is 
     <lb/>
     the improvement of the navigation of the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, so as to render that magnificent 
     <lb/>
     river the shortest, safest and most advan<lb break="no"/>tageous outlet to the ocean for the products 
     <lb/>
     of the fertile and boundless west, with its 
     <lb/>
     rapidly increasing millions. Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     the expenditure which it would be necessary 
     <lb/>
     to incur to render the Ottawa navigable for 
     <lb/>
     seagoing ships, great as it would be positively, 
     <lb/>
     would be insignificant when compared with 
     <lb/>
     the extraordinary advantages which it would 
     <lb/>
     confer upon the country by the thousands 
     <lb/>
     whom it would attract during the progress 
     <lb/>
     of the work, in the first place ; and, secondly, 
     <lb/>
     by the immense manufacturing power which 
     <lb/>
     it would place at our disposal, thereby 
     <lb/>
     affording profitable employment for a dense 
     <lb/>
     population, throughout a line of some three 
     <lb/>
     hundred miles of country, the greater part 
     <lb/>
     of which is now but a comparative wilder<lb break="no"/>ness ; for, considering the unrivalled water 
     <lb/>
     power which would thus be secured along 
     <lb/>
     the main line of communication between 
     <lb/>
     the west and the commerce of Europe, it 
     <lb/>
     is not too much to expect that that power 
     <lb/>
     would attract the attention of men of 
     <lb/>
     capital and enterprise, and that a succession 
     <lb/>
     of mills and factories of every conceivable 
     <lb/>
     description would soon grow up, along the 
     <lb/>
     whole line, which would afford employment 
     <lb/>
     for a numerous, industrious and valuable 
     <lb/>
     population. And then, sir, there is that still 
     <lb/>
     more important and magnificent project, the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic and Pacific Railway. All the best 
     <lb/>
     authorities agree that a far better, shorter, 
     <lb/>
     and cheaper line can be constructed through 
     <lb/>
     British than through United States territory. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, it would be impossible to 
     <lb/>
     over-estimate the advantages which any 
     <lb/>
     country must derive from being possessed 
     <lb/>
     of a line of communication destined to 
     <lb/>
     become the highway from Europe to Asia. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, the acquisition of this advantage alone 
     <lb/>
     would be sufficient to justify us in advocating 
     <lb/>
     this measure ; but when we reflect upon the 
     <lb/>
     almost boundless extent of fertile agricul<lb break="no"/>tural territory through which this line must 
     <lb/>
     pass, the millions upon millions of human 
     <lb/>
     beings which that territory is capable of 
     <lb/>
     supporting—when we bear in mind that 
     <lb/>
     by means of this union we shall not only 
     <lb/>
     secure the control of a larger portion of the 
     <lb/>
     world than is now under the sway of 
     <lb/>
     any power on earth, but that, by the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of such a policy as I have 
     <lb/>
     suggested, our population may be more 
     <lb/>
     than doubled within ten years, and that 
     <lb/>
     though our liabilities will have increas<lb break="no"/>ed, those liabilities will fall upon the 
     <lb/>
     shoulders of so greatly augmented a popu<lb break="no"/>lation, that the burden to be borne by each 
     <lb/>
     individual will be more likely to be deminish<lb break="no"/>ed than increased—when we remember, sir, 
     <lb/>
     that it will be in our power so to shape the 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="921" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0921.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">921</fw>
        
      destinies of British America, that even the 
     <lb/>
     census of 1871 may show that we possess a 
     <lb/>
     population of from eight to ten millions. I 
     <lb/>
     must confess, Mr. SPEAKER, that I cannot 
     <lb/>
     understand how any hon. gentleman can 
     <lb/>
     stand up here, and labor to perpetuate our pre<lb break="no"/>sent insignificance, by interposing obstacles 
     <lb/>
     to the carrying out of the only really great 
     <lb/>
     or statesmanlike idea which has ever been 
     <lb/>
     brought under the consideration of a Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Parliament. And now, sir, though I have 
     <lb/>
     already trespassed too long upon the patience 
     <lb/>
     of hen. members, I must crave their indul<lb break="no"/>gence a moment longer, while touching 
     <lb/>
     briefly upon the subject of defence. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, without discussing the question 
     <lb/>
     of how much or how little we ought to con<lb break="no"/>tribute towards the defence of the Empire, 
     <lb/>
     in a war with any other nation than the 
     <lb/>
     United States, I assume that every true 
     <lb/>
     Canadian, whether of French or British 
     <lb/>
     origin, will be prepared to resist the invasion 
     <lb/>
     of his native soil; and if I am right in this, 
     <lb/>
     I take it, all we have to do is to inform the 
     <lb/>
     home Government that we are determined 
     <lb/>
     —not to contribute so much in men, and so 
     <lb/>
     much in money, to the defence of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but that we are resolved—that every man 
     <lb/>
     and every farthing we can control shall be 
     <lb/>
     sacrificed before we submit to the power of 
     <lb/>
     our republican neighbors, and that all we 
     <lb/>
     ask of England is to pursue a course becom<lb break="no"/>ing the glory of her ancient renown. That 
     <lb/>
     she will do this, sir, we have no reason to 
     <lb/>
     doubt; but I regret to observe that Colonel 
     <lb/>
     JERVOIB, in his report upon the subject of 
     <lb/>
     fortifications, seems altogether to have ig<lb break="no"/>nored the Western Peninsula, for he makes 
     <lb/>
     no mention of any point west of Hamilton 
     <lb/>
     as capable of being fortified, from which I 
     <lb/>
     infer he must have come to the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that in the event of war with the United 
     <lb/>
     States, it would be impossible for us to 
     <lb/>
     hold the country above the head of Lake 
     <lb/>
     Ontario. Sir, this may be the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of that gallant officer, and it may be cor<lb break="no"/>rect; but, as the representative of the 
     <lb/>
     most exposed portion of the western 
     <lb/>
     frontier, I am bound at least to say that 
     <lb/>
     the peeple of that part of the country 
     <lb/>
     would be most unwilling to admit that 
     <lb/>
     they are less able now to hold their own 
     <lb/>
     than their fathers were in 1812. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, our chief danger lies in the pos<lb break="no"/>sibility of a reunion with the North and 
     <lb/>
     South, upon the basis of the Monroe doc<lb break="no"/>trine ; for unhappily the course pursued by 
     <lb/>
     England, so far from conciliating either 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
               
     party, has only on endered feelings of hos<lb break="no"/>tility in the min 5 of the people of both 
     <lb/>
     sections; and for the belligerents to combine 
     <lb/>
     their united forces against a common enemy, 
     <lb/>
     and that enemy one whom they both hate 
     <lb/>
     as intensely as they do England, would be 
     <lb/>
     an event which could excite no surprise in 
     <lb/>
     the minds of any one acquainted with the 
     <lb/>
     feeling which prevails among the masses of 
     <lb/>
     republican America. Sir, talking of forti<lb break="no"/>fications and defence, no force we can bring 
     <lb/>
     into the field, no line of forts we can 
     <lb/>
     build, nor, indeed, any course that could be 
     <lb/>
     adopted, would so effectually protect us, 
     <lb/>
     so absolutely guarantee the inviolability of 
     <lb/>
     our soil as the recognition of the indepen<lb break="no"/>dence of the Southern States by Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain; and when the proposed deputation 
     <lb/>
     from this Government reaches England, I 
     <lb/>
     trust they will feel it to be their duty 
     <lb/>
     strongly to urge the consideration of this 
     <lb/>
     fact upon Her Majesty's Government; for 
     <lb/>
     with a powerful British fleet upon their 
     <lb/>
     coast, a formidable, warlike and bitterly 
     <lb/>
     hostile nation bordering them upon the 
     <lb/>
     South, and some half million well armed and 
     <lb/>
     resolute Canadians in their front, depend 
     <lb/>
     upon it, Mr. SPEAKER, we need be under 
     <lb/>
     no apprehension of war's alarms. And new, 
     <lb/>
     sir, it only remains for me to thank honorable 
     <lb/>
     members for the patient hearing they have 
     <lb/>
     accorded me, and to express a hepe that 
     <lb/>
     the deputation to England will not swerve 
     <lb/>
     from the course they have informed us they 
     <lb/>
     intended to pursue, in consequence of any<lb break="no"/>thing that has transpired in any of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces, but that they will impress upon 
     <lb/>
     the home Government the fact that four-<lb break="yes"/>
     fifths of the people of British America are 
     <lb/>
     represented by this House, which sustains the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of union by an overwhelming major<lb break="no"/>ity ; that they will urge the Imperial Ministry 
     <lb/>
     to exert all the influence they can command 
     <lb/>
     in a constitutional manner, to induce the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Lower Provinces to reconsider 
     <lb/>
     their recent course, and to acquiesce in the 
     <lb/>
     project agreed upon by the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence as the basis of an arrangement by 
     <lb/>
     which a balance of power may be established 
     <lb/>
     on this continent, the spread of repub<lb break="no"/>licanism checked, and our own immediate 
     <lb/>
     prosPerity and future influence insured to 
     <lb/>
     such an extent as to secure for us a higher 
     <lb/>
     degree of consideration while we retain a 
     <lb/>
     colonial position, and qualify us hereafter to 
     <lb/>
     take our place among the family of nations,

     still animated by sentiments of reverence 
     <lb/>
     for the great people under whose fostering

     whom, I trust, we shall always continue to

     maintain the closest alliance. (Cheers)

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. DUFRESNE</persName> (Montcalm)—Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, in rising at this moment to express 
     <lb/>my humble opinion on the merits of the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions now under discussion by this House, 
     <lb/>I do not intend to follow the formula or pre<lb break="no"/>amble hitherto invariably adopted, by saying 
     <lb/>that I approach the subject with fear and 
     <lb/>trembling. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) But 
     <lb/>though I do not approach the question with 
     <lb/>anxiety and hesitation, it is not that I feel 
     <lb/>myself more competent than others for the 
     <lb/>treatment of it ; it is simply for the good 
     <lb/>reason that I rely upon the indulgence of this 
     <lb/>House. We all know how difficult it is for 
     <lb/>a person who is not an habitual public speaker, 
     <lb/>or a member of the legal profession, to ex<lb break="no"/>press himself with facility before a distin<lb break="no"/>guished and highly educated body of men 
     <lb/>such as I now have the honor to address. I 
     <lb/>look upon the resolutions submitted to us as 
     <lb/>expressing the sentiments of the people, 
     <lb/>through their constitutional organ the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. We ask our Sovereign and the Im<lb break="no"/>perial authorities to unite, by means of a 
     <lb/>Federal union, all these Provinces of British 
     <lb/>North America. In examining this question, 
     <lb/>and in order to express more clearly and fully 
     <lb/>my opinion of these resolutions, I may say 
     <lb/>that I accept them for many reasons, but 
     <lb/>chiefly as a means of obtaining the repeal of 
     <lb/>the present legislative union of Canada, and 
     <lb/>securing a peaceable settlement of our sec<lb break="no"/>tional difficulties. I accept them, in the 
     <lb/>second place, as a means of obtaining for 
     <lb/>Lower Canada the absolute and exclusive 
     <lb/>control of her own affairs. I accept them, 
     <lb/>thirdly, as a means of perpetuating French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Canadian nationality in this country. I ac<lb break="no"/>cept them, fourthly, as a more effectual means 
     <lb/>of cementing our connection with the Mother 
     <lb/>Country, and avoiding annexation to the 
     <lb/>United States. I accept them, fifthly and 
     <lb/>lastly, as a means of administering the affairs 
     <lb/>of the country with greater economy. Such 
     <lb/>are my reasons for accepting the Confederation 
     <lb/>scheme submitted to us by the Government. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I shall not undertake to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss the merits of all the resolutions, for the 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen who have already spoken 
     <lb/>have ably and fully developed the merits of 
     <lb/>the whole question ; and, besides, if I may 
     <lb/>dare say it without being thought ridiculous, 
     <lb/>I have undergone a heavy loss—I have, in 
     <lb/>fact, been plundered. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     for Vaudreuil (Mr. HARWOOD) is the offender 
     <lb/>
     —(laughter)—but I cannot complain much 
     <lb/>
     of this, for the theft has turned to the advan<lb break="no"/>tage of the House. What he has stolen from 
     <lb/>
     me is the history of the Helvetic and Ger<lb break="no"/>manic Confederations ; but inasmuch as he 
     <lb/>
     has set forth the facts in a far more able 
     <lb/>
     manner than I myself could have done it, and 
     <lb/>
     as the House has been a gainer thereby, I 
     <lb/>
     must endeavor to practise a proper degree of 
     <lb/>
     resignation under my own heavy affliction. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I intended. to have said some<lb break="no"/>thing on the Helvetic and Germanic Confed<lb break="no"/>erations, but as I have been thus despoiled, 
     <lb/>
     and as the honorable member for Vaudreuil 
     <lb/>
     has treated the subject so powerfully, I shall 
     <lb/>
     refrain from entering into the matter. And 
     <lb/>
     here again the House will be the gainer. 
     <lb/>
     ( Laughter.) As the question of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     itself has already been fully treated with far 
     <lb/>
     more ability than my own feeble powers would 
     <lb/>
     enable me to bring to bear upon the discus<lb break="no"/>sion, I will confine myself to answering certain 
     <lb/>
     statements made by honorable members of the 
     <lb/>
               Liberal party <hi rendition="simple:italic">par excellence</hi>. Contrary to 
     <lb/>
     the opinions of the Church, or rather of the 
     <lb/>
     Head of the Church, who declares that the 
     <lb/>
     name Liberal cannot be allied with the doc<lb break="no"/>trine of the Church, we have seen the extreme 
     <lb/>
     Liberals coming forward in this House as the 
     <lb/>
     champions of the Church and of its ministers. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Richelieu gave us in pompous 
     <lb/>
     terms a sketch of the benefits derived from 
     <lb/>
     the union of the Canadas. I must say that I 
     <lb/>
     listened to him with no little astonishment, 
     <lb/>
     for it was the first time I ever heard a demo<lb break="no"/>crat—a demagogue—lauding the union and 
     <lb/>
     the public men whom the country has, since 
     <lb/>
     the union, placed at the head of affairs. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) He told us that we had had 
     <lb/>
     statesmen who succeeded in securing a triumph 
     <lb/>
     for the rights of Lower Canada—men who 
     <lb/>
     protected our interests and caused us to ad<lb break="no"/>vance in the path of progress. " We see 
     <lb/>
     them in their works," he says—" see the pro<lb break="no"/>gress the country has made under the union ; 
     <lb/>
     look at our primary-school system and our 
     <lb/>
     university system ; look at the establishment 
     <lb/>
     of our ocean line of steamers, bearing our 
     <lb/>
     products to Europe, and returning to us 
     <lb/>
     freighted with the wealth of every foreign 
     <lb/>
     country ! See that magnificent work, the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk Railway, which is without a 
     <lb/>
     parallel in the world ! See our splendid 
     <lb/>
     canals, the finest works of the kind in exist<lb break="no"/>ence." Really, Mr. SPEAKER, I am utterly

     astounded at these laudations falling from the

     lips of the honorable member for Richelieu, 
     <lb/>
     and more especially at his praise of the Grand 
     <lb/>

     honorable member who heard his speech must 
     <lb/>
     have been delighted with that portion of it.

     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) And while it 
     <lb/>
     will probably be admitted that other portions

     of that speech might well have been omitted, 
     <lb/>
     it is surely a good thing that the honorable

     <persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. DUFRESNE</persName>—The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber says that they might have done better 
     <lb/>
     still ; but that was not what he said in his 
     <lb/>
     speech, since he declared that they were men 
     <lb/>
     of the very highest order of merit, and de<lb break="no"/>served the greatest possible praise for the 
     <lb/>
     works and improvements they had carried out. 
     <lb/>
     Now this is indeed peculiarly gratifying to one 
     <lb/>
     in my position, after contending for years 
     <lb/>
     with the party of the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Richelieu, and opposing them because 
     <lb/>
     they constantly strove to excite popular pre<lb break="no"/>judice against all improvement and every 
     <lb/>
     great undertaking. I shall have occasion to 
     <lb/>
     exhibit to the House the means resorted to 
     <lb/>
     by that party, in order to prejudice the peo<lb break="no"/>ple against every man who labored in behalf of 
     <lb/>
     real progress, and I shall endeavor to con<lb break="no"/>trast the prejudices they appealed to ten years 
     <lb/>
     ago with those they are now striving to ex<lb break="no"/>cite. (Hear, hear.) The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Richelieu also stated that since the union 
     <lb/>
     we had advanced the settlement of our town<lb break="no"/>ships, and that this is why he wishes us to 
     <lb/>
     remain as we are at present. He says the 
     <lb/>
     union has not completed its work. He is 
     <lb/>
     right, only it is unfortunate that he and his 
     <lb/>
     party should not have succeeded in making 
     <lb/>
     that discovery a few years ago ; it is unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate that they should only make that dis<lb break="no"/>covery now, when they themselves and the 
     <lb/>
     whole people are convinced that a change in 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution is unavoidably necessary<lb break="no"/>for we French-Canadians, a minority in the 
     <lb/>
     country, cannot dictate to the majority. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I shall not endeavor to excite 
     <lb/>
     popular prejudices, as the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Richelieu has done. I do not desire to 
     <lb/>
     be too severe with the honorable member, or 
     <lb/>
     to condemn him too strongly ; for his mode 
     <lb/>
     of treating this question may be simply the 
     <lb/>
     result of some peculiarity of mental organiza<lb break="no"/>tion ; I merely wish to show that his views 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     as to the dangers of the future are not a whit 
     <lb/>
     more sound than the views upon which he 
     <lb/>
     must have acted during the past. He has 
     <lb/>
     exhausted the library of Parliament in order 
     <lb/>
     to show, in black and white, that the people 
     <lb/>
     of England are the greatest oppressors on the 
     <lb/>
     face of the earth—(hear, hear, and laughter) 
     <lb/>
     —in order to demonstrate a fact which is not 
     <lb/>
     true, for he has cited to us nothing beyond 
     <lb/>
     the mere views of certain historians, whose 
     <lb/>
     opinions only go for what they are worth. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear) It is not my purpose to under<lb break="no"/>take the defence of a people who have no 
     <lb/>
     need of me to defend them, nor to avenge 
     <lb/>
    the insults offered them by the honorable 
     <lb/>member ; but I must say that I repudiate all 
     <lb/>he has said against the English people and 
     <lb/>against England, against the institutions 
     <lb/>and government of that country, and against 
     <lb/>her system of colonial administration. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) What good can result from thus ran<lb break="no"/>sacking history in order to hold up a single 
     <lb/>page, the record of an evil deed ? What 
     <lb/>was the condition of public manners among 
     <lb/>nations at the period of the events he 
     <lb/>has spoken of, connected with Acadia ? 
     <lb/>Why bring up that matter now ? What 
     <lb/>good can it do ? Does the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber desire to provoke the prejudices of a sen<lb break="no"/>sitive and powerful nation against us ? Does 
     <lb/>he want to bring about the ruin of this 
     <lb/>country ? The honorable member, in his 
     <lb/>youth and inexperience, has rendered us a 
     <lb/>very questionable service. (Hear, hear.) He 
     <lb/>rakes up an event which occurred one hun<lb break="no"/>dred years ago, and taunts a conquering na<lb break="no"/>tion with her mode of dealing with the van<lb break="no"/>quished ! Surely this is a strange way of 
     <lb/>serving his fellow-countrymen—of laboring 
     <lb/>to promote their welfare and interests ! Am 
     <lb/>I not right in saying that the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber has displayed an utter want of tact and 
     <lb/>experience ? I trust, for the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber's own sake, that the charge of inexperi<lb break="no"/>ence is the heaviest charge to which he may 
     <lb/>be held amenable ; for I cannot think it pos<lb break="no"/>sible that he was in any way actuated by 
     <lb/>malicious motives. (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, the honorable member tells us that 
     <lb/>"the union has not yet done its work." Is 
     <lb/>he not aware that the population of Upper 
     <lb/>Canada—that the British population vastly 
     <lb/>outnumber our own population in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince ? What then does he mean ? Can it 
     <lb/>be that he really thinks because the union 
     <lb/>has not finished its work, that it ought to be 
     <lb/>preserved, and that we ought to remain as 
     <lb/>we are ? I cannot be convinced that he is so 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">924</fw>
           
     completely devoid of information and judg<lb break="no"/>ment as really to desire that we should remain 
     <lb/>
     as we are. (Hear, and laughter.) Does he not 
     <lb/>
     perceive that if the present union be con<lb break="no"/>tinued, the Upper Canada members will unite 
     <lb/>
     together as one man, in order to carry repre<lb break="no"/>sentation based upon population in the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature? Notwithstanding the facts we have 
     <lb/>
     witnessed during the past few years; notwith<lb break="no"/>standing that he is aware that three-fourths 
     <lb/>
     of the Upper  Canadian members were sent here 
     <lb/>
     by their  electors in order to secure representa<lb break="no"/>tion based upon population, he says the union 
     <lb/>
     has not done its work, and we must remain as 
     <lb/>
     we are! No, I cannot, I repeat, believe him 
     <lb/>
     to be sincere in that. He knows that we can<lb break="no"/>not remain as we are. We are in favor of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, not because we believe it to be 
     <lb/>
     the very best possible remedy for our evils, 
     <lb/>
     but because we are convinced of the necessity 
     <lb/>
     of providing a remedy for our sectional diffi<lb break="no"/>culties. The honorable member for Richelieu 
     <lb/>
     may play the alarmist as loudly as he likes. 
     <lb/>
     I can assure him that the vast majority of his 
     <lb/>
     fellow-countrymen are too intelligent to be de<lb break="no"/>ceived. They know full well that the minority 
     <lb/>
     cannot control the majority. The duty of the 
     <lb/>
     minority is to better their position as far as 
     <lb/>
     possible, but they cannot pretend to dictate to 
     <lb/>
     the   majority—more especially when that major<lb break="no"/>ity is composed, if we are to believe the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Richelieu, of men who de<lb break="no"/>light in oppressing others. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The speech of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Richelieu is the speech of a mere youth, and 
     <lb/>
     is devoid of weight and importance; but it is 
     <lb/>
     a speech which would have been extremely 
     <lb/>
     injurious to the best interests of Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da, had it emanated from a man possessing a 
     <lb/>
     wider reputation or greater importance than 
     <lb/>
     that honorable gentleman enjoys. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, and laughter.) He also stated that 
     <lb/>
     " the cry of representation based upon popu<lb break="no"/>lation had been used in Upper Canada merely 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of securing the success of 
     <lb/>
     party leaders, of enabling them to get into 
     <lb/>
     power." But we know that commanders are 
     <lb/>
     leaders of men ; that commanders are to be 
     <lb/>
     dreaded when they have followers at their 
     <lb/>
     back ; and the Upper Canada leaders surely 
     <lb/>
     do not lack followers. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Richelieu went on to say :—" But we are 
     <lb/>
     in a good position ! The liberals passed the 
     <lb/>
     Separate School Bill! " I believe he was in 
     <lb/>
     the House when the Separate School Bill was 
     <lb/>
     passed ; but if he was not present, he may be 
     <lb/>
     somewhat excusable for that statement. I 
     <lb/>
           <cb/>
               
         ask the honorable member how many liberals 
     <lb/>—how many supporters of the Government of 
     <lb/>the day voted for the Separate School Bill? 
     <lb/>If he did not know when he spoke, it would 
     <lb/>have been better for him to have kept silent 
     <lb/>on that point, and not to have referred to the 
     <lb/>matter at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:PERR2">MR. PERRAULT</persName>—It was the MACDON<lb break="no"/>ALD-DORION Government that passed the 
     <lb/>measure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. DUFRESNE</persName>—No. It was not the 
     <lb/>
     Government that introduced the measure, and 
     <lb/>
     carried it in the House; it was an indepen<lb break="no"/>dent member of this House—Mr. SCOTT, of 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa—who introduced the bill. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the day supported the measure, 
     <lb/>
     but only two of their Upper Canada sup<lb break="no"/>porters voted for it, and one of the two, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for South Wentworth 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. RYMAL), did not do so until I 
     <lb/>
     had called upon him to give his vote, and 
     <lb/>
     forced him to record it.  (Hear, hear.) These 
     <lb/>
     are the facts as they occurred, and they are 
     <lb/>
     proof positive that liberalism is no better 
     <lb/>
     here than elsewhere. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Richelieu loudly 
     <lb/>
     accuses the majority of servility and venality. 
     <lb/>
     There was a time when he spoke in a different 
     <lb/>
     tone, when he himself formed part of the 
     <lb/>
     majority, and when he availed himself of that 
     <lb/>
     position to make a little trip to the Saguenay at 
     <lb/>
     the expense of the Government, and to write 
     <lb/>
     a little romance afterwards. (Hear, hear, 
     <lb/>
     and laughter.) For my part, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     as one of the majority at present, I have yet 
     <lb/>
     to learn when and in what I have been servile 
     <lb/>
     towards my friends in the Government ; nor 
     <lb/>
     am I aware how or when the majority have 
     <lb/>
     evinced venality, as the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     asserts. (Hear, hear.) The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Richelieu has himself experienced the 
     <lb/>
     mode in which a majority evinced venality, 
     <lb/>
     and the lesson has evidently not been lost 
     <lb/>
     upon him. (Hear, hear.) The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member says—" We have a magnificent pub<lb break="no"/>lic domain in Lower Canada; we have an im<lb break="no"/>mense quantity of land, while Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     has none left ; we can establish magnificent 
     <lb/>
     settlements, and increase our population. Let 
     <lb/>
     us remain as we are under the union." Now, 
     <lb/>
     for my part, I assert that for that very reason 
     <lb/>
     we ought to accept Confederation in order 
     <lb/>
     that we may get the complete control of that 
     <lb/>
     noble domain, instead of holding it only in 
     <lb/>
     common with Upper Canada. He gives us a 
     <lb/>
     grand outline of all we could do with that 
     <lb/>
     splendid domain, and then says he does not 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="925" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0925.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">925</fw>
         
     care to have possession of it. Well, for my 
     <lb/>
    part I do desire to have possession of it. 
     <lb/>The honorable member also said that we are 
     <lb/>to have direct taxation under Confederation, 
     <lb/>and that the local governments are to be mere 
     <lb/>municipal councils. I shall refer presently to 
     <lb/>the question of direct taxes ; but I must say 
     <lb/>that municipalities having at their disposal 
     <lb/>millions of acres of land, will be something 
     <lb/>new in the way of " mere municipalities."  I 
     <lb/>rather think the honorable member does not 
     <lb/>quite do justice to the importance of the 
     <lb/>functions of the local governments. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) The honorable member compares the 
     <lb/>local governments to municipalities. Now, I 
     <lb/>find that the Local Government of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada will have a tolerably wide range of 
     <lb/>matters to deal with ; for besides the public 
     <lb/>lands, it is also to have control of the follow<lb break="no"/>ing:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Direct taxation, and in New Brunswick the im<lb break="no"/>position of duties on the export of timber, logs,

            <p>
     I call the attention of honorable members of

     <lb/>
     a few words with reference to each provision 
     <lb/>
     in its turn. If some do not understand their 
     <lb/>
     importance, others will. " Direct taxation."<lb break="no"/>I know that even your ultra democrat will cry 
     <lb/>
     out—" But, for my part, I prefer having the 
     <lb/>
     right to tax myself to leaving the power in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of others, for I never will use the right, 
     <lb/>
     and others might perhaps enforce it. I quote

     As to education, the honorable member for

     Now, I call the attention of hon. members of 
     <lb/>
     this House to the powers here granted to the 
     <lb/>
     local governments, and which would conse<lb break="no"/>quently be granted to us in Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     When we opposed representation based upon 
     <lb/>
     population, was it because we feared that the 
     <lb/>
     majority would pass a tariff weighing une<lb break="no"/>qually on the two sections of the province ? 
     <lb/>
    Was it because we feared they would erect 
     <lb/>no more light-houses in the Gulf or elsewhere ? 
     <lb/>Was it because we feared that Upper Canada, by 
     <lb/>means of its majority, would establish a great<lb break="no"/>er number of post-offices, or increase the rates 
     <lb/>of postage on letters ? No, Mr. SPEAKER, it 
     <lb/>was not for any of these reasons ; but it was 
     <lb/>because we properly and rightly feared that 
     <lb/>when Upper Canada obtained a larger num<lb break="no"/>ber of representatives in the Legislature than 
     <lb/>Lower Canada, they would invade our rights 
     <lb/>and endanger all that we hold most dear. 
     <lb/>That is what we feared. (Hear, hear.) And 
     <lb/>at the very moment when the Government 
     <lb/>presents a measure securing the safety of all 
     <lb/>our rights and institutions, with guarantees 
     <lb/>for the minority, honorable members declare 
     <lb/>that the union must be maintained, even with

     representation based upon population. No, 
     <lb/>
     they are not sincere in this ; it is a mere sub<lb break="no"/>terfuge on their part, for they cannot propose 
     <lb/>
     anything to the country in place of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment project. (Hear, hear) The Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition attempt to shew that a Federal union 
     <lb/>
     and a Legislative union are the same thing, 
     <lb/>
     but the whole world knows that the two kinds 
     <lb/>
     of union are not in any way alike. In a Fed<lb break="no"/>eral union the Legislature cannot go beyond 
     <lb/>
     the rights and powers assigned to it, whereas 
     <lb/>
     in a Legislative union it is vested with all 
     <lb/>
     power—it is sovereign. And is it to be sup<lb break="no"/>posed that under a legislative union, with 
     <lb/>
     representation based upon population, the ma<lb break="no"/>jority would refrain from encroaching on our 
     <lb/>
     rights, our institutions, and all that we value

     as important for our well-being ?

     <persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. DUFRESNE</persName>—The hon. member dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly sees the mote in his neighbor's eye, 
     <lb/>
     but he cannot in any way discover the beam 
     <lb/>
     in his own ! He forgets that he wearied this 
     <lb/>
     House for five or six hours, reading passages 
     <lb/>
     from history calculated to excite prejudice 
     <lb/>
     against a nation which is in a majority both 
     <lb/>
     here and elsewhere. I can only account for 
     <lb/>
     his having forgotten his own speech so soon, 
     <lb/>
     by taking it for granted that the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member did not himself make the research 
     <lb/>
     required in order to swell it up to its vast di<lb break="no"/>mensions, for it was nothing but a mass of 
     <lb/>
     scraps with which he wearied the House 
     <lb/>
     during five long hours. (Hear, hear, and 
     <lb/>
     laughter.) I do not wish to be severe, but I 
     <lb/>
     trust the hon. member will pay attention to 
     <lb/>
     the remarks I now desire to make. He as<lb break="no"/>serted, on the floor of this House, that the 
     <lb/>
     liberals had struggled to obtain responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. If he said that of the men who 
     <lb/>
     really did do so, it would be all very well ; but 
     <lb/>
     if he asserts it of those who form his own 
     <lb/>
     party, he is greatly in error ; for we all know 
     <lb/>
     that that party has always protested against 
     <lb/>
     the union and against responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment. (Hear, hear.) That party declared, 
     <lb/>
     at elections and elsewhere, on every occasion, 
     <lb/>
     that responsible government was a deception 
     <lb/>
     and a snare—an insult cast in our teeth by 
     <lb/>
     England. (Hear, hear.) That has been the 
     <lb/>
     cry of his political party ever since we ob<lb break="no"/>tained responsible government. How, then, 
     <lb/>
     can he have the hardihood to assert that we 
     <lb/>
     owe it to them? (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Richelieu also said that the clergy 
     <lb/>
     were wrong in 1837, and that they are wrong 
     <lb/>
     now in supporting the Government.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PERR2">MR. PERRAULT</persName>—I have often heard 
     <lb/>
     words spoken in this House misquoted, but I 
     <lb/>
     must say I have never heard that species of 
     <lb/>
     tactics carried to such excess as it has been 
     <lb/>
     in this instance, with regard to myself, by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Montcalm. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, from the Opposition.) What I said 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the episcopacy and the men 
     <lb/>
     of talent who adorn it, was this—I stated 
     <lb/>
     that with our present system of public in<lb break="no"/>struction in our rural districts, every child is 
     <lb/>
     enabled to receive such an education as will 
     <lb/>
     fit him to aspire to the highest position in the 
     <lb/>
     country, and to the highest rank in social 
     <lb/>
     life. I then added, in proof of my assertion, 
     <lb/>
     that we now see in the highest ranks in 
     <lb/>
     society men belonging to humble country 
     <lb/>
     families, whose parents possessed neither the 
     <lb/>
     fortune nor the influence necessary to push 
     <lb/>
     their children forward, and that they had suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded only through their own talents, 
     <lb/>
     their industry, and the advantages afforded by 
     <lb/>
     our system of education. I also said, in 
     <lb/>
     proof of my assertion, that the children of the 
     <lb/>
     rural population had attained seats on the 
     <lb/>
     judicial and ministerial benches, and even 
     <lb/>
     among the episcopacy. Now, any one who 
     <lb/>
     understands the obvious meaning of words 
     <lb/>
     will admit that it is impossible to interpret 
     <lb/>
     that sentence as an expression of astonishment 
     <lb/>
     that there should be men of talent in the epis<lb break="no"/>copacy, as the honorable member makes a 
     <lb/>
     pretence of doing. On the contrary, by 
     <lb/>
     reserving the most forcible expression to the

            <fw type="num">927</fw>
           
     last, when I said that even in the ranks of 
     <lb/>
     the episcopacy are to be found the sons of 
     <lb/>
     farmers who advanced themselves by their own 
     <lb/>
     talents, I wished to shew that even the epis<lb break="no"/>copal chair, the first and most elevated 
     <lb/>
     position in our country, was within the reach 
     <lb/>
     of our men of talent, thanks to our system of 
     <lb/>
     education, which enables all to compete for the 
     <lb/>
     highest dignities. And I defy any one capa<lb break="no"/>ble of understanding the sense and use of 
     <lb/>
     words, to deduce any other meaning from my 
     <lb/>
     remarks, unless it be done with the set purpose 
     <lb/>
     of foisting upon me words I never used. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. DUFRESNE</persName>—I have allowed the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Richelieu to explain 
     <lb/>
     what he said, or wished to say, but he had no 
     <lb/>
     right to conclude with an unjust insinuation. 
     <lb/>
     However, I am not greatly surprised, for I 
     <lb/>
     am aware that it is the habit of his party, 
     <lb/>
     and that those honorable gentlemen never lose 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity of insulting those who differ 
     <lb/>
     from them in their opinions. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     A few days ago, when I begged leave to inter<lb break="no"/>rupt the honorable member for Richelieu, he 
     <lb/>
     consented courteously, and in replying to my 
     <lb/>
     remark—which was not of an insulting nature 
     <lb/>
     —he told me that he was not like me, for my 
     <lb/>
     speeches and my works were as yet things of 
     <lb/>
     the future. It was quite true, though it is 
     <lb/>
     not always well to speak the whole truth, 
     <lb/>
     nor, in fact, to hear it. (Laughter) But I 
     <lb/>
     must tell him that in my humble position, 
     <lb/>
     not being fully informed of all that takes 
     <lb/>
     place in the world, I have neither the means 
     <lb/>
     nor the leisure to bring forth works of such 
     <lb/>
     vast importance as those of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member. I content myself with coming here 
     <lb/>
     to discharge my duty towards my constituents, 
     <lb/>
     and I do it myself. I do not employ an offi<lb break="no"/>cial in making researches in the library to 
     <lb/>
     enable me to make long speeches. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, and laughter.) I do not require a paid 
     <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">employé</hi> of the Government to prepare my 
     <lb/>
     speeches ; and, moreover, I have not as yet 
     <lb/>
     found means to live at the expense of the 
     <lb/>
     Government. And if my speeches and works 
     <lb/>
     are as yet things of the future, I am not, at 
     <lb/>
     all events, in the habit of supporting myself, 
     <lb/>
     like the honorable member for Richelieu, by 
     <lb/>
     drawing upon the public chest, with or with<lb break="no"/>out any just claim or right. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I have now done with the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Richelieu. I have a word to say to the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for the county of Bagot. 
     <lb/>
     Though his speech was not an excessively 
     <lb/>
     brilliant one, yet he did not weary the House 
     <lb/>
     like the honorable member for Richelieu. He 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     told us that we did not represent the senti<lb break="no"/>ments of our electors, but that there was no 
     <lb/>
     danger of our voting for an appeal to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple on the question of Confederation, because 
     <lb/>
     the people are so strongly opposed to the pro<lb break="no"/>ject that the Government dare not submit it 
     <lb/>
     for their approval. He was not the first to 
     <lb/>
     make the assertion, and I shall refer to the 
     <lb/>
     point presently. He then told the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment " that it never was their intention to 
     <lb/>
     have the question of Confederation seriously 
     <lb/>
     discussed, and that they did not desire a dis<lb break="no"/>cussion of their scheme. But how did the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member expect to be believed? 
     <lb/>
     Was not the Government plan laid before the 
     <lb/>
     House at the commencement of the session<lb break="no"/>seven weeks ago ? Have not the Government 
     <lb/>
     and their friends done everything in their 
     <lb/>
     power to promote the discussion of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, while honorable gentlemen opposite were 
     <lb/>
     unwilling to do so, and constantly strove to 
     <lb/>
     prevent its discussion ? What was their 
     <lb/>
     motive in so acting ? The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Bagot was, therefore, wrong in stating 
     <lb/>
     that the Government did not desire a discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and that they stifled discussion ; for it 
     <lb/>
     is perfectly clear that the Opposition did not 
     <lb/>
     desire it, and persistently refused it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The honorable member for Bagot is 
     <lb/>
     not in his seat ; but when he returns I shall 
     <lb/>
     have a few words to say in reply to certain 
     <lb/>
     points in his speech. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Drummond and Arthabaska (Mr. J. B. E. 
     <lb/>
     DORION) also told us that the movement 
     <lb/>
     throughout the country is so strong that it 
     <lb/>
     cannot be resisted ; that the people are dis<lb break="no"/>contented, and that the consequences of that 
     <lb/>
     discontent will be highly disastrous. He spoke 
     <lb/>
     of the vast number of petitions presented to the 
     <lb/>
     House against Confederation, in order to shew 
     <lb/>
     that the people are opposed to it. Well, if 
     <lb/>
     all the honorable members of this House who 
     <lb/>
     sent petitions to their counties for signature 
     <lb/>
     have followed the same course as the honor<lb break="no"/>able member himself, it is not surprising that 
     <lb/>
     they should be numerously signed, for we all 
     <lb/>
     remember the honorable member's letter, 
     <lb/>
     which was read in this House a few days ago 
     <lb/>
     by the Honorable Attorney General for Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER). There can be 
     <lb/>
     no two opinions as to the character of that 
     <lb/>
     document. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) The 
     <lb/>
     House will bear in mind that he wrote to the 
     <lb/>
     wardens of his county, directing them to get 
     <lb/>
     the petitions he forwarded signed by the men, 
     <lb/>
     the women, and the children! (Laughter) 
     <lb/>
     And when his letter was read in this House, 
     <lb/>
     instead of blushing with shame and confusion, 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="928" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0928.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">928</fw>
         
     the honorable member. said he gloried in hav<lb break="no"/>ing written it! "It was an energetic step," 
     <lb/>
     said he, " and I am not ashamed of it." 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) I do not desire to make any 
     <lb/>
     insulting remarks, nor to indulge in painful 
     <lb/>
     comparisons ; but it must be remembered 
     <lb/>
     that it is not the hardened criminal that 
     <lb/>
     blushes for his evil deeds ; the rogue that 
     <lb/>
     blushes may still mend his ways but those 
     <lb/>
     who have lost the power of blushing are in 
     <lb/>
     final impenitenee. {Langhter.) The honor<lb break="no"/>able member told us of the astonishing pro<lb break="no"/>gress of the United States, in spite of the war 
     <lb/>
     and the enormous expenses it has entailed ; 
     <lb/>
     and he told us that in five years from the 
     <lb/>
     present time New York will have paid off its 
     <lb/>
     debt ; then why not unite ourselves with the 
     <lb/>
     State of New York ? He did not say all 
     <lb/>
     that, but nearly all ; it is the natural conclu<lb break="no"/>sion to be drawn from his speech. He tells 
     <lb/>
     us that the people are discontented, and that 
     <lb/>
     they will rise up in rebellion if we force Con<lb break="no"/>federation on them. But what means does 
     <lb/>
     he employ in order to excite the prejudices of 
     <lb/>
     the people ? We may judge of the means he 
     <lb/>
     resorts to in this instance by those he em<lb break="no"/>ployed in former days to prejudice the people 
     <lb/>
     against a measure favorable to their own in<lb break="no"/>terests, but unjust in some of its provisions, 
     <lb/>
     involving the spoliation of a particular class 
     <lb/>
     in society—I speak of the abolition of the 
     <lb/>
     Seigniorial Tenure. Were it not for the 
     <lb/>
     abolition of the Seigniorial Tenure, the 
     <lb/>
     seigniors would now be extremely wealthy. 
     <lb/>
     The effect, then, of that law was to despoil 
     <lb/>
     the seigniors for the benefit of the people<lb break="no"/>whom the honorable member for Drummond 
     <lb/>
     and Arthabaska pretends to represent. But, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, how did the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     act at the time ? How did he attempt to 
     <lb/>
     deceive the people, and excite prejudices 
     <lb/>
     against that measure ? I have endeavored to 
     <lb/>
     find the pamphlet written by the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member at the time, but it is not to be found 
     <lb/>
     in the library of Parliament—it has disap<lb break="no"/>peared. However, the democratic journals 
     <lb/>of that period are still forthcoming, and as 
     <lb/>they published a portion of the honorable 
     <lb/>member's pamphlet, I will read a few pas<lb break="no"/>sages, in order to shew what a pot pourri it 
     <lb/>was. The means then used succeeded so well 
     <lb/>with the people, that an attempt will probably 
     <lb/>be made to resort to similar expedients now 
     <lb/>against Confederation. The people, con<lb break="no"/>vinced of the truth of what the hon. member 
     <lb/>wrote against the seigniors and against the 
     <lb/>Government, were incensed against the " trait<lb break="no"/>ors," and in the county of Lotbiniere they 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     prevented the commissioners charged with 
     <lb/>
     the preparation of the schedules from pro<lb break="no"/>ceeding with their duties during a certain 
     <lb/>
     period. It is well to bear in mind the exist<lb break="no"/>ence of these documents, now that our adver<lb break="no"/>saries are loading us with abuse ; and it is 
     <lb/>
     time the people should know who are their 
     <lb/>
     friends and who are the "traitors." (Hear,

     to compel the Government to do better. The

     maintain that the demagogues did everything

     to-day but one-third of the population, and 
     <lb/>
     despite the progress we have made under the

     union, any man of sense who reflects on the 
     <lb/>
     position we now occupy, must admit that we 
     <lb/>
     ought to be delighted to accept the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, since it will give us the con<lb break="no"/>trol of our system of education, our institu<lb break="no"/>tions, and all the interests of Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I have made a note with re<lb break="no"/>ference to the speech of one of my friends in 
     <lb/>
     this House—the hon. member for Beauce 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. TASCHEREAU). I was really surprised 
     <lb/>
     to hear him express himself as he did with 
     <lb/>
     reference to this question of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     I am quite sure he was sincere ; but I must 
     <lb/>
     say I think he might have expressed his own 
     <lb/>
     opinions and refrained from adopting the 
     <lb/>
     false arguments in vogue on the other side 
     <lb/>
     of this House. (Hear, hear.) I feel that 
     <lb/>
     with a friend one must not be severe. Be<lb break="no"/>tween the honorable members for Drummond

     and Arthabaska and Richelieu, and myself, 
     <lb/>
     there need be no such reticence of expression ; 
     <lb/>
     but with the hon. member for Beauce it is quite 
     <lb/>
     a different matter. He told us that Confed<lb break="no"/>eration would give the death-blow to our na<lb break="no"/>tionality ; but how can he possibly think so ? 
     <lb/>
     I can easily understand such arguments being 
     <lb/>
     used by honorable gentlemen opposite, because 
     <lb/>
     they are in the habit of distorting facts ; but 
     <lb/>
     I am pained to see the honorable member for

     give a helping hand to those who are working

     <lb/>been advanced by the people of any other part 
     <lb/>of the proposed Confederation. We all know 
     <lb/>that if this scheme is adopted, the English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>speaking part of the population of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada will be in a very small minority in the 
     <lb/>Local Legislature ; we all know that those 
     <lb/>who first opened up and settled the country 
     <lb/>which I allude to spoke the English language, 
     <lb/>and that the great majority of the people now 
     <lb/>living there are English-speaking Protestants ; 
     <lb/>and, therefore, when their representatives are 
     <lb/>called upon to vote for a measure of this kind, 
     <lb/>which so deeply and intimately affects their 
     <lb/>future position and prosperity, I believe that 
     <lb/>all the details of it, all parts of it, should be 
     <lb/>fully and clearly placed before them, in order 
     <lb/>that they may know exactly in what position 
     <lb/>they stand with regard, and how it is to affect 
     <lb/>the interests they represent. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>The honorable gentlemen on the Treasury 
     <lb/>benches, in introducing this scheme and ask<lb break="no"/>ing our assent to it, have thought proper to 
     <lb/>take a different course ; they merely bring 
     <lb/>down the resolutions which consent to Con<lb break="no"/>federation, reserving the all-important details 
     <lb/>for future consideration. It may be the right 
     <lb/>course, but I doubt it very much. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Although the Government has not 
     <lb/>given all the information which I would 
     <lb/>desire, I do not, however, think that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the section of which I am one of the 
     <lb/>representatives would be justified in opposing 
     <lb/>a scheme that may prove beneficial generally, 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     merely because some of their interests may 
     <lb/>
     possibly be affected by it. I shall, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     vote for the resolutions in your hands, reserving 
     <lb/>
     to myself the right of voting for or against the 
     <lb/>
     details of the scheme for the local constitu<lb break="no"/>tion as in my judgment may seem advisable. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I consider that by voting for 
     <lb/>
     this measure I do not pledge myself to any<lb break="no"/>thing more than the general principle of a 
     <lb/>
     union of the Provinces of British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica. I admit, sir, that last summer the polit<lb break="no"/>ical affairs of this country were in a state of 
     <lb/>
     extreme difficulty, and I admit, too, that it 
     <lb/>
     was necessary something should be done to 
     <lb/>
     get rid of that difficulty. I would have 
     <lb/>
     thought, however, that the Conference which 
     <lb/>
     met here in October last, to consider a subject 
     <lb/>
     that has been before the peeple of this coun<lb break="no"/>try since 1858, would have proposed, for the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the respective legislatures, a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union of the British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ican Provinces. It appears to me that a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union would be far more effective 
     <lb/>
     in binding the provinces together, and far 
     <lb/>
     more economical than the Federal union pro<lb break="no"/>posed. (Hear, hear.) I admit, however, that 
     <lb/>
     there may be very great difficulties in bring<lb break="no"/>ing about a legislative union, that may not 
     <lb/>
     be in the way of a Federal union ; and under 
     <lb/>
     all the circumstances of the case, the scheme 
     <lb/>
     proposed may have been the best that could  
     <lb/>
     have been devised. The greatest objection I 
     <lb/>
    now have to it is that many of the people do 
     <lb/>not understand—that its details are not yet 
     <lb/>fully comprehended by the country. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that if hon. gentlemen had come down 
     <lb/>with the scheme in its entirety—presenting 
     <lb/>all its details, and the results expected to flow 
     <lb/>from them—that there would be far less op<lb break="no"/>position to it than there is in the country and 
     <lb/>in this House. (Hear, hear.) But as it is 
     <lb/>now, they call upon the representatives of the 
     <lb/>people to give their consent to a measure that 
     <lb/>neither they nor the people thoroughly under<lb break="no"/>stand. These objections have been made to 
     <lb/>the scheme, and in my opinion they have 
     <lb/>great weight, more particularly in the part of 
     <lb/>the country which I have the honor to repre<lb break="no"/>sent. It is not to be wondered at that the 
     <lb/>English-speaking part of the population of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada view it with apprehension, or 
     <lb/>rather have fears in their minds as to the 
     <lb/>working of it, when gentlemen like the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Peterborough, who are far re<lb break="no"/>moved from any of the difficulties that sur<lb break="no"/>round our position, have entertained the same 
     <lb/>feeling of apprehension. They have thought 
     <lb/>proper to express doubts and fears as to the 
     <lb/>
         
 
            <pb n="932" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0932.jpg"/>

     result, and it cannot, therefore, be surprising 
     <lb/>
     that we should have our doubts and appre<lb break="no"/>hensions about it. (Hear, hear.) I take it 
     <lb/>
     that the Protestants of Lower Canada have 
     <lb/>
     no cause of complaint against our French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian neighbors. We have lived together 
     <lb/>
     since the union on good terms, and all our in<lb break="no"/>tercourse has been founded on equity and 
     <lb/>
     justice. (Hear, hear.) But there is a feel<lb break="no"/>ing amongst our community that they 
     <lb/>
     should be removed beyond the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     danger from any aggression by the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian population, and it is difficult to satisfy 
     <lb/>
     them that the scheme before the House and 
     <lb/>
     country will permit them to indulge in that 
     <lb/>
     feeling of security. (Hear, hear.) It is not 
     <lb/>
     necessary for me, sir, to enter into any lengthy 
     <lb/>
     remarks upon this subject, nor to follow those 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen who have gone into the 
     <lb/>
     matter thoroughly. I have no doubt that if 
     <lb/>
     a union of all the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces can be brought about on terms that 
     <lb/>
     shall be just and equitable to all sections and 
     <lb/>
     interests, it would be very advantageous to all 
     <lb/>
     of them. (Hear, hear.) I shall not, sir, de<lb break="no"/>tain the House any longer, but shall conclude 
     <lb/>
     by expressing my sincere hope that when we 
     <lb/>
     are again called upon to legislate upon this 
     <lb/>
     subject, we shall find that the details of this 
     <lb/>
     important change of our Constitution will be 
     <lb/>
     founded on justice and equity to all, and that 
     <lb/>
     we shall also find that honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who have now in a great measure the future 
     <lb/>
     destinies of Canada on their hands, may be 
     <lb/>
     found equal to their task, and that Canada, 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the other provinces, may 
     <lb/>
     become the land fit in every respect for the 
     <lb/>
     home of the free. (Cheers) '

     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—I have list<lb break="no"/>ened, Mr. SPEAKER, with great interest to the 
     <lb/>
     observations of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Richmond and Wolfe, who has just sat down. 
     <lb/>
     There is not the least doubt that the honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman represents a constituency and 
     <lb/>
     population, the majority of which is Protes<lb break="no"/>tant in its religious belief, and we know very 
     <lb/>
     well that great efforts have been made by those 
     <lb/>
     opposed to this scheme to create apprehen<lb break="no"/>sion and distrust in the minds of the Protes<lb break="no"/>tant minority in Lower Canada in regard to 
     <lb/>
     it. But I now reiterate what I have already 
     <lb/>
     stated to this House, as a Catholic and as a 
     <lb/>
     member of the Canadian Government, that 
     <lb/>
     when the measure for the settlement of the 
     <lb/>
     Local Government of Lower Canada comes 
     <lb/>
     before this House for discussion, it will be

     Lower Canada. (Cheers)

     <persName ref="pers:RYMA1">Mr. RYMAL</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, relying 
     <lb/>
     upon the pledge given by the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West, that the members of this 
     <lb/>
     House would have a fair Opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     expressing their views upon all the details 
     <lb/>
     of this measure, I had proposed reserving 
     <lb/>
     what little I had to say till such time as 
     <lb/>
     amendments embodying my views were be<lb break="no"/>fore the House. But the pledge which I 
     <lb/>
     expected would be carried out in good faith 
     <lb/>
     has been violated by that hon. gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     and I am compelled now to raise m voice, 
     <lb/>
     and in my weak way, to assert what i would 
     <lb/>
     much rather have recorded by my vote. 
     <lb/>
     You are well aware, sir, and every member 
     <lb/>
     of the House is aware, of the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     that called into existence the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and the avowed object for which it 
     <lb/>
     was formed; and all they asked, so far as I 
     <lb/>
     am aware, was that a certain degree of for<lb break="no"/>bearance should be shown to them, in order 
     <lb/>
     that they might form a scheme that would 
     <lb/>
     remove the dificnlties existing between 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada, and, perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     tend to bring about a union of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. As I understood the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Government, the Federation of the Canada: 
     <lb/>
     was the first object aimed at, arranging it in 
     <lb/>
     such a manner as to allow the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to come in when they desired to do 
     <lb/>
     so. Mr. SPEAKER, that has by some been 
     <lb/>
     denied ; but reading the memorandum drawn 
     <lb/>
     up and read by the Government at the time 
     <lb/>
     explanations were given to this House, and 
     <lb/>
     understanding as I do the purport of it, I 
     <lb/>
     think there is no loop-hole of escape from 
     <lb/>
     the obligation the Government were under 
     <lb/>
     to carry out the Federation of the Canadss 
     <lb/>
     first, leaving it to the other provinces to 
     <lb/>
     come in afterwards if they saw fit. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I bring, then, two charges against 
     <lb/>
     the Government—one against the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West, and the other 
     <lb/>
     against those hon. friends in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment with whom I havesolong acted. The 
     <lb/>
     first is, that the Hon. Attorney General West 
     <lb/>
     broke faith with the House in preventing 
     <lb/>
     amendments being moved; and the second 
     <lb/>
     is, that the Reform members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment broke faith in not bringing down a 
     <lb/>
     measure for the Federation of the Canadas. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I had hoped, sir, that the 
     <lb/>
     infusion of some pure blood into the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment—the addition of two or three men who 
     <lb/>
     had denounced all sorts of wickedness and 
     <lb/>
     corruption so loudly as the hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who went into the Government last sum<lb break="no"/>mer—would at least have brought about some 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="933" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0933.jpg"/>

     improvement in the other members of the 
     <lb/>
     Administration—(laughter)—and although 
     <lb/>
     I have been deceived and disappointed in my 
     <lb/>
     expectations, had the scheme propounded to 
     <lb/>
     this House been such as to commend 
     <lb/>
     itself to my judgment, and convince me 
     <lb/>
     it would remove the sectional difficulties 
     <lb/>
     long complained of, it would have re<lb break="no"/>ceived my approval. I had hoped, too, 
     <lb/>
     and fully believed, that when it came to be 
     <lb/>
     pronounced upon by the Legislature, it would, 
     <lb/>
     before final adaption, be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people for their approval. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     That this was the opinion of a large majority 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Upper Canada, in November 
     <lb/>
     and December last, is, I think, beyond doubt. 
     <lb/>
     The local papers in all sections of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada asserted that the Government could 
     <lb/>
     not take upon itself the fearful responsibility 
     <lb/>
     of forcing such a measure upon the people, 
     <lb/>
     without asking whether they consented to it 
     <lb/>
     or not. Allow me, sir, to read an extract 
     <lb/>
     from one that has accidentally fallen into 
     <lb/>
     my hands, in order to show the feeling of 
     <lb/>
     the people of Upper Canada upon this point. 
     <lb/>
     I am not in the habit of addressing the 
     <lb/>
     House very often, and when I speak I fear 
     <lb/>
     I do not acquit myself very creditably ; and 
     <lb/>
     feeling on this occasion an unusual sense of 
     <lb/>
     responsibility, I am afraid I shall be worse 
     <lb/>
     than usual, which at all times is very indif<lb break="no"/>ferent. But I am impelled by a sense of 
     <lb/>
     duty to give my views upon the subject, and 
     <lb/>
     the House, I am sure, will overlook any 
     <lb/>
     shortcomings that I may exhibit. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The extract to which I have alluded 
     <lb/>
     reads as follows:-<lb/>

     twenty-five copies, and mailed them to my

     as to the propriety of adopting them. Only

     two sent anything like a favorable verdict,

     <lb/>
     was, that they thought the scheme might 
     <lb/>
     be advantageous in a national point of 
     <lb/>
     view, but they feared the expense of 
     <lb/>

     Mr. SPEAKER, I am glad to find that 
     <lb/>
     I am not the only man resident in the 
     <lb/>
     South Riding of Wentworth who questions 
     <lb/>
     in a very slight degree the honesty of 
     <lb/>
     purpose of some members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in bringing down a scheme of this 
     <lb/>
     kind, while, at the same time, refusing to 
     <lb/>
     give the House that information by which it 
     <lb/>
     ought to be accompanied. My correspondent 
     <lb/>
     goes on to say:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">I do not believe there is so much patriotism as 
     <lb/>
     is pretended among the advocates, or at least the 
     <lb/>
     parents of the scheme. I fear they see in it a 
     <lb/>
     nice arrangement by which they can extend their 
     <lb/>
     term of office, either in the General Government 
     <lb/>
     or in the present one. Their departure from the 
     <lb/>
     plan proposed by themselves last session ; their 
     <lb/>
    hurrying the resolutions through the House with<lb break="no"/>out giving the country time to consider them ; 
     <lb/>their great reluctance to give information on the 
     <lb/>subject, and some other things, lead me to doubt 
     <lb/>whether they are actuated solely by patriotic mo<lb break="no"/>tives. I should not have been so uncharitable as 
     <lb/>to doubt their sincerity, had not their conduct on 
     <lb/>former occasions been characterized by a lack of 
     <lb/>that quality. 
     <lb/>
            </quote>
            <p>And I must say, Mr. SPEAKER, that to a 
     <lb/>certain extent I entertain the same opinion. 
     <lb/>I do not propose to go over the whole ground 
     <lb/>in discussing this scheme. I do not feel 
     <lb/>competent to that task.  But since this 
     <lb/>debate commenced, I have listened carefully 
     <lb/>to almost every speech that has been made, 
     <lb/>with the view of receiving that light which 
     <lb/>would qualify me to give a vote satisfactory 
     <lb/>to myself and to my constituents. And I 
     <lb/>have come to the conclusion that taking this 
     <lb/>scheme all in all, I am not in a position to 
     <lb/>approve of it. (Hear, hear.) The refusal 
     <lb/>on the part of the Government to submit it 
     <lb/>to the people of this country, who have the 
     <lb/>deepest interest in it, proves conclusively to 
     <lb/>me that there is something in it which they 
     <lb/>do not wish the people to know. Their 
     <lb/>refusal, also, to give the fullest information 
     <lb/>on a matter of such importance, imparts to 
     <lb/>me a suspicion, that to use a homely but 
     <lb/>expressive phrase, " there's a nigger in the 
     <lb/>fence." (Laughter.) It has been contended 
     <lb/>that with a view to our security, it was ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to combine our strength. Now the 
     <lb/>strength, in my humble judgment, which we 
     <lb/>would obtain by consummating this union, is 
     <lb/>just that kind of strength which a fishing rod 
     <lb/>would obtain by fastening to it some ad<lb break="no"/>ditional joints. (Hear, hear.) If you can, 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     by some convulsion of nature, bring Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island and Newfoundland, and place them 
     <lb/>
     where the uninhabitable mountains, fifteen 
     <lb/>
     or twenty miles north of this place, now are, 
     <lb/>
     or leave a couple of them in the bosom of Lake 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, we might have additional strength. 
     <lb/>
     But, under our actual circumstances, you 
     <lb/>
     propose merely to add to us several hundred 
     <lb/>
     miles more of length, without any additional 
     <lb/>
     hands to defend them (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     must allude to one matter, which is to- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     bring upon us almost unlimited and un<lb break="no"/>known expenses, if this union is consum<lb break="no"/>mated. To undertake the construction of 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railroad is, in my judg<lb break="no"/>ment, to start upon a career of extravagance 
     <lb/>
     which will swamp this young country. As 
     <lb/>
     one of the agriculturists of Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     speaking in their name, I beg to assure the 
     <lb/>
     House—if it needs any assurance on a point 
     <lb/>
     so palpable—that the agriculturists of Canada 
     <lb/>
     are not in a very flourishing condition. The 
     <lb/>
     failure of the crops, with low prices, and 
     <lb/>
     the heavy burdens they have hitherto borne, 
     <lb/>
     have left them in a bad position to bear 
     <lb/>
     increased burdens. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     balance-sheet of our public financial oper<lb break="no"/>ations, I think, should be a warning to every 
     <lb/>
     one of us, that no uncalled-for or unnecessary 
     <lb/>
     expense should be entered upon, but that 
     <lb/>
     our means should be economised, and that a 
     <lb/>
     balance should, if possible, be shewn in our 
     <lb/>
     favor for the first time in ten years. We 
     <lb/>
     also see many of our business men at present 
     <lb/>
     rushing into the bankrupt courts. I find 
     <lb/>
     no fewer than 905 insolvent notices in the 
     <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canada Gazette</hi>, from the 1st September to 
     <lb/>
     the 24th December last. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/></p>
            
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—But did all these 
     <lb/>become bankrupts during the year?  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:RYMA1">MR. RYMAL</persName>—I cannot say. They at all 
     <lb/>events gave the notice during the year. And 
     <lb/>I believe the misfortunes which have befal<lb break="no"/>len these men will, in each case, affect at least 
     <lb/>half a dozen, making an aggregate of 5,000. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I am satisfied, therefore, 
     <lb/>that this is not the proper time for these 
     <lb/>increased burdens being thrown upon the 
     <lb/>people of Canada. I think hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>must agree with me, that we have lived as 
     <lb/>it were too fast, that we have gone beyond 
     <lb/>our means, and that we are reaping now the 
     <lb/>bitter fruits of this in the heavy debt which 
     <lb/>we at present bear. Without enlarging upon 
     <lb/>the reasons why I feel it my duty to oppose 
     <lb/>this measure, I may mention some half 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="935" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0935.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">935</fw>
            
     dozen which to my mind justify me in 
     <lb/>
     opposing it. In the first place, I oppose it 
     <lb/>
     because this is not the scheme which the 
     <lb/>
     Government pledged themselves to submit 
     <lb/>
     to the House this session, nor the one which 
     <lb/>
     has been considered by the people of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I oppose it also, because I was 
     <lb/>
     not sent here to change the Constitution, or 
     <lb/>
     to enter into partnerships, without those 
     <lb/>
     who sent me here having an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     pronouncing their opinion concerning them. 
     <lb/>
     I oppose it, because of the arbitrary conduct 
     <lb/>
     of the promoters of the scheme in endeavor<lb break="no"/>ing to wrest from the people privileges 
     <lb/>
     which they have enjoyed without abusing, 
     <lb/>
     and which they do not wish to give up. I 
     <lb/>
     refer here to the proposed mode of appoint<lb break="no"/>ing the Legislative Council. I oppose it, 
     <lb/>
     because the expenditure which this scheme 
     <lb/>
     involves, in my opinion, far outweighs 
     <lb/>
     the advantages to be derived from 
     <lb/>
     it. Further, I oppose it, because I do 
     <lb/>
     not believe it will settle the sectional diffi<lb break="no"/>culties we have complained of, but, on the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, will multiply them to the same 
     <lb/>
     extent as we take in new partners, and will 
     <lb/>
     leave Upper Canada the victim, not of one, 
     <lb/>
     but of several smaller provinces. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) In conclusion, I think honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen will agree with me, that in 1850 
     <lb/>
     Canada was the admiration and the envy 
     <lb/>
     of most of the people who were acquainted 
     <lb/>
     with our position. I would compare the 
     <lb/>
     position of Canada at that time—and I 
     <lb/>
     think I may without impropriety—to that of 
     <lb/>
     a young man of eighteen or twenty, hand<lb break="no"/>some in figure, with a good constitution, of 
     <lb/>
     robust strength, and under the care of a 
     <lb/>
     tender and loving parent (as I presume 
     <lb/>
     England is to Canada), and this parent has 
     <lb/>
     committed the health of this child of his<lb break="no"/>this lovely youth—to the care of a family 
     <lb/>
     physician, who, however, has transferred him 
     <lb/>
     from time to time to the care of other 
     <lb/>
     physicians of different schools. Some of 
     <lb/>
     them were allopaths, some were homœopaths, 
     <lb/>
     some were hydropaths—but they all bled<lb break="no"/>(laughter)—they all blistered—they all 
     <lb/>
     sweated. (Continued laughter.) Under 
     <lb/>
     such treatment this lovely youth became 
     <lb/>
     pale and sickly. The ruddy hue of health 
     <lb/>
     passed from his countenance, and instead of 
     <lb/>
     his step being firm and bounding, he began 
     <lb/>
     to stagger in his gait. Then the parent be<lb break="no"/>gan to call the physicians to account, for 
     <lb/>
     they were acting or pretending to act under 
     <lb/>
     responsibility for the result of their treat<lb break="no"/><cb/>ment. And what answer did they make ?  
     <lb/>
     Each one of them protested that his own 
     <lb/>
     nostrum was sufficient to cure the malady, 
     <lb/>
     although it was evident that he was sinking 
     <lb/>
     under the treatment. But in order that he 
     <lb/>
     might have the benefit of the craft, and them<lb break="no"/>selves not be dismissed for want of skill, they 
     <lb/>
     agreed to join, and, making an admixture of 
     <lb/>
     their several nostrums, to administer that to 
     <lb/>
     the patient. (Great laughter) Under this 
     <lb/>
     treatment, however, the kind parent began 
     <lb/>
     to think that his son had but a poor chance. 
     <lb/>
     He remonstrated—as I presume our parent 
     <lb/>
     (England) has done—and declared that this 
     <lb/>
     could not be allowed, that the patient would 
     <lb/>
     die, and that the neighbors were wondering 
     <lb/>
     at the amount of the patient's endurance, 
     <lb/>
     and the parent's folly in permitting this 
     <lb/>
     bleeding, blistering, sweating process to go 
     <lb/>
     on so long. And what do you suppose 
     <lb/>
     the quacks, in order to satisfy the parent, 
     <lb/>
     proposed to do? After acknowledging, as 
     <lb/>
    they could not help but acknowledge, that 
     <lb/>they had brought the lovely youth to the 
     <lb/>brink of the grave, they proposed now to 
     <lb/>the parent that he should hand over three 
     <lb/>or four other members of the family, that 
     <lb/>they might experiment upon them also. 
     <lb/>(Laughter.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, I am 
     <lb/>glad to say, that when they heard of this 
     <lb/>proposition, the other children said — 
     <lb/>" We will have none of it—no quack doc<lb break="no"/>tors for us from Canada—we will manage 
     <lb/>our own affairs and select our own physi<lb break="no"/>cians for ourselves." (Hear, hear, and laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) I have spoken in a figurative manner, 
     <lb/>but I trust my language has conveyed the 
     <lb/>sum and substance of our present position 
     <lb/>to the minds of hon. gentlemen. (Hear,  
     <lb/>hear.) It conveys exactly, at all events, the 
     <lb/>opinion I entertain of the treatment which 
     <lb/>Canada has received at the hands of her 
     <lb/>rulers for a number of years past. They 
     <lb/>have been playing their parts, one arguing 
     <lb/>" I am right," and the other, " You're 
     <lb/>wrong "—each party arrogating to itself the 
     <lb/>greatest amount of wisdom—until Canada 
     <lb/>has been reduced to a state of poverty—I 
     <lb/>won't say how low ; I do not like to describe 
     <lb/>it—but to a position in which every one 
     <lb/>admits we cannot remain. And now the 
     <lb/>men who have brought her to that position, 
     <lb/>who have been instrumental in creating the 
     <lb/>sectional difficulties and religious strifes that 
     <lb/>have embroiled the people of Canada, are to 
     <lb/>be the doctors who are to cure this malady ! 
     <lb/>If they can do it, I shall be happy to assist 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="936" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0936.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">936</fw>
          
     in my humble way. But believing the 
     <lb/>
     nostrum they are about to administer will 
     <lb/>
     aggravate the evil rather than cure or allevi<lb break="no"/>ate it, I feel it to be a duty I owe to my 
     <lb/>
     constituents and to my own conscience to 
     <lb/>
     vote against the scheme, be the conse<lb break="no"/>quences what they may. (Cheers.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PARK2">DR. PARKER</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, before 
     <lb/>
     the debate closes, I desire to make a few 
     <lb/>
     observations in explanation of the vote it is 
     <lb/>
     my intention to record on this question. I 
     <lb/>
     shall not trespass on the indulgence of the 
     <lb/>
     House, but will compress in a few sentences 
     <lb/>
     the explanations I desire to make. It is 
     <lb/>
     pretty well within the knowledge of the 
     <lb/>
    House that I entertain strong objections to 
     <lb/>the Address on the table—not only objections 
     <lb/>of principle, but detail—objections not only 
     <lb/>as an Upper Canadian, but as a British North 
     <lb/>American, and objections as to the time and 
     <lb/>manner in which it is sought to give to these 
     <lb/>resolutions the force of law. If it was pos<lb break="no"/>sible to propose or secure certain changes, I 
     <lb/>would make them or warmly support them. 
     <lb/>The motion of the " previous question " by 
     <lb/>the leader of the Government precludes all 
     <lb/>amendments ; for it I am not responsible, but 
     <lb/>by it I am forced to give a yea or nay vote 
     <lb/>on the Address as it now stands. I have no 
     <lb/>choice but to accept or reject these resolutions 
     <lb/>as a whole. If I could take the respons<lb break="no"/>ibility of the latter, I would state my 
     <lb/>objections to the basis of Confederation 
     <lb/>fully, perhaps strongly. I refrain from this 
     <lb/>expression, because, under the circumstances 
     <lb/>to which I have alluded, it would serve no 
     <lb/>good end or purpose. It has been persist<lb break="no"/>ently urged during this debate that the 
     <lb/>opponents of this measure should propound 
     <lb/>a better. A sufficient answer to that argu<lb break="no"/>ment is, that they are not allowed to do so. 
     <lb/>But aside from this, the opponents of a public 
     <lb/>measure are not always called upon to submit 
     <lb/>an alternative proposition, but may stand  
     <lb/>on their strict logical and parliamentary 
     <lb/>right of proposing nothing and conceding 
     <lb/>nothing, not even attempting to prove the 
     <lb/>particular measure to which they are opposed 
     <lb/>had, but that its supporters have not proved 
     <lb/>it to be good. Upon all questions of ordinary 
     <lb/>magnitude and importance from which l 
     <lb/>dissented, I would feel justified by that 
     <lb/>answer. But, sir, this is not a question of 
     <lb/>ordinary magnitude and importance ; our 
     <lb/>domestic and external difficulties are 
     <lb/>pressing and importunate, and I feel 
     <lb/>in rejecting this measure, I am bound 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     morally and in duty to the country 
     <lb/>
     and the people I represent, to see my 
     <lb/>
     way to something better. On this part of 
     <lb/>
     the issue I am entirely with the Government. 
     <lb/>
     I believe the period has arrived when it is 
     <lb/>
     necessary to remodel our institutions, even 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of conducting the civil gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the country. The time has come 
     <lb/>
     when it is necessary to carry some measure of 
     <lb/>
     constitutional reform. The public opinion 
     <lb/>
     of the country—all the events of the last 
     <lb/>
     year—the reconstruction of the present 
     <lb/>
    Administration expressly to settle this 
     <lb/>question, places us in a position whence we 
     <lb/>can neither recede nor stand still. The 
               <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">status quo</hi> is impossible. Under these 
     <lb/>circumstances, the practical question is<lb break="no"/>Can a better measure than that now before 
     <lb/>us be secured ? Better measures could, 
     <lb/>perhaps, have been devised, but it is 
     <lb/>doubtful if they would have secured general 
     <lb/>concurrence or be carried. The only ques<lb break="no"/>tion, however, I have to determine is, that 
     <lb/>under the necessities of the time and the 
     <lb/>restriction from all choice—for neither of 
     <lb/>which I am in any way responsible—I can 
     <lb/>see my way to nothing better, and I have 
     <lb/>therefore determined to record my vote for 
     <lb/>these resolutions. (Hear, hear) Conced<lb break="no"/>ing, as I honestly do, the necessity of 
     <lb/>constitutional changes, I accept this as the 
     <lb/>only practical measure at the present time. 
     <lb/>If I could see a reasonable probability of 
     <lb/>securing anything better, I would vote 
     <lb/>otherwise. But from some of the remarks 
     <lb/>made by leading members in opposition to 
     <lb/>this Address, the changes which they would 
     <lb/>probably propose I could under no circum<lb break="no"/>stances support ; because then, sir, circum<lb break="no"/>stances, over which I have no control, make 
     <lb/>this the only practicable change possible ; 
     <lb/>and, as the necessity is urgent, I accept 
     <lb/>these resolutions as a necessity of the time 
     <lb/>and situation. In voting for this Address, 
     <lb/>however, I reserve to myself the right of judg<lb break="no"/>ment on every question in these resolutions, 
     <lb/>which may hereafter become the subject 
     <lb/>of deliberation in Parliament, should 
     <lb/>I have the honor to hold a seat in this House. 
     <lb/>In voting for these resolutions, I hold myself 
     <lb/>in no way committed to any proposed im<lb break="no"/>provement ; and will vote on them, and par<lb break="no"/>ticularly the Intercolonial Railway, as though 
     <lb/>they Were in no way mentioned in these 
     <lb/>resolutions. Should this measure fail, either 
     <lb/>in the House of Commons or by the persist<lb break="no"/>ent refusal of the Maritime Provinces to 
     <lb/>

     make good their contract, I shall consider 
     <lb/>
     the Government still bound to find some 
     <lb/>
     other solution for our difficulties. Reason<lb break="no"/>able time and allowance being made for the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties of their task, I will continue to 
     <lb/>
     hold them responsible for some satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     measure of settlement. Should British 
     <lb/>
     North America become united on the basis 
     <lb/>
     of these resolutions, a serious responsibility 
     <lb/>
     will rest on those public men who will be 
     <lb/>
     called in the first days to administer these 
     <lb/>
     several governments. Should they fall into 
     <lb/>
     prodigal hands, the most serious injury, even 
     <lb/>
     ruin, may be entailed on the country. 
     <lb/>
     These dangers may be averted by prudence 
     <lb/>
     and economy in our future legislators, by 
     <lb/>
     which happier results may be achieved. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, under the most favorable auspices, 
     <lb/>
     I believe difficulties and embarrassments will 
     <lb/>
     grow up under this new Constitution. I 
     <lb/>
     hope it will not then be considered a finality, 
     <lb/>
     but capable of amendment as time goes on. 
     <lb/>
     I sincerely trust that so far as its future 
     <lb/>
     defects may have their origin in matters of 
     <lb/>
     law, they will be redressed by wise, legal and 
     <lb/>
     enlightened means ; and, so far as they may 
     <lb/>
     have their foundation in matters of sentiment 
     <lb/>
     or opinion, that they will be redressed by the 
     <lb/>
     cultivation of better and more fraternal feel<lb break="no"/>ing between the people of the different pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I trust and believe that by such 
     <lb/>
     happy means, although it is not now such a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution as we can all approve, that it 
     <lb/>
     may in the future be so modified and admin<lb break="no"/>istered as to meet the requirements and 
     <lb/>
     expectations of the country, and that under 
     <lb/>
     it all the residents of these six provinces 
     <lb/>
     may become one united, firm, prosperous 
     <lb/>
     and happy people. (Hear, hear.)

     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">Hon. MR. HOLTON</persName> said—MR. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, I endeavored to catch your eye in the 
     <lb/>
     early part of the evening, with the view of 
     <lb/>
     offering a few observations, both upon the 
     <lb/>
     merits of the subject referred to in the mo<lb break="no"/>tion in your hands, and of replying to some 
     <lb/>
     of the arguments adduced by the friends 
     <lb/>
     of the measure ; but, knowing the extreme 
     <lb/>
     anxiety that existed on the part of many 
     <lb/>
     others to speak to the resolutions before the 
     <lb/>
     vote is taken, and feeling that there would 
     <lb/>
     be another opportunity to address the House, 
     <lb/>
     when the motion, of which notice has been 
     <lb/>
     given by my honorable friend from Peel, 
     <lb/>
     comes up, I have determined not to claim 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the House for any length<lb break="no"/>ened remarks at the present time. There 
     <lb/>
     are, however, just one or two points to 
     <lb/>
     which I feel that I ought briefly to refer, 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     before a division is taken. My honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from Granville (Mr. SHANLY), in 
     <lb/>
     the course of his very interesting speech 
     <lb/>
     —a speech to which I listened with a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of attention—took occasion to 
     <lb/>
     remark upon what be characterised as the 
     <lb/>
     bold and manly course adopted by the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, on learning of the rejection of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme by the people of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. Sir, on that point, I join issue with 
     <lb/>
     that gentleman. The course of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ought to be bold and manly, to entitle 
     <lb/>
     it to the support of a bold and manly mind 
     <lb/>
     like his, that was so much in doubt as to 
     <lb/>
     what course to pursue before this bold and 
     <lb/>
     manly policy was adopted. But, sir, instead 
     <lb/>
     of its being a bold and manly course, I hold 
     <lb/>
     that it was a mere running away from the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty which the defeat of those resolutions 
     <lb/>
     by the people of New Brunswick presented. 
     <lb/>
     What was the position at that moment ? We 
     <lb/>
     were discussing the desirability and feasibility 
     <lb/>
     of having a union of all these colonies, 
     <lb/>
     founded upon resolutions adopted by a 
     <lb/>
     conference of delegates from the various 
     <lb/>
     colonies, which met in this city in October 
     <lb/>
     last. These resolutions were to be concurred 
     <lb/>
     in by all the provinces, and were represented 
     <lb/>
     to us as being in the nature of a treaty. 
     <lb/>
     Suddenly we hear that the Province of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, the only one whose terri<lb break="no"/>tory adjoins ours, had, in effect, refused to 
     <lb/>
     ratify that treaty, and hence the treaty falls 
     <lb/>
     to the ground, and the refusal of that 
     <lb/>
     province to join the union renders a union 
     <lb/>
     impossible. My hon. friend says it was a 
     <lb/>
     bold and manly course to insist on going 
     <lb/>
     on with that which it had become impos<lb break="no"/>sible to carry out ; but, sir, I maintain, 
     <lb/>
     as I said before, that their course was 
     <lb/>
     merely a method—cunning and adroit, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, but neither bold nor manly<lb break="no"/>which they adopted of running away from 
     <lb/>
     their duty. (Hear, hear.) The refusal of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick to join the union, or to 
     <lb/>
     ratify the treaty, having destroyed it, a new 
     <lb/>
     duty then devolved upon our Government—a 
     <lb/>
     duty growing directly out of the obligation 
     <lb/>
     under which those gentlemen placed them<lb break="no"/>selves in the reformation of their Government 
     <lb/>
     in June last. That obligation was to settle 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian difficulty this session, either by 
     <lb/>
     a Confederation of the provinces, or by a 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Federation. The one now under con<lb break="no"/>sideration for the former object being dead, they 
     <lb/>
     were bound to deal with the Canadian ques<lb break="no"/>tion apart altogether from that relating to the 
     <lb/>
     Federation of all the British North American 
     <lb/>
       
            <pb n="938" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0938.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">938</fw>
         
     Colonies. Instead of dealing with it, however, 
     <lb/>
     I say that they have run away from it. And 
     <lb/>
     that is what is called a bold and manly course. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Instead of that it was, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, a most cowardly course to pursue. 
     <lb/>
      (Hear, hear.) It was a stratagetic course, 
     <lb/>
    the effect of which was to avoid the difficulty, 
     <lb/>and hold their places in the Government ; but 
     <lb/>was anything but a manly one. The honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman spoke of this as a treaty. I 
     <lb/>am surprised that a gentleman for whose 
     <lb/>astuteness I had learned to entertain a very high 
     <lb/>estimation, should be carried away by such a 
     <lb/>fallacy as that. I maintain, sir, that no treaty 
     <lb/>has been submitted to us. It is not found in 
     <lb/>the resolutions, nor yet in the despatch of the 
     <lb/>Governor General transmitting them to this 
     <lb/>House. Neither the resolutions nor the des<lb break="no"/>patch contain any intimation of there having 
     <lb/>been a treaty between the respective provinces, 
     <lb/>and certainly we have had no correspondence 
     <lb/>laid before us purporting to relate to a treaty 
     <lb/>between this and the other provinces. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SHAN1">MR. SHANLY</persName>—The treaty was con<lb break="no"/>structed in Conference, and therefore no cor<lb break="no"/>respondence was necessary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Well, we know 
     <lb/>
     that there was correspondence between the 
     <lb/>
     colonial governments which has not been sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to us. It was referred to in the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions submitted to the Legislature of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. That correspondence, though moved 
     <lb/>
     for in this House on the first day of the present 
     <lb/>
     session by my hon. friend from Hochelaga, has 
     <lb/>
     never to this day been brought down, and 
     <lb/>
     yet, sir, it has been pretended that it is a 
     <lb/>
     treaty. If it is a treaty, why did not the 
     <lb/>
     Government submit the treaty or the corres<lb break="no"/>pondence which proved the existence of a 
     <lb/>
     treaty ? The seventeenth clause, sir, is the 
     <lb/>
     only one that can be quoted as having any 
     <lb/>
     bearing whatever on the question of a treaty. 
     <lb/>
     It reads as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">17. The basis of representation in the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons shall be population, as determined 
     <lb/>
     by the official census every ten years ; and the

     number of members at first shall be 194, dis<lb break="no"/>tributed as follows—Upper Canada, 82 ; Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, 65 ; Nova Scotia, 19 ; New Brunswick,

     15 ; Newfoundland, 8 ; and Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island, 5. 
     <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p>
     Of course, sir, the honorable gentlemen un<lb break="no"/>dertook to bring before their respective par<lb break="no"/>liaments the propositions which they had 
     <lb/>
     agreed upon in conference, and which, if ac<lb break="no"/>ceptable to all the legislatures, were to serve 
     <lb/>
     as a basis of a Constitution for the contem<lb break="no"/><cb/>plated union. But there is nothing in that 
     <lb/>
     clause to show that the governments, or the 
     <lb/>
     provinces which they represented, were to be 
     <lb/>
     bound to regard this whole scheme as a treaty, 
     <lb/>
     and to lay it before their respective legislatures 
     <lb/>
     as such. On the contrary, we find  Ministers 
     <lb/>
     in the Lower Provinces stating that the whole 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme might be modified. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And, sir, if it is a treaty, and the 
     <lb/>
     governments were bound as by that treaty to 
     <lb/>
     stand or fall by it, that treaty has been 
     <lb/>
     violated by the other parties thereto. What, 
     <lb/>
     sir, was the course pursued in Newfoundland ? 
     <lb/>
     Why, the leader of the Government himself 
     <lb/>
     moves a resolution in the Legislature, to the 
     <lb/>
     effect that the consideration of the whole 
     <lb/>
     question be postponed until next session, with 
     <lb/>
     a general election intervening If there was 
     <lb/>
     a treaty binding on all parties—and there 
     <lb/>
     cannot be a treaty unless it is binding on all 
     <lb/>
     parties—that is the very nature and essence of 
     <lb/>a treaty. If honorable gentlemen are justified 
     <lb/>in their statement that it is a treaty, do they 
     <lb/>not, by necessary implication, thereby charge 
     <lb/>the governments of all the other provinces 
     <lb/>with a breach of faith ? (Hear, hear.) But, 
     <lb/>sir, there was no treaty, and it was never in<lb break="no"/>tended to consider these resolutions as being 
     <lb/>in the nature of a treaty. It was simply in<lb break="no"/>tended that these heads of agreement—for 
     <lb/>they are hardly worthy of the name of resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, so clumsily are they strung together<lb break="no"/>should be brought before each Legislature in 
     <lb/>the shape of propositions, to be considered 
     <lb/>and voted upon separately, at the same time 
     <lb/>keeping in view the importance and expe<lb break="no"/>diency of adhering to the agreement arrived 
     <lb/>at in the Conference. Any other agreement in 
     <lb/>a conference composed of members of the 
     <lb/>Opposition, as well as of the governments of 
     <lb/>the Lower Provinces, would have been simply 
     <lb/>absurd ; but our Government were shrewd 
     <lb/>enough to see the difficulties that were likely 
     <lb/>to arise in considering the resolutions separ<lb break="no"/>ately, and that it would be impossible to 
     <lb/>obtain the assent of this House to all of the 
     <lb/>self-contradictory, and, in some cases, absurd 
     <lb/>propositions, contained in this scheme ; and, 
     <lb/>therefore, they hit upon this expedient of pro<lb break="no"/>claiming it to be in the nature of a treaty, of 
     <lb/>using their strength as a Government in its 
     <lb/>favor, and of asking the honorable members 
     <lb/>of this House to vote for it en masse—to 
     <lb/>vote in stultification of all their antecedents 
     <lb/>upon every question that has engaged the 
     <lb/>attention of this Legislature, or that has been 
     <lb/>the subject of discussion in our Provincial 
     <lb/>Parliament during the last quarter of a cen<lb break="no"/><pb n="939" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0939.jpg"/><fw type="num">939</fw>tury. (Hear, hear.) Sir, up to a recent 
     <lb/>
    period there might possibly be said to have 
     <lb/>been some little life in this debate ; but during 
     <lb/>the last week it has been to me not without 
     <lb/>its ludicrous aspects. When I have heard 
     <lb/>honorable members get up day after day and 
     <lb/>argue gravely for union with a people who 
     <lb/>we now know will have no union with us, and 
     <lb/>arguing that that union will be a means by 
     <lb/>which we could emerge from our sectional 
     <lb/>difficulties here in Canada, it has presented 
     <lb/>to my mind a most ludicrous aspect. I can<lb break="no"/>not conceive why hon. gentlemen, in the face 
     <lb/>of the intelligence we have had from New 
     <lb/>Brunswick and Newfoundland, and for what 
     <lb/>we know is likely to be the action of Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island and Nova Scotia, should go 
     <lb/>on gravely arguing in favor of this as a live 
     <lb/>scheme, from which anything else could come 
     <lb/>than the perpetuation of the official life of a 
     <lb/>few hon. gentlemen, brought together by 
     <lb/>means that I shall not now allude to more 
     <lb/>particularly, but which I shall take another 
     <lb/>occasion to characterise in such terms as I 
     <lb/>think are appropriate. Their Confederation 
     <lb/>scheme is dead, sir, and they know it is dead ; 
     <lb/>and yet they go on and ask their supporters 
     <lb/>here to vote for this string of seventy-two 
     <lb/>propositions. The hon. gentleman who has 
     <lb/>just taken his seat, said he was going to vote 
     <lb/>for the motion, but wished it to be distinctly 
     <lb/>understood that he was not in favor of any 
     <lb/>one of the propositions which the motion em<lb break="no"/>braces. I tell my honorable friend that he is 
     <lb/>going to record his vote in favor of every one 
     <lb/>of these propositions. I tell him that the 
     <lb/>Government will not give to him, or to this 
     <lb/>House of Parliament, the privilege of record<lb break="no"/>ing a vote on one proposition alone, unless it 
     <lb/>is recorded in favor of the whole scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PARK2">DR. PARKER</persName>—What I said was this-<lb/>that I reserved to myself the right of voting 
     <lb/>
     as I pleased on every resolution which might 
     <lb/>
     become the subject of parliamentary action 
     <lb/>
     on another day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I understood my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend perfectly ; but notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing any declaration that he may make in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the subject, the fact still holds 
     <lb/>
     good that by his vote he will place himself on 
     <lb/>
     record as being in favor of those seventy-two 
     <lb/>
     resolutions. That is the inevitable result of 
     <lb/>
     the mode in which these resolutions are put 
     <lb/>
     to this House—a very unsatisfactory mode, a 
     <lb/>
     very unparliamentary mode, and a mode 
     <lb/>
     which I maintain is an insult to this House 
     <lb/>
     as a free Parliament, representing British 
     <lb/>freemen—and I trust that before the final<lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     passing  of the resolutions and Address, this 
     <lb/>
    House will resist this endeavor to tamper 
     <lb/>with its freedom, andcondemn with it the men 
     <lb/>who have been the authors of the attempt. 
     <lb/>Well, sir, the scheme is dead, and yet it is to 
     <lb/>keep the men alive. (Laughter) That is 
     <lb/>the whole object of this discussion. The hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen know very well that the 
     <lb/>scheme is dead. (Hear, hear.) They know 
     <lb/>perfectly well that I am uttering the simple 
     <lb/>truth when I say that when they came down 
     <lb/>with their new programme, they were in the 
     <lb/>greatest possible difficulty ; and it was to re<lb break="no"/>tire from this difficulty, and not to force it, 
     <lb/>that they hit upon the expedient we saw them 
     <lb/>resorting to—proclaiming the refusal of the 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces to come into the union as 
     <lb/>the strongest reason why they declared in 
     <lb/>favor of the union. ( Hear, hear.) These 
     <lb/>are the few observations I proposed making 
     <lb/>to-night, reserving any further remarks I may 
     <lb/>have to make for the debate which will pro<lb break="no"/>bably arise on the motion of the honorable 
     <lb/>member for Peel (Hon. Mr. CAMERON. But 
     <lb/>while I am up, I desire to call the attention 
     <lb/>of the House to a somewhat startling state<lb break="no"/>ment which appears in the English news<lb break="no"/>papers that arrived today. I hold in my 
               <lb/>ands the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> of February 21st, containing 
     <lb/>the extended report of the debate in the 
     <lb/>House of Lords, of which we received a sum<lb break="no"/>mary by telegraph a few days ago, and in res<lb break="no"/>pect to which some information was recently 
     <lb/>conveyed to the House by a member of the 
     <lb/>Government, on the authority of a telegram 
     <lb/>which had been received from New York. It 
     <lb/>will be remembered that the first telegraphic 
     <lb/>report we had of the conversation in the 
     <lb/>House of Lords represented an appropriation 
     <lb/>of £50,000 as having been made towards the 
     <lb/>defences of Quebec. Although we had ap<lb break="no"/>plied for this information, it was refused us, 
     <lb/>but it was given unhesitatingly by Lord DE 
     <lb/>GREY, the Secretary at War, in the House of 
     <lb/>Lords, connected with some other statements 
     <lb/>respecting the share in the defences of the 
     <lb/>country to be undertaken by the people of 
     <lb/>this country. The honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>however, improved the opportunity which the 
     <lb/>news afforded them in their own way. They 
     <lb/>made it the basis of a new flank movement. 
     <lb/>It served as an excellent excuse for moving 
     <lb/>the previous question, in order that they 
     <lb/>might close this debate at the earliest possible 
     <lb/>moment, and start for England with the 
     <lb/>greatest haste, in order to save the country 
     <lb/>from impending invasion. The telegraphic re<lb break="no"/>port created a good deal of excitement in the

     my honorable friend from West Middlesex 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. SCATCHERD) was making some remarks 
     <lb/>
     in reference to this subject, the Hon. Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council rose in his place and told 
     <lb/>
     the House that either he himself or some 
     <lb/>
     other party had telegraphed to New York to 
     <lb/>
     learn the precise facts as to the alleged appro<lb break="no"/>priation by the Imperial Government of

     £50,000. The honorable gentleman stated

     he had learned that the sum was not £50,000.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—£30,000, or £50,<lb break="no"/>000—it was variously stated—but £200,000. 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, we have the extended report at 
     <lb/>
     length, and it appears that £50,000 is the 
     <lb/>
     sum to be placed in the estimates this year. 
     <lb/>
     They look to the expenditure of £200,000 in 
     <lb/>
     the course of four years, beginning this year 
     <lb/>
     with an appropriation of £50,000. It appears 
     <lb/>
     from this that they do not consider the case 
     <lb/>
     as so very urgent—not, at all events, so urgent 
     <lb/>
     as to require the business of the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     of this country to be suspended, in order that 
     <lb/>
     Ministers may hasten thither to make provi<lb break="no"/>sion for the defence of the country. (Hear 
     <lb/>
     hear.) So much would follow from the fact 
     <lb/>
     of their spreading the £200,000 over four 
     <lb/>
     years. But that is not all. Very startling 
     <lb/>
     statements on the subject of the defence of 
     <lb/>
     Canada were made in this debate in the House 
     <lb/>
     of Lords. We know how persistently our 
     <lb/>
     own Government have refused us the necessary 
     <lb/>
     information to guide us on the subject—seek<lb break="no"/>ing, in the absence of that information, un<lb break="no"/>fairly to use the subject of defence as a 
     <lb/>
     means of persuading honorable gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     support their measure of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Now I hold this doctrine, that 
     <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">quoad</hi> Canadian affairs, our Ministers are 
     <lb/>bound to furnish us with the same ample 
     <lb/>information as the Imperial Government are 
     <lb/>bound to furnish the Imperial Parliament, 
               <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">quoad</hi> Imperial affairs, when it is not incon<lb break="no"/>sistent with the public interest so to do. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Well, we find that weeks ago this debate 
     <lb/>came up in an incidental manner in the House 
     <lb/>of Lords, on a motion of a noble lord (Lord 
     <lb/>LYVEDEN) , for information on the subject, 
     <lb/>and that the Government at once entered into 
     <lb/>the fullest explanations, in the course of which 
     <lb/>they made some rather startling statements 
     <lb/>as to their negotiations on the defence ques<lb break="no"/>tion with this Government, and in respect to 
     <lb/>which all information has been withheld from 
     <lb/>us. In answer to Lord LYVEDEN, Earl DE 
     <lb/>GREY said:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>The Government undertook to provide for the 
     <lb/>
     necessary improvements in the defence of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     which had always been considered as an Imperial  
     <lb/>
     fortress and which, though formerly of great 
     <lb/>
     strength , like other fortifications, required im<lb break="no"/>provements to meet the altered circumstances of 
     <lb/>
     warfare. They had proposed to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Government to undertake the fortification of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal and the western points. The Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Government was well aware of the obligations 
     <lb/>
     which rested on them, and when they had re<lb break="no"/>ceived the necessary answer from the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, were ready to undertake these works. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mark this, that the Canadian Government 
     <lb/>
     are ready to undertake the fortification of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal and the western points. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Such is the information which we 
     <lb/>
     get from Earl DE GREY, that our Ministers 
     <lb/>
     have entered into this understanding, provided 
     <lb/>
     that they can get the assent and authority of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Parliament to incur the whole 
     <lb/>
     expense of permanent defensive works west<lb break="no"/>ward of Quebec. (Hear, hear.) And yet, sir, 
     <lb/>
     although information on this subject has been 
     <lb/>
     soughht for at almost every stage of the debate 
     <lb/>
     —aImost daily—they have persistently with<lb break="no"/>held it from us. But now fortunately before 
     <lb/>
     this debate is closed, we learn from the lips of 
     <lb/>
     the Secretary at War that in so far as in them 
     <lb/>
     lay, they pledged the resources of this coun<lb break="no"/>try to an untold amount for the construction 
     <lb/>of fortifications throughout the province, 
     <lb/>with the exception of Quebec. They have 
     <lb/>agreed to this, I say, subject to the ap<lb break="no"/>proval of Parliament, and which approval 
     <lb/>they dare not ask until this scheme, the 
     <lb/>whole of the seventy-two resolutions, with all 
     <lb/>their clumsy contrivances, is adopted by 
     <lb/>this House—in order that their official exis<lb break="no"/>tence may be lengthened out for a few months 
     <lb/>longer. (Hear, hear.) The whole amount 
     <lb/>which  will be required for permanent fortifi<lb break="no"/>cations, as stated in a leading article in the 
               <lb/>the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, is £1,300,000 sterling—about 
     <lb/>$7,000,000, of which the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment propose to expend £200,000, or about 
     <lb/>$1,000,000. We therefore learn that our 
     <lb/>Government have really bargained for the 
     <lb/>expenditure by Canada of $5,000,000 to 
     <lb/>$6,000,000 towards the permanent defen<lb break="no"/>ces of the country, in respect of which we 
     <lb/>have had no information whatever. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) There can be no doubt that they 
     <lb/>have made this bargain, because I have 
     <lb/>quoted the words of Earl DE GREY stating in 
     <lb/>precise terms that the Canadian Government 
     <lb/>had agreed to it, subject to the approval of 
     <lb/>our Parliament. I say that this is a startling 
     <lb/>fact, and I hope that the humble gentlemen 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="941" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0941.jpg"/>

     who intend voting for these seventy-two 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, which in reality sanction this 
     <lb/>
     arrangement—because the Government have 
     <lb/>
     insisted upon it and urged it throughout this 
     <lb/>
     debate—will pause before they add other 
     <lb/>
     $6,000,000 to the untold millions to which 
     <lb/>
     we shall be pledged by the adoption of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme now before the House. ( Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/></p>
            
            <p><persName ref="pers:FORT2">MR. FORTIER</persName>—In rising to speak at 
     <lb/>such an advanced stage of the debate, it is 
     <lb/>not my intention to occupy the attention of 
     <lb/>the House for any lengthened period, espe<lb break="no"/>cially as the topic of Confederation which 
     <lb/>has been under consideration for several 
     <lb/>days past, has been pretty thoroughly ex<lb break="no"/>hausted. I do not, however, consider that I 
     <lb/>should be doing my duty were I to allow 
     <lb/>this question to pass without remark, and 
     <lb/>without stating to the House and to the coun<lb break="no"/>try the reasons which have brought me to 
     <lb/>the determination to vote as I have resolved 
     <lb/>to vote on this great question of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. What, I would ask, Mr. SPEAKER, do 
     <lb/>Ministers call upon us to do on this occasion ? 
     <lb/>To pass an Address to Her Majesty, praying 
     <lb/>Her by a single stroke of the pen to cancel 
     <lb/>our present Constitution, and to substitute 
     <lb/>another based on the seventy-two resolutions 
     <lb/>adopted by the Conference at Quebec, held 
     <lb/>on the 10th October last. and which resolu<lb break="no"/>tions are now before the House. I am con<lb break="no"/>vinced that the Quebec Conference, when 
     <lb/>they framed the basis of our new Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, far from being actuated by any senti<lb break="no"/>ment of disinterestedness, were on the 
     <lb/>contrary influenced by the desire of personal 
     <lb/>advancement. I may be deceived, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKE, and I sincerely hope that I am. 
     <lb/>I hope that the electors of New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>who have just rejected the scheme of the 
     <lb/>Quebec Conference, and at the same time 
     <lb/>passed a direct vote of censure against the 
     <lb/>most illustrious men in that province, for 
     <lb/>having agreed to this scheme, and, by so doing, 
     <lb/>compromised the interests of their country<lb break="no"/>I hope, I say, that these electors have also 
     <lb/>been mistaken, knowing, as I do, that obedi<lb break="no"/>ence must be yielded to the majority, and 
     <lb/>that, in spite of their triumphant opposition, 
     <lb/>Confederation will be imposed upon us as 
     <lb/>now projected. It is sought by a single 
     <lb/>stroke of the pen to abrogate our Constitu<lb break="no"/>tional Act, and to substitute for it a Consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the details of which we are alto<lb break="no"/>gether ignorant, of which, indeed, every 
     <lb/>effort is made to keep us in ignorance. We 
     <lb/>are urged to exchange what we now have 
     <lb/>or something that they propose to give us.

            </p>

            <p>
     FRANKLIN has told us that "a bird in the 
     <lb/>
     hand is worth two in the bus ." I am one 
     <lb/>
     of those who would prefer the bird in the 
     <lb/>
     hand, and for that reason I am not prepared, 
     <lb/>
     without further guarantee, to change the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution of the country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I hold to the Constitution of 1840, because 
     <lb/>
     it consecrates a great principle in favor of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, that of equality of represen<lb break="no"/>tation in the Legislature ; and I adhere the 
     <lb/>
     more firmly to it, Mr. SPEAKER, when I

     bear in mind that it is one of the express

     conditions of my presence in this House as 
     <lb/>
     the representative of the county of Yamaska, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not intend to betray the confidence

     reposed in me. In relation to this subject, 
     <lb/>
     I will take the liberty of reading to the

     MY DEAR FRIEND,—From the little information 
     <lb/>
     l have been able to obtain in relation to what has 
     <lb/>
     taken place in the House since the beginning of 
     <lb/>
     the session, I observe that the true patriots, far 
     <lb/>
     from being able to avert, will not even have the 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction of delaying, the storm which threa<lb break="no"/>tens our unhappy country. The French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     egotists are, as usual, in the majority, especially 
     <lb/>
     in this nineteenth century—the age of progress it 
     <lb/>
     may be, but the age of selfishness, of hazardous 
     <lb/>
     speculations, in which conscience (now, alas! only 
     <lb/>
     a by-word) takes no part—the age of usurious 
     <lb/>
     loans, to the great detriment of the poor people, 
     <lb/>
     whom, not content with pillaging and ruining, it 
     <lb/>
     is now proposed, with the view of securing a few 
     <lb/>
     years of power and position, to deprive of their 
     <lb/>
     nationality, their laws and their religion.     
     <lb/>
     What ought we to do under these circum<lb break="no"/>stances, when we see our country threatened by 
     <lb/>
     its own children, allied with its bitterest foes? 
     <lb/>
     Treat the traitors with disdain, and maintain with 
     <lb/>
     firmness (no matter how few in numbers we may 
     <lb/>
     be) an energetic and constitutional opposition. 
     <lb/>
     It may be that at last the Catholic clergy will 
     <lb/>
     awake from their dream, and will manfully aid 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition, whose sole object is the preserva<lb break="no"/>tion of its most cherished rights.

     DEAR SIR,—I have received a copy of the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions in relation to the projected, union of the

     <lb/>
     having examined and studied them, and having

     read with care all that the papers on either side 
     <lb/>
     have to say for and against them, I beg to state 
     <lb/>
     as my opinion, that they are very far from meet<lb break="no"/>ing with my approval . Even were they better

     than they are, I should be very sorry to see them 
     <lb/>
     adopted before an Opportunity has been afforded 
     <lb/>
     to the electors to pronounce upon them, and to 
     <lb/>
     authorize their representatives to vote in favor of 
     <lb/>
     them. I shall abstain, in view of the want of 
     <lb/>
     space in a simple letter like this, from discussing 
     <lb/>
     the reasons which have led me to form this 
     <lb/>
     opinion. Suffice it that I unite my voice with that 
     <lb/>
     of the best friends of our country in telling you 
     <lb/>
     that you were not elected to destroy, but rather to 
     <lb/>
     promote the working of our Constitution.

            <p>
     These remarks, Mr. SPEAKER, are so true 
     <lb/>
     and so reasonable, that I should be ashamed 
     <lb/>
     did I not agree with them ; yet if I had reason 
     <lb/>
     to anticipate that our country would be 
     <lb/>
     endangered by the refusal of this House to 
     <lb/>
     pass the scheme of Confederation now pro<lb break="no"/>posed to us, I would not hesitate to vote 
     <lb/>
     in favor of it. But I am very far from 
     <lb/>
     believing that our Constitution cannot be 
     <lb/>
     made to work with benefit to the country 
     <lb/>
     for many years to come. If the TACHE-<lb break="yes"/>
     MACDONALD Government had not been 
     <lb/>
     defeated last year, and if it could have 
     <lb/>
     retained a majority of one or two votes only, 
     <lb/>
     as has been so well observed by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Beauce, Confederation would 
     <lb/>
     still be in the clouds, and the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford would still be at a great 
     <lb/>
     distance from his long-sought haven. It is, 
     <lb/>
     however, to be hoped that the offspring of 
     <lb/>
     the present Administration—composed, as it 
     <lb/>
     is, of such heterogeneous elements—will not 
     <lb/>
     be the victim of premature birth, and that 
     <lb/>
     the Government will have something else to 
     <lb/>
     present to the country than a still-born child. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, that great 
     <lb/>
     principle of sectional equality was conse<lb break="no"/>crated anew by the Legislative Council Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1856. And by whom was it consecrated ? 
     <lb/>
     By the men who are now in power. On the 
     <lb/>
     14th March, 1856, the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmorency, seconded by the Hon. Mr.

     <lb/>
     between Upper and Lower Canada, and ren<lb break="no"/>dering that branch of the Legislature elective. 
     <lb/>

     Thus, on this exciting question of representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population, eighty-nine members from

     Upper and Lower Canada voted and took

     part in the discussion, forty-four from Upper

     the Constitutional Act of 1840 to which I

     <lb/>
     branches of the Legislature ; as I have just 
     <lb/>
     shewn, it was also confirmed by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the Mother Country, for whose

     of establishing the peace, happiness and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity of the country since the troubles 
     <lb/>
     of 1837 and 1838 ; behind these two acts 
     <lb/>
     the French-Canadians have sheltered thems 
     <lb/>
     selves as behind an impregnable rampart, 
     <lb/>
     and yet these two acts the present Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, sustained by a majority of French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians in this House, are ready to scatter 
     <lb/>
     to the four winds. (Hear, hear.) For the 
     <lb/>
     last quarter of a century, Canada has enjoyed 
     <lb/>
     responsible government and the advantage 
     <lb/>
     of equality in the representation. What then 
     <lb/>
     is there to complain of, and by whom are 
     <lb/>
     complaints made ? Who have complained 
     <lb/>
     during the last ten years—have the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians, have the Upper-Canadians ?  No, 
     <lb/>
     sir, it is the hon. member for South Oxford 
     <lb/>

     (Hon. Mr. BROWN), and on what ground ? 
     <lb/>
    On the question of representation based 
     <lb/>upon numbers. Why has that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>created such a turmoil in Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>and why has he tried to tread under foot 
     <lb/>that which the French-Canadians hold most 
     <lb/>dear—their religion ? It was to attain power, 
     <lb/>to reach the seat which he now occupies on 
     <lb/>the other side of the House, supported by 
     <lb/>the honorable members for Kamouraska and 
     <lb/>Dorchester, like altar posts on each side 
     <lb/>of a statue. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>Who are those who have opposed that hon. 
     <lb/>member in this House ? All the members 
     <lb/>for Lower Canada, both French and English 
     <lb/>without distinction. Never have the mem<lb break="no"/>bers from Lower Canada been divided on 
               <lb/>this vital question. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Bleus</hi> and <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouges</hi>, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, have united as one man to pre<lb break="no"/>serve that which guaranteed to them their 
     <lb/>future as descendants of old France. And 
     <lb/>what was the cause of this union of French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Canadians against the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>Oxford ? To refuse him that which the 
     <lb/>present Administration has conceded to him, 
     <lb/>by the Quebec Conference. What was the 
     <lb/>reason given by the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>for Upper Canada, during the session of 
     <lb/>1863, to the member for South Oxford, who 
     <lb/>reproached him for having governed Upper 
     <lb/>Canada by a Lower Canadian majority ? He 
     <lb/>replied—and his words are still ringing in 
     <lb/>my ears—" Never," said he, " has Upper 
     <lb/>Canada had to complain of anything which 
     <lb/>my Government has imposed on Upper 
     <lb/>Canada by means of a Lower Canadian ma<lb break="no"/>jority. You have no grounds of complaint, 
     <lb/>and you will never obtain your extreme de<lb break="no"/>mands." This was the language used at 
     <lb/>that time. But things are changed, and 
               <lb/>unfortunately <hi rendition="simple:italic">autre temps autre chose, 
     <lb/>O tempora ! O mores !</hi> And afterwards, 
     <lb/>the honorable member for Montreal East 
     <lb/>added expressions more or less ironical, 
     <lb/>more or less founded, comparing the Grits 
     <lb/>of Upper Canada to so many codfish in 
     <lb/>the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It was then, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, that the honorable member 
     <lb/>for South Oxford took an activepart in the 
     <lb/>discussion. (Hear, hear.) You, no doubt, 
     <lb/>remember the occasion, or then you your<lb break="no"/>self, Mr. SPEAKER, were, in the eyes of the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Montreal, only a codfish 
     <lb/>eager for the bait. Mr. SPEAKER, I have 
     <lb/>always admired the energy displayed by the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Montreal East in resisting 
     <lb/>the hon. member for South Oxford ; his cour<lb break="no"/>age and boldness were boundless, and there 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     was such a vast difference of principles, and 
     <lb/>
     so much animosity existed between those 
     <lb/>
     two hon. gentleman and their respective 
     <lb/>
     supporters, that you could never for one 
     <lb/>
     moment have imagined that they could 
     <lb/>
     endure each other as neighbors on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches. This mutual reconcilia<lb break="no"/>tion, Mr. SPEAKER, reminds me of the effect 
     <lb/>
     produced on my mind by the happy family, 
     <lb/>
     which I had an opportunity of seeing at New 
     <lb/>
     York a few years ago, when the rat was to be 
     <lb/>
     seen between the paws of the cat, the monkey 
     <lb/>
     running after the rabbit, and the sparrow co<lb break="no"/>quetting with the owl. (Hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
    How long have the men to whom I have 
     <lb/>just referred paid any attention to the 
     <lb/>claims of the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>Oxford ? How long have they listened to 
     <lb/>him ? It is only since those hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>have found themselves in a minority in this 
               <lb/>House, since the TACHE-MACDONALD Go<lb break="no"/>vernment have resolved <hi rendition="simple:italic">per fas aut nefas</hi> 
     <lb/>to retain office—never before. Now, all this 
     <lb/>has not tended to inspire me with any confi<lb break="no"/>dence in the plan of Confederation, and has 
     <lb/>indeed made me resolve to vote against the 
     <lb/>whole, because this scheme is to be accepted 
               <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi> or not at all. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>Government tells us, Mr. SPEAKER,  that 
     <lb/>these resolutions cannot'be amended in any 
     <lb/>particular ; the seventy-two resolutions, they 
     <lb/>say, must be voted all together, so as to give 
     <lb/>no ground for complaint on the part of the 
     <lb/>Maritime Provinces. It is a treaty from 
     <lb/>which no deviation can be allowed. But 
     <lb/>how is it that the Honorable Mr. TILLEY, 
     <lb/>of New Brunswick, offered to allow the 
     <lb/>Opposition in that province to amend this 
     <lb/>treaty ? And did not the Government 
     <lb/>declare, at the end of the last session, that 
     <lb/>they intended to propose an amendment of 
     <lb/>some kind to the Constitutional Act, and 
     <lb/>that they would submit it to the people for 
     <lb/>their consideration before seeking its adop<lb break="no"/>tion ? And now they refuse to do this. Ah l 
     <lb/>I repeat, all this is very far from inspiring 
     <lb/>me with the least confidence in the scheme 
     <lb/>of Confederation, and in the present Admin<lb break="no"/>istration. You must swallow the whole 
     <lb/>scheme without hesitation, without power to 
     <lb/>offer a single amendment. Let those who 
     <lb/>please vote for such a measure, the humble 
     <lb/>member for Yamaska assuredly will not. 
     <lb/>I therefore declare that I am prepared to 
     <lb/>vote against the measure now under consi<lb break="no"/>deration. (Applause.)

     extended by the House, I have to say that I 
     <lb/>
     do not rise to make a long speech, but that 
     <lb/>
     I shall content myself with giving a silent 
     <lb/>
     vote. However, before recording my vote 
     <lb/>
     upon the measure which is submitted to us, 
     <lb/>
     I wish to put a question to the Government. 
     <lb/>
     I acknowledge that if I confined myself to 
     <lb/>
     consulting my own ideas, I should not put 
     <lb/>
     this question ; but I do so in order to meet 
     <lb/>
     the wishes of several of my friends, both 
     <lb/>
     within this House and beyond its precincts. 
     <lb/>
     Those friends have expressed alarm in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to one of the clauses of the resolutions, 
     <lb/>
     and have requested me to ask an explanation 
     <lb/>
     from the Hon. Attorney General for Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, as to the interpretation of that 
     <lb/>
     clause. I have therefore to ask him whether 
     <lb/>
     article 46 of the resolutions, which states 
     <lb/>
     that " both the English and French lan<lb break="no"/>guages may be employed in the General 
     <lb/>
     Parliament and in its proceedings, and in 
     <lb/>
     the Local Legislature of Lower Canada," is 
     <lb/>
     to be interpreted as placing the use of the 
     <lb/>
     two languages on an equal footing in the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament ? In stating the appre<lb break="no"/>hensions entertained by certain persons on 
     <lb/>
     this subject—and I consider that it is a 
     <lb/>
     mark of patriotism on their part, and that 
     <lb/>
     their apprehensions may be legitimate—I 
     <lb/>
     hope the Government will not impute to me 
     <lb/>
     any hostile intention and will perceive that 
     <lb/>
     the course I adopt is in their interest, as it 
     <lb/>
     will give them an opportunity of dissipating 
     <lb/>
     the apprehensions in question (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD—I 
     <lb/>
     have very great pleasure in answering the 
     <lb/>
     question put to me by my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     the county of Quebec. I may state that the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of one of the resolutions adopted 
     <lb/>
     by the Conference is this, that the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the French-Canadian members as to the 
     <lb/>
     status of their language in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Legislature shall be precisely the same as 
     <lb/>
     they now are in the present Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Canada in every possible respect. I have 
     <lb/>
     still further pleasure in stating that the 
     <lb/>
     moment this was mentioned in Conference, 
     <lb/>
     the members of the deputation from the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces unanimously stated that it 
     <lb/>
     was right and just, and without one dis<lb break="no"/>sentient voice gave their adhesion to the 
     <lb/>
     reasonableness of the proposition that the 
     <lb/>
     status of the French language, as regards 
     <lb/>
     the procedure in Parliament, the printing of 
     <lb/>
     measures, and everything of that kind, should 
     <lb/>
     be precisely the same as it is in this Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>-I do not rise to<lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     offer any lengthened remarks, but to draw 
     <lb/>
     for a moment the attention of the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Administration, with a view to obtain 
     <lb/>
     some information in connection with this 
     <lb/>
     scheme ; but before doing so, I would say a 
     <lb/>
     word in reply to the explanation given by 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Attorney General West to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion put by the hon. member for the county 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec (Hon. Mr. EVANTUBEL), with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the use of the French language. The 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General West stated that the 
     <lb/>
     intention of delegates at the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence was to give the same guarantees for the 
     <lb/>
     use of the French language in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Legislature," now existed under the present 
     <lb/>
     union. I conceive, air, that this is no guarantee 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever, for in the Union Act it was pro<lb break="no"/>vided that the English language alone should 
     <lb/>
     be used in Parliament, and the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage was entirely prohibited ; but this pro<lb break="no"/>vision was subsequently repealed by the 11th 
     <lb/>
     and 12th Victoria, and the matter left to the 
     <lb/>
     discretion of the Legislature. So that if, 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow, this Legislature choose to vote 
     <lb/>
     that no other but the English language 
     <lb/>
     should be used in our proceedings, it might 
     <lb/>
     do _so, and thereby forbid the use of the 
     <lb/>
     French language. There is, therefore, no 
     <lb/>
     guarantee for the continuance of the use of 
     <lb/>
     the language of the majority of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada, but the will and the 
     <lb/>
     forbearance of the majority. And as the 
     <lb/>
     number of French members in the General 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, under the proposed Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, will be proportionately much smaller 
     <lb/>
     than it is in the present Legislature, this 
     <lb/>
     ought to make hon. members consider what 
     <lb/>
     little chance there is for the continued use 
     <lb/>
     of their language in the Federal Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     This is the only observation I have to make 
     <lb/>
     on this subject, and it was suggested to me 
     <lb/>
     le; the answer of the Hon. Attorney General

     of the French language should form one of 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     add to what has been stated by the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General for Upper Canada, in reply 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. member for the county of Que<lb break="no"/>bec and the hon. member for Hochelaga, 
     <lb/>
     that it was also necessary to protect the 
     <lb/>
     English minorities in Lower Canada with 
     <lb/>
     respect to the use of their language, because 
     <lb/>
     in the Local Parliament of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     the majority will be composed of French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians. The members of the Conference 
     <lb/>
     were desirous that it should not be in the 
     <lb/>
     power of that majority to decree the abolition 
     <lb/>
     of the use of the English language in the 
     <lb/>
     Local Legislature of Lower Canada, any 
     <lb/>
     more than it will be in the power of the

     Federal Legislature to do so with respect to 
     <lb/>
     the French language. I will also add that 
     <lb/>
     the use of both languages will be secured 
     <lb/>
     in the Imperial Act to be based on these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions. (Hear, hear.)

     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—I am very glad to 
     <lb/>
     hear this statement ; but I fail to see any<lb break="no"/>thing in the resolutions themselves which 
     <lb/>
     gives such an assurance, in proof of which 
     <lb/>
     we have the honorable member for Quebec 
     <lb/>
     county asking how the matter really stands. 
     <lb/>
     But it is not simply for the use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language in the Legislature that protection 
     <lb/>
     is needed—that is not of so great importance 
     <lb/>
     as is the publication of the laws and pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings of Parliament. The speeches deli<lb break="no"/>vered in this House are only addressed to a 
     <lb/>
     few, but the laws and proceedings of the House 
     <lb/>
     are addressed to the whole peop1e, a million 
     <lb/>
     or nearly a million of whom speak the French 
     <lb/>
     language. I now beg to address one or two 
     <lb/>
     observations on a different subject. When 
     <lb/>
     the question was first brought before us, I 
     <lb/>
     drew the attention of the Government to the 
     <lb/>
     discrepancy between the printed resolutions 
     <lb/>
     which are now submitted to us, and the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions which were despatched to the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Legislature, during the recess, by 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Provincial Secretary. The discre<lb break="no"/>pancy consists in the wording of the third 
     <lb/>
     section of the 29th resolution. In the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions which were sent us by the Hon. Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary, the 29th read as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The General Government shall have power to 
     <lb/>

     the General Government was deprived of the 
     <lb/>
     right of imposing export duties on lumber, 
     <lb/>
     coals, and other minerals in regard to all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces ; whilst by the resolutions now before 
     <lb/>
     the House, the General Government is allowed 
     <lb/>
     to impose such duties except on lumber ex<lb break="no"/>ported from New Brunswick, and coals and 
     <lb/>
     other minerals exported from Nova Scotia. 
     <lb/>
     Then the 43rd resolution now before the House 
     <lb/>
     says:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The local legislatures shall have power to make 
     <lb/>
     laws respecting the following subjects :— 1. Di<lb break="no"/>rect taxation, and in New Brunswick the impo<lb break="no"/>sition of duties on the export of timber, logs, 
     <lb/>
     masts, spars, deals, and sawn lumber ; and in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, of coals and other minerals.

            <p>
     That is to say, in New Brunswick and Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia they have a right to impose duties, for 
     <lb/>
     local purposes, on the expert of lumber, coals, 
     <lb/>
     and other minerals, whilst in Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces that power is withheld ; and 
     <lb/>
     while the timber and minerals from Canada 
     <lb/>
     can be taxed by the General Government for 
     <lb/>
     general purposes, the timber of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, and the coal and minerals of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, can only be taxed by the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments of these provinces, and for local pur<lb break="no"/>poses only. This is a most unjust arrange<lb break="no"/>ment for both Upper and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Now, sir, I find in an official document, pub<lb break="no"/>lished in Nova Scotia under the sanction of 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="946" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0946.jpg"/>

     the Government of that province, and submit<lb break="no"/>ted to parliament now sitting, that the powers 
     <lb/>
     of the General Government and of the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments in respect to the export duties upon 
     <lb/>
     lumber, coals, and other minerals, are exactly 
     <lb/>
     the same, word for word, as are set forth in 
     <lb/>
     the printed copy sent to the members during 
     <lb/>
     the recess. (Hear, hear.) It has been as<lb break="no"/>serted that this was a treaty entered into by 
     <lb/>
     the delegates of the several provinces ; but it 
     <lb/>
     seems to be a treaty in which alterations have 
     <lb/>
     been made. (Hear, hear.) I called the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the honorable gentlemen opposite to 
     <lb/>
     this discrepancy, and asked which was the 
     <lb/>
     true and correct copy of the resolutions, and 
     <lb/>
     I was told that it was the copy which had 
     <lb/>
     been submitted to the House. There has 
     <lb/>
     been an alteration somewhere ; and in a matter 
     <lb/>
     of this serious importance, the Government 
     <lb/>
     ought to tell us how and where it occurred<lb break="no"/>they ought to inform us if it is not the case 
     <lb/>
     that the treaty was changed after the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence had ceased to meet, and at whose request 
     <lb/>
     and by whom the change was made. It is 
     <lb/>
     evident that we are called to vote for a scheme, 
     <lb/>
     here, different from that submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature of Nova Scotia, and one more un<lb break="no"/>favorable to us than that which the delegates 
     <lb/>
     from Nova Scotia have reported to their Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. While on this subject, I will also 
     <lb/>
     remark that there is also a discrepancy between 
     <lb/>
     the French and the English versions of the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions submitted to the House, the 
     <lb/>
     French version being the same as the one com<lb break="no"/>municated to the members by the Hon. Provin<lb break="no"/>cial Secretary, and also to those submitted to 
     <lb/>
     the Nova Scotia Legislature. This would 
     <lb/>
     indicate that the change has been made in 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions submitted to this House, and 
     <lb/>
     it is well that we should have some informa<lb break="no"/>tion, and know what has taken place about 
     <lb/>
     this pretended treaty since the separation of 
     <lb/>
     the delegates. (Hear, hear.) There is an<lb break="no"/>other important matter which demands the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the House. It has been stated here 
     <lb/>
     that the whole of the delegates had agreed to 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions of the Conference. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The name of Mr. PALMER was men<lb break="no"/>tioned as being an exception, and to that the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen opposite declared that 
     <lb/>
     all the delegates had agreed to these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions. Is not that what was stated ?

     <lb/>
     besides Mr. PALMER, who asserted publicly

     that he had signed the resolutions of the

     Conference to authenticate them, and that he

     had not agreed to these resolutions, there is

     also Mr. DICKEY, another delegate, who has 
     <lb/>
     taken the same course. Mr. DICKEY even 
     <lb/>
     went so far as to address a letter to the Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, Sir B.

     GRAVES MCDONNELL, in which he says:-<lb/>

     these resolutions were, in point of fact, a

     or amend in the least important particular,

     reference to the second point, the Canadian

     Government is not responsible for the Opin<lb break="no"/>ions of the delegates after they left this coun<lb break="no"/>try ; and as regards the third point, His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency the Governor General sent down the

     the English copy, now before the House is

     different. Now, of these different versions 
     <lb/>
     which is the correct one, and where has the 
     <lb/>
     alteration been made ? The importance of 
     <lb/>
     the question is, I think, very great ; for if 
     <lb/>
               the version given in this <hi rendition="simple:italic">Blue-Book</hi> from

     Nova Scotia, and in the French copy, be cor<lb break="no"/>rect, we in Lower Canada will have a right

     <lb/>
     as the junior member of this honorable House, 
     <lb/>
     it was proper that I should be the last to 
     <lb/>
     speak on the question which now engages our 
     <lb/>
     attention. A very few days before the com<lb break="no"/>mencement of the present session, I did not 
     <lb/>
     know that I should fill the seat which I now 
     <lb/>
     occupy in this chamber, and should be called 
     <lb/>
     on to vote on the question of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and take part in the debate upon it. Ac<lb break="no"/>cordingly, I have not had time, as most of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable members who have spoken on the 
     <lb/>
     scheme submitted to the House have had, to 
     <lb/>
     prepare myself to treat it in a political and dip<lb break="no"/>lomatic sense, and to examine the basis on which 
     <lb/>
     it rests. If, on the other hand, I had had the 
     <lb/>
     time necessary to make myself thoroughly ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with it in all its bearings, I should 
     <lb/>
     have acted not otherwise than I shall now act. 
     <lb/>
     I should have left, as now, to other members 
     <lb/>
     of this House better qualified than I am in re<lb break="no"/>spect of knowledge, and the discussion and 
     <lb/>
     consideration of great political questions, 
     <lb/>
     which are the fruit of a long service in Par<lb break="no"/>liament—I should have left to such honor<lb break="no"/>able members the office of viewing the ques<lb break="no"/>tion in the various aspects which distinguish 
     <lb/>
     it. (Hear, hear.) As member for the chief 
     <lb/>
     place of the district of Three Rivers, and a 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadian, I ought to speak in explan<lb break="no"/>ation of my views. The difficult position of 
     <lb/>
     the country for the last few years, arising 
     <lb/>
     from the equal strength of the two parties in 
     <lb/>
     the political arena, and rendering the admin<lb break="no"/>istration of public affairs arduous to the va<lb break="no"/><pb n="948" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0948.jpg"/><fw type="num">948</fw>rious ministries which had, one after another, 
     <lb/>
     come into power—that position, I say, ne<lb break="no"/>cessitated a change which might put an end 
     <lb/>
     to such a deplorable state of affairs. Our situ<lb break="no"/>ation was like that of the Roman Empire 
     <lb/>
     when near its fall. The union, as the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General for Lower Canada (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. CARTIER) so well said, had lasted its 
     <lb/>
     time ; it now became necessary to try some<lb break="no"/>thing else. It was necessary that the nation 
     <lb/>
     which, of all the different races which inhabit 
     <lb/>
     the British Provinces in North America, is 
     <lb/>
     foremost in duration, energy and prosperity, 
     <lb/>
     should take the lead and initiate that measure 
     <lb/>
     which was to deliver the country from its diffi<lb break="no"/>culties. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, the most natural 
     <lb/>
     remedy which occurred was the scheme for the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the English Provinces on this 
     <lb/>
     continent, and as the opponents of the measure 
     <lb/>
     —men who have thrown all their powers, cour<lb break="no"/>age and perseverance into their opposition<lb break="no"/>have never moved any other, it seemed to be 
     <lb/>
     the only one which found acceptance. This 
     <lb/>
     scheme has not had the effect of producing 
     <lb/>
     fear in my mind, as it has in several members 
     <lb/>
     who have spoken before me. After careful 
     <lb/>
     examination, I have arrived at the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that it is practicable, and that it ought to be 
     <lb/>
     adopted. I am well aware that it is not per<lb break="no"/>fect, for there is nothing perfect in this nether 
     <lb/>
     world. It was not possible to take every 
     <lb/>
     advantage for Lower Canada, and to leave 
     <lb/>
     nothing for Upper Canada and the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. Some concessions were necessary 
     <lb/>
     to be made in common justice, as we were 
     <lb/>
     obtaining great material advantages, together 
     <lb/>
     with the preservation and protection of our 
     <lb/>
     dearest interests. In short, it was necessary 
     <lb/>
     that we and they should make what is gener<lb break="no"/>ally termed a compromise, and that compro<lb break="no"/>mise was such as to be in our favor in every 
     <lb/>
     respect. I do not profess to be a religious 
     <lb/>
     man, but I may venture to assert, without 
     <lb/>
     transgressing the bounds of modesty, that I 
     <lb/>
     love and revere my religion as much as any 
     <lb/>
     other man in this House. Before, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     I could form any decided opinion on the 
     <lb/>
     question that is now before the House, and 
     <lb/>
     give my vote in favor of it, I did not omit to 
     <lb/>
     consult our priests. I have always blamed 
     <lb/>
     the conduct of those priests who interfered in 
     <lb/>
     elections and matters of policy, acting the 
     <lb/>
     parts of canvassers and ultra-partisans, instead 
     <lb/>
     of endeavoring from the pulpit—the very 
     <lb/>
     abode of truth—to calm the animosities of 
     <lb/>
     parties, and to aid the people in making an 
     <lb/>
     honest, free, independent and judicious choice, 
     <lb/>
    and turning in a manner the pulpit of truth 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     itself into a political tribune, from which they 
     <lb/>
     promulgate principles which might be termed 
     <lb/>
     seditious. Such conduct I have always con<lb break="no"/>demned. I love to find in the members of 
     <lb/>
     the clergy those virtues which ought to char<lb break="no"/>acterise them ; and as now the business in 
     <lb/>
     hand is not the election of a member of Par<lb break="no"/>liament, but a complete change in the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the country, it is my opinion that 
     <lb/>
     they ought to be considered citizens, and to 
     <lb/>
     enjoy as fully and completely as any other 
     <lb/>
     class the endowments and privileges which 
     <lb/>
     belong to others, and that, as others have, so 
     <lb/>
     should they have a right to examine the new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution which we are to receive, and to 
     <lb/>
     give their opinion on its merits and imperfec 
     <lb/>
     tions. Relying on the judgment and the in<lb break="no"/>telligence of certain of this order, I thought it 
     <lb/>
     right to consult them. I had recourse to two 
     <lb/>
     members of the clergy of the districtof Three 
     <lb/>
     Rivers—men of great learning, and eminently 
     <lb/>
    qualified to give an opinion on the scheme of 
     <lb/>Confederation—men who were perfectly free 
     <lb/>from the spirit of party, without political bias 
     <lb/>or personal ambition to be gratified in prefer<lb break="no"/>ence to the interests of the country, and whose 
     <lb/>opinions were entitled to respect as being the 
     <lb/>fruit of a life of study and labor constantly 
     <lb/>employed to increase the happiness and pros<lb break="no"/>perity of their fellow-citizens and their coun<lb break="no"/>try, and to protect our religious institutions. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I have no intention to name 
     <lb/>these two venerable men, who are known 
     <lb/>throughout the country as two of the most 
     <lb/>distinguished members of our Canadian 
     <lb/>clergy and most eminent citizens. Well, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, I consulted those two men, and 
     <lb/>both agreed in making answer that they were 
     <lb/>favorable to the project of Confederation of 
     <lb/>the British North American Provinces on 
     <lb/>this continent. Resting, then, on my own 
     <lb/>convictions that Confederation is the best 
     <lb/>means we have at hand of escaping from the 
     <lb/>present difficult position of the country, and 
     <lb/>on the authority of members of the clergy 
     <lb/>—an authority which I take pleasure in 
     <lb/>mentioning , because the opponents of the 
     <lb/>Ministerial plan have affected to believe that 
     <lb/>all the clergy in the country are opposed to 
     <lb/>the measure—thus supported, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>I hold it to be my duty, and I do not hesitate 
     <lb/>to give my vote in favor of the principle and 
     <lb/>the project of Confederation. Certain appre<lb break="no"/>hensions have arisen in the public mind rela<lb break="no"/>tive to the project in question ; these fears, I 
     <lb/>need not say, have been excited by the 
     <lb/>opponents of the measure, who make them<lb break="no"/>selves hoarse with crying that French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     
            <pb n="949" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0949.jpg"/>

     nationality would be swallowed up by Con<lb break="no"/>federation, and that in twenty-five or thirty 
     <lb/>
     years' time there would not be a single French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian left in Lower Canada. Well, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I appeal, to prove the falsehood of 
     <lb/>
     these declarations, to the men who in 1840 
     <lb/>
     —the time of the union of the two provinces<lb break="no"/>labored with so much zeal and cue to 
     <lb/>
     guard the natural depository of our social and 
     <lb/>
     religious rights from danger—I appeal, to 
     <lb/>
     prove it, to those men who applied all their 
     <lb/>
     energy, their abilities, and their patriotism 
     <lb/>
     to prevent the union; to those men who, 
     <lb/>
     endowed with a singleness of mind at least 
     <lb/>
     equal to that which animates the opponents of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, procured numerous petitions to 
     <lb/>
     be signed against the union of Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada ; to those men, in short, who 
     <lb/>
     predicted that in ten years' time there would 
     <lb/>
     not be a single French-Canadian left—these 
     <lb/>
     men I summon to the bar of public opinion, 
     <lb/>
     and I ask them—" Gentlemen, did you predict 
     <lb/>
     truly? What has become of that French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian nationality which was to be swal<lb break="no"/>lowed up by the union ? Has it disappeared, 
     <lb/>
     as you said it would ? See and judge for 
     <lb/>
     yourselves." That nation, which was doomed 
     <lb/>
     to be annihilated, has built up Montreal, the 
     <lb/>
     first commercial city in the two Canadas<lb break="no"/>Montreal, on which the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Richelieu (Mr. PERRAULT) pronounced such 
     <lb/>
     a pompous eulogy in his speech the other 
     <lb/>
     evening—an eulogy that be extended to 
     <lb/>
     the country generally—praising its immense 
     <lb/>
     resources and growing prosperity. It was 
     <lb/>
     under the union and through the union that 
     <lb/>
     the splendid Victoria Bridge was erected, the 
     <lb/>
     most magnificent work of the kind in the 
     <lb/>
     world. Under its auspices, also, we con<lb break="no"/>structed those immense canals which have re<lb break="no"/>ceived honorable mention from the lips of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Richelieu; and every<lb break="no"/>body knows that that honorable member is 
     <lb/>
     eminently qualified to pronounce a judgment 
     <lb/>
     on such matters, having seen and examined 
     <lb/>
     the canals constructed in Europe. Accor<lb break="no"/>dingly we are justified in saying that our 
     <lb/>
     canals are immeasurably superior to the canals 
     <lb/>
     of Europe, as he tells us in respect to several 
     <lb/>
     of our canals, that a boy in the smallest of 
     <lb/>
               skiffs could touch the <hi rendition="simple:italic">revêtement</hi> walls with 
     <lb/>
     his two tiny oars. I must say that I do not 
     <lb/>
     accept the interpretation put on that part of 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member's speech by the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Montcalm (Mr. JOSEPH 
     <lb/>
     DUFRESNE), in which he said that there were 
     <lb/>
     men on the bench of bishops as well informed 
     <lb/>
    and as eminent as any that were to be found 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     in any ministry. This is the interpretation I 
     <lb/>
     put on that phrase of the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Richelieu, and I do not think I mistake 
     <lb/>
     in saying that it turns against those who, at 
     <lb/>
     the time of the union of the two Canadas, 
     <lb/>
     did everything they could to prevent it. In 
     <lb/>
     1840 those men, those good and zealous 
     <lb/>
     patriots, told the people, by way of serving 
     <lb/>
     their cause, that in twenty-five years there 
     <lb/>
     would not be a single French-Canadian left in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada; and now the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Richelieu comes out and gives them the 
     <lb/>
     lie direct by saying that at this present time, 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholic bench of bishops num<lb break="no"/>bers among its members men—of course 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians—who are as eminent for 
     <lb/>
     their talents and acquirements as the most 
     <lb/>
     distinguished members of our political world ; 
     <lb/>
     and that religion is amply protected by the 
     <lb/>
     present Constitution, which was nevertheless 
     <lb/>
     destined, according to those great patriots, to 
     <lb/>
     swallow us up and sweep us from the face of 
     <lb/>
     the continent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DENI2">MR. DENIS</persName>—That is very true. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUC1">MB. DE NIVERVILLE</persName>—One word to 
     <lb/>
     comfort those French-Canadians who are 
     <lb/>
     afraid of suffering wrong in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, being as they say an insignifi<lb break="no"/>cant minority of that body. Ever since 
     <lb/>
     nations began to comprehend their true 
     <lb/>
     interests, a certain equilibrium has been 
     <lb/>
     established which it will always be their aim 
     <lb/>
     to maintain. This constitutes the protection 
     <lb/>
     which the union of two weak parties affords 
     <lb/>
     against a strong one, which would aggran<lb break="no"/>dize itself at their expense. This law of 
     <lb/>
     equilibrium is reproduced in all times and 
     <lb/>
     places—among nations and among indivi<lb break="no"/>duals: it is found even among animals. 
     <lb/>
     For what purpose did the two first nations 
     <lb/>
     in the world, France and England, unite 
     <lb/>
     together to resist the invading forces of the 
     <lb/>
     powerful despot of the north—the Emperor 
     <lb/>
     of Russia, and what was the object of the 
     <lb/>
     campaign in the Crimea? Was it to reap 
     <lb/>
     the barren glory of shouting that the French 
     <lb/>
     soldiers rushed to the assault with the im<lb break="no"/>petuous speed of the thunderbolt ; that the 
     <lb/>
     English soldiers received the enemy's fire 
     <lb/>
     without yielding a foot; that they marched 
     <lb/>
     with the cool determination of a wedge of 
     <lb/>
     iron against the enemy's squares, and that 
     <lb/>
     nothing could resist their onward move<lb break="no"/>ment? By no means. Those two powers 
     <lb/>
     were perfectly acquainted with the qualities 
     <lb/>
     which distinguished their respective armies, 
     <lb/>
     and did not need to put them to the proof. 
     <lb/>
    Their intention was simply to prevent the 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="950" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0950.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">950</fw>
          
     Emperor of Russia from extending the fron<lb break="no"/>tiers of his states indefinitely, to the detriment 
     <lb/>
     of the surrounding nations. Why did the 
     <lb/>
     present Emperor of the French go to war 
     <lb/>
     with his cousin the Emperor of Austria? 
     <lb/>
     For exactly the same reason. I will go 
     <lb/>
     even further, and ask why the beast grazing 
     <lb/>
     in a pasture drives away the first strange 
     <lb/>
     animal which enters it? It is a mere 
     <lb/>
     instinct of self-preservation. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Well, Mr. SPEAKER, as that instinct of 
     <lb/>
     self-preservation prevails among all created 
     <lb/>
     beings on the earth, why should it not 
     <lb/>
     be produced among the different provinces 
     <lb/>
     of the Confederation? If Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     should ever seek to act unjustly towards 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada and the Lower Provinces, the 
     <lb/>
     latter would naturally and instinctively 
     <lb/>
     strike up an alliance to resist the encroach<lb break="no"/>ments and injustice of the sister province. 
     <lb/>
     I am certain, therefore, that in this respect 
     <lb/>
     we have nothing to fear. As a French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian, it is my business to speak of what 
     <lb/>
     concerns us most nearly: our religion, our 
     <lb/>
     language, our institutions and our laws 
     <lb/>
     Well, then, with respect to our language, I 
     <lb/>
     ask whether there is the least danger of our 
     <lb/>
     losing it in the Confederation? Far from 
     <lb/>
     being in danger, I believe it will be more in 
     <lb/>
               vogue under the new <hi rendition="simple:italic">régime</hi>, as it can be 
     <lb/>
     spoken and made use of not only in the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament and local legislatures, 
     <lb/>
     but also in the supreme courts which will 
     <lb/>
     be hereafter instituted in the country. I 
     <lb/>
     say that when that time arrives—that is to 
     <lb/>
     say, when the Confederation is established, 
     <lb/>
     we shall have a fuller use of our language. 
     <lb/>
     For what liberty have we in its use in this 
     <lb/>
     chamber? That liberty which the liberals 
     <lb/>
     have vaunted so highly, which cannot be 
     <lb/>
     touched without destroying it, in what way 
     <lb/>
     have we it here? Has it been conceded to 
     <lb/>
     us in the full acceptation of the word ? By 
     <lb/>
     no means, Mr. SPEAKER ; we have it, but it 
     <lb/>
     is as TANTALUS had the water—he was 
     <lb/>
     thirsty, but he drank not ; though the water 
     <lb/>
     bubbled to his lips, the water receded as 
     <lb/>
     soon as he attempted to receive it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) In truth, what kind of liberty have 
     <lb/>
     we, who do not understand the English 
     <lb/>
     language? We are at liberty to hold our 
     <lb/>
     tongues, to listen, and to understand if we 
     <lb/>
     can. (Hear, hear, and continued laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     Under the Confederation, the Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>dians will speak their language, and the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadians theirs, just as we do now; 
     <lb/>
     with this diflerence, that they who count a 
     <lb/>
    large majority of their countrymen in the 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     House, may hope to hear their language 
     <lb/>
     spoken the oftenest, as new members will 
     <lb/>
     use the language of the majority. I intend 
     <lb/>
     no reproval to the honorable members who 
     <lb/>
     have spoken in English on the question 
     <lb/>
     now before the House, thus depriving us of 
     <lb/>
     the pleasure of understanding them, and, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, of enjoying their eloquence, and 
     <lb/>
     being convinced by their logic. What they 
     <lb/>
     have done on the present occasion is a 
     <lb/>
     simple act of justice due to the majority of 
     <lb/>
     this House, and one which the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians have always rendered with pleasure. 
     <lb/>
     But if we follow the example of most French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians in days gone by, we shall not keep 
     <lb/>
     our language long How often do we find 
     <lb/>
     in the towns, nay, even in the country parts, 
     <lb/>
     Canadians who have no sooner caught up 
     <lb/>
     two words of English than they run off with 
     <lb/>
     delight to repeat them to their neighbors. 
     <lb/>
     Emigration to the United States, which will 
     <lb/>
     cease under Confederation (for we shall have 
     <lb/>
     the management of our public lands), has 
     <lb/>
     been a principal cause of that stupid mania 
     <lb/>
     with which all seem to be seized who have 
     <lb/>
     lived some time among our neighbors and 
     <lb/>
     returned to Canada. To give you an idea 
     <lb/>
     of that lamentable mania, I shall relate a 
     <lb/>
     circumstance in which I was one of the 
     <lb/>
     actors. Not two months since, I was on the 
     <lb/>
     platform at the station where the branch 
     <lb/>
     from Arthabaska to Three Rivers leaves the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk, when two young men, dressed 
     <lb/>
     in the American fashion, came to the hotel 
     <lb/>
     One, as he came in, called out in a loud 
     <lb/>
     voice, " Where is the ostler ?" The man, 
     <lb/>
     who was a stout Canadian, soon made his 
     <lb/>
     appearance, and as soon as he set eyes on 
     <lb/>
     the gentleman, called out in his turn, 
     <lb/>
               " What! Joe, is it you ?" (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Tiens! c'est toi, 
     <lb/>
     Joh !</hi>) Of course our pretended American 
     <lb/>
     was taken aback, and for the moment dumb<lb break="no"/>founded. Seeing his embarrassment, and 
     <lb/>
     willing, in pity to the poor victim of affecta<lb break="no"/>tion, to relieve him from it, although it had 
     <lb/>
     its comic side, I called to the stableman and 
     <lb/>
     said, " Go and take the gentlemen's horses; 
     <lb/>
     don't you see they are Americans, and that 
     <lb/>
     they don't understand you." Well, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, such scenes frequently occur; 
     <lb/>
     nay, those who move now and then from 
     <lb/>
     home may see them every day. So if 
     <lb/>
     we do not wish our beautiful language 
     <lb/>
     to lose its influence, we must not fail to 
     <lb/>
     discountenance the affectation of Canadians 
     <lb/>
     talking English when they hardly know 
     <lb/>
     a word of it. Otherwise we must take 
     <lb/>
    to talking English, and let our own language 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="951" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0951.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">951</fw>
           
     sink into disuse and oblivion. For our 
     <lb/>
     religion I have no fears. The experience of 
     <lb/>
     the past is a guarantee for the future. We 
     <lb/>
     live no longer in those times when Paradise 
     <lb/>
     was the promised reward of all who ill-treated 
     <lb/>
     those of a religion different from their own. 
     <lb/>
     These are not the days in which wars and 
     <lb/>
     troubles between nations were begotten of 
     <lb/>
     religious hatred. The world is too civilized 
     <lb/>
     to renew the scenes which were then con<lb break="no"/>stantly exhibited. Every man is free to 
     <lb/>
     practise his religion as he pleases, and this 
     <lb/>
     tolerant spirit is especially to be noted as 
     <lb/>
     characterising the English nation. True, 
     <lb/>
     we find some fanatics both among the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish and the French population: unfortu<lb break="no"/>nately we had two instances of the working 
     <lb/>
     of this spirit in one evening in this House<lb break="no"/>the one from a Catholic, the other from a 
     <lb/>
     Protestant. The former cried out loudly 
     <lb/>
     that Confederation would be a mortal blow 
     <lb/>
     to the Catholic religion, while the other 
     <lb/>
     cried as loudly that it would be the ruin of 
     <lb/>
     the Protestants. I must confess, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, that I am not one of those who 
     <lb/>
     live in fear and distrust of British domina<lb break="no"/>tion. As long as we live under the sway of 
     <lb/>
     free England, I have not the least doubt 
     <lb/>
     that our language will be fully protected, 
     <lb/>
     and that in fifty years from this present time, 
     <lb/>
     good Catholics will be allowed the exercise 
     <lb/>
     of their religion as freely, as safely and as 
     <lb/>
     piously as this day, and that the wicked will 
     <lb/>
     not be compelled to be more religious than 
     <lb/>
     they now are. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Bagot told us that there are a 
     <lb/>
     great number of Catholics in England, and 
     <lb/>
     that they are perfectly at liberty to exercise 
     <lb/>
     their religion at their pleasure, but that they 
     <lb/>
     are not represented in the English Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     This, far from being a proof of intolerance, 
     <lb/>
     I take to be a proof of their tolerant 
     <lb/>
     character, since, although able to oppress 
     <lb/>
     the Catholics, they leave them at full liberty 
     <lb/>
     to fulfil the pious exercises of their religion. 
     <lb/>
     I repeat it, Mr. SPEAKER, there are fanatics 
     <lb/>
     in all religions ; happily for humanity, they 
     <lb/>
     are but a small minority, and men of good 
     <lb/>
     sense hold them in contempt. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Our institutions are secured to us by our 
     <lb/>
     treaties with Great Britain; our laws by the 
     <lb/>
     articles of Confederation. What coercion, 
     <lb/>
     what restraint or opposition have we to ap<lb break="no"/>prehend from the Mother Country, when the 
     <lb/>
     subject of the British Government is acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged throughout the whole world to be of 
     <lb/>
     all men the most free? Most free in the 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     exercise of his rights as a citizen ; as free in 
     <lb/>
     speech and action as he is secure in his per<lb break="no"/>son, wherever he may find occasion to assert 
     <lb/>
     his rights, to uphold them and defend them. 
     <lb/>
     I say " wherever," because the English peo<lb break="no"/>ple can, with as perfect freedom and perfect 
     <lb/>
     confidence, state their grievances before any 
     <lb/>
     tribunal and all authorities, from the highest 
     <lb/>
     to the lowest, as they can in the bosom of 
     <lb/>
     their families or in a circle of intimate 
     <lb/>
     friends. We, moreover, possess one infalli<lb break="no"/>ble means—based on the laws of Nature 
     <lb/>
     herself—of preserving to the French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dians in all their purity their language, their 
     <lb/>
     religion, their institutions and their laws; 
     <lb/>
     and that means is education—the education 
     <lb/>
     which we receive first from the authors of 
     <lb/>
     our existence in our childhood, and which is 
     <lb/>
     afterwards continued in our elementary 
     <lb/>
     schools and our seminaries; that education<lb break="no"/>Christian, moral and religious—which is so 
     <lb/>
     carefully, wisely and anxiously instilled into 
     <lb/>
     us in our youthful days by the masters and 
     <lb/>
     tutors of our colleges ; that practical educa<lb break="no"/>tion which we acquire in the course of our 
     <lb/>
     dealings and transactions with men of busi<lb break="no"/>ness. That education it is, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     which renders nations prosperous, rich and 
     <lb/>
     great, which elevates them to the rank of 
     <lb/>
     which they are worthy, and maintains them 
     <lb/>
     in it. It never fades from the mind on 
     <lb/>
     which it has been impressed—it remains 
     <lb/>
     fixed on the memory, like the characters 
     <lb/>
     which we engrave on the bark of a 
     <lb/>
     young tree, and which are found long 
     <lb/>
     years after, when it falls under the wood<lb break="no"/>man's axe. As the representative of 
     <lb/>
     the city of Three Rivers, I may be allowed 
     <lb/>
     to say a few words relative to the advantages 
     <lb/>
     which Confederation will bring to that dis<lb break="no"/>trict. Every one knows that it possesses 
     <lb/>
     immense tracts of land not yet opened out 
     <lb/>
     to the settler, magnificent forests of timber of 
     <lb/>
     all kinds, and mines of inestimable value. 
     <lb/>
     It is beyond question that Three Rivers 
     <lb/>
     yields the best iron in the country. This 
     <lb/>
     was proved at the Great Exhibition at 
     <lb/>
     London, where the first medals were awarded 
     <lb/>
     to the Radnor Ironworks Company for the 
     <lb/>
     best iron-wheels, in respect of durability, 
     <lb/>
     elegance and quality. The St. Maurice has 
     <lb/>
     been grossly neglected by the various Ad<lb break="no"/>ministrations which, during the last ten 
     <lb/>
     years, have held office, although the district 
     <lb/>
     yielded a revenue of $30,000 or $40,000 to 
     <lb/>
     the public chest, which might have entitled 
     <lb/>
     it to some compensation. Nevertheless, the 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="952" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0952.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">952</fw>
           
     district of Three Rivers is not behind other 
     <lb/>
     districts in the country, either in industrial 
     <lb/>
     success or in the energy and enterprise of 
     <lb/>
     its inhabitants. The Arthabaska Railway, 
     <lb/>
     which it was said would not pay running 
     <lb/>
     expenses, is at present more productive than 
     <lb/>
     any part of the Grand Trunk Railway. We 
     <lb/>
    need colonization roads and railways, and 
     <lb/>I am convinced that under the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, when we shall have the management 
     <lb/>of our own funds without the interference of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada, we shall build railways in all 
     <lb/>parts where the requirements of trade and 
     <lb/>industrial pursuits call for them. We shall 
     <lb/>then offer to the settler well-made and well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>kept roads, and the district of Three Rivers 
     <lb/>will derive precious results from them, as 
     <lb/>'well as other districts of the country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>Hear.) We have a proof of the rapidity 
     <lb/>with which the district of Three Rivers 
     <lb/>would grow, if it were encouraged. This is 
     <lb/>found in the parishes of St. Maurice, St. 
     <lb/>Etienne, Ste. Flore and Shawinigan. It is 
     <lb/>nearly twenty-five years since St. Maurice 
     <lb/>was a mere forest ; now it is a large, 
     <lb/>rich, and beautiful parish, of which the 
     <lb/>district of Three Rivers has reason to 
     <lb/>be proud. It numbers upwards of five hun<lb break="no"/>dred voters with the parish of Mont Carmel, 
     <lb/>which is an offset from it. The extensive trade 
     <lb/>in timber which is carried on in the valley of 
     <lb/>the St. Maurice, and which employs thousands 
     <lb/>of laborers, is an important element in 
     <lb/>the commercial business of the country, 
     <lb/>exporting to a great amount the lumber 
     <lb/>which is taken from the extensive terri<lb break="no"/>tory—if I may be allowed the expression<lb break="no"/>belonging to the district of Three Rivers; 
     <lb/>and these vast tracts which await the settler, 
     <lb/>those iron mines so rich and so well known, 
     <lb/>those mines of other minerals still hidden 
     <lb/>in the mountains and valleys of the St. 
     <lb/>Maurice, those riches of all kinds which 
     <lb/>abound there await only the hand of man 
     <lb/>to render the district and city of Three 
     <lb/>Rivers an important part of Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) The Ministers of the Crown 
     <lb/>in Canada have been accused of bringing up 
     <lb/>the question of Confederation only as a 
     <lb/>means of retaining power and increasing it. 
     <lb/>The Hon. Attorney General for Lower 
     <lb/>Canada has been accused of moving that 
     <lb/>measure only that he may become Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Governor of Lower Canada. Well, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, I am thoroughly convinced that 
     <lb/>that honorable Minister has too much energy, 
     <lb/>is too laborious, to seek or to accept an office 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     in which he would have nothing to do. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) For my part, I make a 
     <lb/>
     present to the Opposition of all the profit I 
     <lb/>
     am likely to derive from places or dignities 
     <lb/>
     under Confederation, when we have it. I 
     <lb/>
     repel the idea that Canadian statesmen 
     <lb/>
     allowed themselves to be influenced by paltry 
     <lb/>
     notions of personal interest, when they set 
     <lb/>
     about devising means to extricate us from the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties in which we were involved. They 
     <lb/>
     had in view only the interests of the nation, 
     <lb/>
     and never had a thought, as some have insinu<lb break="no"/>ated, of delivering the country up to ruin and 
     <lb/>
     desolation. I conclude, Mr. SPEAKER, by 
     <lb/>
     declaring that I am in favor of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and opposed to the appeal to the people, 
     <lb/>
     because I believe it to be perfectly useless. 
     <lb/>
     An hon. member who spoke yesterday told 
     <lb/>
     us that the clergy are not qualified to form a 
     <lb/>
     judgment on the project of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I ask you, if the clergy are not 
     <lb/>
     qualified to form a judgment on such a ques<lb break="no"/>tion, how the people can form one who have 
     <lb/>
     not the necessary education ? How can 
     <lb/>
     they comprehend the aggregate and the 
     <lb/>
     details of the scheme, and ascertain whether 
     <lb/>
     it would be beneficial to them or not ? I 
     <lb/>
     repeat that I am in favor of the project now 
     <lb/>
     under consideration—first, because I declar<lb break="no"/>ed myself favorable to the measure when I 
     <lb/>
     presented myself to my constituents ; and, 
     <lb/>
     secondly, because I think it necessary and 
     <lb/>
     even indispensable, and calculated moreover 
     <lb/>
     to promote the interests of the country in 
     <lb/>
     general, and those of Lower Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     district of Three Rivers in particular.<lb break="no"/>(Cheers)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GAGN1">MR. GAGNON</persName> — Mr. SPEAKER, the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of a Confederation of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     now before this House is one too deeply 
     <lb/>
     interesting to be received in silence. If I 
     <lb/>
     rise to speak on this occasion, it is for the 
     <lb/>
     simple purpose of justifying my opinion on 
     <lb/>
     the subject, by stating my reasons for enter<lb break="no"/>taining it ; and as I am not in the habit of 
     <lb/>
     making speeches, I crave the indulgence of 
     <lb/>
     the House. It is the opinion of members 
     <lb/>
     on the other side of the House that the 
     <lb/>
     country will derive great advantages from 
     <lb/>
     this union ; but those advantages depend, as 
     <lb/>
     most people think, on the contingencies of 
     <lb/>
     an unknown future, and by others, are looked 
     <lb/>
     upon as the doubtful results of a hazardous 
     <lb/>
     and dangerous speculation, which will in<lb break="no"/>volve the ruin of our credit. Not only, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, do we risk our capital, which will 
     <lb/>
     be lost in the execution of this great scheme ; 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="953" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0953.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">953</fw>
   
     not only do we ruin, by this new union, the 
     <lb/>
     credit of our country, but we Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>dians risk everything that is dear to us, 
     <lb/>
     even our nationality, while knowing that we 
     <lb/>
     can gain nothing by the change. As an 
     <lb/>
     inducement to Lower Canada to accept this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, we are promised a railway to open 
     <lb/>
     up an intercourse of commerce with the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, and we are given to believe 
     <lb/>
    that this great commerce to be opened up 
     <lb/>by the grand line of communication will be 
     <lb/>a vast benefit to us ; but those who will take 
     <lb/>time to reflect may come to a different con<lb break="no"/>clusion, without any danger of being mis<lb break="no"/>taken, for those provinces have nothing to 
     <lb/>exchange with us. We have the same pro<lb break="no"/>ductions as they have, and in greater 
     <lb/>abundance than any of them. They have 
     <lb/>nothing but coal which we do not possess, 
     <lb/>and that is not transported by railway. This 
     <lb/>railway will, as a matter of course, load to 
     <lb/>the expenditure of enormous sums for build<lb break="no"/>ing it, and will afterwards cost us a great deal 
     <lb/>in repairs and working expenses, and after 
     <lb/>all, will only be of use as a substitute for a 
     <lb/>few schooners which carry down our produce 
     <lb/>to the Gulf Provinces every season. This, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, will be a dear price to pay 
     <lb/>for the complete destruction of our little 
     <lb/>inland navigation, which ought rather to be 
     <lb/>protected. The amount of expenditure 
     <lb/>involved in the building of this railway, if 
     <lb/>wisely applied to the opening of colonization 
     <lb/>roads, to the improvement of roads and 
     <lb/>bridges, and the clearing of the public lands, 
     <lb/>would be much more beneficial to the people of 
     <lb/>this province, who would find in these things 
     <lb/>a degree of satisfaction and happiness which 
     <lb/>would enable them to do without Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, which would be no cure for our poli<lb break="no"/>tical troubles. A little more good-will and 
     <lb/>calmness in discussing the question, would 
     <lb/>have stifled the cry for representation based 
     <lb/>on population, and our country would have 
     <lb/>been able to go on under the actual union, 
     <lb/>which is less dangerous and less expensive 
     <lb/>than that which is now proposed by the 
     <lb/>Government. I should have had other re<lb break="no"/>marks to offer, Mr. SPEAKER, but I am 
     <lb/>obliged to postpone them, as hon. members 
     <lb/>must be worn out with their long sittings, 
     <lb/>and the lateness of the hour. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/> <persName ref="pers:HUNT2">HON. MR. HUNTINGTON</persName> said—I do 
     <lb/>not intend, Mr. SPEAKER, to occupy the 
     <lb/>time of the House in any lengthened re<lb break="no"/>marks ; and yet as a member representing a 
     <lb/>constituency of this country, I do not feel 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     disposed to give a vote on this question, 
     <lb/>
     without saying at least a word upon it. 
     <lb/>
     And it occurs to me—and I say it in the 
     <lb/>
     best spirit, and with no intention to cast a 
     <lb/>
     reflection upon honorable gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     —that if there is so great a desire as appears 
     <lb/>
     to exist tonight on the part of honorable 
     <lb/>
     members to express themselves upon this 
     <lb/>
     question—many of them who are favorable 
     <lb/>
     to the scheme as well as opposed to it—and 
     <lb/>
     if it is found that the opportunity is cur<lb break="no"/>tailed, the responsibility does not at any 
     <lb/>
     rate rest upon this side of the House. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I do not as I have said, prppose at 
     <lb/>
     this late hour to enter at any considerable 
     <lb/>
     length into a discussion of this measure; 
     <lb/>
     but there are points that present themselves 
     <lb/>
     to me as possessing considerable importance, 
     <lb/>
     that have not, I believe, been brought out 
     <lb/>
     during the progress of the debate; and if 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity is subsequently given for 
     <lb/>
     remarking upon them, I may avail myself 
     <lb/>
     of it. But I cannot forbear remarking 
     <lb/>
     now, in reference to the announcement 
     <lb/>
     made by the Government the other night, 
     <lb/>
     that in a certain sense I consider it was 
     <lb/>
     a step in the right direction. I believe 
     <lb/>
     it was then stated that a mission would 
     <lb/>
     be sent to England to consult with the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government with a view of arrang<lb break="no"/>ing definitely the question of the de<lb break="no"/>fence of this country, and the proportion of 
     <lb/>
     the cost of defence to be borne by the res<lb break="no"/>pective countries. Now, without desiring 
     <lb/>
     or intending to occupy the time of the 
     <lb/>
     House by raising a debate upon this point, 
     <lb/>
     I cannot help observing that it was desira<lb break="no"/>ble, before this scheme of Confederation was 
     <lb/>
     adopted at all by the Conference, that this 
     <lb/>
     arrangement should have taken place with 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government—that it should 
     <lb/>
     have been preliminary to the plan of union 
     <lb/>
     proposed, and that the Conference should 
     <lb/>
     have taken upon itself to arrange with 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government the proportionate 
     <lb/>
     expense which is to be borne by the two 
     <lb/>
     countries in relation to the defence Of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces; for, let it be borne in mind that 
     <lb/>
     this question has been forced upon us in 
     <lb/>
     Canada as the only means of preparing the 
     <lb/>
     country against the aggression of our neigh<lb break="no"/>bors; and yet we are asked in adopting this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, to go to a great extent in the dark. 
     <lb/>
     We are asked to adopt it, and at the same 
     <lb/>
     time it is known that the result must be a 
     <lb/>
     change in respect to the proportion of de<lb break="no"/>fence we in this country will be called upon 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="954" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0954.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">954</fw>
   
     to bear. It has been said that the disposi<lb break="no"/>tion in England to take part in our defence 
     <lb/>
     was owing to the fact that Canada had 
     <lb/>
     manifested a disposition also to make pro<lb break="no"/>vision for defence. Now, supposing we 
     <lb/>
     should fail at any time hereafter to hear what 
     <lb/>
     may be considered in England a fair propor<lb break="no"/>tion of this cost, what would be the conse<lb break="no"/>quence? Why, we might be placed again 
     <lb/>
     in precisely the same position in which we 
     <lb/>
     find ourselves to-day. England might with<lb break="no"/>draw her troops from this province, and 
     <lb/>
     refuse to engage in any defensive works, 
     <lb/>
     unless we undertook more than in the opin<lb break="no"/>ion of the people of this country we are able 
     <lb/>
     to bear ; and hence it is my opinion that if 
     <lb/>
     it was desirable that this question of Con<lb break="no"/>federation should be submitted to the people 
     <lb/>
     at all for their adoption, the first and indis<lb break="no"/>pensable step to have taken was to arrange 
     <lb/>
     with the Imperial Government the terms 
     <lb/>
     and conditions as regards the question of 
     <lb/>
     defence upon which we are to enter this 
     <lb/>
     new state of political existence. ln this 
     <lb/>
     sense I do not regret that the scheme, as far 
     <lb/>
     as the Lower Provinces are concerned—judg<lb break="no"/>ing from recent events in New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     and the utterances of public men in the 
     <lb/>
     other colonies—is likely to be delayed in its 
     <lb/>
     accomplishment ; and I am not sorry that 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Government, by this action of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces, will be compelled to 
     <lb/>
     consult with the Imperial authorities and 
     <lb/>
     arrange with them the proportion we are to 
     <lb/>
     bear of the cost of maintaining the defence 
     <lb/>
     of the country. (Hear, hear.) It may be 
     <lb/>
     almost providential that we are compelled, 
     <lb/>
     by the force of circumstances in the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, to take this step now ; and I must 
     <lb/>
     say that heretofore there has been a disposi<lb break="no"/>tion manifested on the part of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to keep the people in ignorance upon 
     <lb/>
     this subject ; but I trust that when these 
     <lb/>
     negotiations shall have taken place with the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government, we shall know pre<lb break="no"/>cisely what the Government has done and 
     <lb/>
     what it has agreed to do, and that the exact 
     <lb/>
     proportion of expense that we are expected 
     <lb/>
     to bear will be laid before this House and 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the opinion of the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country. (Hear, hear.) I make these 
     <lb/>
     remarks, sir, merely because to me the 
     <lb/>
     point appears to be a very important 
     <lb/>
     one, and because I believe the fullest 
     <lb/>
     information will be indispensable to this 
     <lb/>
     House in the future discussions that may 
     <lb/>
     take place upon this subject. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     There is another point that has suggested 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     itself, to which, perhaps, I may be permitted 
     <lb/>
     to allude in a few words. I wish to do so 
     <lb/>
     without reflecting upon any hon. member 
     <lb/>
     of this House ; but I cannot help feeling 
     <lb/>
     and expressing extreme regret, as a Canadian 
     <lb/>
     and a British subject, at the spirit that has 
     <lb/>
     characterized this discussion upon Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation and defence on the part of those hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who support this scheme. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     in a British Legislature, where it is proposed 
     <lb/>
     to build up a great monarchical- constitution 
     <lb/>
     on this continent, on the model which has 
     <lb/>
     flourished in England, I regret that any 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman should have found it 
     <lb/>
     necessary to charge a seditious and disloyal 
     <lb/>
     intention upon all those who cannot agree 
     <lb/>
     with them in supporting this scheme. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) For myself—I say it sincerely 
     <lb/>
     and earnestly, though I have boasted less of 
     <lb/>
     my loyalty and attachment to the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown and Constitution than some hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House—I think I may say there is 
     <lb/>
     no one who loves more than I love the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish constitutional system, no man who de<lb break="no"/>sires more than I desire to see copied here 
     <lb/>
     that British constitutional—monarchical sys<lb break="no"/>tem, and no man who believes more firmly 
     <lb/>
     than I believe that it would give to the 
     <lb/>
     people of these colonies that greatness, 
     <lb/>
     prosperity and freedom that have distin<lb break="no"/>guished the people from whom we have 
     <lb/>
     sprung on the other side of the water. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But if this debate is consid<lb break="no"/>ered to be of sufficient importance to have a 
     <lb/>
     place among the records of the country—to 
     <lb/>
     go down to posterity as the serious utter<lb break="no"/>ances of our public men, I think it is a 
     <lb/>
     cause of deep regret that hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite, in view of that great patriotism of 
     <lb/>
     which they have boasted so much, and which 
     <lb/>
     they affirm has induced them to sink minor 
     <lb/>
     considerations of party and personal an<lb break="no"/>tagonism for the sake of carrying a prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of which they profess to be the 
     <lb/>
     disinterested and self-denying exponents, 
     <lb/>
     have not seen fit, in the discussion of this 
     <lb/>
     question, to discuss it like statesmen, and not 
     <lb/>
     brand as infamous, traitorous and rebellious 
     <lb/>
     those who differ from them in their view of 
     <lb/>
     it. (Hear, hear.) I think the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country, whether belonging to the Conser<lb break="no"/>vative or the Reform party, will feel a deep 
     <lb/>
     regret at this ; and if there is one thing more 
     <lb/>
     than another that indicates that the present 
     <lb/>
     like past coalitions is going to result in ad<lb break="no"/>vantage to the Conservative at the expense 
     <lb/>
     of the Reform party—if there is one thing 
     <lb/>
     more than another that makes me fear that 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="955" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0955.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">955</fw>
      
     the Reform members of the Government, for 
     <lb/>
     whom I have a strong political as well as 
     <lb/>
     personal sympathy, will be overwhelmed by 
     <lb/>
     their conservative colleagues—it is this cry, 
     <lb/>
               this bugbear, this <hi rendition="simple:italic">bête noire</hi> of annexation 
     <lb/>
     raised by hon. gentlemen on the other side 
     <lb/>
     of the House. Why, sir, it is only a few 
     <lb/>
     months since we had the great Constitutional 
     <lb/>
     party organized in this country, and baptized 
     <lb/>
     with an amount of eloquence and parade such 
     <lb/>
     as never attended the birth of a party in any 
     <lb/>
     other country. We were told by the leaders 
     <lb/>
     of this great Constitutional party that the 
     <lb/>
     British Constitution in this country must be 
     <lb/>
     defended; that the country was divided into 
     <lb/>
     two parties—the Annexation party and the 
     <lb/>
     Constitutional party—and that the reformers 
     <lb/>
     composed the former, while the conservatives 
     <lb/>
     desired to perpetuate British connection. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend the member for Lambton 
     <lb/>
     was singled out for attack, and told that he 
     <lb/>
     and those with whom he acted desired to 
     <lb/>
     hand the country over to the Americans ; 
     <lb/>
     that he was unfaithful and untrue to his 
     <lb/>
     allegiance ; that he carried the sign of 
     <lb/>
     democracy on his face ; and the whole Re<lb break="no"/>form party was branded last summer by the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative leaders as annexationists, who 
     <lb/>
     desired to uproot and overthrow the British 
     <lb/>
     institutions of this country. Well, sir, what 
     <lb/>
     do we find now ? We find the same charges 
     <lb/>
     hurled at the minority in this House—my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friends who sit around me—by the 
     <lb/>
     leaders of this same great Constitutional 
     <lb/>
     party ; and we find the Honorable Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, the Honorable Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, and the Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council— for all of whom, I confess, I 
     <lb/>
     yet feel a strong political sympathy—sitting 
     <lb/>
     silently by, while their old friends and for<lb break="no"/>mer colleagues are suffering the same abuse 
     <lb/>
     that was dealt out to them by their present 
     <lb/>
     colleagues only a few short months ago. 
     <lb/>
     Have they suddenly turned to view these 
     <lb/>
     charges as just, or do they still think, as 
     <lb/>
     they thought last summer, that they are 
     <lb/>
     unfair and unfounded ? If they were unfair 
     <lb/>
     then, is it right now that, without a word of 
     <lb/>
     expostulation, they should allow them to be 
     <lb/>
     hurled at us without a word of expostulation 
     <lb/>
     from the great Liberal party of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, that has suffered with us from these 
     <lb/>
     disgraceful, foul and slanderous imputations? 
     <lb/>
    (Hear, hear.) Is it liberal, is it just, is it 
     <lb/>fair, is it manly, sir, that they should now 
     <lb/>sit silently by and see the handful who com<lb break="no"/>pose the minority in this House—honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen with whom, but a short time 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     since, they acted and in whom they had 
     <lb/>
     confidence—branded, as they themselves 
     <lb/>
     were branded six months ago, with the name 
     <lb/>
     of annexationist and democrat ? (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I have thought, as I have heard 
     <lb/>
     these charges reiterated, that they might 
     <lb/>
     have interposed ; I have thought they might 
     <lb/>
     have pitied us a little for the sake of former 
     <lb/>
     associations. I have thought that the great 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party of Upper Canada might have 
     <lb/>
     come a little to the rescue of their former 
     <lb/>
     colleagues, and said to those who uttered 
     <lb/>
     these false accusations—' Don't hound down 
     <lb/>
     these men too much ; we know and have 
     <lb/>
     acted with them : they are not annexation<lb break="no"/>ists, they are not rebellious, and we know 
     <lb/>
     that your accusations against them are un<lb break="no"/>fair and ungenerous." But, sir, throughout 
     <lb/>
     this debate these members of the Government 
     <lb/>
     have listened to attacks of this kind—the 
     <lb/>
     great Reform party of Upper Canada, which 
     <lb/>
     only yesterday, as it were, was smarting 
     <lb/>
     under the lash that is now cracked over our 
     <lb/>
     heads, which only yesterday writhed under 
     <lb/>
     the odium of these false representations—sat 
     <lb/>
     silently by, without a word of expostulation, 
     <lb/>
     without a word in defence of their old 
     <lb/>
     friends, whom they know to be unjustly and 
     <lb/>
     slanderously accused. (Hear. hear.) Now, 
     <lb/>
     why I speak of this matter is because I fear 
     <lb/>
     that these gentlemen, who have long been 
     <lb/>
     the exponents of that great Liberal party, 
     <lb/>
     which has gained for us responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment and everything worth living for under 
     <lb/>
     the political system we now enjoy, will be 
     <lb/>
     overwhelmed by the preponderance of con<lb break="no"/>servative feeling in the Government and 
     <lb/>
     conservative influence in the country. I 
     <lb/>
     know that they do not feel comfortable 
     <lb/>
     under the present state of affairs. I know 
     <lb/>
     how the MCKELLARS, the MACKENZIES, who 
     <lb/>
     have been so long the victims of conserva<lb break="no"/>tive sneers, and others who have long fought 
     <lb/>
     the battle of reform, must feel ; but I fear 
     <lb/>
     that the conservative leaven is about to 
     <lb/>
     leaven the whole lump.

     <lb/>
     for me to except him. I say, sir, it is but 
     <lb/>
     yesterday since the organs of hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite, who lead the Constitutional party 
     <lb/>
     of this country, denounced us all as Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans and annexatiouists ; and I warn the 
     <lb/>
     hon. members of the Liberal party, who sit 
     <lb/>
     quietly by while these charges are still made 
     <lb/>
     against the minority, that the measure which 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="956" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0956.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">956</fw>
        
     is meted out to us now, and to them last 
     <lb/>
     summer, may again be dealt out to them 
     <lb/>
     without mercy. (Hear, hear.) I repeat, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I have, since this Coalition took place, 
     <lb/>
     seen no sign so perfect and so convincing to 
     <lb/>
     me, that the conservatives have had the 
     <lb/>
     best of the bargain, as this—to see those 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen sitting tamely and silently 
     <lb/>
     in their seats, and not rising to say a word  
     <lb/>
     while the old cry under which they had 
     <lb/>
     writhed for so many years is fulminated 
     <lb/>
     against their former allies, and we have no 
     <lb/>
     indication from them that they are not the 
     <lb/>
     party which they once were. With these 
     <lb/>
     remarks, and reserving to myself the right 
     <lb/>
     of speaking more at length on the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     which I would be glad to discuss somewhat 
     <lb/>
     fully if time had been allowed, I have simply 
     <lb/>
      to say that the constituency which I repre<lb break="no"/>sent is not disposed to permit me to vote for 
     <lb/>
     this scheme. I say this from knowledge, 
     <lb/>
     having been compelled to be a good deal 
     <lb/>
     among them while attending to my business. 
     <lb/>
     In the Eastern Townships, both among the 
     <lb/>
     French and English, the general opinion 
     <lb/>
     is strongly against this scheme. I have had 
     <lb/>
     such opportunities of learning the views and 
     <lb/>
     wishes of my constituents with reference to 
     <lb/>
     this matter, as few other hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     have enjoyed for learning the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     those whom they represent, and I come back 
     <lb/>
     to this House very much strengthened in 
     <lb/>
     the conviction that in the Eastern Town<lb break="no"/>ships, and especially in the constituency 
     <lb/>
     which I represent-<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:HUNT2">HON. MR. HUNTINGTON</persName>—The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member says " Hear, hear," but lthink I 
     <lb/>
     may speak in behalf of a large number of 
     <lb/>
      petitioners in the county of Compton<lb break="no"/>(hear, hear)—there is a large majority of 
     <lb/>
     the people opposed to this scheme. I have 
     <lb/>
     felt it to be my duty, as no one had risen to 
     <lb/>
     speak from the point of view I have taken, 
     <lb/>
     that I should say a word for those who were 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the scheme, and that as there 
     <lb/>
     was no one here to speak for the Eastern 
     <lb/>
     Townships, where so strong a feeling per<lb break="no"/>vaded the masses against the scheme, I 
     <lb/>
     would but discharge my duty in rising to 
     <lb/>
     state what I found to be the feeling in those 
     <lb/>
     townships. (Hear, hear.) I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that the Conservative party have large fol<lb break="no"/>lowing in the Eastern Townships. I have 
     <lb/>
     no doubt that a great many of those who 
     <lb/>
     follow the hon. member for Sherbrooke are 
     <lb/>
     disposed to follow him in supporting the 
     <lb/>
    scheme ; but I speak for the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     of those townships, with whose opinions 
     <lb/>
     I have had an excellent opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     becoming acquainted. I do not say that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Compton is not sup<lb break="no"/>ported by that party in the position which 
     <lb/>
     he has taken, but I do say that those people 
     <lb/>
     in the Eastern Townships, as a general 
     <lb/>
     thing, who sympathize with the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party, are opposed to the scheme in the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances under which it has been pre<lb break="no"/>sented to the people. I was not a little 
     <lb/>
     surprised by a remark which fell from my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the member for Richmond and 
     <lb/>
     Wolfe ( Mr. WEBB). I know perfectly well 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman's sincerity, and therefore 
     <lb/>
     I was singularly struck with the position he 
     <lb/>
     took. While he seemed to admit the gen<lb break="no"/>eral feeling of apprehension which prevailed, 
     <lb/>
     and the unpopularity of the scheme in the 
     <lb/>
     Townships, yet he would vote for the whole 
     <lb/>
     scheme, reserving to himself the right to 
     <lb/>
     deal with details. The scheme having been 
     <lb/>
     adopted by this House as a whole, there 
     <lb/>
     is no probability whatever of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman getting a chance to vote upon the 
     <lb/>
     details a second time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WEBB1">MR. WEBB</persName>—The resolutions have not 
     <lb/>
     been adopted, nor yet concurred in by the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUNT2">HON. MR. HUNTINGTON</persName>—Well, I am 
     <lb/>
     speaking of them as if they had been adopt<lb break="no"/>ed. It makes no difference whether they are 
     <lb/>
     adopted or not in the other provinces for 
     <lb/>
     some time to come. So far as Canada is 
     <lb/>
     concerned, the scheme will be carried before 
     <lb/>
     this House rises, and there will be no further 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of dealing with its details. But 
     <lb/>
     suppose we should get the opportunity here<lb break="no"/>after of voting on those details, in what posi<lb break="no"/>tion would be my hon. friend from Richmond 
     <lb/>
     and Wolfe, or my hon. friend from North 
     <lb/>
     Wellington (Dr. PARKER)—in what position 
     <lb/>
     would they stand when they rose to move 
     <lb/>
     amendments to resolutions which they had 
     <lb/>
    only so short a time previously voted for ? 
     <lb/>Would they not be reminded by honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen opposite that they had swallowed 
     <lb/>the whole bait, hook and line, bob and 
     <lb/>sinker ! (Laughter.) They say they will 
     <lb/>oppose the details in future ; but if the 
     <lb/>details are incorrect, and they believe so, and 
     <lb/>they say they do, why not oppose them now ? 
     <lb/>It was said by the honorable member for 
     <lb/>South Grenville (Mr. SHANLY) that we 
     <lb/>ought to carry the whole scheme, let the 
     <lb/>details be ever so unsatisfactory, trusting to 
     <lb/>the Federal Legislature to detect and remedy 
     <lb/>them hereafter. Now I think that Canada 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="957" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0957.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">957</fw>
       
     has had some experience in that way of 
     <lb/>
     doing things. Those details become vested 
     <lb/>
     right, and the sections benefited by them 
     <lb/>
     claim them as such. and tenaciously cling 
     <lb/>
     to them. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     have not time to go into this subject at this 
     <lb/>
     point, and show how objectionable are many 
     <lb/>
     of the details ; but I maintain the position 
     <lb/>
     that it is most absurd and illogical to ask us 
     <lb/>
     to accept the scheme as a whole, and leave 
     <lb/>
     such objectionable details to be regulated 
     <lb/>
     hereafter. When the union of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces took place in 1841, the discussion in 
     <lb/>
     relation to it in the British Houses of Par<lb break="no"/>liament showed that the framers of the 
     <lb/>
     Union Act expected that any difficulties that 
     <lb/>
     might grow out of it would be easily regu<lb break="no"/>lated by the united Parliament of Canada<lb break="no"/>that such questions as representation by 
     <lb/>
     population could be dealt with at any time. 
     <lb/>
     But what happened ? Why ! Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     treated equal representation as a vested right, 
     <lb/>
     and stood firmly on that right. This being the 
     <lb/>
     case, there was no process provided by which 
     <lb/>
     the evil could be regulated. The result was 
     <lb/>
     that a great struggle came on, the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     arising out of which, honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite tell us, have proved our Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion to be a failure. From this experience 
     <lb/>
     of the past, we ought to learn that it is very 
     <lb/>
     bad policy to deliberately put errors in our 
     <lb/>
     Constitution and trust to the future to remedy 
     <lb/>
     them. If you speak of a union of all Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America, nobody objects. Every<lb break="no"/>body is in favor of a union, provided the 
     <lb/>
     details are satisfactory ; but providing imper<lb break="no"/>fect details and trusting to the future for 
     <lb/>
     rendering them what they ought to have 
     <lb/>
     been made at the outset, reminds me of an 
     <lb/>
     incident a friend related the other day. 
     <lb/>
     A carter was about to take a friend of mine 
     <lb/>
     with his baggage to the railway station, when 
     <lb/>
     my friend observed that one of the tugs was 
     <lb/>
     nothing but a piece of rope. Says my friend, 
     <lb/>
     " You are not going to take me through these 
     <lb/>
     twenty miles of woods with that string, are 
     <lb/>
     you?" "Oh ! never mind," says he, "I have 
     <lb/>
     more strings in my pocket with which I can 
     <lb/>
     regulate that on the road." So hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the Treasury benches ask us to follow 
     <lb/>
     them in their rickety concern, assuring us 
     <lb/>
     that they have a pocketful of strings with 
     <lb/>
     which they can regulate things on the way. 
     <lb/>
     ( Laughter.) But, sir, they will find no little 
     <lb/>
     difficulty in bringing their pocketful of 
     <lb/>
     strings into operation. They will find almost 
     <lb/>
     insurmountable difficulties in the way of re<lb break="no"/>moving the vested rights that will grow up 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     under any system that may be established. 
     <lb/>
    I believe that a number of circumstances 
     <lb/>connected with this scheme, a discussion of 
     <lb/>which I cannot now go into, render it the 
     <lb/>general opinion of those whom it is my busi<lb break="no"/>ness to represent on this floor, that in its 
     <lb/>present shape this scheme ought not to be 
     <lb/>carried into effect. First of all, so sweeping 
     <lb/>a measure as this—one for sweeping away 
     <lb/>our entire Constitution and substituting a 
     <lb/>new one unknown to the British flag—ought 
     <lb/>not to be carried out until it is submitted to 
     <lb/>the people; and, secondly, the multitude of 
     <lb/>details which it embraces ought to be calmly 
     <lb/>and critically considered, with a view to 
     <lb/>their amendment, where found defective, be<lb break="no"/>fore being incorporated in our Constitution. 
     <lb/>I do not say that this is the feeling of the 
     <lb/>Conservative party of my own constitu<lb break="no"/>ency, or of the Eastern Townships ; but 
     <lb/>I do say that even among that party 
     <lb/>there are grave apprehensions of diffi<lb break="no"/>culty growing out of such a jumble as is 
     <lb/>presented for our adoption, when no time 
     <lb/>is to be allowed even for their consideration, 
     <lb/>to say nothing of their amendment. And 
     <lb/>many of that party have no hesitation in 
     <lb/>giving expression to those feelings. I have 
     <lb/>not met with a man, conservative or re<lb break="no"/>former, during my absence from this session 
     <lb/>of the House, who has not been ready to 
     <lb/>contend that it was the first duty of the 
     <lb/>Government to provide for consulting the 
     <lb/>people, and ascertaining from them, in a 
     <lb/>definite manner, whether they desired the 
     <lb/>change proposed or not. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Having thus briefly expressed my views, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, in order not to weary the 
     <lb/>House at this late hour of the night—or 
     <lb/>rather of the morning, for it is now after 
     <lb/>three o'clock—I will conclude by stating 
     <lb/>that I feel it my duty, as a true represent<lb break="no"/>ative, to record my vote against the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COWA1">MR. COWAN</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Shefford says that he and his 
     <lb/>
     friends  sympathised with the Reform party of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada when they were branded as 
     <lb/>
     rebels and writhing under the charge of dis<lb break="no"/>loyalty, and blames us for not extending the 
     <lb/>
     same sympathy to him and his friends when 
     <lb/>
     laboring under a similar accusation. I don't 
     <lb/>
     deny, sir, that the reformers of Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada have often been branded as rebels, but I  
     <lb/>
     do most emphatically deny that they ever 
     <lb/>
     writhed under the false accusation. Conscious 
     <lb/>
     of their fealty to both their Queen and coun<lb break="no"/>try, they treated with the most sovereign con<lb break="no"/><pb n="958" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0958.jpg"/><fw type="num">958</fw>tempt every such foul, unfounded imputation 
     <lb/>
     against their loyalty. And I would advise 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Shefford to keep equally 
     <lb/>
     cool under similar provocation. If he and his 
     <lb/>
     friends are really loyal—and I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     they are—all such aspersions of their loyalty, 
     <lb/>
     instead of affecting them, will only recoil on 
     <lb/>
     the heads of their accusers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERG2">MR. T. R. FERGUSON</persName> said—Feeling 
     <lb/>
     and knowing as I do, Mr. SPEAKER, the great 
     <lb/>
     desire that is felt by the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the Treasury benches, and also, I am ready 
     <lb/>
     to admit, by the large majority of the honor<lb break="no"/>able members of this House, that discussion 
     <lb/>
     should not be continued unnecessarily, and 
     <lb/>
     that no obstructions should be thrown in the 
     <lb/>
     way of an immediate decision on the question 
     <lb/>
     before us, I beg to state that it is not from 
     <lb/>
     choice but from necessity, that it is not from 
     <lb/>
     any desire of self-gratification, but from a deep 
     <lb/>
     sense of duty, that I rise to say a single word 
     <lb/>
     upon this occasion, particularly as so much 
     <lb/>
     has been said, and as the night is now so far 
     <lb/>
     advanced. I hope, therefore, that as I have 
     <lb/>
     remained silent during the debate up to the 
     <lb/>
     present moment, the House will bear with me 
     <lb/>
     while I briefly express my views on this all- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     important matter, and assign a few of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons that induce me to record my vote in 
     <lb/>
     the manner which I design. Sir, I would 
     <lb/>
     say that I stand here in a different position 
     <lb/>
     from that of many honorable members who 
     <lb/>
     submitted the resolutions embodying the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme to their constituents, 
     <lb/>
     and who held public meetings on the subject, 
     <lb/>
     and who received from them positive instruc<lb break="no"/>tions as to how their vote should be recorded. 
     <lb/>
     I received a circular from the Government, 
     <lb/>
     marked " Private," but took no action to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain public opinion on its contents, so 
     <lb/>
     that I am, I regret to say , without a single 
     <lb/>
     word of advice as to how I should act in the 
     <lb/>
     matter. I may say, sir, that after reading 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions over again and again, I found 
     <lb/>
     many things in them that I could not endorse. 
     <lb/>
     I felt that they were not that which we had 
     <lb/>
     expected from the Government, when we gave 
     <lb/>
     our assent to the Coalition that was formed 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of bringing down some pro<lb break="no"/>position for the settlement of our sectional 
     <lb/>
     difficulties. I had expected that if a union 
     <lb/>
     of the colonies took place at all, and a change 
     <lb/>
     of our Constitution in that direction was pro<lb break="no"/>posed, we would not have had a Federal but 
     <lb/>
     a Legislative form of Government. It has 
     <lb/>
     been stated, since we had the pleasure of 
     <lb/>
     meeting together in the present session, that 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentlemen who went to the 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     Conference to represent Canadian views, and 
     <lb/>
     engage in preparing a scheme of union, could 
     <lb/>
     not obtain that union without its being 
     <lb/>
     based upon the Federal system. Sir, I feel 
     <lb/>
     that this is very much to be deplored, as I 
     <lb/>
     believe that with a union based on the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral system, we shall have constant dissen<lb break="no"/>sion, and before very many years, if this 
     <lb/>
     scheme goes into operation, we shall again 
     <lb/>
     have agitations for constitutional changes of 
     <lb/>
     various kinds, and that the ultimate result 
     <lb/>
    must be a perfect union under one Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Government for the whole country, and 
     <lb/>that now was the best time to settle the mat<lb break="no"/>ter finally. If in the end, however, that 
     <lb/>should be the result of the long discussion we 
     <lb/>have had upon this Constitution, then I shall 
     <lb/>feel that though no amendments have been 
     <lb/>allowed on the floor of this House, yet the 
     <lb/>discussion has been productive of some good 
     <lb/>purpose. (Hear, hear.) I had resolved upon 
     <lb/>offering amendments upon various points in 
     <lb/>the scheme before us, but the motion for the 
     <lb/>"previous question" has shut them out, 
     <lb/>which I very much regret. It is too late now 
     <lb/>to enter into an explanation of these several 
     <lb/>amendments I was about to move, or to state 
     <lb/>what I contemplated accomplishing by pro<lb break="no"/>posing them. It is sufficient for me to say 
     <lb/>that the previous question having been pro<lb break="no"/>posed, I feel that there has not been that op<lb break="no"/>portunity for the full consideration of the 
     <lb/>scheme in all its parts that was expected, or 
     <lb/>that ought to have been given to this House, 
     <lb/>in view of the fact that the people are not to 
     <lb/>be consulted in any other manner than by a 
     <lb/>vote of their representatives. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Being one of those, sir, who earnestly sought 
     <lb/>for a constitutional change, and who joined 
     <lb/>in the very just complaint of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>that she was compelled to labor under great 
     <lb/>grievances—the lack of equal rights with 
     <lb/>Lower Canada on this floor, man for man, 
     <lb/>while she also contributed much the larger 
     <lb/>proportion of the revenue—it is needless for 
     <lb/>me to say that I earnestly desired some 
     <lb/>change, that I sympathized with the pre<lb break="no"/>vailing sentiment of Upper Canada, and 
     <lb/>used my best endeavors, in the House and 
     <lb/>out of it, to assist in bringing about a 
     <lb/>remedy for our political and sectional ills. 
     <lb/>But, sir, we found we could not get repre<lb break="no"/>sentation according to population ; and since 
     <lb/>the present scheme was announced, and know<lb break="no"/>ing the strong feeling which exists against it 
     <lb/>on the part of many of the Lower Canada 
     <lb/>members, I endeavored to ascertain, on com<lb break="no"/>ing down here, the opinion of hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="959" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0959.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">959</fw>
      
     from Lower Canada, and I found that, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding their opposition to the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, which they were willing to do 
     <lb/>
     almost anything to defeat, they were still per<lb break="no"/>sistent in denying to Upper Canada a single 
     <lb/>
     shadow of a hope that her grievances would 
     <lb/>
     be redressed, if this scheme were rejected, by 
     <lb/>
     the granting of representation according to 
     <lb/>
     population. (Hear, hear.) Before coming here, 
     <lb/>
     too, I entertained the opinion that those hon. 
     <lb/>
     orable gentlemen from Upper Canada, who 
     <lb/>
     had fought so long and so uselessly for repre<lb break="no"/>sentation according to population, would join 
     <lb/>
     with me in endeavoring to get an amendment 
     <lb/>
     to the scheme before us adopted, giving us a 
     <lb/>
     Legislative instead of a Federal union. I 
     <lb/>
     soon found out, however, that there was little 
     <lb/>
     hope of getting such an amendment carried, 
     <lb/>
     because nine-tenths of them were determined 
     <lb/>
     to accept the scheme as it stood, simply be<lb break="no"/>cause their leaders were in the Government. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) My hon. friend the member 
     <lb/>
     for Shefford (Hon. Mr. HUNTINGTON), com<lb break="no"/>plains of this measure being forced upon the 
     <lb/>
     country ; but if there is one hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     more than another chargeable with bringing 
     <lb/>
     about this state of affairs, it is that honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman. He once held a high and honor<lb break="no"/>able position in the Governmentpf this coun<lb break="no"/>try. He is possessed of great ability, and 
     <lb/>
     being highly popular with his constituents, 
     <lb/>
     could well have afforded to have lent a help<lb break="no"/>ing hand to those who were desirous of hav<lb break="no"/>ing the union as it was work satisfactorily. 
     <lb/>
     I am satisfied that when he held the reins of 
     <lb/>
     power, if he was so anxious for the good-will, 
     <lb/>
     as well as for the reputation of the great Pro<lb break="no"/>testant and Reform party of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and so desirous of maintaining and protecting 
     <lb/>
     the rights which he now desires to have given 
     <lb/>
     to his friends, he would have used his power 
     <lb/>
     in the Government and his eloquence in the 
     <lb/>
     House to obtain even-handed justice for Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada, and to relieve his friends in that 
     <lb/>
     portion of the province from the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     under which they labored. But, instead of 
     <lb/>
     doing that, he joined a Government that de<lb break="no"/>nied its members the privilege of voting for 
     <lb/>
     representation according to population — a 
     <lb/>
     Government that made it a close question, 
     <lb/>
     and which, instead of dealing with it as they 
     <lb/>
     ought to have done, or even giving us reason 
     <lb/>
     to hope well of the future, took such a course 
     <lb/>
     in relation to that great question as left a 
     <lb/>
     dark and dismal future before those who had 
     <lb/>
     been struggling for their rights on that ques<lb break="no"/>tion. As regards the position of that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, after it was reconstructed, I believe I 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     am right in saying it was thoroughly under<lb break="no"/>stood that its members were not to vote for it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—No ; they 
     <lb/>
     were to vote as they liked. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERG2">MR. FERGUSON</persName>—Well, whatever may 
     <lb/>
     have been their privileges, we all know that 
     <lb/>
     there was nothing done in the matter, al<lb break="no"/>though they might have seen that it would 
     <lb/>
     be better to come out honestly and say that 
     <lb/>
     even-handed justice should be done to both 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada. As this was my 
     <lb/>
     impression, Mr. SPEAKER, and seeing that no 
     <lb/>
     change could be made in the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     that would benefit Upper Canada, I felt I 
     <lb/>
     had a duty to perform—I felt that if they 
     <lb/>
     would not give us a change in the mode we 
     <lb/>
     desired, it was not for me to say that I would 
     <lb/>
     play the part of the dog in the manger. I feel 
     <lb/>
     it would be better to have almost any scheme, 
     <lb/>
     than to endure the difficulties we had labored 
     <lb/>
     under for so many years past ; and I told the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen from Lower Canada that 
     <lb/>
     if that were the course they were to pursue, 
     <lb/>
     they would change my mind to a consid<lb break="no"/>erable extent. Another thing which had a 
     <lb/>
     peculiar effect on my mind, was the report of 
     <lb/>
     Col. JERVOIS on the defences of our country. 
     <lb/>
     It is impossible for me to deny that the 
     <lb/>
     speeches which have been made in the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish Parliament, expressive of a want of sym<lb break="no"/>pathy with the Canadian people, and of a desire 
     <lb/>
     to get rid of Canada, have not been pleasant 
     <lb/>
     to me ; and although I think I have a loyal 
     <lb/>
     heart, and am bound by powerful obligations 
     <lb/>
     to maintain British supremacy, I find it hard 
     <lb/>
     that English statesmen should express a wil<lb break="no"/>lingness to shake us off and leave us in the 
     <lb/>
     power of a foreign nation. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     Col. JERVOIS was sent out to ascertain what 
     <lb/>
     defences were necessary, and what could be 
     <lb/>
     done to defend this country if at an unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate moment a difficulty might arise. When 
     <lb/>
     I see that his report declares that we have a 
     <lb/>
     difficult country to defend—that it would take 
     <lb/>
     a large number of men to put us into a 
     <lb/>
     condition to defend ourselves—and when I 
     <lb/>
     see that the British Government, true to its 
     <lb/>
     real instincts, is resolved to aid us in our de<lb break="no"/>fence—this, I say, has a great effect upon my 
     <lb/>
     mind, and makes me think it would not be 
     <lb/>
     my duty, under the circumstances, to refuse 
     <lb/>
     assent to the Government measure at a mo<lb break="no"/>ment when I feel that the lives and property 
     <lb/>
     of my constituents, 30,000 in number, are 
     <lb/>
     open to an attack at any time from the pow<lb break="no"/>erful armies a foreign people might choose to 
     <lb/>
     bring up against them. (Hear.) The scheme 
     <lb/>
     seems to me to be an expensive and trouble<lb break="no"/><pb n="960" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0960.jpg"/><fw type="num">960</fw>some one ; but I do not think it would be 
     <lb/>
     right for me to reject any measure calculated 
     <lb/>
     to ensure to us that assistance of which we 
     <lb/>
     stand so much in need. The United States 
     <lb/>
     are, perhaps, more willing to injure their 
     <lb/>
     neighbors than other countries are, owing to 
     <lb/>
     the universal idea that they must carry out 
     <lb/>
     the Munroe doctrine of complete domination 
     <lb/>
     over at least the American continent. They 
     <lb/>
     are at this moment a war-making and a war- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     loving people. For four years they have 
     <lb/>
      been practising the art of war upon their 
     <lb/>
     own flesh and blood, and have shown little 
     <lb/>
     sympathy with those who have been in con<lb break="no"/>gress with them and jointly concerned in 
     <lb/>
     every great enterprise—who grew with their 
     <lb/>
     growth, and strengthened with their strength ; 
     <lb/>
     and I feel that they would have very little 
     <lb/>
     sympathy indeed with us in the event of any 
     <lb/>
     trouble arising either between us and them, 
     <lb/>
     or between them and the Mother Country. 
     <lb/>
     We are in a very difficult position. The 
     <lb/>
     Americans have done a great deal to revoke 
     <lb/>
     the wrath of England and to insult Canada. 
     <lb/>
     At this moment they want to abrogate the 
     <lb/>
     Reciprocity treaty, and talk of doing away 
     <lb/>
     with the bonding system. They lately im<lb break="no"/>posed a passport system, which has only just 
     <lb/>
    been removed. Well, seeing that there was 
     <lb/>no redress for the grievances of Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada, one Ministry falling after another with<lb break="no"/>out doing anything, and viewing our condi<lb break="no"/>tion relatively to the United States, I feel it 
     <lb/>my duty to forego opposition to this new ar<lb break="no"/>rangement. When I saw the telegraphic des<lb break="no"/>patch, too, relating to the debate in the House 
     <lb/>of Lords a few days ago ; when I saw that 
     <lb/>there people were so interested in Canadian 
     <lb/>affairs, that on the question being put in the 
     <lb/>House of Lords it was declared by the leader 
     <lb/>of the House that no steps should be taken 
     <lb/>respecting the Hudson's Bay Company until 
     <lb/>some information should be received from 
     <lb/>Canada respecting the Confederation system ; 
     <lb/>when I found that they were willing to be 
     <lb/>with us in peace and with us in war ; when 
     <lb/>they said " Help yourself and we will help 
     <lb/>you" ; when they said, in language stronger 
     <lb/>than words can convey, " Not a hair of 
     <lb/>your head shall be touched without return<lb break="no"/>ing the injury tenfold," I felt that we must 
     <lb/>support these new resolutions. (Hear.) I 
     <lb/>do not think, with my honorable friend who 
     <lb/>spoke today, that in three years there will be 
     <lb/>a cry for annexation. I think that in three 
     <lb/>years we shall be a stable people—that in 
     <lb/>three years we shall have sufficient defences 
     <lb/>to resist aggression—that in three years 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     we shall have risen in the estimation of 
     <lb/>
     England and the world at large—that our 
     <lb/>
     boundaries will extend from Canada to the 
     <lb/>
     Red River and the Saskatchewan. I agree 
     <lb/>
     with another honorable gentleman who has 
     <lb/>
     spoken to-day, and do not desire to see the 
     <lb/>
     young men of this country sent away into 
     <lb/>
     another country , when we have spacious limits 
     <lb/>
     of our own. I desire to keep our young men 
     <lb/>
     among us, and our old men too, as long as 
     <lb/>
     they live. (Hear, hear.) When I think that 
     <lb/>
     England is going to do much for us in other 
     <lb/>
     respects, I think she will be willing to open 
     <lb/>
     up that country ; she will not be an unkind 
     <lb/>
     mother to us, and demand from her children 
     <lb/>
     that, when she has placed us in a position 
     <lb/>
     of difficulty, we should bear all the burdens. 
     <lb/>
     I believe, however, that we ought to put our 
     <lb/>
     shoulders to the wheel and do something for 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. That is the true spirit of Britons ; 
     <lb/>
     for if we did not, we should be open to insult 
     <lb/>
     —and insult is worse than injury. Rather than 
     <lb/>
     have to bear with it, I am willing to risk the 
     <lb/>
     consequences of even a larger debt than we 
     <lb/>
     yet have—to give some of the means that I 
     <lb/>
     possess ; and in saying and acting thus for 
     <lb/>
     myself, I am speaking and acting for my 
     <lb/>
     constituents too, who sent me here without 
     <lb/>
     any other pledge or bond than that I should 
     <lb/>
     do for them the best I could. I have made 
     <lb/>
     this the land of my adoption, and it is evident 
     <lb/>
     that any injury I impose on their children I 
     <lb/>
     impose on my own too. (Hear.) Whatever 
     <lb/>
     may be the result of the scheme—and I trust 
     <lb/>
     it will not turn out so badly as some hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen seem to expect, and which I much 
     <lb/>
     dreaded myself—I trust we shall have such 
     <lb/>
     arrangements made with the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, if arrangements are made with them, 
     <lb/>
     that we shall have a real union—not union 
     <lb/>
     mixed with disunion. (Hear, hear.) I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that in the course of the summer we 
     <lb/>
     shall see millions of British capital spent here 
     <lb/>
     for our defence, and I see clearly that we shall 
     <lb/>
     have to contract debt for this purpose our<lb break="no"/>selves. But we have another duty to per<lb break="no"/>form : we have to prepare the strong-hearted 
     <lb/>
     yeomen of this country to man our fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions. England cannot supply us with all 
     <lb/>
     the men and money necessary to defend the 
     <lb/>
     province—that is the duty of our young men, 
     <lb/>
     and our middle aged men too. If we do not 
     <lb/>
     perform this duty, we shall not be worthy of 
     <lb/>
     the name of a people, not be worthy of the 
     <lb/>
     rights, liberties and privileges we enjoy. I 
     <lb/>
     will not detain the House much longer ; but 
     <lb/>
     I must say that one remark I heard addressed 
     <lb/>
     to this Chamber to-day, seemed to me very 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="961" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-10_Page_0961.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">961</fw>
         
     uncharitable. This House will believe me 
     <lb/>
     when I say that I was as much astonished as 
     <lb/>
     others to see a Government formed, composed 
     <lb/>
     of men of different parties ; but, sir, I came 
     <lb/>
     to the conclusion that the state of parties at 
     <lb/>
     that time, and the conduct of some so-called 
     <lb/>
     friends of the Ministry then in power, led to 
     <lb/>
     such an event ; and I do not blame the Con<lb break="no"/>servatives who were in that Government for 
     <lb/>
     taking in other gentlemen, if by that course 
     <lb/>
     they could advance the interests of the coun<lb break="no"/>try.  I have heard it said that some mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the present Government were actuat<lb break="no"/>ed in entering that Government by the greed 
     <lb/>of office, its emolument and its power ; but I 
     <lb/>will not be so uncharitable as to make such 
     <lb/>an accusation against them. I believe they 
     <lb/>suffered a good deal personally in making the 
     <lb/>arrangement, and I should be sorry to say 
     <lb/>they did it for any other object than to satisfy 
     <lb/>the obligations of their conscience. Their 
     <lb/>object, sir, was, no doubt, the good of the 
     <lb/>country, not the small gain or the temporary 
     <lb/>pleasure of holding for a few years the po<lb break="no"/>sition of Ministers. (Hear.) I trust they 
     <lb/>will discharge their duty as Ministers in such 
     <lb/>a way as to enable the people of the country 
     <lb/>to regard their advent to power with satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion—not to condemn them for wrong-doing 
     <lb/>as traitors to their country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>I think, sir, there are Ministers in the Cabinet 
     <lb/>who could make far more money in the pur<lb break="no"/>suit of their various avocations than in gov<lb break="no"/>erning the country, and I trust they will be 
     <lb/>as economical as they can in all their expen<lb break="no"/>diture, while not losing sight of one great aim 
     <lb/>—that the people of this country must be pre<lb break="no"/>pared to defend themselves, so as not to be 
     <lb/>afraid of the threats and alarms that reach us 
     <lb/>every day. If in the end we arrive at a union 
     <lb/>of the colonies, good results will flow from it. 
     <lb/>I think we have no evil results to fear, though 
     <lb/>I would at this moment, if I could, remedy 
     <lb/>some of the faults in these seventy-two reso<lb break="no"/>lutions. I am sorry, for instance, for one 
     <lb/>thing—that the clause relating to the general 
     <lb/>education of the people of this country was 
     <lb/>inserted in its present shape into the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions. I am sorry the separate school system 
     <lb/>is to be retained for Upper Canada. I am 
     <lb/>sorry that bone of contention is to be incor<lb break="no"/>porated into the permanent Constitution of 
     <lb/>this country. Though 52,000 Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic children in Upper Canada attended 
     <lb/>school in 1863, no more than 15,000 of them 
     <lb/>ever availed themselves of the separate schools. 
     <lb/> <persName ref="pers:ANON1">A VOICE</persName>—You are wrong. 
     <lb/> <persName ref="pers:FERG2">MR. FERGUSON</persName>—No, I beg the honor<lb break="no"/><cb/>able gentleman's pardon, I am not wrong. 
     <lb/>
     I take the figures of the Superintendent of 
     <lb/>
     Education, Dr. RYERSON. And of my own 
     <lb/>
     knowledge, in places where separate schools 
     <lb/>
     have been established and are still existing, 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholics have grown weary of 
     <lb/>
     them, and I am satisfied they would now be 
     <lb/>
     willing that their children should get their 
     <lb/>
     education along with the children of the rest 
     <lb/>
     of the community, without any fear that their 
     <lb/>
     respect for their own religion would be inter<lb break="no"/>fered with, or their consciences injured. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I trust the day will come when they 
     <lb/>
     will all take the right view of it, and the 
     <lb/>
     question with them with reference to education 
     <lb/>
     may be—not what church they belong to<lb break="no"/>but how their children may receive the best 
     <lb/>
     education, and grow up with other youth in 
     <lb/>
     peace and harmony. I regret that the subject 
     <lb/>
     is mentioned in these resolutions. I had a 
     <lb/>
     resolution prepared on that matter, as well as 
     <lb/>
     another with regard to our canals, and I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry I have not had an opportunity of moving 
     <lb/>
     them. I trust, however, that the assurances 
     <lb/>
     given by the Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council will be carried out, and that a canal 
     <lb/>
     and a direct and unbroken communication 
     <lb/>
     from Lake Huron to Quebec will be an ac<lb break="no"/>complished fact at no distant day. The peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Western Canada will be dissatisfied and 
     <lb/>
    bitterly disappointed if the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the Treasury benches neglect this ; 
     <lb/>and if they do, they may rest assured that 
     <lb/>another cry will come, by and by, from Upper 
     <lb/>Canada which will remove them from their 
     <lb/>seats, as others have been removed from those 
     <lb/>seats before. (Hear, hear.) While money 
     <lb/>contributed by the west is spent in the east, 
     <lb/>we insist that the improvements necessary for 
     <lb/>the prosperity of Upper Canada should also 
     <lb/>receive the attention of the Government ; and 
     <lb/>there is not a man in Upper Canada who does 
     <lb/>not see the necessity of having our navigation 
     <lb/>improved and a sufficient channel for sea<lb break="no"/>going vessels made to the seaboard. If this 
     <lb/>is attended to, there will not be so much 
     <lb/>to complain of about the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>road being built, although we should like to 
     <lb/>have it built at a cheaper rate. In conclusion, 
     <lb/>I would say, that notwithstanding all the 
     <lb/>objections I may have to details—yet, in view 
     <lb/>of the relations in which we stand to the  
     <lb/>neighboring country—the urgency of the 
     <lb/>defence question, and the threatening aspect 
     <lb/>generally of our present position, I take upon 
     <lb/>myself, though with great reluctance, the 
     <lb/>responsibility of voting for this scheme.
