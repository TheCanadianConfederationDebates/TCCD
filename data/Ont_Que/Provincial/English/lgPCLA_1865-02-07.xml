<!--<p>
     their future acts. They would also observe 
     <lb/>
     that all formerly connected with the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk were urging this scheme forward. He 
     <lb/>
     then accused the Government of bad faith in 
     <lb/>
     bringing down these resolutions, instead of a 
     <lb/>
     measure simply for the Canadas; that the 
     <lb/>
     reform party only committed themselves to 
     <lb/>
     the latter scheme when Mr. BROWN entered 
     <lb/>
     the Cabinet, but now it was only secondary. 
     <lb/>
     To bear this out he read the following reso<lb break="no"/>lution adopted by that party :<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>Moved by Mr. HOPE McKENZIE, and second<lb break="no"/>ed by Mr. McGIVERIN— That we approve of the 
     <lb/>
     course which has been pursued by Mr. BROWN in 
     <lb/>
     the negotiations with the Government. and that 
     <lb/>
     we approve of the project of a Federal union of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadas, with provision for its extension to 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces and the North-Western 
     <lb/>
     territory, as one based on which the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     difficulties now existing should be settled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He was not personally opposed to Con<lb break="no"/>federation in itself , but this measure was so 
     <lb/>
     defective that he could not support it, bearing, 
     <lb/>
     as it did, the seeds of decay apparent in its 
     <lb/>
     details. He heartily concurred in the views 
     <lb/>
     expressed recently at Halifax, by a distinguished 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada Statesman—(MR. BROWN):— 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     " On a survey of the whole case, I do think 
     <lb/>
     that there is no doubt as to the high advan<lb break="no"/>tages that would result from a union of all 
     <lb/>
     the colonies, provided that terms of union 
     <lb/>
     could be found just to all the contracting 
     <lb/>
     parties, and so framed as to secure harmony 
     <lb/>
     in the future administration of affairs. But 
     <lb/>
     it were wrong to conceal for a moment that 
     <lb/>
     the whole merit of the scheme of union may 
     <lb/>
     be completely marred by the character of its 
     <lb/>
     details." He asked who would not say that 
     <lb/>
     the details of this measure did not so mar as 
     <lb/>
     to spoil the scheme. If we are to have a Con<lb break="no"/>federation, let it be put upon a proper and 
     <lb/>
     permanent foundation, one that will be of ad<lb break="no"/>vantage to this young and vigorous province, 
     <lb/>
     and he expressed the hope that only such a 
     <lb/>
     scheme would be sanctioned by Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and applause.) 
     <lb/>

     TUESDAY, <hi rendition="simple:italic">February</hi> 7, 1865. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName> rose to continue 
     <lb/>
     the debate on Confederation. He said that 
     <lb/>
     he approached this subject with a certain 
     <lb/>
     amount of diffidence, knowing it was not the 
     <lb/>
     first time he had had the honor of speaking 
     <lb/>
     upon it in the Lower Provinces and elsewhere. 
     <lb/>
     He felt that this was a momentous occasion, 
     <lb/>
     as for anything that he said on this grave 
     <lb/>
     question, he was responsible to his constituents 
     <lb/>
     and the country. Respecting this grave ques<lb break="no"/>tion, it had been said that the TACHÉ-MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD Government had taken upon them<lb break="no"/>selves the solution of a problem which was not 
     <lb/>
     at the time of its formation before the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and had not even been mooted. Those 
     <lb/>
     saying so were ignorant of the parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     history of the past few years. He would briefly 
     <lb/>
     refer to the history of this great question, as 
     <lb/>
     far as it had been brought before the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and country. When the CARTIER-MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD Government was constructed, after 
     <lb/>
     the downfall of the BROWN-DORION Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, a programme of the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     former was laid before Parliament. Among 
     <lb/>
     the subjects contained in this programme of 
     <lb/>
     7th August, 1858, was one referred to in the 
     <lb/>
     following terms: " The late Government felt 
     <lb/>
     themselves bound to carry out the law of the 
     <lb/>
     land respecting the seat of Government, but, in 
     <lb/>
     the face of the recent vote on that subject, the 
     <lb/>
     Administration did not consider themselves 
     <lb/>
     warranted in incurring an expenditure for 
     <lb/>
     the public buildings, until Parliament has had 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity of considering the whole ques<lb break="no"/>tion in all its bearings ; and the expediency of 
     <lb/>
     a Federal Union of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces will be anxiously considered, and 
     <lb/>
     communication with the Home Government 
     <lb/>
     and the Lower Provinces entered into forth<lb break="no"/>with on the subject ; and the result of this 
     <lb/>
     communication will be submitted to Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment at its next session. The Government 
     <lb/>
     will, during the recess, examine into the organ<lb break="no"/>ization and working of the public departments, 
     <lb/>
     and carry out such administrative reforms as 
     <lb/>
     will be conducive to economy and efficiency." 
     <lb/>
     Here was this scheme of a union of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces mentioned in the programme of the 
     <lb/>
     CARTIER-MACDONALD Government, in 1858. 
     <lb/>
     He merely quoted this passage to show that 
     <lb/>
     neither Parliament nor the country was now 
     <lb/>
     taken by surprise with regard to this scheme. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We had had general and spe<lb break="no"/>cial elections since 1858, and to pretend that 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="54" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0054.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">54</fw>
           

     this subject, which had been so often canvassed, 
     <lb/>
     was new to the country, was to assert an un<lb break="no"/>truth. At the close of that session, Sir EDMUND 
     <lb/>
     HEAD, in his Speech proroguing Parliament, 
     <lb/>
     made use of the following language :—" I 
     <lb/>
     propose, in the course of the recess, to 
     <lb/>
     communicate with Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and with the Governments of the sister 
     <lb/>
     colonies, on another matter of very great im<lb break="no"/>portance. I am desirous of inviting them to 
     <lb/>
     discuss with us the principles on which a bond 
     <lb/>
     of a federal character, uniting the Provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British North America, may perhaps hereafter 
     <lb/>
     be practicable." In accordance  with that an<lb break="no"/>nouncement of policy, a deputation was sent to 
     <lb/>
     England, composed of his then colleagues, 
     <lb/>
     Hons. Messrs. GALT and Ross and himself. 
     <lb/>
     We pressed the matter before the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government, whom we asked to authorize a 
     <lb/>
     meeting of delegates from the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Governments, to consider this sub<lb break="no"/>ject and report upon it, said report to be com<lb break="no"/>municated to the Colonial Secretary. Of 
     <lb/>
     course we wanted, at that time, to act with the 
     <lb/>
     sanction and approval of the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. We pressed the matter as strongly as 
     <lb/>
     we could before it. Of all the provinces that 
     <lb/>
     responded to the call of the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, Newfoundland, he thought, was the only 
     <lb/>
     one which professed her readiness to appoint 
     <lb/>
     delegates  when the opportune moment arrived. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)  Although the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     were not opposed to Confederation, still, as the 
     <lb/>
     question had not been brought conspicuously 
     <lb/>
     before their people, they did not like then to 
     <lb/>
     join in the measure and in the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     which the Canadian delegates had urged upon 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government in 1858. At this 
     <lb/>
     time the Canadian Delegates had a duty to 
     <lb/>
     perform towards the illustrious Administrator 
     <lb/>
     of the Government, Sir E. HEAD, to fulfil the 
     <lb/>
     promise he had made, on proroguing Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, by pressing the measure upon the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Imperial Administration. The 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government also kept its promise 
     <lb/>
     to report to the House the result of the 
     <lb/>
     mission to England, at the next session of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. The hon. gentleman here read 
     <lb/>
     the despatch dated October, 1858, which was 
     <lb/>
     transmitted to the Imperial Government, set<lb break="no"/>ting forth the sectional difficulties which had 
     <lb/>
     arisen between Upper and Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     principally on account of the former' s demand 
     <lb/>
     for increased representation in Parliament, on 
     <lb/>
     the ground of its much larger population. 
     <lb/>
     Every one who knew anything of his past pub<lb break="no"/>lic course was aware that he was opposed to 
     <lb/>
     the principle of representation by population 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     while Upper and Lower Canada were under 
     <lb/>
     one Government. He did not regret his oppo<lb break="no"/>sition. If such a measure had been passed, 
     <lb/>
     what would have been the consequence ? There 
     <lb/>
     would have been constant political warfare be<lb break="no"/>tween Upper and Lower Canada. True it was 
     <lb/>
     that the members from Upper Canada, being 
     <lb/>
     in the majority, it might have been imagined 
     <lb/>
     they would have carried everything before 
     <lb/>
     them ; but as far as justice to Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     was concerned, such might not have been the 
     <lb/>
     case. The consequence of representation by 
     <lb/>
     population would have been that one territory 
     <lb/>
     would have governed another, and this fact 
     <lb/>
     would have presented itself session after ses<lb break="no"/>sion in the House, and day after day in 
     <lb/>
     the public prints. (Hear, hear.) The mo<lb break="no"/>ment this principle had been conceded as the 
     <lb/>
     governing element, it would have initiated 
     <lb/>
     between the two provinces a warfare which 
     <lb/>
     would have been unremitting. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     He wished that Upper Canada should un<lb break="no"/>derstand him in this matter. He was ac<lb break="no"/>cused of being opposed to Upper Canada's 
     <lb/>
     rights, because during fifteen or twenty years 
     <lb/>
     he had to oppose his honorable friend the 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council (Hon. MR. BROWN) . 
     <lb/>
     His honorable colleague took the ground that 
     <lb/>
     representation should be arranged according 
     <lb/>
     to population in each section of the prov<lb break="no"/>ince. He (Hon. MR. CARTIER) had resisted 
     <lb/>
     that position, believing that the moment such 
     <lb/>
     a principle was applied, his honorable friend, 
     <lb/>
     who, no doubt, wanted to maintain the peace<lb break="no"/>ful government of the country, would have 
     <lb/>
     been disappointed in his wish. It would have 
     <lb/>
     given rise to one of the bitterest struggles 
     <lb/>
     between the two provinces that ever took place 
     <lb/>
     between two nations. He did not mean to 
     <lb/>
     say that the majority from Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     would have tyrannized over Lower Canada ; 
     <lb/>
     but the idea that Upper Canada, as a terri<lb break="no"/>tory, had the preponderence in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment by a large number of representatives, 
     <lb/>
     would have been sufficient to generate that 
     <lb/>
     sectional strife to which he had alluded. In 
     <lb/>
     1858 he first saw that representation by 
     <lb/>
     population, though unsuited for application as a 
     <lb/>
     governing principle as between the two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, would not involve the same objection if 
     <lb/>
     other partners were drawn in by a federation. 
     <lb/>
     In a struggle between two—one a weak, and 
     <lb/>
     the other a strong party—the weaker could not 
     <lb/>
     but be overcome ; but if three parties were 
     <lb/>
     concerned, the stronger would not have the 
     <lb/>
     same advantage ; as when it was seen by the 
     <lb/>
     third that there was too much strength on one 
     <lb/>
     side, the third would club with the  weaker 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="55" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0055.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">55</fw>
          
     combatant to resist the big fighter.  (Cheers 
     <lb/>
     and laughter.) He did not oppose the 
     <lb/>
     principle of representation by population 
     <lb/>
     from an unwillingness  to do justice to 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada. He took this ground, how<lb break="no"/>ever, that when justice was done to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, it was his duty to see that no injustice 
     <lb/>
     was done to Lower Canada. He did not entertain 
     <lb/>
     the slightest apprehension that Lower Canada's 
     <lb/>
     rights were in the least jeopardized by the provi<lb break="no"/>sion that in the General Legislature the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians of Lower Canada would have a 
     <lb/>
     smaller number of representatives than all the 
     <lb/>
     other origins combined. It would be seen by the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions that in the questions which would 
     <lb/>
     be submitted to the General Parliament there 
     <lb/>
     could be no danger to the rights and privi<lb break="no"/>leges of either French Canadians, Scotchmen, 
     <lb/>
     Englishmen or Irishmen. Questions of com<lb break="no"/>merce, of international communication, and 
     <lb/>
     all matters of general interest, would be dis<lb break="no"/>cussed and determined in the General Legis<lb break="no"/>lature ; but in the exercise of the functions 
     <lb/>
     of the General Government, no one could ap<lb break="no"/>prehend that anything could be enacted which 
     <lb/>
     would harm or do injustice to persons of any 
     <lb/>
     nationality. He did not intend to go into 
     <lb/>
     the details of the question of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     but merely to bring before the House the 
     <lb/>
     most conspicuous arguments in order to induce 
     <lb/>
     members to accept the resolutions submitted 
     <lb/>
     by the Government. Confederation was, as 
     <lb/>
     it were, at this moment almost forced upon 
     <lb/>
     us. We could not shut our eyes to what was 
     <lb/>
     going on beyond the lines, where a great 
     <lb/>
     struggle was going on between two Confedera<lb break="no"/>cies, at one time forming but one Confederacy. 
     <lb/>
     We saw that a government, established not 
     <lb/>
     more than 80 years ago, had not been able to 
     <lb/>
     keep together the family of states which had 
     <lb/>
     broke up four or five years since. We could 
     <lb/>
     not deny that the struggle now in progress 
     <lb/>
     must necessarily influence our political exist<lb break="no"/>ence. We did not know what would be the 
     <lb/>
     result of that great war—whether it would 
     <lb/>
     end in the establishment of two Confederacies 
     <lb/>
     or in one as before. However, we had to do 
     <lb/>
     with five colonies, inhabited by men of the 
     <lb/>
     same sympathies and interests, and in order 
     <lb/>
     to become a great nation they required only 
     <lb/>
     to be brought together under one General 
     <lb/>
     Government. The matter resolved itself into 
     <lb/>this, either we must obtain British North 
     <lb/>American Confederation or be absorbed in an 
     <lb/>American Confederation. (Hear, hear, and 
     <lb/>dissent.) Some entertained the opinion that 
     <lb/>it was unnecessary to have British North 
     <lb/>American Confederation to prevent absorption 
     <lb/>
         

    
            <cb/>
          
     into the vortex of American Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Such parties were mistaken. We knew the 
     <lb/>
     policy of England towards us—that she was 
     <lb/>
     determined to help and support us in any 
     <lb/>
    struggle with our neighbors. The British  
     <lb/>Provinces, separated as at present, could not 
     <lb/>defend themselves alone, and the question 
     <lb/>resolved itself into this : shall the whole 
     <lb/>strength of the empire be concentrated into 
     <lb/>Prince Edward Island, or Canada, as the case 
     <lb/>may be, in case of a war with the United 
     <lb/>States—or shall the provinces be left to fight 
     <lb/>single-handed, disunited ? We were not suf<lb break="no"/>ficiently united. We had our duties, with 
     <lb/>regard to England, to perform. In order to 
     <lb/>secure the exercise of her power in our defence 
     <lb/>we must help her ourselves. We could not do 
     <lb/>this satisfactorily or effciently unless we had 
     <lb/>a Confederation. When all united, the enemy 
     <lb/>would know that, if he attacked any part of 
     <lb/>those provinces—Prince Edward Island or 
     <lb/>Canada—he would have to encounter the com<lb break="no"/>bined strength of the empire. Canada, sepa<lb break="no"/>rate, would be, although comparatively strong 
     <lb/>in population and wealth, in a dangerous posi<lb break="no"/>tion should a war ensue. When we had 
     <lb/>organized our good defensive force, and united 
     <lb/>for mutual protection, England would send 
     <lb/>freely here both men and treasure for our 
     <lb/>defence. (Cheers) He had stated before 
     <lb/>audiences in the Lower Provinces that, as 
     <lb/>far as territory, population and wealth were 
     <lb/>concerned, Canada was stronger than any 
     <lb/>of the other provinces, but at the same 
     <lb/>time was wanting in one element necessary 
     <lb/>to national greatness—the maritime one ; 
     <lb/>and that, owing to the large trade and com<lb break="no"/>merce of Canada, extensive communication 
     <lb/>with Great Britain at all seasons was abso<lb break="no"/>lutely necessary. Twenty years ago our com<lb break="no"/>merce for the year could be managed by com<lb break="no"/>munication with Great Britain in the summer 
     <lb/>months only. At present, however, this system 
     <lb/>was insuffcient, and for winter communication 
     <lb/>with the sea-board we were left to the caprice 
     <lb/>of our American neighbors, through whose 
     <lb/>territory we must pass. He had also alluded 
     <lb/>to the bonding system, which if the Americans 
     <lb/>were to withdraw, Canada would be left in 
     <lb/>winter without any winter harbors. Canada, 
     <lb/>having two or three elements of national 
     <lb/>greatness—territory and population—wanted 
     <lb/>the maritime element ; and as he had said,<lb break="no"/>the Lower Provinces had this element and a 
     <lb/>sea-board, but not not a back country or large 
     <lb/>population, which Canada possessed,—and for 
     <lb/>the mutual benefit and prosperity of all the 
     <lb/>provinces, all these elements ought to be united 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="56" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0056.jpg"/>

     together. Those who pretended that the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces would be in as safe 
     <lb/>
     a position, remaining separate, while they 
     <lb/>
     belonged to the British Crown, as under 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, were under great misappre<lb break="no"/>hension. Now was the time for us to form a 
     <lb/>
     great nation of the several provinces. Now 
     <lb/>
     was the time to look the matter in the face 
     <lb/>
     and adopt the only safe and prudent course 
     <lb/>
     open to us in the shape of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     He maintained it was necessary for our own 
     <lb/>
     commercial interests, prosperity and efficient 
     <lb/>
     defence. That was what we had now to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss, and not the manner in which Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion was to be brought about, which would be 
     <lb/>
     discussed when the details of the scheme came 
     <lb/>
     up for consideration. At present the question 
     <lb/>
     was : Was Confederation of the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces necessary in order to in<lb break="no"/>crease our strength and power and secure to us 
     <lb/>
     the continuance of the benefits of British 
     <lb/>
     connection ? He had no doubt that the measure 
     <lb/>
     was necessary for those objects. It would be 
     <lb/>
     observed that the English speaking opponents 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme, in Lower Canada, pretended 
     <lb/>
     a fear of this element being absorbed by the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian ; while the opponents, com<lb break="no"/>posed of the latter origin—of men who might 
     <lb/>
     be called the old Papineau Tail—whose sole 
     <lb/>
     idea was annexation to the United States—said 
     <lb/>
     they were afraid of the extinction of French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian nationality in the great Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. The annexation party in Montreal, 
     <lb/>
     including the followers of Mr. JOHN DOUGALL, 
     <lb/>
     the proprietor of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Witness</hi>, opposed the 
     <lb/>
     scheme on the ground of supposed danger to 
     <lb/>
     the British of Lower Canada. The annexa<lb break="no"/>tion party could not, however, be supposed 
     <lb/>
     to be sincere in their opposition to the scheme<lb break="no"/>except in so far as they desired to carry 
     <lb/>
     Canada into the American Union. The 
     <lb/>
     absorption of this province into the United 
     <lb/>
     States had long been contemplated, as would 
     <lb/>
     be seen from the 7th  article in the original 
     <lb/>
     draft of the American Constitution, which he 
     <lb/>
     would read. It was as follows: " Art. 7. 
     <lb/>
     Canada, according to this Confederation and 
     <lb/>
     joining in the measures of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the 
     <lb/>
     advantages of this union ; and shall be equally 
     <lb/>
     with any other of the United States, solemnly 
     <lb/>
     bound to a strict observance of, and obedience 
     <lb/>
     to, these articles ; as shall be also any other 
     <lb/>
     colony which shall be admitted into this Con<lb break="no"/>federacy. The eleven votes in Congress shall 
     <lb/>
     be increased in proportion as the Confederacy 
     <lb/>
     is extended. But, except Canada, no other 
     <lb/>
     colony shall be admitted into the Confederacy 
     <lb/>
            
        <cb/>

     without the assent of eleven or more votes, as 
     <lb/>
     the case may require, by the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     being extended." By that article, no new 
     <lb/>
     state could go into the union except by the 
     <lb/>
     vote of the number of states required to admit 
     <lb/>
     a new partner. But, as regarded  Canada, no 
     <lb/>
     such assent was required ; on knocking at the 
     <lb/>
     door of the union, she would, as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     course, be admitted. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman went on to say that the 
     <lb/>
     papers lately  contained a report of a meeting 
     <lb/>
     at the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Institut Canadien</hi> of Montreal, where 
     <lb/>
     it was resolved that it was for the interests of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada—in the interests of the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, were the province to become a 
     <lb/>
     part of the American Union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName> said that was not the 
     <lb/>
     case. The honorable gentleman had misquoted 
     <lb/>
     what had passed there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. MR. CARTIER</persName> said he was right. 
     <lb/>
     If resolutions were not passed, sentiments were 
     <lb/>
     expressed to that effect. Then the organ of 
     <lb/>
     the Institute—<hi rendition="simple:italic">L'Ordre</hi>, he thought—had set 
     <lb/>
     forth that the interests of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     would be better secured by annexation to the 
     <lb/>
     United States than entering into a Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion with the British American Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     It was no wonder, then, that the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian annexationists betrayed their pur<lb break="no"/>pose in opposition  to British North American 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, and that their English-speaking 
     <lb/>
     colleagues pretended a fear of the rights of 
     <lb/>
     their class being jeopardized under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. We knew their object in this—that 
     <lb/>
     they were aware that as soon as this project 
     <lb/>
     was adopted, there would be no avail in any 
     <lb/>
     cry of separation to form a part of the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Union. (Hear, hear,) There had been 
     <lb/>
     a good deal of fault-finding and complaint as 
     <lb/>
     to the proceedings of the delegates having 
     <lb/>
     been conducted with closed doors. Such a 
     <lb/>
     course was an absolute necessity. Every one 
     <lb/>
     could understand that if all the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     arising among the representatives of the five 
     <lb/>
     colonies, during the Conference, had gone 
     <lb/>
     every morning to the public, it would have 
     <lb/>
     been impossible  for the delegates to continue 
     <lb/>
     to meet, or compromise any of the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     that might be expected to spring up. Be<lb break="no"/>sides, the proceedings of the American Con<lb break="no"/>gress of 1782 was held with closed doors, and 
     <lb/>
     their proceedings were not published while 
     <lb/>
     matters were progressing. With regard to 
     <lb/>
     this, he would quote from a letter of Col. 
     <lb/>
     MASON, a member of the Convention :— " All 
     <lb/>
     communications of the proceedings are for<lb break="no"/>bidden during the sitting of this Convention ; 
     <lb/>
     this, I think, was a necessary precaution to 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="57" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0057.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">57</fw>
          
     prevent misrepresentations or mistakes ; there 
     <lb/>
     being a material difference between the appear<lb break="no"/>ance of a subject in its first crude and indigested 
     <lb/>
     shape and after it shall have been properly 
     <lb/>
     matured and arranged." On the same princi<lb break="no"/>ple the Conference at Quebec very properly 
     <lb/>
     sat with closed doors. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     wished, however, that the British Canadian 
     <lb/>
     public should know the result of our labors 
     <lb/>
     when concluded, and that result the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     and people of Canada had before their con<lb break="no"/>sideration, and it was for them to discuss its 
     <lb/>
     merits. We, on this side of the House<lb break="no"/>the members of the Government and their 
     <lb/>
     supporters—had come to the conclusion that 
     <lb/>
     Federation was desirable and necessary ; and 
     <lb/>
     we were ready to hear the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the other side who necessarily, from 
     <lb/>
     their standing, were supposed to have devoted 
     <lb/>
     their attention to it and appreciated their 
     <lb/>
     position, stating what in their opinion would 
     <lb/>
     be sufficient in order to maintain ourselves as 
     <lb/>
     a British colony on this side of the Atlantic, 
     <lb/>
     and to increase in wealth and power. He was 
     <lb/>
     aware that some members of the House, and a 
     <lb/>
     number of people in Upper Canada, in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada and in the Lower Provinces, were of 
     <lb/>
     opinion that a Legislative Union ought  to 
     <lb/>
     have taken place instead of a Federal Union. 
     <lb/>
     He would say, however, at the outset, that it 
     <lb/>
     was impossible to have one Government to 
     <lb/>
     deal with all the private and local interests 
     <lb/>
     of the several sections of the several provinces 
     <lb/>
     forming the combined whole. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The next question to be considered, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     by those who had set to work to discover a 
     <lb/>
     solution of the difficulties under which we had 
     <lb/>
     labored, was—what was the best and most 
     <lb/>
     practicable mode of bringing the provinces 
     <lb/>
     together, so that particular rights and interests 
     <lb/>
     should be properly guarded and protected ? 
     <lb/>
     No other scheme presented itself but the 
     <lb/>
     Federation system, and that was the project 
     <lb/>
     which now recommended itself to the Par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada. Some parties—through 
     <lb/>
     the press and by other modes— pretended that 
     <lb/>
      it was impossible to carry out Federation, on 
     <lb/>
     account of the differences of races and religions. 
     <lb/>
     Those who took this view of the question 
     <lb/>
     were in error. It was just the reverse. It 
     <lb/>
     was precisely on account of the variety of 
     <lb/>
     races, local interests, &amp;c., that the Federation 
     <lb/>
     system ought to be resorted to, and would be 
     <lb/>
     found to work well. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     were in the habit of seeing in some public 
     <lb/>
     journals, and hearing from some public men, 
     <lb/>
     that it was a great misfortune indeed there 
     <lb/>
     should be a difference of races in this colony 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     —that there should be the distinction of 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian from British Canadian. Now, 
     <lb/>
     he (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) desired on this point to 
     <lb/>
     vindicate the rights, the merits, the usefulness, 
     <lb/>
     so to speak, of those belonging to the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian race. (Hear, hear.) In order to 
     <lb/>
     bring these merits and this usefulness more 
     <lb/>
     prominently before his hearers, it would be 
     <lb/>
     only necessary to allude to the efforts made 
     <lb/>
     by them to sustain British power on this con<lb break="no"/>tinent, and to point out their adherence to 
     <lb/>
     British supremacy in trying times. We were 
     <lb/>
     all conversant with the history of the circum<lb break="no"/>stances which had brought about  the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties between England and her former Ameri<lb break="no"/>can colonies in 1775. Lower Canada,—or 
     <lb/>
     rather he should say, the Province of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     for the colony was not then known by the 
     <lb/>
     name of Canada, but was called the Province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec,—contained the most dense popula<lb break="no"/>tion of any British colony in North America at 
     <lb/>
     that time. The accession of Lower Canada was 
     <lb/>
     of course an object of envy to the other Amer<lb break="no"/>ican colonies, and strenuous efforts were made 
     <lb/>
     by those who had resolved to overthrow British 
     <lb/>
     power on this continent to induce Canada 
     <lb/>
     to ally herself to their cause. As early as 
     <lb/>
     1775   the French Canadians were solemnly 
     <lb/>
     addressed in a proclamation by General WASH<lb break="no"/>INGTON, who called upon them to abandon the 
     <lb/>
     flag of their new masters, inasmuch as they 
     <lb/>
     could not expect anything from those who dif<lb break="no"/>fered from them in language, in religion, in 
     <lb/>
     race, and in sympathies. But what was the 
     <lb/>
     conduct of the French Canadian people under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances—what was the attitude of 
     <lb/>
     the clergy and the seigniors ? It was right in 
     <lb/>
     treating this chapter of our history, to render 
     <lb/>
     justice to whom justice was due, and it was 
     <lb/>
     truth to say that the seigniors, forming , as they 
     <lb/>
     did, the  educated class of our  population at 
     <lb/>
     that early epoch, had fully  understood that 
     <lb/>
     the object and aim of those who appealed to 
     <lb/>
     them was the downfall of the monarchical sys<lb break="no"/>tem in America. (Hear, hear.) A few years 
     <lb/>
     only had elapsed at that time since the trans<lb break="no"/>fer of the country and its population from the 
     <lb/>
     Crown of France to the Crown of Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain ; but even within that brief interval of 
     <lb/>
     time, they were enabled to appreciate the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages of their new position, notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     the fact that they were still struggling and 
     <lb/>
     complaining. The people, as well as the clergy 
     <lb/>
     and aristocracy, had understood that it was 
     <lb/>
     better for them to remain under the English 
     <lb/>
     and Protestant Crown of England, rather than 
     <lb/>
     to become republicans. (Hear, hear.) They 
     <lb/>
     were proof against the insidious offers of 
     <lb/>

     GEORGE WASHINGTON ; and not only so, but 
     <lb/>
     when the Americans came as invaders, they 
     <lb/>
     fought against the armed forces of ARNOLD, 
     <lb/>
     MONTGOMERY and others. (Cheers) At<lb break="no"/>tempts were made to excite hostility to Feder<lb break="no"/>ation on the ground that, under the regime of a 
     <lb/>
     local legislature, the English Protestant minor<lb break="no"/>ity would not be fairly dealt with. He thought 
     <lb/>
     the way in which the French Canadians had 
     <lb/>
     stood by British connection, when there were 
     <lb/>
     but few British in the province, was a proof 
     <lb/>
     that they would not attempt to deal unjustly 
     <lb/>
     now by the British minority, when their num<lb break="no"/>bers were so much greater. On this point, 
     <lb/>
     appealing to the evidence of history, he would 
     <lb/>
     quote from the work which he had already 
     <lb/>
     quoted. At a time when there were, perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     hardly a few hundred English Protestant resi<lb break="no"/>dents in Lower Canada, the address in the 
     <lb/>
     name of WASHINGTON, to which he had already 
     <lb/>
     briefly referred, was circulated throughout 
     <lb/>
     the country by ARNOLD'S invading army. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman here read a number of ex<lb break="no"/>tracts from General WASHINGTON'S proclama<lb break="no"/>tion, addressed to the inhabitants of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     It made the most earnest appeals to the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadians to join the other colonies. "We 
     <lb/>
     rejoice," said General WASHINGTON, " that 
     <lb/>
     our enemies have been deceived with regard to 
     <lb/>
     you ; they have persuaded themselves—they 
     <lb/>
    have even dared to say—that the Canadians 
     <lb/>were not capable of distinguishing between the 
     <lb/>blessings of liberty and the wretchedness of 
     <lb/>slavery ; that gratifying the vanity of a little 
     <lb/>circle of nobility would blind the people of 
     <lb/>Canada. By such artifices they hoped to bend 
     <lb/>you to their views, but they have been de<lb break="no"/>ceived. * * * Come then, my brethern, 
     <lb/>unite with us in an indissoluble union ; let us 
     <lb/>run together to the same goal. * * * 
     <lb/>Incited by these motives, and encouraged by 
     <lb/>the advice of many friends of liberty among 
     <lb/>you, the grand American Congress have sent 
     <lb/>an army into your province, under the com<lb break="no"/>mand of General SCHUYLER—not to plunder but 
     <lb/>to protect you—to animate and bring forth into 
     <lb/>action those sentiments of freedom you have 
     <lb/>disclosed, and which the tools of despotism 
     <lb/>would extinguish through the whole creation. 
     <lb/>To co-operate with this design, and to frustrate 
     <lb/>those cruel and perfidious schemes, which 
     <lb/>would deluge our frontiers with the blood of 
     <lb/>women and children, I have despatched Colonel 
     <lb/>ARNOLD into your country, with a part of the 
     <lb/>army under my command. I have enjoined 
     <lb/>upon him, and I am certain that he will con<lb break="no"/>sider himself, and act as in the country of his 
     <lb/>patrons and best friends. Necessaries and 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     accommodations of every kind which you may 
     <lb/>
     furnish he will thankfully receive and render 
     <lb/>
     the full value. I invite you, therefore, as 
     <lb/>
     friends and brethren, to provide him with 
     <lb/>
     such supplies as your country affords ; and I 
     <lb/>
     pledge myself not only for your safety and se<lb break="no"/>curity, but for an ample compensation. Let 
     <lb/>
     no man desert his habitation—let no one flee 
     <lb/>
     as before an enemy. The cause of America 
     <lb/>
     and of liberty is the cause of every virtuous 
     <lb/>
     American citizen, whatever may be his religion 
     <lb/>
     or descent. The united colonies know no dis<lb break="no"/>tinction but such as slavery, corruption and 
     <lb/>
     arbitrary dominion may create. Come then, 
     <lb/>
     ye generous citizens, range yourselves under 
     <lb/>
     the standard of general liberty—against which 
     <lb/>
     all the force of artifice and tyranny will never 
     <lb/>
     be able to prevail." It appeared by this ad<lb break="no"/>dress that the most tempting offers and promi<lb break="no"/>ses had been made by the republican general ; 
     <lb/>
     but they had failed, nevertheless, to accom<lb break="no"/>plish the desired effect. This, however, was 
     <lb/>
     not the only trait of this nature in the history 
     <lb/>
     of the French Canadian people. There was 
     <lb/>
     another despatch, or rather proclamation, issued 
     <lb/>
     in 1778   by Baron D'ESTAING, commander of 
     <lb/>
     the French fleet, which was acting in aid of 
     <lb/>
     the American revolutionary party. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman read some extracts from 
     <lb/>
     this proclamation, as follows :—" I shall not 
     <lb/>
     ask the military companions of the Marquis Of 
     <lb/>
     LÉVIS, those who shared his glory, who ad<lb break="no"/>mired his talents and genius for war, who loved 
     <lb/>
     his cordiality and frankness, the principal 
     <lb/>
     characteristics of our nobility, whether there 
     <lb/>
     be other names in other nations among which 
     <lb/>
     they would be better pleased to place their own. 
     <lb/>
     Can the Canadians, who saw the brave MONT<lb break="no"/>CALM fall in their defence—can they become 
     <lb/>
     the enemies of his nephews ? Can  they fight 
     <lb/>
     against their former leaders, and arm them<lb break="no"/>selves against their kinsmen ? At the bare men<lb break="no"/>tion of their names, the weapons would fall out 
     <lb/>
     of their hands. I shall not observe to the min<lb break="no"/>isters of the altars, that their evangelic efforts 
     <lb/>
     will require the special protection of Providence, 
     <lb/>
     to prevent faith being diminished by example, 
     <lb/>
     by worldly interest, and by sovereigns whom 
     <lb/>
     force has imposed upon them, and whose poli<lb break="no"/>tical indulgence will be lessened proportionably 
     <lb/>
     as those sovereigns shall have less to fear. I 
     <lb/>
     shall not observe that it is necessary for reli<lb break="no"/>gion that those who preach it should form a 
     <lb/>
     body in the state ; and that in Canada no 
     <lb/>
     other body would be more considered, or have 
     <lb/>
     more power to do good than that of the 
     <lb/>
     priests, taking a part in the Government, 
     <lb/>
     since their respectable conduct has merited the 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="59" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0059.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">59</fw>
          
     confidence of the people. I shall not repre<lb break="no"/>sent to that people, nor to all my countrymen 
     <lb/>
     in general, that a vast monarchy, having the 
     <lb/>
     same religion, the same manners, the same 
     <lb/>
     language, where they find kinsmen, old friends 
     <lb/>
     and brethren, must be an inexhaustible source 
     <lb/>
     of commerce and wealth, more easily acquired 
     <lb/>
     and better secured by their union with power<lb break="no"/>ful neighbors, than with strangers of another 
     <lb/>
     hemisphere, among whom everything is dif<lb break="no"/>ferent, and who, jealous and despotic sover<lb break="no"/>eigns would, sooner or later, treat them as a 
     <lb/>
     conquered people, and doubtless much worse 
     <lb/>
     than their late countrymen, the Americans, 
     <lb/>
     who made them victorious. I shall not urge 
     <lb/>
     to a whole people that to join with the United 
     <lb/>
     States is to secure their own happiness, since 
     <lb/>
     a whole people, when they acquire the right 
     <lb/>
     of thinking and acting for themselves, must 
     <lb/>
     know their own interest. But I will declare, 
     <lb/>
     and I now formally declare in the name of 
     <lb/>
     His Majesty, who has authorized and com<lb break="no"/>manded me to do it, that all his former sub<lb break="no"/>jects in North America, who shall no more 
     <lb/>
     acknowledge the supremacy of Great Britain, 
     <lb/>
     may depend upon his protection and support." 
     <lb/>
     D'ESTAING had appealed to their ancestry and 
     <lb/>
     their prejudices ; he had invoked the names of 
     <lb/>
     LEVIS and MONTCALM, and endeavored to in<lb break="no"/>fluence their clergy ; but the French Canadians 
     <lb/>
     understood their position too well. If they had 
     <lb/>
     their institutions, their language and their 
     <lb/>
     religion intact to-day, it was precisely because 
     <lb/>
     of their adherence to the British Crown. Had 
     <lb/>
     they yielded to the appeals of WASHINGTON 
     <lb/>
     and Baron D'ESTAING, it is probable that there 
     <lb/>
     would not have been now a vestige of British 
     <lb/>
     power on this continent. But, with the dis<lb break="no"/>appearance of British power, they too would 
     <lb/>
     have  disappeared as French Canadians. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) These historical facts taught that 
     <lb/>
     there should be a mutual feeling of gratitude 
     <lb/>
     from the French Canadians towards the 
     <lb/>
     British, and from the British towards the 
     <lb/>
      French Canadians, for our present position, 
     <lb/>
     that Canada is still a British colony. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) He had had occasion, a moment ago, 
     <lb/>
     to refer to the French Canadian clergy in con<lb break="no"/>nection with D'ESTAING'S address, and he 
     <lb/>
     would say this, to their honor and credit, that, 
     <lb/>
     if to-day Canada was a portion of the British 
     <lb/>
     Empire, it was due to the conservatism of the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian clergy. (Cheers) It was 
     <lb/>
     a pleasure to him thus to be able to quote from 
     <lb/>
     these old documents proofs of the honor, 
     <lb/>
     loyalty, and liberality of the French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     people. He (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) was as devoid 
     <lb/>
     of prejudice as any honorable gentleman in this 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
     
     House ; but when he heard or read the state<lb break="no"/>ments occasionally made, that there was some 
     <lb/>
     danger that, under the Federation system, the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians would have too much power, 
     <lb/>
     and that the power thus obtained would be 
     <lb/>
     used to the prejudice of the British and Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minority—the history of the past, in 
     <lb/>
     many instances, was the best reply to such 
     <lb/>
     attacks. (Hear, hear.) Baron D'ESTAING 
     <lb/>
     issued his tempting proclamation in 1778, and 
     <lb/>
     it was sent into Canada frequently afterwards, 
     <lb/>
     and circulated at the instigation of ROCHAM<lb break="no"/>BEAU and LAFAYETTE; but our clergy and 
     <lb/>
     our aristocracy, the leaders of our people in 
     <lb/>
     these days, saw that it was not their interest 
     <lb/>
     to cast their lot with the democratic element<lb break="no"/>they knew the hollowness of democracy. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) We found ourselves at the present 
     <lb/>
     day discussing the question of the Federation 
     <lb/>
     of the British North American Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     while the great Federation of the United States 
     <lb/>
     of America was broken up and divided against 
     <lb/>
     itself. There was, however, this important 
     <lb/>
     difference to be observed in considering the 
     <lb/>
     action of the two peoples. They had founded 
     <lb/>
     Federation for the purpose of carrying out and 
     <lb/>
     perpetuating democracy on this continent ; 
     <lb/>
     but we, who had the benefit of being able to 
     <lb/>
     contemplate republicanism in action during a 
     <lb/>
     period of  eighty years, saw its defects, and felt 
     <lb/>
     convinced  that purely democratic institutions 
     <lb/>
     could not be conducive to the peace and pros<lb break="no"/>perity of nations. We were not now discussing 
     <lb/>
     the great problem presented to our considera<lb break="no"/>tion, in order to propagate democratic princi<lb break="no"/>ples. Our attempt was for the purpose of form<lb break="no"/>ing a Federation with a view of perpetuating the 
     <lb/>
     monarchical element. The distinction, there<lb break="no"/>fore, between ourselves and our neighbors was 
     <lb/>
     just this :—In our Federation the monarchical 
     <lb/>
     principle would form the leading feature, while 
     <lb/>
     on the other side of the lines, judging by the 
     <lb/>
     past history and present condition of the 
     <lb/>
     country, the ruling power was the will of the 
     <lb/>
     mob, the rule of the populace. Every per<lb break="no"/>son who had conversed with the most intelli<lb break="no"/>gent American statesmen and writers must 
     <lb/>
     have learned that they all admitted that the 
     <lb/>
     governmental powers had become too extend<lb break="no"/>ed, owing to the introduction of universal 
     <lb/>
     suffrage, and mob rule had consequently sup<lb break="no"/>planted legitimate authority ; and we now saw 
     <lb/>
     the sad spectacle of a country torn by civil 
     <lb/>
     war, and brethren fighting against brethren. 
     <lb/>
     The question for us to ask ourselves was this: 
     <lb/>
     Shall we be content to remain separate—shall 
     <lb/>
     we be content to maintain a mere provin<lb break="no"/>cial existence, when, by combining together, 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="60" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0060.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">60</fw>
        
     we could become a great nation? It had 
     <lb/>
     never yet been the good fortune of any group 
     <lb/>
     of communities to secure national greatness 
     <lb/>
     with such facility. In past ages, warriors had 
     <lb/>
     struggled for years for the addition to their 
     <lb/>
     country of a single province. We had too, 
     <lb/>
     for instance, in our own days, the case of 
     <lb/>
     NAPOLEON III, who, after great expenditure 
     <lb/>
     of blood and treasure in the Italian difficulty, 
     <lb/>
     had acquired Savoy and Nice, by which he 
     <lb/>
     had obtained an addition of nearly one mil<lb break="no"/>lion inhabitants to France—only one million 
     <lb/>
     souls, and if any person were for a moment 
     <lb/>
     to make a calculation of the value of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces acquired on one side, and the great 
     <lb/>
     cost on the other, he would at once see the 
     <lb/>
     great disproportion between the one and the 
     <lb/>
     other, and so ascertain the fact that the ter<lb break="no"/>ritory  acquired did not compensate the outlay. 
     <lb/>
     Here, in British North America, we had five 
     <lb/>
     different communities inhabiting five separate 
     <lb/>
     colonies. We had the same sympathies, and 
     <lb/>
     we all desired to live under the British Crown. 
     <lb/>
     We had our commercial interests besides. It 
     <lb/>
     was of no use whatever that New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia and Newfoundland should have 
     <lb/>
     their several custom houses against our trade, 
     <lb/>
    or that we should have custom houses against 
     <lb/>the trade of those provinces. In ancient times, 
     <lb/>the manner in which a nation grew up was 
     <lb/>different from that of the present day. Then 
     <lb/>the first weak settlement increased into a vil<lb break="no"/>lage, which, by turns, became a town and a 
     <lb/>city, and the nucleus of a nation. It was 
     <lb/>not so in modern times. Nations were now 
     <lb/>formed by the agglomeration of communities 
     <lb/>having kindred interests and sympathies. 
     <lb/>Such was our case at the present moment. 
     <lb/>Objection had been taken to the scheme now 
     <lb/>under consideration, because of the words 
     <lb/>" new nationality." Now, when we were 
     <lb/>united together, if union were attained, we 
     <lb/>would form a political nationality with which 
     <lb/>neither the national origin, nor the religion of 
     <lb/>any individual, would interfere. It was la<lb break="no"/>mented by some that we had this diversity of 
     <lb/>races, and hopes were expressed that this dis<lb break="no"/>tinctive feature would cease. The idea of unity 
     <lb/>of races was utopian—it was impossible. Dis<lb break="no"/>tinctions of this kind would always exist. Dis<lb break="no"/>similarity, in fact, appeared to be the order of 
     <lb/>the physical world and of the moral world, as 
     <lb/>well as in the political world. But with regard 
     <lb/>to the objection based on this fact, to the 
     <lb/>effect that a great nation could not be formed 
     <lb/>because Lower Canada was in great part 
     <lb/>French and Catholic, and Upper Canada was 
     <lb/>British and Protestant,and the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
            
     were mixed, it was futile and worthless in the 
     <lb/>
     extreme. Look, for instance, at the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, inhabited as it was by three great 
     <lb/>
     races. (Hear, hear.) Had the diversity of 
     <lb/>
     race impeded the glory,  the progress, the wealth 
     <lb/>
     of England ? Had  they not rather each con<lb break="no"/>tributed their share to the greatness of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire ? Of the glories of the senate, the 
     <lb/>
     field, and the ocean, of the successes of trade 
     <lb/>
     and commerce, how much was contributed by 
     <lb/>
     the combined talents, energy and courage of 
     <lb/>
     the three races together ? (Cheers.) In our 
     <lb/>
     own Federation we should have Catholic and 
     <lb/>
     Protestant, English, French, Irish and Scotch, 
     <lb/>
     and each by his efforts and his success would 
     <lb/>
     increase the prosperity and glory of the new 
     <lb/>
     Confederacy.  (Hear, hear.) He viewed the 
     <lb/>
     diversity of races in British North America in 
     <lb/>
     this way : we were of different races, not for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of warring against each other, but 
     <lb/>
     in order to compete and emulate for the gen<lb break="no"/>eral welfare. (Cheers.) We could not do 
     <lb/>
     away with the distinctions of race. We could 
     <lb/>
     not legislate for the disappearance of the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians from American soil, but British 
     <lb/>
     and French Canadians alike could appreciate 
     <lb/>
     and understand their position relative to each 
     <lb/>
     other. They were placed like great families 
     <lb/>
     beside each other, and their contact produced 
     <lb/>
     a healthy spirit of emulation. It was a benefit 
     <lb/>
     rather than otherwise that we had a diversity 
     <lb/>
     of races. Of course, the difficulty, it would be 
     <lb/>
     said, would be to deal fairly by the minority. 
     <lb/>
     In Upper Canada the Catholics  would find 
     <lb/>
     themselves in a minority ; in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     the Protestants would be in a minority, while 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces were divided. Under 
     <lb/>
     such circumstances, would any one pretend 
     <lb/>
     that either the local or general governments 
     <lb/>
     would sanction any injustice. What would be 
     <lb/>
     the consequence, even supposing any such thing 
     <lb/>
     were attempted by any one of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments ? It would be censured everywhere. 
     <lb/>
     Whether it came from Upper Canada or from 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, any attempt to deprive the 
     <lb/>
     minority of their rights would be at once 
     <lb/>
     thwarted. Under the Federation system, grant<lb break="no"/>ing to the control of the General Government 
     <lb/>
     these large questions of general interest in 
     <lb/>
     which the differences of race or religion had 
     <lb/>
     no place, it could not be pretended that the 
     <lb/>
     rights of either race or religion could be 
     <lb/>
     invaded at all. We were to have a Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Parliament to deal with the matters 
     <lb/>
     of defence, tariff, excise, public works, and 
     <lb/>
     these matters absorbed all individual interest. 
     <lb/>
     Now, he would ask those self-styled national<lb break="no"/>ists who accused him of bartering fifty-eight 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="61" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0061.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">61</fw>
           
     counties in Lower Canada to John Bull, and 
     <lb/>
     his honorable colleague beside him (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BROWN)—he would ask them, under what 
     <lb/>
     supposition could they think it possible for 
     <lb/>
     any injustice to be done to the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians by the General Government ? (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) He came now to the subject of Local 
     <lb/>
     Governments. We could easily understand 
     <lb/>
     how a feeling against the Federation project 
     <lb/>
     was raised in the minds of a few of the British 
     <lb/>
     residents of Lower Canada by fears of such 
     <lb/>
     difficulties as those which occurred in the days 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. PAPINEAU, relative to the passing of 
     <lb/>
     laws relating to commercial matters. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) These difficulties had been of a 
     <lb/>
     very inconvenient nature, Mr. PAPINEAU not 
     <lb/>
     being a commercial man, and not understand<lb break="no"/>ing the importance of these measures. He 
     <lb/>
     considered Mr. PAPINEAU was right in the 
     <lb/>
     struggle he maintained against the oligarchy 
     <lb/>
     at that time in power ; but he had never ap<lb break="no"/>proved of the course he took with reference to 
     <lb/>
     commercial matters, and in opposition to mea<lb break="no"/>sures for the improvement of the country. 
     <lb/>
     But this precedent could not be urged as an 
     <lb/>
     objection to Federation, inasmuch as it 
     <lb/>
     would be for the General Government to deal 
     <lb/>
     with our commercial matters. There could 
     <lb/>
     be no reason for well-grounded fear that the 
     <lb/>
     minority could be made to suffer by means of 
     <lb/>
     any laws affecting the rights of property. If 
     <lb/>
     any such enactments were passed, they would 
     <lb/>
     fall upon the whole community. But even 
     <lb/>
     supposing such a thing did occur, there was a 
     <lb/>
     remedy provided under the proposed Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. The magnitude of the scheme now sub<lb break="no"/>mitted was, perhaps, the reason why those who 
     <lb/>
     had not made themselves conversant with the 
     <lb/>
     question felt some apprehension in contem<lb break="no"/>plating it ; but, when we came to discuss it 
     <lb/>
     clause by clause, he would be ready to state 
     <lb/>
     that no interest would be harmed in any way 
     <lb/>
     if Federation took place. It was true that op<lb break="no"/>position was being offered in Montreal, by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     JOHN DOUGALL, of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Witness</hi>. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And, while referring to the opponents 
     <lb/>
     of Federation, he could not help adverting to 
     <lb/>
    the strange manner in which extremes met 
     <lb/>and worked in unison to oppose Federation. 
     <lb/>(Laughter.) For instance, we had the party 
     <lb/>who formerly composed what might be styled 
     <lb/>Mr. PAPINEAU'S Tail—the extreme democratic 
     <lb/>party—joined with Mr. DOUGALL'S Tail. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear, cheers, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:PERR2">MR. PERRAULT</persName> —And members of the 
     <lb/>clergy oppose it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. MR. CARTIER</persName> said the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman was mistaken. The clergy were 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     for it. But the honorable gentleman would 
     <lb/>
     have an opportunity of speaking afterwards. 
     <lb/>
     This scheme, he repeated, met with the ap<lb break="no"/>proval of all moderate men. The extreme 
     <lb/>
     men, the socialists, democrats and annexation<lb break="no"/>ists were opposed to it. The French Cana<lb break="no"/>dian opponents of the project were, it ap<lb break="no"/>peared, afraid that their religious rights would 
     <lb/>
     suffer under the new arrangement. Fancy 
     <lb/>
     the celebrated <hi rendition="simple:italic">Institut Canadien</hi>, of Mont<lb break="no"/>real, under the lead of citizen BLANCHET, 
     <lb/>
     taking religion under their protection! 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. DOUGALL</persName> loudly pro<lb break="no"/>claimed that the British Protestant minority 
     <lb/>
     would be entirely placed at the mercy of 
     <lb/>
     the French Canadians. He (Hon. Mr. CAR<lb break="no"/>TIER) thought the arguments of the young 
     <lb/>
     French gentlemen belonging to the national 
     <lb/>
     democratic party who cried out that their re<lb break="no"/>ligion and nationality would be destroyed, 
     <lb/>
     ought in all reason to be sufficient to satisfy 
     <lb/>
     the scruples and calm the fears of Mr. DOU<lb break="no"/>GALL. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">True Witness</hi>, which was also one 
     <lb/>
     of the enemies of the scheme, said that if it 
     <lb/>
     were adopted the French Canadians were 
     <lb/>
     doomed ; while his brother in violence, the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Witness</hi>, said that the Protestants were doomed. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) At a meeting re<lb break="no"/>cently held in Montreal on the subject, he (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. CARTIER.) observed that Mr. CHERRIER 
     <lb/>
     had enrolled himself among the enemies of the 
     <lb/>
     project. Well, this fine, quiet, old gentleman 
     <lb/>
     announced that he had come out of his politi<lb break="no"/>cal retirement for the purpose of opposing Fe<lb break="no"/>deration. All he (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) could say 
     <lb/>
     was that he never knew Mr. CHERRIER was a 
     <lb/>
     strong politician. However, it appeared that 
     <lb/>
     he had come out once more on the political 
     <lb/>
     stage for the purpose of opposing this villain<lb break="no"/>ous scheme, which was intended to destroy the 
     <lb/>
     nationality and religion of the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians—all brought about by that confounded 
     <lb/>
     CARTIER ! (Laughter and cheers.) Allusion 
     <lb/>
     had been made to the opinion of the clergy. 
     <lb/>
     Well, he would say that the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     clergy was for Confederation. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Those who were high in authority, as well as 
     <lb/>
     those who occupied more humble positions, 
     <lb/>
     were in favor of Federation, not only because 
     <lb/>
     they saw in it so much security for all they 
     <lb/>
     held dear, but because it was just to their 
     <lb/>
     Protestant fellow-subjects as well, because they 
     <lb/>
     were opposed to political bickering and strife. 
     <lb/>
     This opposition to a state of political dissen<lb break="no"/>sion and trouble was the general feeling of the 
     <lb/>
     clergy, and because they saw in Confederation 
     <lb/>
     a solution of those difficulties which had exist<lb break="no"/>ed for some time, due regard being had to just 
     <lb/>

     rights, they were favorable to the project.<lb break="no"/>The fact, however, was that when we saw such 
     <lb/>
     extreme opponents as Mr. CLERK, of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">True 
     <lb/>
     Witness</hi>, Mr. DOUGALL, of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Witness</hi>, and 
     <lb/>
     the young gentlemen of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Institut Canadien</hi> 
     <lb/>
     combined to resist Confederation, because each 
     <lb/>
     party argued it would produce the most widely 
     <lb/>
     different results—we might look upon this 
     <lb/>
     fact, he repeated, as one of the strongest argu<lb break="no"/>ments in favor of Confederation. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We had, on the other hand, all the moderate 
     <lb/>
     men, all that was respectable and intelligent, 
     <lb/>
     including the clergy, favorable to Federation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and oh, oh.) He did not, of 
     <lb/>
     course, mean to say that there were not re<lb break="no"/>spectable opponents to the project—what he 
     <lb/>
     did mean, however, was that it met general 
     <lb/>
     approval from the classes referred to. He 
     <lb/>
     was opposed, he might as well state most 
     <lb/>
     distinctly, to the democratic system which 
     <lb/>
     obtained in the United States. In this coun<lb break="no"/>try of British North America we should have 
     <lb/>
     a distinct form of government, the character<lb break="no"/>istic of which would be to possess the monar<lb break="no"/>chical element. When we had Confederation 
     <lb/>
     secured, there was not the least doubt but 
     <lb/>
     that our Government would be more respect<lb break="no"/>able—that it would have more prestige, and 
     <lb/>
     command more respect from our neighbours. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The great want under the 
     <lb/>
     American form—the point which they all 
     <lb/>
     admitted formed the great defect—was the 
     <lb/>
     absence of some respectable executive element. 
     <lb/>
     How was the head of the United States Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment chosen ? Candidates came forward, 
     <lb/>
     and of course each one was abused and villified 
     <lb/>
     as corrupt, ignorant, incapable and unworthy 
     <lb/>
     by the opposite party. One of them attained 
     <lb/>
     the presidential chair ; but even while in that 
     <lb/>
    position he was not respected by those who  
     <lb/>had opposed his election, and who tried to 
     <lb/>make him appear the most corrupt and con<lb break="no"/>temptible being in creation. Such a system 
     <lb/>could not produce an executive head who would 
     <lb/>command respect. Under the British system, 
     <lb/>ministers might be abused and assailed ; but 
     <lb/>that abuse never reached the Sovereign. 
     <lb/>Whether we were made a kingdom or a vice<lb break="no"/>royalty—whatever name or grade was assigned 
     <lb/>to us—we would undoubtedly have additional 
     <lb/>prestige. He would now conclude his remarks  
     <lb/>by asking honorable gentlemen to consider 
     <lb/>well this scheme. It was his hope, his cher<lb break="no"/>ished hope, that it would be adopted by the 
     <lb/>House. The time was opportune, as his hon<lb break="no"/>orable colleague (Atty. Gen. MACDONALD)had 
     <lb/>so ably stated last evening ; the  opportunity 
     <lb/>might never offer itself again in such a facile 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     and propitious manner. We knew we had, in 
     <lb/>
     all our proceedings, the approbation of the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government. So if these resolutions 
     <lb/>
     were adopted by Canada, as he had no doubt 
     <lb/>
     they would, and by the other Colonial Legis<lb break="no"/>latures, the Imperial Government would be 
     <lb/>
     called upon to pass a measure which would 
     <lb/>
     have for its effect to give a strong central or 
     <lb/>
     general government and local governments, 
     <lb/>
     which would at once secure and guard the 
     <lb/>
     persons, the properties and the civil and reli<lb break="no"/>gious rights belonging to the population of 
     <lb/>
     each section. (Loud cheers.)

     previously been favored when I have ad<lb break="no"/>dressed it on subjects relating to the commer<lb break="no"/>cial and financial interests of this province ;

     for I am now required to follow the very able

     and eloquent speeches of the two Attorneys

     <lb/>
     as none were more able than those gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     to discuss, the most important political and 
     <lb/>
     philosophical questions which are involved in 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation of the British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ican colonies ; and the material interests of 
     <lb/>
     the country upon which it is my province this

     night to dwell, though unquestionably those 
     <lb/>
     which are intended to be served through the 
     <lb/>
     political alterations we have to consider, are, 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless, likely to prove tedious to the

     <lb/>
     however, imperatively called for when we are 
     <lb/>

     There is one advantage which I feel that I

     enjoy on this occasion, and it is that this

     House is not called upon, in dealing with the 
     <lb/>
     commercial and financial interests involved in 
     <lb/>
     the proposed changes, to consider the form 
     <lb/>
     or mode of government by which such inter<lb break="no"/>ests are to be promoted. It makes little differ<lb break="no"/>ence to the consideration of this branch of 
     <lb/>
     the subject whether the Constitution of the

     new Government be that of a Legislative or

     Federal Union—the points with which I am

     about to deal, are those which concern the

     public at large, and bear no reference to what

     may be the creed, nationality or language of

     <lb/>
     those connected with the trade, resources

     to them all ?

     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Thirdly</hi>.—Are the measures proposed in

            </p>

            <p>
     In dealing with the first question, whether 
     <lb/>
     the material interests of the provinces will be 
     <lb/>
     promoted by their union, it may be well for 
     <lb/>
     me to offer to the House some few remarks 
     <lb/>
     as to the resources of British North America. 
     <lb/>
     Possessing as we do, in the far western part of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, perhaps the most fertile wheat-growing 
     <lb/>
     tracts on this continent,—in central and eastern 
     <lb/>
     Canada facilities for manufacturing such as 
     <lb/>
     cannot anywhere be surpassed,— and in the 
     <lb/>
     eastern or Maritime Provinces an abundance 
     <lb/>
     of that most useful of all minerals, coal, as 
     <lb/>
     well as the most magnificent and valuable 
     <lb/>
     fisheries in the world ; extending as this coun<lb break="no"/>try does for two thousand miles, traversed by 
     <lb/>
     the finest navigable river in the world, we 
     <lb/>
     may well look forward to our future with 
     <lb/>
     hopeful anticipation of seeing the realization, 
     <lb/>
     not merely of what we have hitherto thought 
     <lb/>
     would be the commerce of Canada, great as 
     <lb/>
     that might become, but to the possession of 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic ports, which we shall help to build to 
     <lb/>
     a position equal to that of the chief cities of 
     <lb/>
     the American Union. (Hear.) But it is not 
     <lb/>
     so much by the extent of a country that its 
     <lb/>
     power and real greatness are to be estimated, 
     <lb/>
     as by its containing within itself the elements 
     <lb/>
     of different interests, for it is in the diversity 
     <lb/>
     of employment that security is found against 
     <lb/>
     those sad reverses to which every country, de<lb break="no"/>pending mainly on one branch of industry, 
     <lb/>
     must always be liable. (Hear) A most re<lb break="no"/>markable illustration of this has recently oc<lb break="no"/>curred in our own Mother Country. No one 
     <lb/>
     would have ventured to say, a few years ago, 
     <lb/>
     that England could have lost its immense 
     <lb/>
     cotton supply without having its system of 
     <lb/>
       
            <cb/>
         
     commercial industry almost entirely over<lb break="no"/>thrown, and having its people sunk into the 
     <lb/>
     deepest misery. Yet we have seen, within the 
     <lb/>
     last few years, the cotton supply cut off. We 
     <lb/>
     have seen, it is true, a considerable portion of the 
     <lb/>
     people reduced to great want, but, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time, the wonderful diversity of employment 
     <lb/>
     which exists in the country opened new chan<lb break="no"/>nels for the employment of the distressed oper<lb break="no"/>atives, and though there was great pressure 
     <lb/>
     for a time, it was only temporary in its opera<lb break="no"/>tions ; and at this moment, after a short pause, 
     <lb/>
     we see the industry of England greater than 
     <lb/>
     it was at the beginning of the American war. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) We may therefore rejoice that, in 
     <lb/>
     the proposed Union of the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces, we shall obtain some se<lb break="no"/>curity against those providential reverses to 
     <lb/>
     which, as long as we are dependent on one 
     <lb/>
     branch of industry as a purely agricultural 
     <lb/>
     country, we must always remain exposed. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The resources of these great 
     <lb/>
     colonies, and the extent to which the industry 
     <lb/>
     and intelligence of their inhabitants have de<lb break="no"/>veloped them, are most significantly shewn in 
     <lb/>
     the Trade and Navigation Tables, which are 
     <lb/>
     in the possession of the public. I am afraid 
     <lb/>
     to weary the House by going at any length 
     <lb/>
     into statements relating to them, but I feel 
     <lb/>
     that in order to place the question of union 
     <lb/>
     fairly before the House and the country, I am 
     <lb/>
     called upon to glance, however briefly, at the 
     <lb/>
     position in which the trade and tonnage of 
     <lb/>
     each of the British North American Provinces 
     <lb/>
     at the present moment stands. The returns 
     <lb/>
     of the trade of Canada in 1863, taking exports 
     <lb/>
     and imports conjointly, shew an aggregate of 
     <lb/>
     $87,795,000. Taking the census of 1861, 
     <lb/>
     this trade represents thirty-five dollars per 
     <lb/>
     head of the population. The value of the 
     <lb/>
     import and export trade of New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     for the same year, reaches $16,729,680, 
     <lb/>
     amounting to sixty-six dollars per head of its 
     <lb/>
     population. The aggregate trade of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia for the same period, amounted to $18<lb break="no"/>622,359, or fifty-six dollars per head of its 
     <lb/>
     ple. And in the case of Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island, the import and export trade amounted 
     <lb/>
     to $3,055,568, representing thirty-seven dol<lb break="no"/>lars per head of the population of that colony. 
     <lb/>
     The value of the total trade of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     was $11,245,032, or eighty-six dollars per 
     <lb/>
     head. The whole of these figures represent 
     <lb/>
     an  aggregate trade of all the provinces amount<lb break="no"/>ing to $137,447,567. Notwithstanding the 
     <lb/>
     large population and the very large amount 
     <lb/>
     represented by the trade of Canada, when it 
     <lb/>
     is divided per head it falls considerably short 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="64" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0064.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">64</fw>
          
     of the trade of New Brunswick and Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, being a little more than half per head of 
     <lb/>
     the former, and not more than two-thirds of 
     <lb/>
     that of Nova Scotia. All the statistics to which 
     <lb/>
     I have had access show that the commercial 
     <lb/>
     and financial position of our sister colonies is 
     <lb/>
     such as to enable them creditably to seek an 
     <lb/>
     alliance with any country on earth ; and it 
     <lb/>
     cannot be said that, in seeking or consenting 
     <lb/>
     to an alliance with Canada, they have any 
     <lb/>
     local, or sectional, or selfish object in view. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Passing from trade, I will 
     <lb/>
     turn to another subject — the ship building 
     <lb/>
     and tonnage of those colonies— and will take 
     <lb/>
     the returns of 1863. In that year, the num<lb break="no"/>be of ships built in all those colonies was no 
     <lb/>
     less than 645, with a tonnage amounting to 
     <lb/>
     219,763 tons. This statement of the enor<lb break="no"/>mous amount of tonnage built in one year is 
     <lb/>
     as good evidence as can be offered of the fa<lb break="no"/>cilities we possess for becoming an important 
     <lb/>
     maritime power. The industry represented 
     <lb/>
      by those figures shows an export value of 
     <lb/>
     nearly nine million dollars ! The sea-going 
     <lb/>
     tonnage of Canada, including that of the in<lb break="no"/>land lakes, amounts to about nine million tons, 
     <lb/>
     a great portion of which, however, represents 
     <lb/>
     the tonnage of vessels performing coasting 
     <lb/>
     service, many of which frequently clear and 
     <lb/>
     arrive in the course of one day. It is gratifying 
     <lb/>
     to know that the trade between Canada and 
     <lb/>
     the States on the other side of the lakes is 
     <lb/>
     of a nature to give employment to a large 
     <lb/>
     portion of this lake tonnage — amounting 
     <lb/>
     to 6,907,000 tons — but it cannot be classed 
     <lb/>
     in the same category as the tonnage arriving 
     <lb/>
     at Quebec and Montreal, which in most cases 
     <lb/>
     can make only two or three trips per an<lb break="no"/>num. The sea-going tonnage of Canada 
     <lb/>
     amounted to 2,133,000 tons ; of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, 1,386,000 ; of Nova Scotia, 1,432,000 
     <lb/>
     tons. Consequently the amount of sea-going 
     <lb/>
     tonnage, subject only to a small deduction, 
     <lb/>
     was actually about five million tons, of which 
     <lb/>
     about 2,133,000 was that of vessels trading 
     <lb/>
     between the St. Lawrence and foreign ports. 
     <lb/>
     In making this statement it is due to the 
     <lb/>
     House that it should be made aware that 
     <lb/>
     some portion of this trade will not be repre<lb break="no"/>sented after the contemplated union has taken 
     <lb/>
     place. At present, the internal commerce 
     <lb/>
     between these colonies appears in the returns 
     <lb/>
     of each as imports and exports, but I should 
     <lb/>
     be glad if I were able to make on this account 
     <lb/>
     a large deduction from the figures I have 
     <lb/>
     given. It is matter for regret on the part of 
     <lb/>
     all of us that the trade between these colo<lb break="no"/>nies—subject all to the same Sovereign, con<lb break="no"/><cb/>nected with the same empire—has been so 
     <lb/>
     small. Intercolonial trade has been, indeed, 
     <lb/>
     of the most insignificant character ; we have 
     <lb/>
     looked far more to our commercial relations 
     <lb/>
     with the neighbouring—though a foreign 
     <lb/>
     country,—than to the interchange of our own 
     <lb/>
     products, which would have retained the bene<lb break="no"/>fits of our trade within ourselves ; hostile 
     <lb/>
     tariffs have interfered with the free interchange 
     <lb/>
     of the products of the labor of all the colonies, 
     <lb/>
     and one of the greatest and most immediate 
     <lb/>
     benefits to be derived from their union, will 
     <lb/>
     spring from the breaking down of these bar<lb break="no"/>riers and the opening up of the markets of all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces to the different industries of 
     <lb/>
     each. (Hear, hear.) In this manner we may 
     <lb/>
     hope to supply Newfoundland and the great 
     <lb/>
     fishing districts of the Gulf, with the agricul<lb break="no"/>tural productions of Western Canada ; we 
     <lb/>
     may hope to obtain from Nova Scotia our 
     <lb/>
     supply of coal ; and the manufacturing indus<lb break="no"/>try of Lower Canada may hope to find more 
     <lb/>
     extensive outlets in supplying many of those 
     <lb/>
     articles which are now purchased in foreign 
     <lb/>
     markets. For instance Newfoundland produces 
     <lb/>
     scarcely anything by agriculture, manufactures 
     <lb/>
     hardly an article of clothing, and a considerable 
     <lb/>
     trade may thus be expected to arise ; while, 
     <lb/>
     instead of  having payments made, as they 
     <lb/>
     are now, through Lombard street, they will 
     <lb/>
     be made through our own bankers in Montreal 
     <lb/>
     and elsewhere.  If we require to find an ex<lb break="no"/>ample of the benefits of free commercial in<lb break="no"/>tercourse, we need not look beyond the effects 
     <lb/>
     that have followed from the working of the 
     <lb/>
     Reciprocity Treaty with the United States. In 
     <lb/>
     one short year from the time when that treaty  
     <lb/>
     came into operation, our trade in the natural 
     <lb/>
     productions of the two countries swelled from 
     <lb/>
     less than $2,000,000 to upwards of $20,000,000 
     <lb/>
     per annum, and now, when we are threatened 
     <lb/>
     with an interruption of that trade—when we 
     <lb/>
     have reason to fear that the action of the 
     <lb/>
     United States will prove hostile to the con<lb break="no"/>tinuance of free commercial relations  with 
     <lb/>
     this country—when we know that the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of this question is not grounded on 
     <lb/>
     just views of the material advantages result<lb break="no"/>ing to each country—but that the irritation 
     <lb/>
     connected with political events exercises a 
     <lb/>
     predominant influence over the minds of 
     <lb/>
     American statesmen, it is the duty of the 
     <lb/>
     House to provide, if possible, other outlets for 
     <lb/>
     our productions. If we have reason to  fear 
     <lb/>
     that one door is about to be closed to our 
     <lb/>
     trade, it is the duty of the House to endeavor 
     <lb/>
     to open another ; to provide against a coming  
     <lb/>
    evil of the kind feared by timely expansion in 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="65" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0065.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">65</fw>
          
     another direction ; to seek by free trade with 
     <lb/>
     our own fellow-colonists for a continued and 
     <lb/>
     uninterrupted commerce which will not be 
     <lb/>
     liable to be disturbed at the capricious will of 
     <lb/>
     any foreign country. (Hear, hear.) On 
     <lb/>
     this ground, therefore, we may well come to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that the union between these 
     <lb/>
     colonies is demanded alike on account of their 
     <lb/>
     extensive resources, and because of the 
     <lb/>
     peculiar position in which they stand relatively 
     <lb/>
     to each other, to Great Britain, and to the 
     <lb/>
     United States. All these are questions which 
     <lb/>
     fall within the province of the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, as proposed in the resolutions before 
     <lb/>
     the House, and whatever may be the doubts 
     <lb/>
     and fears of any one with respect to the de<lb break="no"/>tails of the organization by which it is pro<lb break="no"/>posed to work the new system of Confedera<lb break="no"/>ation, no one can doubt that the great inter<lb break="no"/>ests of trade and commerce will be best pro<lb break="no"/>moted and developed by being entrusted to 
     <lb/>
     one central power, which will wield them in 
     <lb/>
     the common interest. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I now come, Mr. SPEAKER, to the consid<lb break="no"/>eration of the second, and perhaps I may say 
     <lb/>
     the third division of my subject also—wheth<lb break="no"/>er the material condition of these provinces 
     <lb/>
     is such as to make the union practicable, and 
     <lb/>
     whether the details of the measures proposed 
     <lb/>
     are equitable to each and to all. In consid<lb break="no"/>ering this point, it is necessary for us first to 
     <lb/>
     review the liabilities of each province, the 
     <lb/>
     reasons why they were incurred, the objects 
     <lb/>
     which have been sought. In doing so, the 
     <lb/>
     House will not fail to remark that the same 
     <lb/>
     policy has animated the legislatures of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, or perhaps I should speak more 
     <lb/>
     exactly in sayng those of Canada, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and Nova Scotia. The public debt of 
     <lb/>
     all these provinces has, with some slight 
     <lb/>
     exceptions, been incurred for public improve<lb break="no"/>ments, intended to develope the resources of 
     <lb/>
     the country, to attract immigration and wealth 
     <lb/>
     to their respective shores, to cheapen the 
     <lb/>
     means whereby the products of their farms 
     <lb/>
     were to be taken to market, and to reduce the 
     <lb/>
     cost of freight of articles which enter largely 
     <lb/>
     into the consumption of their inhabitants. 
     <lb/>
     Nor will any one fail to observe the intimate 
     <lb/>
     connection which all these public works have 
     <lb/>
     with each other—a connection which singu<lb break="no"/>larly illustrates the natural union which exists 
     <lb/>
     between these several provinces. If we con<lb break="no"/>sider the public improvements of Canada, her 
     <lb/>
     great canals intended to bring the trade of the 
     <lb/>
     vast countries bordering on the lakes down to 
     <lb/>
     the Gulf of St. Lawrence ; if we look at the 
     <lb/>
     railway system forced upon us in our compe<lb break="no"/><cb/>tition with American channels of trade, stretch<lb break="no"/>ing from the extreme west to the extreme east 
     <lb/>
     of the province ; and if we then look at the 
     <lb/>
     public works that have been undertaken in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, we find that, 
     <lb/>
     practically, they form parts of one great whole. 
     <lb/>
     It is through the St. Lawrence that the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Lower Provinces will send their fish , oils 
     <lb/>
     and other exports to the west, and it is through 
     <lb/>
     our canals and river that they will import 
     <lb/>
     the necessaries they require from the west. 
     <lb/>
     Through these canals and the river St. Law<lb break="no"/>rence, and along the railway systems of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, when hereafter connected, a great 
     <lb/>
     trade will flow in one uninterrupted stream, 
     <lb/>
     enriching in its course not only the cities of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, but also swelling the tide of a new 
     <lb/>
     commerce we may hope to see called into 
     <lb/>
     being in the open Atlantic ports of St. John 
     <lb/>
     and Halifax. (Hear, hear.) I will now pro<lb break="no"/>ceed, sir, briefly to lay before the House a 
     <lb/>
     statement of the present engagements of the 
     <lb/>
     several provinces, beginning with Canada. I 
     <lb/>
     find that our whole debt, exclusive of the 
     <lb/>
     Common School Fund, which does not form a 
     <lb/>
     portion of our engagements relatively to the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, amounts to $67,263,995. 
     <lb/>
     The debt of Nova Scotia is $4,858,547, and 
     <lb/>
     that of New Brunswick $5,702,991 ; and I 
     <lb/>
     may notice, with reference to the debts of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, that in the 
     <lb/>
     case of Nova Scotia a portion of their liabili<lb break="no"/>ties, to the amount of nearly half a million of 
     <lb/>
     dollars, consists of treasury notes, while the 
     <lb/>
     policy has been pursued both in that province 
     <lb/>
     and in New Brunswick of retaining in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Government the Savings Bank 
     <lb/>
     deposits of the people, which form, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     a part of the liabilities I have named to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of $1,167,000. It must, therefore, be 
     <lb/>
     observed that the rate of interest on the debts 
     <lb/>
     of these two colonies is not, on the whole 
     <lb/>
     amount, higher than that which the bulk of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian debt now bears. Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     has only incurred liabilities to the extent of 
     <lb/>
     $946,000, bearing interest at five per cent., 
     <lb/>
     while Prince Edward Island owes $240,673. 
     <lb/>
     The total liabilities of those provinces are, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, $11,748,211, against the interest on 
     <lb/>
     which may be placed the net revenues of the 
     <lb/>
     railways which are the property of those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and which produced last year a net 
     <lb/>
     amount of about $100,000. In addition to 
     <lb/>
    the existing liabilities of Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>Brunswick, there are certain further engage<lb break="no"/>ments they have incurred for the extension of 
     <lb/>their railway system requiring future provision 
     <lb/>tothe extent, in the case of Nova Scotia, of 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="66" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0066.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">66</fw>
        
     $3,000,000, and in that of New Brunswick of 
     <lb/>
     $1,300,000. It must be evident to the House 
     <lb/>
     that, in entering into such a partnership as is 
     <lb/>
     proposed, some common basis must be arrived 
     <lb/>
     at on which each province must enter into the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. Taking all the engagements, 
     <lb/>
    present and future, of Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>Brunswick, it was found that, relatively to 
     <lb/>their populations, they amounted to about $25 
     <lb/>per head, and this amount, as applied to 
     <lb/>Canada, would entitle us to enter the union 
     <lb/>with a debt of $62,500,000. Some difficulty 
     <lb/>might have occurred in reducing our debt to 
     <lb/>this amount had it not been apparent, on 
     <lb/>examination, that a considerable portion of it 
     <lb/>was connected with local advances, such as the 
     <lb/>Municipal Loan Fund, which does not properly 
     <lb/>belong to the same category as debt contracted 
     <lb/>in connection with our system of public im<lb break="no"/>provements, and the management of which is 
     <lb/>intended to be confided to the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, but rather partakes of a local charac<lb break="no"/>ter, and should more properly be left in the 
     <lb/>hands of the local legislatures. It will 
     <lb/>therefore be found provided in the resolutions, 
     <lb/>that in assuming for itself, apart from the 
     <lb/>General Government, the surplus of debt of 
     <lb/>about five millions ($5,000,000), the Province 
     <lb/>of Canada became entitled to withdraw from 
     <lb/>the general assets all those items which were 
     <lb/>of a local character, and for which a portion 
     <lb/>of its debt had been incurred. Had not this 
     <lb/>means been adopted, it would have been neces<lb break="no"/>sary to permit all the Lower Provinces to 
     <lb/>increase their obligations beyond those for 
     <lb/>which their legislatures have hitherto had to 
     <lb/>provide, and bring in larger debts to the Con<lb break="no"/>federation than they will now do, and a most 
     <lb/>unnecessary and prodigal expenditure of public 
     <lb/>money would have been the consequence. It 
     <lb/>was wise, then, to confine the liabilities of the 
     <lb/>General Government simply to those debts 
     <lb/>which had been incurred for purposes of 
     <lb/>general improvement, and to provide locally, 
     <lb/>in this country, for the assumption of the sur<lb break="no"/>plus, together with the assets which had been 
     <lb/>created by it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName> —Do the $67,263,995, 
     <lb/>
     stated as the debt of Canada, include the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal seigniorial indemnity given to Upper and 
     <lb/>
    Lower Canada, under the Act of 1854? 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName> —Yes ; that amount does 
     <lb/>
     include the indemnity, and among the arrange<lb break="no"/>ments contemplated by the Government, as<lb break="no"/>suming that Confederation does take place, 
     <lb/>
     they will submit, for the consideration of this 
     <lb/>
     House, a project for the assumption by Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada of the seigniorial indemnity provided 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
        
     by the Act of 1859, whereby it will be ren<lb break="no"/>dered unnecessary to give an equivalent indem<lb break="no"/>nity to Upper Canada, thus saving upwards of 
     <lb/>
     three millions of dollars. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     would desire again, Mr. SPEAKER, to refer to 
     <lb/>
     the position of the Lower Provinces, and to 
     <lb/>
     call the attention of the House to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that both in the case of Newfoundland and in 
     <lb/>
     that of Prince Edward Island, their liabilities 
     <lb/>
     are very much less in proportion to the popu<lb break="no"/>lation than those of the three larger provinces ; 
     <lb/>
     and in order to permit of their entering into 
     <lb/>
     the union upon fair terms, it was necessary to 
     <lb/>
     provide that they should be allowed to receive 
     <lb/>
     from the general exchequer a sum equal to the 
     <lb/>
     interest upon the amount of debt which they 
     <lb/>
     had not been obliged to contract. By this means 
     <lb/>
     provision was in fact made for the mainten<lb break="no"/>ance of their local governments, while at the 
     <lb/>
     same time a cause of future complaint was re<lb break="no"/>moved. (Hear, hear.) It now becomes my 
     <lb/>
     duty to submit to the House a statement of 
     <lb/>
     the resources which the several provinces pro<lb break="no"/>pose to bring into the common stock, and I 
     <lb/>may add that for the purpose of this statement 
     <lb/>being more readily verified, the financial re<lb break="no"/>turns of 1863 have been taken as the standard. 
     <lb/>From these returns it would appear that the 
     <lb/>income and expenditure of the several pro<lb break="no"/>vinces stood in that year as follows : Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia, with a population of 338,857, had an 
     <lb/>income of $1,185,629, her outlay being $1,<lb break="no"/>072,274 ; New Brunswick, with a population 
     <lb/>of 252,047, had an income of $894,836, and 
     <lb/>an outlay of $884,613 ; Newfoundland, with a 
     <lb/>population of 130,000, had an income of 
     <lb/>$480,000, the outlay being $479,420 ; Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island, with a population of 80,000, 
     <lb/>had an income of $197,384, the outlay being 
     <lb/>$171,718. The total revenue of all these 
     <lb/>colonies amounted to $2,763,004, and the 
     <lb/>total expenditure to $2,608,025—the united 
     <lb/>surplus over expenditure for 1863 being 
     <lb/>$154,979. It will be observed that as regards 
     <lb/>these provinces their income and expenditure 
     <lb/>are such that they will enter the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation with a financial position in no respect 
     <lb/>inferior to that of Canada. If an objection 
     <lb/>were made with respect to any province in 
     <lb/>regard to its financial position, it would be 
     <lb/>against Canada. The Lower Provinces have 
     <lb/>been and are now in a position to meet, from 
     <lb/>their taxation, all their expenses, and cannot 
     <lb/>be regarded as bringing any burthen to the 
     <lb/>people of Canada. It is not necessary for me 
     <lb/>to say anything in reference to the financial 
     <lb/>position of Canada in 1863, but it must be 
     <lb/>gratifying to the House to know that the de<lb break="no"/><pb n="67" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0067.jpg"/><fw type="num">67</fw>ficiency which unfortunately existed during 
     <lb/>
    that year was removed in 1864, and that, 
     <lb/>therefore, we are not obliged now to propose 
     <lb/>to enter the Confederation in an inferior po<lb break="no"/>sition, in this respect, to that of our sister 
     <lb/>colonies. (Hear, hear.) The revenues of each 
     <lb/>of these provinces are, as the House is well 
     <lb/>aware, collected under different systems of tax<lb break="no"/>ation, suited to the local industry and the 
     <lb/>wants of their several populations. It is, there<lb break="no"/>fore, manifest that one of the first duties of 
     <lb/>the General Legislature will be to consider the 
     <lb/>modes by which the burden of taxation can be 
     <lb/>most easily borne by the industry of the whole 
     <lb/>country, and to assilmilate the several sources 
     <lb/>of revenue which are now in existence in such 
     <lb/>manner as will least interfere with the profit<lb break="no"/>able exercise of the industry of the people. It 
     <lb/>would be entirely out of place for me, sir, to 
     <lb/>attempt on this occasion to indicate what the 
     <lb/>policy of the General Government may be, but 
     <lb/>one thing must be evident to all, and that is, 
     <lb/>that where the taxation is about equal per 
     <lb/>head, the adjustment of it cannot be attended 
     <lb/>with any injustice to the people of any of the 
     <lb/>several provinces. Reductions may be made in 
     <lb/>our customs, on the one hand ; and, perhaps, 
     <lb/>on the other, some portions of our commerce 
     <lb/>may be relieved from the exactions to which 
     <lb/>they are now subjected. Apart from the advan<lb break="no"/>tages which will manifestly flow from the free 
     <lb/>trade which will hereafter exist between us, 
     <lb/>it must be clear to every member of the House 
     <lb/>that the credit of each and all the provinces 
     <lb/>will be greatly advanced by a union of their 
     <lb/>resources. A larger fund will be available 
     <lb/>as security to the public creditor, larger in<lb break="no"/>dustries will be subjected to the action of the 
     <lb/>Legislature for the maintenance of public 
     <lb/>credit, and we will also see removed some of 
     <lb/>those apprehensions which have latterly affected 
     <lb/>the public credit of this country (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) It must be evident, for it is proved 
     <lb/>by the fluctuating quotations of the secu<lb break="no"/>rities of these provinces in London that 
     <lb/>the apprehension of war with the United 
     <lb/>States—which has, unfortunately, affected the 
     <lb/>prices of Canadian bonds—has not to the same 
     <lb/>extent effected those of New Brunswick and 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia, which are less exposed to hostile 
     <lb/>attack ; and we may therefore hope that 
     <lb/>the union, while it affords us greater re<lb break="no"/>sources, will, at the same time, carry with it a 
     <lb/>greater sense of security. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>must now enquire whether the proposed 
     <lb/>system of general and local governments, 
     <lb/>as regards the interests to which I have 
     <lb/>already alluded, is likely to work beneficially ; 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
       
     and this brings me to the consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     question of the means that will be at the dis<lb break="no"/>posal of the general and local governments. 
     <lb/>
     It must be admitted that having the power of 
     <lb/>
     taxation in their own hands, it will be the 
     <lb/>
     fault of the General Legislature if any em<lb break="no"/>barrassment is felt in meeting the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of the General Government. Before, 
     <lb/>
     however, passing to the consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     means at the disposal of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments, I would take this opportunity of reply<lb break="no"/>ing to the honorable member for Hochelaga, in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the export duty on timber in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, and the royalty in Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     on the produce of the mines. This has arisen 
     <lb/>
     from the circumstance that in the former pro<lb break="no"/>vince it was found both expensive and incon<lb break="no"/>venient to attempt to levy their timber dues 
     <lb/>
     in the forest, and they therefore adoptedthe 
     <lb/>
     plan of causing them to be paid in the form 
     <lb/>
     of an export duty upon the clearances of 
     <lb/>
     vessels at the custom house. If, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     provision had not been made for securing to 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick the payment of these dues, 
     <lb/>
     that province would have been deprived of the 
     <lb/>
     large amount which its territorial timber con<lb break="no"/>tributes to the revenue, and the General 
     <lb/>
     Legislature would have been required to in<lb break="no"/>crease the proposed grant to that province by 
     <lb/>
     an amount equal to those dues—somewhere 
     <lb/>
     about $90,000 per annum. In the case of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia—not possessing any public lands 
     <lb/>
     or timber to any extent—her territorial reve<lb break="no"/>nue is almost wholly derived from her mines, 
     <lb/>
     and collected in the form of royalty. Her 
     <lb/>
     representatives at the Conference pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that if the policy of the General Government 
     <lb/>
     should be to impose an export duty on her 
     <lb/>
     coal, it would virtually oblige her either to re<lb break="no"/>linquish the royalty, which new forms a large 
     <lb/>
    source of her revenue, or submit to be placed in 
     <lb/>a most disadvantageous position in competing 
     <lb/>in the American markets with the coal of that 
     <lb/>country. For these reasons an exception was 
     <lb/>made in the case of both of these provinces, 
     <lb/>such as has been alluded to by the honorable 
     <lb/>member. (Hear, hear.) In the case of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, an arrangement has been made 
     <lb/>whereby the whole of the territorial rights of 
     <lb/>that colony have been ceded to the General 
     <lb/>Government, and I will take the opportunity, 
     <lb/>when adverting to the means of supporting 
     <lb/>the Local Government of that colony, to ex<lb break="no"/>plain the manner and the consideration for 
     <lb/>which these rights were so ceded. (Hear.) I 
     <lb/>now propose, sir, to refer to the means which 
     <lb/>will be at the disposal of the several local 
     <lb/>governments to enable them to administer 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="68" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0068.jpg"/>

     the various matters of public policy which 
     <lb/>
     it is proposed to entrust to them, and it is evi<lb break="no"/>dent that unless ample provision is made in the 
     <lb/>
     arrangements, great danger will arise that the 
     <lb/>
     machinery whereby the local wants of the people 
     <lb/>
     are intended to be met will speedily become 
     <lb/>
     impaired, causing complaint on the part of 
     <lb/>
     the inhabitants of the respective localities, 
     <lb/>
     and involving considerable danger to the whole 
     <lb/>
     machinery of government. (Hear, hear.) In 
     <lb/>
     the case of Canada it will be remembered 
     <lb/>
     that the sum of nearly five millions of the 
     <lb/>
     public debt has to be borne by Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. It will hereafter be for the 
     <lb/>
     House to decide how this sum shall be appor<lb break="no"/>tioned, but the probability is that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will recommend that it shall be divided 
     <lb/>
     on the basis of population. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     must be remembered that Canada will have 
     <lb/>
     at its disposal a large amount of the local 
     <lb/>
     assets, including especially the sums due to 
     <lb/>
     the municipal loan fund, which will produce 
     <lb/>
     an income for the support of their local in<lb break="no"/>stitutions. As a matter of account between 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada and the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, they will be charged with the 
     <lb/>
     interest on their respective proportions of the 
     <lb/>
     five millions against the subsidy which it is 
     <lb/>
     proposed shall be given to them, while they 
     <lb/>
     themselves will collect from the municipalities 
     <lb/>
     and other local sources all the revenue and 
     <lb/>
     amounts which now enter into the general 
     <lb/>
     revenue of the Province of Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     question of the sub-division of the local assets 
     <lb/>
     of Canada is not, however, before the House. 
     <lb/>
     What we have now to consider is whether the 
     <lb/>
     bargain as between Canada as a whole and 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces ought to be assented to. 
     <lb/>
     If it be assented to the question will arise, 
     <lb/>
     how shall we deal with the local matters be<lb break="no"/>tween Upper and Lower Canada ? and a pro<lb break="no"/>position will be brought down which I hope 
     <lb/>
     and believe will satisfy both sections, and do 
     <lb/>
     them substantial justice.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName> —I must repeat that, no 
     <lb/>
     matter what views the Government may have 
     <lb/>
     on the distribution of the liabilities as be<lb break="no"/>tween Upper and Lower Canada, they will be 
     <lb/>
     susceptible of alteration in any way the House 
     <lb/>
     may see fit, this being a matter solely of local 
     <lb/>
     arrangement, and in no respect involving the 
     <lb/>
     agreement entered into with the other prov<lb break="no"/>inces; but I must point out that, as regards 
     <lb/>the original seigniorial indemnity and the mu<lb break="no"/><cb/>nicipal loan, they are both included in the 
     <lb/>
     sixty-seven millions already stated as the lia<lb break="no"/>bilities of Canada, and cannot, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     form any additional charge against Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. (Hear, hear.) Indeed,  as regards 
     <lb/>
     the Municipal Loan Fund, instead of being 
     <lb/>
     stated as a liability, it appears that the sums 
     <lb/>
     due under it are, in connection with the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as I now view it, to be regarded in the 
     <lb/>
     light of assets, because we are considering now 
     <lb/>
     the sums received as assets by Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The Municipal Loan Fund being one of them, 
     <lb/>
     the sums due to it under the existing provin<lb break="no"/>cial arrangements will become payable as an 
     <lb/>
     asset to that section of the province. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     It will be observed that in the plan proposed 
     <lb/>
     there are certain sources of local revenue re<lb break="no"/>served to the Local Governments, arising from 
     <lb/>
     territorial domain, lands, mines, &amp;c. In the 
     <lb/>
     case of Canada, a large sum will be received 
     <lb/>
     from these resources, but it may be that some 
     <lb/>
     of them, such as the Municipal Loan Fund, 
     <lb/>
     will become exhausted in course of time. We 
     <lb/>
     may, however, place just confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     development of our resources, and repose in 
     <lb/>
     the belief that we shall findin our ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial domain, our valuable mines and our 
     <lb/>
     fertile lands, additional sources of revenue 
     <lb/>
     far beyond the requirements of the public 
     <lb/>
     service. If, nevertheless, the local revenues 
     <lb/>
     become inadequate, it will be necessary for 
     <lb/>
     the local governments to have resort to di<lb break="no"/>rect taxation ; and I do not hesitate to say that 
     <lb/>
     one of the wisest provisions in the proposed 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, and that which affords the surest 
     <lb/>
     guarantee that the people will take a healthy 
     <lb/>
     interest in their own affairs and see that no 
     <lb/>
     extravagance is committed by those placed in 
     <lb/>
     power over them, is to be found in the fact 
     <lb/>
     that those who are called upon to administer 
     <lb/>
     public affairs will feel, when they resort to 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation, that a solemn responsibility 
     <lb/>
     rests upon them, and that that responsibility 
     <lb/>
     will be exacted by the people in the most per<lb break="no"/>emptory manner. (Hear, hear.) If the men 
     <lb/>
     in power find that they are required, by means 
     <lb/>
     of direct taxation, to procure the funds neces<lb break="no"/>sary to administer the local affairs, for which 
     <lb/>
     abundant provision is made in the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     they will pause before they enter upon any 
     <lb/>
     career of extravagance. Indeed, I do not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate to say, that if the public men of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces were sufficiently educated to under<lb break="no"/>stand their own interests in the true light of 
     <lb/>
     the principles of political economy, it would 
     <lb/>
     be found better now to substitute direct tax<lb break="no"/>ation for some of the indirect modes by which 
     <lb/>taxation has been imposed upon the industry<lb/>

     of the people. (Hear, hear.) I do not, how<lb break="no"/>ever, believe that at this moment it is possible, 
     <lb/>
     nor do I think the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     would support any government in adopting 
     <lb/>
     this measure unless it were forced upon them 
     <lb/>
     by the pressure of an overwhelming necessity 
     <lb/>
     —the necessity of providing, by extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     means, against dangers by which the peace, 
     <lb/>
     happiness and prosperity of the country may 
     <lb/>
     be threatened, in fact, by some of those great 
     <lb/>
     disturbing causes which are frequently the 
     <lb/>
     beginning of the most important financial 
     <lb/>
     changes. (Hear, hear.) The local revenue 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada during the last four years 
     <lb/>
     has averaged the sum of $739,000, and that 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada, $557,239 ; together they 
     <lb/>
     amount to nearly $1,300,000, independent of 
     <lb/>
     the eighty cents per head which it is proposed 
     <lb/>
     to allow the local governments out of the 
     <lb/>
     general exchequer, for the purpose of meet<lb break="no"/>ing their local expenditures. These local 
     <lb/>
     expenditures include such items as the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of justice, the support of educa<lb break="no"/>tion, grants to literary and scientific societies, 
     <lb/>
     hospitals and charities, and such other mat<lb break="no"/>ters as cannot be regarded as devolving upon 
     <lb/>
    the General Government. The whole charge, 
     <lb/>exclusive of the expenses of local government 
     <lb/>and legislation, on an average of the last four 
     <lb/>years, has in Lower Canada amounted to 
     <lb/>$997,000, and in Upper Canada to $1,024,<lb break="no"/>622 per annum. In addition to these 
     <lb/>sums, will have now to be added such 
     <lb/>amounts as may be required to meet the cost 
     <lb/>of the Civil Government of the country and 
     <lb/>of the Legislation for local purposes. It 
     <lb/>may be difficult to form any reliable esti<lb break="no"/>mate of the sums required for this purpose, 
     <lb/>but when the House considers that, according 
     <lb/>to the statements given of the expenditure 
     <lb/>during the last four years, there will be avail<lb break="no"/>able in the whole Province of Canada the sum 
     <lb/>of no less than $1,043,015, it must, I think, 
     <lb/>be admitted that if those charged with the 
     <lb/>administration of local affairs in Upper and 
     <lb/>Lower Canada exceed this amount they will 
     <lb/>be guilty of a degree of profligacy and extra<lb break="no"/>vagance for which a speedy remedy will be 
     <lb/>found by the people. (Hear, hear.) With 
     <lb/>reference to the Lower Provinces, the delegates 
     <lb/>from them to the Conference were asked what 
     <lb/>reductions they could make in the existing 
     <lb/>cost of the government of their several colonies, 
     <lb/>and the figures I am about to give will be 
     <lb/>found most satisfactory, as showing their dis<lb break="no"/>position to reduce their requirements to the 
     <lb/>lowest possible sum. In the case of Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia, the estimate of outlay in 1864 for 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     objects of a local character required an expen<lb break="no"/>diture of no less than $667,000. Some por<lb break="no"/>tion of this expenditure was for services that 
     <lb/>
     did not require again to be performed, but it 
     <lb/>
     is gratifying to observe that they have under<lb break="no"/>taken to perform the whole service in future 
     <lb/>
     for $371,000. (Hear, hear.) In the case of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, in 1864 the estimated expen<lb break="no"/>diture was $404,000, which they have under<lb break="no"/>taken to reduce to $353,000, and at the same 
     <lb/>
     time they have further undertaken within ten  
     <lb/>
     years to make an additional reduction of 
     <lb/>
     $63,000, thus reducing the whole expenditure 
     <lb/>
     in the future to $290,000. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, with an expenditure of 
     <lb/>
     $124,000, proposes to perform the same local 
     <lb/>
     duties that formerly required $170,000 ; and 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland an outlay of $479,000 has 
     <lb/>
     been similarly reduced to $350,000. Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     The House must now, sir, consider the  means 
     <lb/>
     whereby these local expenditures have to be 
     <lb/>
     met. I have already explained that, in the 
     <lb/>
     case of Canada, and also in that of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, certain sources of revenue are set 
     <lb/>
     aside as being of a purely local character and 
     <lb/>
     available to meet the local expenditure ; but 
     <lb/>
     I have been obliged in my explanations with 
     <lb/>
     regard to Canada to advert to the fact that it 
     <lb/>
     is contemplated to give a subsidy of 80 cents 
     <lb/>
     per head to each of the Provinces. In trans<lb break="no"/>ferring to the General Government all the 
     <lb/>
     large sources of revenue, and in placing in 
     <lb/>
    their hand with a single exception, that of 
     <lb/>direct taxation, all the means whereby the 
     <lb/>industry of the people may be made to contri<lb break="no"/>bute to the wants of the state, it must be evi<lb break="no"/>dent to every one that some portion of the 
     <lb/>resources thus placed at the disposal of the 
     <lb/>General Government must in some form or 
     <lb/>other be available to supply the hiatus that 
     <lb/>would otherwise take place between the sources 
     <lb/>of local revenue and the demands of local 
     <lb/>expenditure. The members of the Conference 
     <lb/>considered this question with the most earnest 
     <lb/>desire to reduce to the lowest possible limits 
     <lb/>the sum that was thus required, and I think 
     <lb/>the figures that I have already given to the 
     <lb/>House afford the best possible evidence that 
     <lb/>no disposition existed, at any rate on the part 
     <lb/>of our friends from the Lower Provinces, to 
     <lb/>take from the public exchequer one shilling 
     <lb/>more than the necessities of their respective 
     <lb/>communities absolutely demanded. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) In the case of Canada, perhaps it will 
     <lb/>be said that a smaller sum would have met 
     <lb/>our immediate wants, but it was felt that it 
     <lb/>would be impossible to justify any distinction 
     <lb/>being drawn between subjects of the same 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="70" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0070.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">70</fw>
         
     country. And if in Canada we receive per<lb break="no"/>haps a somewhat larger amount than we ab<lb break="no"/>solutely require, it ought rather to be a subject 
     <lb/>
     of gratification to this House that it will pos<lb break="no"/>sess the means of giving greater encourage 
     <lb/>
     ment to our educational system, and greater 
     <lb/>
     development to those interests which are 
     <lb/>
     peculiarly entrusted to the charge of the local 
     <lb/>
     governments, and this, too, without making 
     <lb/>
     any greater demand than is at this time 
     <lb/>
      made upon the resources of the people. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) A subsidy of 80 cents per 
     <lb/>
     head was provided, based upon the popu<lb break="no"/>lation according to the census of 1861. The 
     <lb/>
     amount, if taken upon the basis of the present 
     <lb/>
     population, would undoubtedly be considerably 
     <lb/>
     less ; and it must be observed that the agree<lb break="no"/>ment does not contemplate any future exten<lb break="no"/>sion of this amount. It is hoped that being 
     <lb/>
     in itself fixed and permanent in its character, 
     <lb/>
     the local governments will see the importance 
     <lb/>
     —I may say the necessity—of their exercising 
     <lb/>
     a rigid and proper control over the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of their several provinces. We thus 
     <lb/>
     obtain one of the greatest securities that can 
     <lb/>
     be offered to us that those influences which, 
     <lb/>
     in such a Legislature as we now possess in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, are brought to hear for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of swelling the public expenditure, will not 
     <lb/>
     exist in the local legislatures, but will meet with 
     <lb/>
     such a resistance, from the mere fact of the 
     <lb/>
     inability of the local governments to obey 
     <lb/>
     them, as to produce a very considerable 
     <lb/>
     saving in the general expense of the whole 
     <lb/>
     country. (Hear, hear.) I have now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, only to advert to the last question 
     <lb/>
     which I have stated is necessary to be decided 
     <lb/>
     on the present occasion ; and that is, whether 
     <lb/>
     under the proposed Confederation such addi<lb break="no"/>tional expenses will be incurred as to render 
     <lb/>
     it undesirable. In considering this point, I 
     <lb/>
     must state that in my opinion the question of 
     <lb/>
     expense alone is by no means a fair criterion 
     <lb/>
     by which to judge of the advantages of a mea<lb break="no"/>sure such as that now before the House. If 
     <lb/>
     it be looked at in its most restricted sense, the 
     <lb/>
     only point in which additional expense can be 
     <lb/>
     incurred, must be that of the simple cost of 
     <lb/>
     governing the country. In no other way that 
     <lb/>
     I am able to see, can there be additional ex<lb break="no"/>pense charged upon the people ; and looking 
     <lb/>
     at it in this point of view, we may well doubt 
     <lb/>
     whether the aggregate charge will be greater 
     <lb/>
     for the General Government, caring for the 
     <lb/>
     general interests of the whole, and for the 
     <lb/>
     local governments, attending merely to the 
     <lb/>
     local business of each section,—we may well 
     <lb/>
    doubt, I  say, whether that expense will be 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     greater, in any considerable degree, than that 
     <lb/>
     which is required for our Government under 
     <lb/>
     the present system. (Hear, hear.) On the 
     <lb/>
     one hand we shall be free from the empty 
     <lb/>
     parade of small Courts entailed by our present 
     <lb/>
     system on each of these provinces, keeping up 
     <lb/>
     a pretence of regal show when the reality is 
     <lb/>
     wanting ; we shall have the legislation of the 
     <lb/>
     General Government restricted to those great 
     <lb/>
     questions which may properly occupy the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the first men in the country ; we 
     <lb/>
     shall not have our time frittered away in 
     <lb/>
     considering the merits of petty local bills, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore we may reasonably hope that 
     <lb/>
     the expenses of  the General Legislature will 
     <lb/>
     be considerably less than even those of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature of Canada at the present moment, 
     <lb/>
     —while, on the other hand, the local legis<lb break="no"/>latures having to deal rather with municipal 
     <lb/>
     than great general questions, will be able to 
     <lb/>
     dispose of them in a manner more satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to the people, and at infinitely less expense 
     <lb/>
     than now. I believe, therefore, the simple 
     <lb/>
     cost of the Government of the country will 
     <lb/>
     not be in reality any greater under the new 
     <lb/>
     than under the old system ; but there are 
     <lb/>
     other items of expenditure for great public 
     <lb/>
     objects, the absence of which from the esti<lb break="no"/>mates of any country is an indication rather 
     <lb/>
     of weakness and of dependence than a sub<lb break="no"/>ject that ought to form a source of satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion. If such items are not now found in the 
     <lb/>
     public expenditure, either of Canada or the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, it is the best proof  that 
     <lb/>
     could be given that our position is one of in<lb break="no"/>feriority, and that we do not possess either 
     <lb/>
     the power or the means to undertake such 
     <lb/>
     works as make such items necessary. Let me 
     <lb/>
     give one or two points as examples of my 
     <lb/>
     meaning ; and first I will instance the great 
     <lb/>
     question of defence—(hear, hear) —the absence 
     <lb/>
     of items of expenditure for which can only be 
     <lb/>
     an indication that we are lacking in one of the 
     <lb/>
     chief elements of national greatness, that we 
     <lb/>
     do not properly value the institutions under 
     <lb/>
     which we live, and that we are not willing to 
     <lb/>
     make the sacrifices that every free people must 
     <lb/>
     make if they are desirous of preserving them. 
     <lb/>
     The same argument applies to public works, 
     <lb/>
     in connection with which it might be said 
     <lb/>
     that great advantage would arise from large 
     <lb/>
     expenditure ; but with limited resources and 
     <lb/>
     an undeveloped territory it might be impos<lb break="no"/>sible for any small country to undertake the 
     <lb/>
     necessary outlay. Many works of this kind 
     <lb/>
     are not directly productive of revenue, although 
     <lb/>
     indirectly of  the utmost advantage, and if 
     <lb/>
     the resources of a country generally cannot 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="71" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-07_Page_0071.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">71</fw>
           
     be applied to that outlay, the absence of such 
     <lb/>
     expenditure ought to be a subject of regret 
     <lb/>
     in the community, and not of rejoicing. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) In this view let us look at 
     <lb/>
     the immense extent of territory that stretches 
     <lb/>
     away west of Upper Canada. The reason 
     <lb/>
     why we have not been able to assume posses<lb break="no"/>sion of that territory and open it up to the 
     <lb/>
     industry of the youth of this country who, 
     <lb/>
     in consequence of the want of some such 
     <lb/>
     field for the employment of their energies, 
     <lb/>
     have been obliged to go off to the States in 
     <lb/>
     thousands, especially to those states possess<lb break="no"/>ing the boundless resources of the great 
     <lb/>
     North-West, is because there sources of Can<lb break="no"/>ada—great as they have been, considering the 
     <lb/>
     disadvantages under which she has labored<lb break="no"/>have been inadequate for the development of 
     <lb/>
     this district. Now, one of the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme before the House refers to this 
     <lb/>
     same question, and I believe that one of the 
     <lb/>
     first acts of the General Government of 
     <lb/>
     the United Provinces will be to enter into 
     <lb/>
     public obligations for the purpose of opening 
     <lb/>
     up and developing that vast region, and of 
     <lb/>
     making it a source of strength instead of a 
     <lb/>
     burden to us and to the Mother Country also. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)  Looking, however, to the 
     <lb/>
     whole question of expense, I must say that if 
     <lb/>
     the benefits of Confederation are to be weighed 
     <lb/>
      against the loss of three or four hundred 
     <lb/>
     thousand dollars, the House had better care<lb break="no"/>fully consider whether the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country will not accept the former at such 
     <lb/>
     comparatively trifling cost—whether they will 
     <lb/>
     not feel that a union with a million of their 
     <lb/>
     fellow colonists is worth much more to them 
     <lb/>
     than any mall pecuniary question of this 
     <lb/>
     kind that may arise. (Hear, hear.) I trust 
     <lb/>
      the House will not permit the question to be 
     <lb/>
     judged of in a small, contracted manner. I 
     <lb/>
     trust it will keep in view the desire the country 
     <lb/>
     manifests for the utmost possible development 
     <lb/>
     of its resources. Let us endeavor by this 
     <lb/>
     measure to afford a better opening than we 
     <lb/>
     now possess for the industry and intelligence 
     <lb/>
     of the people. Let us seek by this scheme 
     <lb/>
     to give them higher and worthier objects of 
     <lb/>
     ambition. Let us not reject the scheme with 
     <lb/>
     the bright prospect it offers of a nobler future 
     <lb/>
     for our youth, and grander objects for the 
     <lb/>
     emulation of our public men. Let us not re<lb break="no"/>fuse it on small questions of detail, but judge 
     <lb/>
     it on its general merits. Let us not lose sight 
     <lb/>
     of the great advantages which union offers 
     <lb/>
     because there may be some small matters 
     <lb/>
     which, as individuals, we may not like. Let 
     <lb/>
      us trust that this machinery, however faulty 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
        
     it may be, will yet under Providence open up 
     <lb/>
     for this country a happy career ; while at the 
     <lb/>
     same time the House must not forget that it 
     <lb/>
     will for ever remove the great and crying evils 
     <lb/>
     and dissensions which have existed in Canada 
     <lb/>
     for the last ten years, and which have threat<lb break="no"/>ened to plunge the country into the most dis<lb break="no"/>asterous and lamentable state of discord and 
     <lb/>
     confusion. (Cheers.) Surely this last fact 
     <lb/>
     alone will commend the project to the House. 
     <lb/>
     It should induce the Legislature and the peo<lb break="no"/>ple to make every allowance for the men who 
     <lb/>
    have been engaged in the work, and lead 
     <lb/>them to approach the result of their labors 
     <lb/>as now submitted, not in a hypercritical spirit 
     <lb/>so that the public mind may be led astray on 
     <lb/>mere matters of detail. Let the House frank<lb break="no"/>ly and kindly look at it as a great measure 
     <lb/>brought down for the purpose of relieving 
     <lb/>the country from distress and depression, and 
     <lb/>give it that consideration which is due, not to 
     <lb/>the arguments of the Government, feeble as 
     <lb/>they may be in view of the great interests 
     <lb/>involved, but to the fact that the country 
     <lb/>desires and cries for, at the hands of the 
     <lb/>House, some measure whereby its internal 
     <lb/>prosperity, peace and happiness may be de<lb break="no"/>veloped and maintained. (Loud cheers.)

     the intention of replying to the remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member from Niagara Division (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     MR. CURRIE), who engaged the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House during most of its sitting. From 
     <lb/>
     its commencement to its conclusion, the speech 
     <lb/>
     of that honorable gentleman was of a most 
     <lb/>
     remarkable character. At its very outset he 
     <lb/>
    took the opportunity of quoting some parts of 
     <lb/>the first speech he made in this chamber, two 
     <lb/>years ago, in which he strongly approved of 
     <lb/>the principle of a Confederation between 
     <lb/>Canada and the Lower Provinces, and in some 
     <lb/>portions of his yesterday's speech he reiterated 
     <lb/>in a very decided manner his approval of such 
     <lb/>a scheme. But other parts of his speech were 
     <lb/>of such a character that if any of the pro<lb break="no"/>moters of Confederation had been at first in<lb break="no"/>clined to number him among the friends of 
     <lb/>
