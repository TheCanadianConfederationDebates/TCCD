     have been passed by the Catholics of Upper

     Canada ? Is he ignorant that Vicar-General

     MCDONNELL of Kingston is here at the

     Palace, to give effect to them ? And does he

     <lb/>
     the question, I must not presume to ask the 
     <lb/>
     Government to state their intentions with 
     <lb/>
    regard to it ? Their answer should not be 
     <lb/>delayed on the plea set up to-night by the 
     <lb/>President of the Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN), 
     <lb/>that they are to consider the matter. It is a 
     <lb/>matter worthy of consideration, and I press it

     act as the champion of any religious sect. I

     have come to do justice to all parties, and I 
     <lb/>
     claim that we are entitled to understand, when 
     <lb/>
     it is intended to make distinctions for the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of the minority in one section of the

     we have occupied, in discussing those con<lb break="no"/>stitutional questions that have so long separ<lb break="no"/>ated parties, and involved the two sections 
     <lb/>
     of the province in serious dissensions. I do 
     <lb/>
     this to meet the charges of inconsistency 
     <lb/>
     brought against myself and others, because 
     <lb/>
     we support the present Coalition Government 
     <lb/>
     with a view to obtain the solution of the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties with which we have had to 
     <lb/>
     contend—in a way not perhaps hitherto 
     <lb/>
     advocated very extensively, especially in that 
     <lb/>
     part of the province to which I myself 
     <lb/>
     belong. Since I had the honor of having a 
     <lb/>
     seat in this House, I have never advocated 
     <lb/>
     representation by population as the sole 
     <lb/>
     measure I would accept as a settlement of 
     <lb/>
     those difficulties. In the first speech I ever 
     <lb/>
     made in this House, I used the following 
     <lb/>
     language :—

            <p> (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga (Hon. Mr. DORION) asserted that we <lb/>
had advocated this measure merely as a <lb/>
means of remedying the financial injustice <lb/>
of which we complained. That was not the <lb/>
case. It is quite true that we urged very <lb/>
strongly—and I am not prepared at this <lb/>
moment to withdraw a single statement I <lb/>
have made with reference to that—we urged <lb/>
very strongly the injustice of the position <lb/>
in which we were placed, in contributing <lb/>
largely to the public revenue, and finding <lb/>
that that revenue was expended without due <lb/>
consideration being given to that part of the <lb/>
country which contributed most heavily <lb/>
towards it. But, at the same time, we felt <lb/>
that we were treated unjustly in another <lb/>
respect. We felt that it was not fair—that <lb/>
it could not be just—that four men in Lower <lb/>
Canada should be equal, politically, to five <lb/>
men in Upper Canada. We complained <lb/>
that our laws were framed by an eastern <lb/>
majority, in spite of our protestations. It <lb/>
was this which aggrieved us much more <lb/>
deeply than the mere loss of a certain sum <lb/>
of money. (Hear, hear.) Up to the <lb/>
beginning of 1862 the agitation for a redress <lb/>
of this grievance had been carried on <lb/>
throughout the whole of Western Canada ; <lb/>
and I am convinced that at that time there <lb/>
was not an individual who could appear in <lb/>
public in Canada West, and take any share <lb/>
in the public discussions of the day, with <lb/>
any chance of getting a favorable hearing, <lb/>
unless he asserted that he was in favor ot <lb/>
representation by population. <lb/>

further in his assertion of the rights of <lb/>

than I would be disposed to do. He asserted <lb/>
on the floor of this House that he would not <lb/>

            <cb/>

      
 the day, simply because they would not <lb/>
accord justice to Upper Canada. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Any
Upper <lb/>
Canada legislation. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man could not have taken stronger ground <lb/>
than that. I shall come to speak presently of <lb/>
his own Administration. The hon. member <lb/>
for Hochelaga seemed to think that, because<lb/>
the people of Canada West conducted their <lb/>
agitation with a good deal of system and <lb/>
order, there was nothing very alarming or <lb/>
dangerous about it. But the hon. gentleman <lb/>
should have remembered that it is a character<lb break="no"/>istic of the British people, that they on all <lb/>
occasions conduct a political agitation with <lb/>
due decorum and due respect to the laws, <lb/>
and that it is not the less serious on that <lb/>
account. When they have a deep-seated <lb/>
feeling that injustice is being perpetrated <lb/>
upon them, they will not sit still under it, <lb/>
although they will at the same time, while <lb/>
conducting the agitation against it, respect <lb/>
the rights of other parties. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
I am free to confess that, when I first came <lb/>
into this House, I labored under some slight <lb/>
misapprehension of the position which the <lb/>
Lower Canadians occupied towards us of <lb/>
Western Canada. There is, or there was <lb/>
then, a popular opinion that the Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nadians were only afraid of representation by <lb/>
population, because they dreaded that the <lb/>
people of Canada West would use the larger <lb/>
power they would thereby obtain for the inju<lb break="no"/>ry, if not the destruction, of their religious <lb/>
institutions. That is entirely an error. I am <lb/>
convinced that the people of Lower Canada <lb/>
have no such opinion and no such fear. In <lb/>
speaking the other day on that subject, the <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
DORIAN) quoted from a speech of mine deliv<lb break="no"/>ered in Toronto a few days before this session
<lb/>
commenced ; and I do not think the hon. <lb/>
gentleman shewed his usual candor or fair<lb break="no"/>ness in making the representation he did. <lb/>
He represented me as having stated at that <lb/>
meeting, that I had abandoned representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population, as a thing that was not <lb/>
advisable, or possible, or something of that <lb/>
sort. Now what I did say was this :— <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> He had looked at it in this way. The time
<lb/>
had been when the people of Upper Canada <lb/>
imagined that the Lower Canadians were afraid <lb/>
to grant representation by
population lest western <lb/>
reformers should interfere with their religious <lb/>
institutions. He was fully satisfied that that idea <lb/>
was entirely erroneous—that the French people <lb/>
never had the slightest fear of the kind, because <lb/>
they knew it would be political
suicide, it would <lb/>
be absolute ruin to any political party having the<lb/>
administration of affairs in their hands, to perpe<lb break="no"/>trate injustice on any section of the people, to <lb/>
whatever church they belonged. (Cheers.) <lb/>
There was one element, however, which always <lb/>
entered largely into the discussion of all our na<lb break="no"/>tional questions, and that was that the French <lb/>
people were a people entirely different from our<lb break="no"/>selves in origin, and largely in feeling. We all <lb/>
had a certain pride in our native country, and <lb/>
gloried in the deeds of our ancestors. The French <lb/>
people had that feeling quite as strongly as any <lb/>
of us ; this reason, and also because
they were a <lb/>
conquered people, they felt it necessary to main<lb break="no"/>tain a strong national spirit, and to resist all at<lb break="no"/>tempts to procure justice by the people of the <lb/>
wes,. lest that national existence
should be broken <lb/>
down. He (Mr. MACKENZIE) felt
for one that <lb/>
mere representation by population, under such <lb/>
circumstances would perhaps
scarcely meet the <lb/>
expectations formed of it,
because although Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada would have seventeen more members <lb/>
than Lower Canada, it would be an easy thing <lb/>
for the fifty or fifty-five members representing <lb/>
French constituencies to unite with a minority <lb/>
from Upper Canada, and thus secure an Admin<lb break="no"/>istration subservient to their views. <lb/>
            </p></quote>
  
            <p> These were the sentiments that I uttered <lb/>
at that meeting, and the sentiments to <lb/>
which I am prepared now to give utter<lb break="no"/>rance again. (Hear, hear.) I believe that that <lb/>
feeling of nationality has been our sole difficul<lb break="no"/>ty, in working our present political system. <lb/>
But I do not believe for one moment that it <lb/>
would be possible or perhaps
desirable to <lb/>
extinguish that strong feeling of nationality. <lb/>
Break down that feeling and all patriotism <lb/>
will be broken down with it. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
I do not think it would be fair, or kind, or <lb/>
honorable, to attempt to do so. When <lb/>
Britain conquered the country, she accepted <lb/>
the responsibility of governing a foreign <lb/>
people in accordance with their feelings, so <lb/>
far as consistent with British policy. That <lb/>
feeling of nationality obtains so
strongly in <lb/>
all countries, that, where attempts have been <lb/>
made, as in Austria, to break it down, they <lb/>
have signally failed. When such
an attempt <lb/>
failed, though made by a despotic
government, <lb/>
with a powerful army at its command, how <lb/>
could we expect it to succeed in a free coun<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
        
try. In Austria, at this moment, eighteen
<lb/>
different nationalities are represented in <lb/>
the national councils ; and, notwithstanding <lb/>
all its military power and <hi rendition="simple:italic">prestige</hi>, Austria <lb/>
has been compelled to accord local parlia<lb break="no"/>ments or assemblies to every one of those <lb/>
eighteen nationalities. (Hear, hear.) I <lb/>
have felt, therefore, that it would be utterly <lb/>
impracticable to obtain representation by <lb/>
population so long as the French people be<lb break="no"/>lieved, as I came to find they did
believe, <lb/>
that this concession to us would involve <lb/>
destruction to them as a separate people. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>— That is what they <lb/>
fear will be the result of the scheme now <lb/>
proposed. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName> —No ; I have yet to <lb/>
learn that they have any such fear. The <lb/>
Attoney General East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER), <lb/>
in his speech, a few evenings ago, adverted <lb/>
to the position taken by the French inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of Lower Canada at the time of the <lb/>
French revolution, and claimed credit for <lb/>
them, because they remained loyal to the <lb/>
British Crown, when all the other North <lb/>
American Colonies threw off the
British <lb/>
sway. The honorable gentleman's claim <lb/>
was perfectly just. But I believe that they <lb/>
were actuated by another feeling beyond the <lb/>
feeling of loyalty—that they felt their only <lb/>
safeguard as a distinct peeple— the only <lb/>
way to preserve their nationality, was to <lb/>
remain attached to Great Britain. Their <lb/>
existence for twenty years as a French colony <lb/>
under British rule, was not perhaps sufficient <lb/>
to give that attachment which they have <lb/>
now to the British Government. But it <lb/>
was perfectly clear to them that, if they <lb/>
entered the American Union, they would be <lb/>
absorbed and lost, just as the French colony <lb/>
of Louisiana has since been. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
I have been charged, and others with me, <lb/>
who have held the same political views, with <lb/>
deserting our party, because we have ceased <lb/>
to act with the gentlemen from Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada with whom we formerly acted. I think <lb/>
there is no fair ground for such a charge. <lb/>
For what, after all, is party ? It is but an <lb/>
association of individuals holding opinions <lb/>
in common on some grounds of public policy, <lb/>
or some measures which they may believe <lb/>
to be necessary for the conduct of the <lb/>
government of the country to which they <lb/>
belong. Looking at the matter in that light, <lb/>
there is no part of our party politics in the <lb/>
west, that we have insisted upon so strongly <lb/>
as that which concerns the representation of <lb/>
the people in Parliament. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—And, as soon as <lb/>
our former political friends in Lower Canada <lb/>
ceased to take advanced ground on
that ques<lb break="no"/>tion, while the other party, hitherto opposed <lb/>
to us, became willing to take that advanced <lb/>
ground, it became clearly our duty to unite <lb/>
with that party who held opinions in com<lb break="no"/>mon with us on matters that
concerned us <lb/>
above all others. (Hear, hear.) At the <lb/>
time of the formation of the MACDONALD- <lb break="yes"/>
SICOTTE Government, I was, with many <lb/>
others, strongly blamed, because we allowed <lb/>
that Government to come into existence at <lb/>
all. It is quite possible we
were wrong ; but <lb/>
I think after all it was fortunate that the <lb/>
hon. member for Cornwall (Hon. J. S. <lb/>
MACDONALD) had a fair opportunity
to try <lb/>
his favorite remedy for our constitutional <lb/>
difficulties—the " double majority
principle." <lb/>
That principle had been pressed on the <lb/>
attention of the country for ten years as one <lb/>
amply sufficient as a remedial measure, <lb/>
under which the existing
political system <lb/>
could be harmoniously worked. In the
<lb/>
MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government it had a <lb/>
fair trial and a speedy death. (Hear, hear, <lb/>
and laughter.) The existence of that <lb/>
Government, if it served no
other purpose, <lb/>
showed the utter impracticability
of the <lb/>
one means, by which my hon. friend <lb/>
hoped to accomplish what he, in com<lb break="no"/>mon with ourselves, had long aimed
at. <lb/>
(Hear, hear. Now, supposing the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral party of the west had refused <lb/>
the terms offered by the present Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration—if we had declined to sup<lb break="no"/>port a government which was really <lb/>
giving us nearly all we demanded—I do <lb/>
think we would have been fairly chargeable <lb/>
with creating if not advocating a state of <lb/>
anarchy. I think it would have been a most <lb/>
suicidal thing, if, having obtained—if not to <lb/>
the full extent, yet to a very great extent— <lb/>
the concession of the principle we had con<lb break="no"/>tended for so long, we had refused to accept <lb/>
the settlement offered, merely because a cer<lb break="no"/>tain number of gentlemen, to whom we had<lb/>
been strongly opposed before, were among the <lb/>
leaders of the new movement. I for one felt <lb/>
it would be quite impossible for me to main<lb break="no"/>tain my ground in Canada West, if I took <lb/>
the responsibility of acting in that way. <lb/>
Some honorable gentlemen have asserted, <lb/>
and truly asserted, that this measure is not<lb/>
as perfect as it might have been—and
that it <lb/>
is not as complete as some of us
might have<lb/>
desired it to be. It is not perhaps, consider<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
      
ing everything, in the exact form in
which <lb/>
we demanded it. But, where there are two <lb/>
great parties in a nation—as there have been <lb/>
with us—it is quite clear that,
when they <lb/>
     
agree to effect a settlement of the
constitu<lb break="no"/>tional difficulties which have separated them, <lb/>
this can only be accomplished by
mutual <lb/>
compromise to a greater or less
extent. And <lb/>
the true question to be determined in this <lb/>
discussion, and by the vote at the close of <lb/>
this debate, is this—whether this a fair com<lb break="no"/>promise or not. I am prepared to
say it is <lb/>
       
perhaps as fair as could reasonably be ex<lb break="no"/>pected, and I have therefore no
hesitation in <lb/>
giving it all the support in my power. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) In its main features it is the very <lb/>
scheme which was proposed by the Toronto <lb/>
Convention—only carried to a greater extent <lb/>
than the convention thought advisable or <lb/>
possible at the time. The speeches which <lb/>
were delivered at that convention, as well <lb/>
as the resolutions which were passed, shewed <lb/>
clearly that it was the opinion of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates there present, that a Confederation of <lb/>
the whole provinces would be desirable, if <lb/>
it were possible to attain it as speedily, as <lb/>
they expected they could obtain a Feder<lb break="no"/>ation of the two Provinces of Canada. <lb/>
That, I believe, was the sole reason <lb/>
why resolutions were not moved and adopt<lb break="no"/>ed in favor of the larger instead of the <lb/>
smaller scheme. But we have been told by <lb/>
the two hon gentlemen beside me—the hon. <lb/>
member for Chateauguay (Hon. Mr. HOLTON) <lb/>
and the honorable member for Hochelaga <lb/>
(Hon. Mr. DORION)—that the scheme of the <lb/>
Toronto Convention took no hold upon the <lb/>
public mind. As to this I have to say that <lb/>
having had as fair an opportunity
perhaps as <lb/>
most men to ascertain the feelings
of the <lb/>
people in Western Canada, I can assert, <lb/>
without any fear of contradiction by hon. <lb/>
gentlemen from that part of the country, <lb/>
that no scheme ever took a greater or more <lb/>
complete hold upon the public mind in <lb/>
Upper Canada than the scheme of the <lb/>
Toronto Convention. (Hear, hear.) And <lb/>
for the very reason that the present scheme <lb/>
is merely an expansion of that one, it has <lb/>
received almost universal approval in Canada <lb/>
West. (Hear, hear.) It is true that after <lb/>
the Toronto Convention was held, there was <lb/>
not any very strong agitation in its favor. <lb/>
But I have observed this, that at all the elec<lb break="no"/>tions which have been held subsequent to the <lb/>
convention, gentlemen who have taken the <lb/>
same side of politics as myself have been <lb/>
accustomed to say that as soon as the Lower <lb/>

 Canadians
who were opposed to representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population would agree to the scheme <lb/>
of the Toronto Convention, they were ready <lb/>
to meet them on that ground. Personally, I <lb/>
have always been in favor of a legislative <lb/>
union, where it can be advantageously work<lb break="no"/>ed. If it could be adapted to our circum<lb break="no"/>stances in these colonies, I would at this <lb/>
moment be in favor of a legislative union <lb/>
as the best system of government. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that is the general opinion of the people <lb/>
in the west. But it is the duty of every <lb/>
public man to shape his course with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to theoretical principles of government, <lb/>
according to the circumstances which may <lb/>
prevail locally. And it is quite clear that, <lb/>
if the legislative union could not be worked <lb/>
well with Upper and Lower Canada, it would <lb/>
work still worse with the other
provinces <lb/>
brought in. There remained, therefore, in <lb/>
my opinion, no other alternative
than to <lb/>
adopt the Federal principle, or to dissolve <lb/>
entirely the connection which exists between <lb/>
Upper and Lower Canada at the present <lb/>
moment ; and that I would look upon as one <lb/>
of the greatest calamities which could befall <lb/>
these provinces. Even if this scheme were <lb/>
more objectionable than it is, had I the <lb/>
alternative put before me to accept dissolu<lb break="no"/>tion of the union or to accept this, I would <lb/>
without hesitation accept Confederation <lb/>
rather than dissolution. (Hear. hear.) In <lb/>
the scheme as propounded, we have all that <lb/>
we could possibly demand in the way of <lb/>
representation in the Lower House. And, <lb/>
besides that, we have provision made for ex<lb break="no"/>tending the representation east or west, as <lb/>
occasion may require, according to the in<lb break="no"/>crease of our population shown at
the <lb/>
decennial periods for taking the census. <lb/>
Any thing fairer than that could not possibly <lb/>
be demanded. And if Lower Canada <lb/>
increases more rapidly in population <lb/>
than Canada West, she will obtain
re<lb break="no"/>presentation accordingly. For, although <lb/>
the number of her members can not be <lb/>
changed from sixty-five, the
proportion of <lb/>
that number to the whole will be changed <lb/>
relatively to the progress of the
various colo<lb break="no"/>nies. On the other hand if we extend, as I <lb/>
have no doubt we will do, westward, towards <lb/>
the centre of the continent, we will obtain a <lb/>
large population for our Confederation in the <lb/>
west. In that quarter we must look
for <lb/>
the largest increase of our
population in <lb/>
British America, and before many years elapse <lb/>
the centre of population and power will tend <lb/>
westward much farther than most people  <lb/>
           

            <cb/> 
        
now think. The increase in the represen<lb break="no"/>tation is therefore almost certain to be chiefly <lb/>
in the west, and every year will add to the <lb/>
influence and power of Western Canada, as <lb/>
well as to her trade and commerce. The <lb/>
most important question that arises relates <lb/>
to the constitution of the Upper House. It <lb/>
is said that in this particular the scheme is <lb/>
singularly defective—that there has been a <lb/>
retrograde movement in going back from <lb/>
the elective to the nominative system. I <lb/>
admit that this statement is a fair one from <lb/>
those who contended long for the applica<lb break="no"/>tion of the elective principle to the Upper <lb/>
House ; but it can have no weight with <lb/>
another large class, who, like myself, never <lb/>
believed in the wisdom of electing the <lb/>
members of two Houses of Parliament with <lb/>
coordinate powers. I have always
believed <lb/>
that a change from the present
system was <lb/>
inevitable, even with our present political <lb/>
organization. (Hear, hear.) The constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of an Upper House or Senate seems to <lb/>
have originated in the state of society which <lb/>
prevailed in feudal times ; and
from being <lb/>
the sole legislative body—or at least the most <lb/>
powerful—in the State, it has imperceptibly <lb/>
become less powerful, or secondary in impor<lb break="no"/>tance to the lower chamber, as the mass of <lb/>
the people became more intelligent, and <lb/>
popular rights became more fully
understood. <lb/>
Where there is an Upper House it manifestly <lb/>
implies on the part of its members peculiar <lb/>
duties or peculiar rights. In Great Britain, <lb/>
for instance, there is a large class of landed <lb/>
proprietors, who have long held almost all <lb/>
the landed property of the country in their <lb/>
hands, and who have to pay an immense <lb/>
amount of taxes. The fiscal legislation of <lb/>
Britain for many years has tended to the <lb/>
reduction of impost and excise duties on <lb/>
articles of prime necessity, and to the impo<lb break="no"/>sition of heavy taxes on landed property and <lb/>
incomes. Under such a financial system, <lb/>
there are immense interests at stake, and the <lb/>
House of Lords being the highest judicial <lb/>
tribunal in the kingdom, there is a combi<lb break="no"/>nation of peculiar rights and peculiar duties <lb/>
appertaining to the class represented which <lb/>
amply justify its maintenance. We have no <lb/>
such interests, and we impose no
such duties, <lb/>
and hence the Upper House becomes a mere <lb/>
court of revision, or one of coordinate juris<lb break="no"/>diction ; as the latter it is not required ; to <lb/>
become the former, it should be constituted <lb/>
differently from the House of Assembly. <lb/>
The United States present the example of <lb/>
a community socially similar to ourselves, <lb/>
           

            <pb n="426" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-23_Page_0426.jpg"/>

 establishing an Upper House. They have— <lb/>
reasoning doubtless from the same premises <lb/>
—not only given the legislatures of the <lb/>
respective states the power of nominating <lb/>
the members of the Senate, but have also <lb/>
given that body powers entirely different
<lb/>
from those possessed by the elective branch. <lb/>
It is a remarkable fact that there is only one <lb/>
other government in Europe which has a <lb/>
system similar to Great Britain, and that is <lb/>
Sweden. There is another class, represented <lb/>
by a number of the German nations. There <lb/>
are Wurtemburg, Hesse Darmstadt, Prussia, <lb/>
Saxony, Hanover, Baden and Bavaria, with <lb/>
an aggregate population of about 30,000,000, <lb/>
whose Upper Chambers are partly hereditary, <lb/>
partly nominative, and partly <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex-officio</hi>. The <lb/>
purely hereditary principle, as found in <lb/>
Great Britain and Sweden, obtains among a <lb/>
population of some 32,000,000. Then there <lb/>
is another class nominated by the Crown for <lb/>
life from a list chosen by intermediate <lb/>
bodies. The councils choose three lists and <lb/>
the Sovereign nominates therefrom. In this <lb/>
way, Spain, Brazil and the new nation of <lb/>
Roumania, composed of the Turkish princi<lb break="no"/>palities of Moldavia and Wallachia, appoint <lb/>
their Upper Houses—Spain, with a popula<lb break="no"/>tion of 16,301,850 ; Brazil, 7,677,800 ; Rou<lb break="no"/>mania, 3,578,000 ; altogether
27,556,650. <lb/>
There is another class where the members of <lb/>
the Senate are nominated for life, where the <lb/>
number is limited, and where some few <lb/>
members of the royal family have the privi<lb break="no"/>lege of sitting as members. Italy, with a <lb/>
population of 21,777,334 ; Portugal, 3,584, <lb/>
677 ; Servia, 1,098,281 ; Austria, 34,000,000. <lb/>
This class represents altogether a population <lb/>
of 61,460,292. Then there is another class <lb/>
where the members are elected for a term of <lb/>
years, and it is a remarkable fact in this con<lb break="no"/>nection that the countries I refer to are, with <lb/>
the exception of three British colonies and one <lb/>
monarchy, entirely republican. The one mon<lb break="no"/>archy in the list that elects its Upper Cham<lb break="no"/>ber in this way, is Belgium ; but Belgium, <lb/>
although a monarchy, is well known to be <lb/>
one of the most democratic countries in Eu<lb break="no"/>rope. This list includes Switzerland, whose <lb/>
people number 2,534,242 La Plata, 1,171,<lb break="no"/>800 ; Chili, 1,558,319 ; Peru, 2,865,000 ; <lb/>
United States, 30,000,000 ; Liberia, 500,000 ; <lb/>
Belgium, 4,529,000 ; South Australia, 126,<lb break="no"/>830 ; Tasmania, 89,977 ; Victoria, 540,322<lb/>
—having a total population of 43,915,490.<lb/>
In Nassau we find the Upper Chamber partly<lb/>
nominative and partly <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex-officio</hi>, the
popula<lb break="no"/>tion being 457,571. Then there's
Denmark, <lb/>
           

            <cb/>    
          
 with a partly nominative and partly elec<lb break="no"/>tive system, the elections being held by the  <lb/>
Provincial Councils, the population being
<lb/>
1,600,000 ; while in the Netherlands, with a <lb/>
       
 population of 3,372,652, the members are  <lb/>
elected entirely by the Provincial Councils. <lb/>
         
In one of the British colonies, New South
<lb/>
          
 Wales, the members are nominated for a
term <lb/>
    
 of years ; whilst in two of the youngest
and <lb/>
         
most enterprising of the British
colonies, <lb/>
       
 New Zealand and Queensland, they have the
<lb/>
      
system which we propose to adopt, of
nomina<lb break="no"/>ting a limited number of members for
life. <lb/>
          There is evidently room here for great <lb/>
           latitude of opinion as to the
constitution of <lb/>
the Upper Chamber, and I do not think we <lb/>
           can be fairly charged with retrogression<lb/>
         because we choose to make the members of <lb/>
our Upper House nominative
instead of elec<lb break="no"/>tive. Our people comprise but one class,
and <lb/>
if the members of the two chambers are to be <lb/>
chosen by the same electors, it is very clear
<lb/>
that it will be extremely difficult for both to <lb/>
maintain their individuality, possessing
simi<lb break="no"/>lar powers and privileges, and avoid collisions. <lb/>
It is evident that two chambers which have <lb/>
originated in precisely the same way, will <lb/>
claim to exercise the same rights and privi<lb break="no"/>leges, and to discharge the same functions ; <lb/>
but were the Upper Chamber nominative, <lb/>
instead of elective, the jurisdiction of that <lb/>
chamber would be, of course, correspondingly <lb/>
changed, and the chances of collision made <lb/>
more remote. There are quite a number of
<lb/>
states (some of them very considerable in <lb/>
size and population, and of recent origin) <lb/>
which have dispensed with an Upper Cham<lb break="no"/>ber altogether. I confess my arguments would <lb/>
lead to the adoption of this system, as the one <lb/>
most suited to our circumstances. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) The nations which have adopted this <lb/>
system are Hesse Cassel, with a population of  <lb/>
726,000 ; Luxemburg, 413,000 ; Saxe Cobourg,<lb/>
mar, 273,000; Saxe Meiningen, 172,000;
<lb/>
Saxe Altenburg, 137,000; Saxe Cobourg, <lb/>
159,000 ; Brunswick, 273,000 ; Mecklenburg <lb/>
Schwerin, 548,000 ; Norway, 1,328,471 ; <lb/>
         Mecklenburg Streilitz, 99,060 ;
Oldenburg, <lb/>
295,245 ; Anhalt, 181,824 ; Lippe-Detmold,<lb/>
108,513 ; Waldeck, 58,000 ; Schwarzburg,<lb/>
71,913 ; and in the kingdom of Greece, with <lb/>
a population of 1,096,810, where a new con<lb break="no"/>stitution has been recently adopted, the states<lb break="no"/>men of that country have, after some experi<lb break="no"/>ence of the duplicate system,
resolved to <lb/>
legislate with a single chamber. But while
<lb/>
it is my opinion that we would be better without
<lb/>
an Upper House, I know that the question is

 not, at the present moment, what is the
best <lb/>
possible form of government,
according to our <lb/>
particular opinions, but what is the best that <lb/>
can be framed for a community holding dif<lb break="no"/>ferent views on the subject. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Hear, hear. That <lb/>
is the point, and therefore I accept, as a fair <lb/>
compromise, a second chamber nominated by <lb/>
the Confederate Cabinet. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—One honorable <lb/>
member—I think the honorable member for <lb/>
Lotbiniere (Mr. JOLY)—used the
argument <lb/>
that the Federal system was a weak one. I <lb/>
do not think the Federal system is necessarily <lb/>
a weak one ; but it is a system which requires <lb/>
a large degree of intelligence
and political <lb/>
knowledge on the part of the
people, and I <lb/>
think it was entirely unfair on the part of the <lb/>
honorable member to compare our probable <lb/>
prospects in the future, under
Confederation, <lb/>
with the past history of the Spanish republics <lb/>
          
in South America. We have in this country
<lb/>
a population habituated to
self-government, <lb/>
and this entirely destroys the parallel sought <lb/>
to be instituted. For my part, I hold it would <lb/>
be altogether impossible for the
honorable <lb/>
member for South Oxford, for instance, or <lb/>
some other honorable members we
know of, to <lb/>
carry on the same agitation in any of
the <lb/>
South American republics—(laughter)—that <lb/>
we have seen them doing in Upper
Canada, <lb/>
without producing a complete
revolution, and <lb/>
instead of my honorable friend (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
BROWN) finding himself at the head of a <lb/>
newspaper, controlling his
columns, he would <lb/>
find himself at the head of an
army marshal<lb break="no"/>ling its columns. (Laughter.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:GALT1">Hon. MR. GALT</persName>—He would, perhaps, be <lb/>
found issuing a <hi rendition="simple:italic">pronunciamento</hi>. (Laughter.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—Yes, a <hi rendition="simple:italic">pronuncia<lb break="no"/>mento</hi> would undoubtedly be the
legitimate <lb/>
result in such a state of
society. The fact is, <lb/>
we cannot compare such a population with <lb/>
those who are educated to our own
form of <lb/>
government. I have time and again
attended <lb/>
political meetings with my
honorable friends <lb/>
opposite, and after seven or
eight hours in<lb break="no"/>dulging in strong language, and
sometimes <lb/>
bitter enough speeches, the
people have separ<lb break="no"/>ated quietly without any personal
feeling <lb/>
being entertained the one against
the other. <lb/>
fore, then, asserting that the people of
this <lb/>
country are incapable of
governing themselves, <lb/>
or that the Federal principle is
a weak one, it <lb/>
is necessary to prove that we are
not more <lb/>
civilised than were the people of
South <lb/>
America thirty years ago. (Hear,
hear.) I <lb/>
         assume,
therefore, that it is necessary to <lb/>
           

            <cb/> 
          
prove that our people are less civilised
than <lb/>
the populations of the South American re<lb break="no"/>publics were thirty years ago, or that they <lb/>
have already shown an incapacity for govern<lb break="no"/>ing themselves before we can receive the as<lb break="no"/>sertion that the Federal principle as proposed <lb/>
to be applied in our case is a weak one. If <lb/>
the honorable member based his argument <lb/>
against the Confederation on the question of <lb/>
weakness or strength as exemplified in exist<lb break="no"/>ing governments, he would be bound to ac<lb break="no"/>cept Russia as the model for his government, <lb/>
there being no stronger government on the <lb/>
face of the earth. But a despotism is only <lb/>
possible where the people are ignorant, and <lb/>
an attempt to establish a republic among such <lb/>
a people would be out of the question,—it <lb/>
would only produce weakness. Were a re<lb break="no"/>public to be established at this moment in <lb/>
Russia, it would occasion a state
of anarchy, <lb/>
because the people are too ignorant to exercise <lb/>
intelligently the franchise bestowed upon<lb/>
them. It is for this reason
unfair to institute<lb/>
comparisons between these unfortunate re<lb break="no"/>publics and the proposed government for the <lb/>
people of British North America. I am <lb/>
certain that, if there were a Federal union be<lb break="no"/>tween all the colonies of British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca, extending even across the continent to our <lb/>
western confines, although great inconvenience <lb/>
might be experienced by such an extension, <lb/>
we would find a law-abiding people capable of <lb/>
self-government, in all parts of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eracy. (Hear, hear.) The example of the <lb/>
United States has been appealed to, and it is <lb/>
true that when the war commenced, when <lb/>
they found themselves unable to enforce their <lb/>
laws in some portion of the states, that it <lb/>
did seem to prove to the minds
of those who <lb/>
did not understand the people, and to the <lb/>
writers of certain newspapers in England, that <lb/>
there was an inherent weakness in the system.<lb/>
There is no doubt that there were some indi<lb break="no"/>cations of such weakness, and the conflict of <lb/>
sovereignty between states and the Federal <lb/>
Government did produce weakness. But I <lb/>
think the attitude of the people of the Nor<lb break="no"/>thern States fully shows that even with the <lb/>
imperfections of their system, which will be <lb/>
admitted, and which imperfections are avoided <lb/>
in the scheme now before the House—even <lb/>
with these imperfections, a strength, a power, <lb/>
and a vigor have been displayed, which have <lb/>
silenced even the attacks of hostile criticism. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) The Federal system, then, can<lb break="no"/>not be said to be a failure with our race, <lb/>
neither can it be said to be a failure in Switz<lb break="no"/>erland. This was admitted in a measure
by <lb/>

the honorable member for Lotbinière, but <lb/>
that honorable gentleman gave as a reason for <lb/>
its apparent success, that Switzerland was <lb/>
surrounded by a number of powerful nations. <lb/>
I think, on the other hand, that the reason <lb/>
assigned would be the very cause of a failure <lb/>
of the system in Switzerland. The govern<lb break="no"/>ment of that country would have broken down <lb/>
long ago if there was any inherent weakness <lb/>
in the form of the constitution, in consequence <lb/>
of the hostile systems which surrounded it. <lb/>
The fact of the Swiss maintaining their inde<lb break="no"/>pendence so long and conducting the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of their affairs so well
and cheaply, is <lb/>
an evidence to my mind that the Federal sys<lb break="no"/>tem of government is not weak where the <lb/>
people are trained and educated to under<lb break="no"/>stand and appreciate the benefits of self-gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. (Hear, hear.) Then, sir, we are <lb/>
assured that all sorts of calamities will over<lb break="no"/>take us if we change our Constitution, and <lb/>
many of the honorable gentlemen who pro<lb break="no"/>phecy these evil results will no doubt, like <lb/>
many other prophets, do all they can to bring <lb/>
their predictions to pass. (Hear, hear.) This <lb/>
is not the first time in the history of the <lb/>
world that prophecies of this kind have been <lb/>
indulged in. I was a good deal amused the <lb/>
other night in reading the discussions which <lb/>
took place in the Scottish Parliament on the <lb/>
occasion of the proposed union with England <lb/>
in 1707 ; and in perusing one of the speeches <lb/>
in particular, I could not help remarking the <lb/>
coincidence betwen the tone therein assumed <lb/>
and that adopted by Her Majesty's loyal Can<lb break="no"/>adian Opposition. The speaker, Lord BEL<lb break="no"/>HAVEN, used this language in depicting the <lb/>
dire calamities which he imagined would be<lb break="no"/>fall Scotland by joining her
fortunes to Eng<lb break="no"/>land :— </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>MY LORD CHANCELLOR,—I think I see our

rectifications they may meet with. I think I see <lb/>
the valiant and gallant soldiery either sent to <lb/>
learn the plantation trade abroad, or at home pe<lb break="no"/>titioning for a small subsistence as the reward of <lb/>
their honourable exploits, while their old corps <lb/>
are broken, the common soldiers left to beg, and <lb/>
the youngest English corps kept standing. I <lb/>

 by counter petitions. In short, I think I see the <lb/>
laborious ploughman, with his corn spoiling upon <lb/>
his hands for want of sale, cursing the day of his <lb/>
birth, dreading the expense of his burial—(laugh<lb break="no"/>ter)—and uncertain whether to
marry or do worse. <lb/>
(Much laughter.) I think I see the incurable dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties of landed men, fettered under the golden <lb/>
chain of equivalents, their pretty daughters pe<lb break="no"/>titioning for want of husbands—(laughter)—and
<lb/>
their sons for want of employment. I think I see <lb/>
our mariners delivering up their ships to their <lb/>
Dutch partners, and what through presses and <lb/>
necessity, earning their bread as underlings in <lb/>
the royal English navy. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> And here, Mr. SPEAKER, comes the climax, <lb/>
and if I were asked to point to one of <lb/>
the <hi rendition="simple:italic">dramatis personæ</hi> in our Canadian House <lb/>
of Assembly fitted to take part in a similar <lb/>
scene as is here depicted, I should unhesitat<lb break="no"/>ingly turn to the honorable member for Cha<lb break="no"/>teauguay (Hon. Mr. HOLTON), who could <lb/>
more suitably than any one else I know per<lb break="no"/>sonate Lord BELHAVEN when he exclaims : <lb/>
"But above all, my Lord, I think I see our <lb/>
ancient mother Caledonia, like CAESAR,
sit<lb break="no"/>ting in the midst of our Senate,
ruefully <lb/>
looking round about her, covering herself <lb/>
with her royal garment, attending to the fatal <lb/>
blow and breathing out her last with <hi rendition="simple:italic">et tu <lb/>
quoque mi fili</hi>." (Laughter.) It must have <lb/>
seemed very strange for the statesmen of <lb/>
Scotland, who saw in the union of the two <lb/>
kingdoms all the evidences of coming power <lb/>
and grandeur, to have heard expressed such <lb/>
desponding sentiments as these. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) No doubt the majority saw in the <lb/>
union which they were then about to consum<lb break="no"/>mate, the strength which subsequently grew <lb/>
out of that union, and the influence and <lb/>
greatness by which it would be attended. <lb/>
At the time of the union Scotland had only a <lb/>
revenue of £150,000 per annum, and last <lb/>
year she contributed to the British cxchequer <lb/>
nearly £7,000,000. (Hear, hear.) This, <lb/>
however, is but one instance of the benefit of <lb/>
the union, which has worked to the fullest <lb/>
extent as well as could possibly be desired. <lb/>
If necessary I could bring forward many ar<lb break="no"/>guments to prove that, in the same manner, <lb/>
union between different peoples who are geo<lb break="no"/>graphically situated so as to favor it, adds to <lb/>
their strength, and makes them greater and <lb/>
more powerful than they could possibly hope <lb/>
to become in their several states of separation
<lb/>
and isolation. (Hear, hear.) I
am quite<lb/>
aware, sir, that in a matter of this kind it is <lb/>
exceedingly easy to make objections. There
<lb/>
can be nothing easier than to carp at a set of<lb/>
resolutions like these. It would not be diffi<lb break="no"/>

 cult to spend hours in captious criticism
as to <lb/>
the details of such a scheme as is proposed. <lb/>
But I think we may fairly call on those gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who criticise in a hostile spirit a <lb/>
measure of this character, to say what else <lb/>
they propose to do ; for, if we cannot carry <lb/>
this into practical operation now, it is quite <lb/>
evident something else must be devised. I re<lb break="no"/>collect that last year, when the
present ad<lb break="no"/>ministration came down to the House pro<lb break="no"/>posing such a plan for settling our difficulties, <lb/>
and received, as I for one imagined, the sanc<lb break="no"/>tion of this House, I remarked that the <lb/>
course of the House was a revolutionary one, <lb/>
the revolution to be a peaceable one certainly, <lb/>
but still a revolution. It implied the opinion <lb/>
on the part of our public men, that our <lb/>
present system could not be gone on with ; <lb/>
and if our present system cannot be continued, <lb/>
we ought not to attempt to throw out this <lb/>
measure merely because it does not entirely <lb/>
meet the views of every member of this <lb/>
House. (Hear.) I think it would
have been <lb/>
desirable that all the members from Lower <lb/>
Canada should have united with us and <lb/>
studied out a new system, and gone to <lb/>
work earnestly to give it effect by the ne<lb break="no"/>cessary legislation. (Hear.) I did hope <lb/>
that when the measure came down and we <lb/>
met this session to discuss it, it would not <lb/>
have been thought necessary by any one to <lb/>
organize a regular opposition. Certainly I <lb/>
did not expect that honorable gentlemen like <lb/>
the honorable members for Hochelaga and <lb/>
Chateauguay, who have hitherto appeared to <lb/>
recognise the gravity of our constitutional dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties, or have at least
asserted that they <lb/>
did, would have found it necessary to go into <lb/>
unqualified opposition. I rather thought they <lb/>
would have endeavored to give
effect to the <lb/>
measure as the only remedial one within our <lb/>
reach. (Hear, hear.) It is not because I <lb/>
think the measure entirely faultless that I <lb/>
propose to give it my utmost support, but be<lb break="no"/>cause I believe every other measure to be im<lb break="no"/>possible now, and because, under the proposed <lb/>
government, the country has a great future <lb/>
before it. Looking at the matter
commer<lb break="no"/>cially, as a question of comparative cheapness,<lb/>
we shall not be, to say the least, any worse off<lb/>
than at the present moment. I believe we <lb/>
shall be able to govern as
cheaply united as <lb/>
we now do separately. I apprehend there will <lb/>
be no necessity in the Local Legislature for <lb/>
more than one chamber, and although this <lb/>
branch of the subject has not
been discussed <lb/>
in the House, and we do not know what the <lb/>
propositions of the Government are to be, I <lb/>
           

            <cb/>    
         
 may take occasion to say that I hope they
<lb/>
will not think of adopting the
double system <lb/>
in our local legislatures, for it will cause a <lb/>
serious increase of expenditure, not attended <lb/>
with a corresponding benefit. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
The honorable member for Montreal Centre <lb/>
devoted a large portion of his speech last <lb/>
night to the military side of the question, and <lb/>
argued very strongly, from the position
of the <lb/>
neighboring republic, that it
was absolutely <lb/>
indispensable for us to become a military <lb/>
power. Now, while I am not at all
disposed <lb/>
to take the view that gentleman does of the <lb/>
position of the United States relatively <lb/>
towards ourselves ; while I do not think that <lb/>
any large proportion of the people of the <lb/>
United States have hostile inclinations <lb/>
towards ourselves—though they are apt to in<lb break="no"/>dulge in language that is undoubtedly unbe<lb break="no"/>coming and certainly threatening;  while I do <lb/>
not at all anticipate they will adopt,
in so un<lb break="no"/>justifiable a manner as he seemed to expect, <lb/>
any hostile measures towards us, it is not to be <lb/>
denied that with a population of three millions <lb/>
and a half, it will be absolutely necessary for <lb/>
us to take some steps that will place us in a <lb/>
more independent position. It is not honor<lb break="no"/>able, it is not manly for so powerful a colony <lb/>
as this is to depend entirely on
the Mother <lb/>
Country for protection. (Hear, hear.) I took <lb/>
occasion to express these views last year, when <lb/>
discussing the estimates, and said I hoped <lb/>
the Government would bring down a measure <lb/>
to pay a large portion of the expenditure at<lb break="no"/>tendant on the maintenance, by the Imperial <lb/>
Government, of British troops among us. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) Portugal, with a population as <lb/>
nearly as can be equal to our own, has a <lb/>
standing army of 17,000 men. Holland, with <lb/>
about the same population as ourselves at <lb/>
home, but with extensive colonies abroad, has <lb/>
a standing army of 57,600 men. Denmark, <lb/>
with a population not quite equal to one half <lb/>
what the Confederacy will possess, has an <lb/>
army of 22,900 men. Now I do not think it <lb/>
will be at all necessary for us to maintain a <lb/>
standing army like these nations. I do not <lb/>
think we are in the same position as these <lb/>
countries, because our wealth is, to a great <lb/>
extent, not realized. It would be hardly fair <lb/>
to assess some of our new counties, where <lb/>
people own nothing but their land, at the <lb/>
nominal value of that land, for the purpose of <lb/>
paying a large standing army; and besides we <lb/>
have no colonies, no outside sources of wealth. <lb/>
I think, however, we are nearly as well able, <lb/>
man for man, to maintain a force necessary<lb/>
for our defence as the people of
Great Bri<lb break="no"/>

tain, and whatever measure the
Confederate <lb/>
Government may propose of a moderate, rea<lb break="no"/>sonable nature, will, I am convinced, receive <lb/>
the support of the majority of the people of <lb/>
this country. (Hear, hear, and cheers.) I ap<lb break="no"/>prehend it is not looking at all too far forward <lb/>
to think of the day when another colony to <lb/>
the westward of Canada West will
come into <lb/>
the union. I am of course unaware what <lb/>
papers may be brought down by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in reference to the North-West and the <lb/>
Hudson's Bay Territory, but I hope when <lb/>
they do come down they will show some <lb/>
progress in that direction, in raising that <lb/>
magnificent country from the state in which <lb/>
it now is. I hope some system will be put into <lb/>
operation for extending roads and telegraphs <lb/>
to that country, so as to open it up for settle<lb break="no"/>ment by our own young men and immigrants <lb/>
coming from Europe. The question of the <lb/>
North-West is most intimately connected with <lb/>
our prosperity as a people, and some exception <lb/>
has justly been taken to the 68th and 69th <lb/>
paragraphs in the resolutions, which say :— <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—Yes, that is the <lb/>
point my hon. friend is very much exercised <lb/>
over, but he is quite as much in favor of Con<lb break="no"/>federation as I am. In this paragraph, while <lb/>
it is pronounced indispensable to have the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway built at once, it is only <lb/>
promised that as soon as the state of the <lb/>
finances will permit, the North-West is to be <lb/>
taken in hand. I think it is absolutely neces<lb break="no"/>sary for the prosperity of this colony that our <lb/>
canal connection with the upper lakes should <lb/>
be perfected as early as possible. Our canal <lb/>
system must be improved so as to accommo<lb break="no"/>date the large trade that is coming from the <lb/>
North-West. On the northern shores of Lake <lb/>
Superior we have sources of wealth that are <lb/>
perfectly inexhaustible. We read only the <lb/>
other day that a mountain of iron had been <lb/>
discovered close to the coast, quite sufficient
<lb/>
to supply the demands of the world for 500 <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
          
years. We have in that locality an
abundant <lb/>
supply of minerals of all kinds, and unless our <lb/>
canals are made capable of carrying that <lb/>
traffic, it will necessarily find channels in <lb/>
another direction. (Hear.) There
is an <lb/>
agitation among a portion of the community <lb/>
for making a new canal from Toronto to the <lb/>
Georgian Bay, and I admit it is very desir<lb break="no"/>able it should be constructed, though I do <lb/>
not think it ever can be ; and even if
it could be, <lb/>
it is entirely beyond our resources at the <lb/>
present time. I am convinced that the true <lb/>
route for a canal (if a new one should be un<lb break="no"/>dertaken) to the Georgian Bay is up the <lb/>
Ottawa, because that would be giving a great <lb/>
backbone to the country. If we had a fine <lb/>
canal, capable of carrying vessels of war in <lb/>
that direction, it would be a splendid means <lb/>
of defence, as well as a great highway for the <lb/>
commercial products of the west. Of course <lb/>
I know this to be impossible at the present <lb/>
time, but I think it exceedingly desirable that <lb/>
we should press on the attention of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, with all the influence that can be <lb/>
brought to bear, the necessity for having this <lb/>
69th article attended to, though I am not <lb/>
inclined to go farther than that now. (Hear.) <lb/>
The importance of perfecting the present and <lb/>
other highways to the centre of the continent <lb/>
must be so apparent to all parts of our com<lb break="no"/>mon country, that I see no reason to fear that<lb/>
the subject will not receive due attention from <lb/>
the Confederate Government at the earliest <lb/>
moment. As regards the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way, I have taken some little
interest in that, <lb/>
as knew that I would be compelled to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss it on approaching this subject, and, in <lb/>
examining the maps and reports of Major <lb/>
ROBINSON, I find that there is no difficulty
<lb/>
whatever in arriving at a conclusion as to the <lb/>
comparative cost. The route that is most <lb/>
feasible—that alluded to by the honorable <lb/>
member for Richelieu—the northern or eastern <lb/>
route by the Bay of Chaleurs, is about 655 <lb/>
miles from Halifax to Quebec. It is already <lb/>
constructed to Truro, some 55 miles from <lb/>
Halifax, and from Quebec 140 miles to <lb/>
Rivière du Loup. This will leave nearly 400 <lb/>
miles to be built. Major ROBINSON estimates <lb/>
the cost of the road at about £7,000 per mile, <lb/>
or about £2,800,000 altogether. I do not <lb/>
think, judging from the statement he gives of <lb/>
the grades in the road, the bridges to be built, <lb/>
and the material to be found along the line, <lb/>
that it is a fair inference that the cost would <lb/>
equal the amount he sets down. The charac<lb break="no"/>ter of the ground over which the road will <lb/>
pass is very similar to the railways of Canada. <lb/>
            </p>


            <pb n="431" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-23_Page_0431.jpg"/>

 <p> It is represented to be very much of the <lb/>
nature of the country through which the <lb/>
Great Western runs westward of Hamilton <lb/>
over a great portion of the line. The best <lb/>
portion of the line is equal to the worst por<lb break="no"/>tions of the Great Western. Even at the cost <lb/>
of £7,000 per mile the expense of constructing <lb/>
the entire road would be a little over fifteen <lb/>
millions of dollars. The proportion of that <lb/>
payable by Canada would be about nine mil<lb break="no"/>lions. I think it is extremely probable that <lb/>
when we obtain the report of the engineers <lb/>
sent out by our Government, it will be found <lb/>
that a very large portion can be constructed <lb/>
for much less than £7,000 per mile. But, <lb/>
whatever the sum may amount to, it is per<lb break="no"/>fectly clear that without the road there can <lb/>
be no union of the provinces. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
It is equally clear that on that road there is a <lb/>
very large proportion of the country that is <lb/>
exceedingly desirable for settlement, and that <lb/>
only awaits the opening up of some means of <lb/>
communication with the markets. Major <lb/>
ROBINSON reports that on one portion of it— <lb/>
and I confess that I was not aware of the fact <lb/>
until I examined the report more closely to<lb break="no"/>day—that there is a tract of country along <lb/>
the New Brunswick portion of the line not <lb/>
excelled for timber or land in any part of the <lb/>
world that he ever saw. (Hear, hear.) I do <lb/>
not propose taking up the time of the House <lb/>
by reading from this valuable report, but <lb/>
estimates are given showing the
amount of <lb/>
population that these districts will support <lb/>
when properly settled. He shows that the <lb/>
country, if the road is once carried through, <lb/>
will be settled very rapidly. I do not, how<lb break="no"/>ever, expect that that road can
possibly pay <lb/>
as a commercial enterprise for a long time to <lb/>
come, and I do not desire to deceive myself <lb/>
or deceive any other person on that point. <lb/>
That it will be of importance more as a mili<lb break="no"/>tary work than for any other
purpose, nobody <lb/>
can deny. In 1862, when I opposed the pro<lb break="no"/>position to construct the road, I then felt that <lb/>
this was an argument that could fairly be used <lb/>
in its favor. Military authorities are still <lb/>
unanimously of opinion that its construction <lb/>
would be of great importance as a means of <lb/>
protection in case of
hostilities. The most <lb/>
important reason, however, why it should be <lb/>
constructed, in addition to the military reason, <lb/>
is, that without its construction there can be <lb/>
no union of the provinces, and without a <lb/>
Federal union of the provinces we cannot hope <lb/>
to obtain a settlement of our
sectional difficul<lb break="no"/>ties. The one is dependent upon the other, <lb/>
and I believe the people of Canada are willing <lb/>
         

            <cb/> 
     
 to accept
the conclusion that this argument ne<lb break="no"/>cessarily leads us to engage in the construction <lb/>
of that road. (Hear, hear.) I do not propose <lb/>
to-night to indulge much in figures relative to <lb/>
what our condition will be, financially, after <lb/>
this measure is carried out ; but the honorable <lb/>
member for Hochelaga made some statements <lb/>
that I can scarcely allow to pass. He was <lb/>
understood to say that Lower Canada came <lb/>
into the union without any debt, and was to <lb/>
go out with thirty millions of dollars of debt, <lb/>
while only some twelve millions of dollars were <lb/>
expended in that section of the province. <lb/>
Now, sir, there has been spent altogether on <lb/>
the canals of Canada $20,813,304.03 ; on <lb/>
roads and bridges in Canada West, $562,866,
<lb/>
and on roads and bridges in Canada East, <lb/>
$1,163,829.34 ; on the government buildings <lb/>
at Ottawa there have already been paid over <lb/>
$1,513,412.56 ; and on railroads there have <lb/>
been spent altogether $29,910,825.16, or <lb/>
altogether about $53,964,236.79.
Now, I <lb/>
think that one-half of this enormous amount <lb/>
is fairly chargeable to Lower Canada. One- <lb break="yes"/>
half or a little more than that of the works <lb/>
on which the money was spent are situated in <lb/>
Lower Canada, and, if we include the Victoria <lb/>
Bridge, it is considerably more than one-half. <lb/>
Besides these, however, there are quite a num<lb break="no"/>ber of other items which I do not take into <lb/>
account. There is the Quebec Fire Loan, <lb/>
and a deficiency in a number of special funds <lb/>
that I will not take any notice of at this <lb/>
time. Then take it from another point of <lb/>
view. From a return made to Parliament, we <lb/>
find that the entire cost of improving the <lb/>
navigation in Upper Canada, including the <lb/>
cost of light-houses, canals, &amp;c.,
altogether <lb/>
amounted to $7,022,665.61 ; that
the revenue <lb/>
derived from Upper Canada harbors and <lb/>
canals has been $4,887,291.73 ;
leaving a <lb/>
balance against Upper Canada of $2,145,<lb break="no"/>373.88. In Lower Canada, during
the same <lb/>
period, the expenditure has been $4,484,<lb break="no"/>566.52, while there was a revenue of <lb/>
$708,086.80, leaving a balance against Lower <lb/>
Canada of $4,176,479.72. I give these <lb/>
figures simply to prove that the position taken <lb/>
by the honorable member for Hochelaga was <lb/>
entirely incorrect ; but it would be superfluous <lb/>
to do that if I were to allude to one item <lb/>
which he gave when he was comparing the <lb/>
amount of debt that we would have to pay <lb/>
per head of our population, compared with <lb/>
that of Great Britain. The amount per head <lb/>
with us is about $25, and he gravely told the <lb/>
House that the amount per head in Great <lb/>
Britain was only $37. when every person <lb/>
          

            <pb n="432" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-23_Page_0432.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">482</fw>
           
 knows or ought to know that it is about <lb/>
$140. Nevertheless he drew a comparison <lb/>
showing that while the comparatively poor <lb/>
people of Canada would have to pay $25 <lb/>
per head, the rich people of Great Brit<lb break="no"/>ain had only $37 to pay. It is very re<lb break="no"/>markable, however, that the whole of this <lb/>
portion of the honorable gentleman's speech <lb/>
was omitted from the report given in the <lb/>
papers next morning. I do not propose to go <lb/>
into these figures, but merely to refer to a few <lb/>
facts to place the assertions made by that <lb/>
honorable gentleman in their true light before <lb/>
the House. Our debt is indeed very large, <lb/>
and we could all wish that it was very much <lb/>
less than it is, but we have got to bear it and <lb/>
to pay it, and must do the best we can under <lb/>
the circumstances. The measure of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, in my opinion, will not add to nor <lb/>
yet lessen it, except what may be incurred for <lb/>
the construction of the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way. lt is quite possible, of course, that we <lb/>
may undertake enormous expenditures for <lb/>
public works calculated to open up and <choice><sic>de<lb break="no"/>velope</sic><corr>develop</corr></choice> the resources of the country, and thus <lb/>
soon render our debt much heavier than at pres<lb break="no"/>ent, and it will be a question for the Govenment <lb/>
that may be established after Confederation, <lb/>
to decide how far it will be wise or prudent to <lb/>
undertake works of great cost until we shall <lb/>
have a good surplus in hand. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
One of the objections urged by the opponents <lb/>
of the measure is, that it is being hurried <lb/>
through too fast—that in a matter of so much <lb/>
much importance to present and future gener<lb break="no"/>ations, more time for consideration should be <lb/>
given. We have been discussing
this question <lb/>
for many years in Canada West. Since the <lb/>
Toronto Convention of 1859, the question has <lb/>
been continuously before the people. It is now <lb/>
nearly a year since it was proposed in some<lb break="no"/>thing like its present shape in this House, and <lb/>
since that time the whole of our
newspapers <lb/>
have been writing upon it continually. We <lb/>
have nearly 300 newspapers in the country— <lb/>
and they have been carrying on a constant <lb/>
        
argument for or against the scheme, until
I <lb/>
do not think it is possible to say or write much <lb/>
more upon the subject with any advantage. <lb/>
If the question is not now fully understood, <lb/>
I fear it will not be much better understood <lb/>
by any delay that can be now accorded. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) Another objection
raised is, <lb/>
that a measure of such vast importance ought <lb/>
not to be carried through without its first <lb/>
being submitted to the people. I have mixed <lb/>
with the people a good deal, and I have found <lb/>
the opinion all but universal amongst them, <lb/>
         

            <cb/> 
         
that it was expedient to put the measure
into <lb/>
practical operation as soon as possible. The <lb/>
peeple consider it utterly impossible to carry <lb/>
on the former violent political agitation with<lb/>
any benefit to the country, and the desire is <lb/>
general that we should get rid of the present <lb/>
constitutional difficulties and get settled down <lb/>
to some quiet and permanent way of manag<lb break="no"/>ing our governmental business and political <lb/>
discussions. (Hear, hear.) The charges that <lb/>
are made against members of this House about <lb/>
inconsistency in advocating this measure, are <lb/>
very easily met. In a country like ours, so <lb/>
full of change, with a constant agitation going <lb/>
on for constitutional changes and for new <lb/>
laws, both local and general, it is utterly im<lb break="no"/>possible that a man can remain long in public <lb/>
life without being open to charges of incon<lb break="no"/>sistency ; but if these are caused by a strong <lb/>
effort to settle the difficulties under which <lb/>
the country has been laboring, like the present <lb/>
one, I feel certain that the success of the <lb/>
measure in hand will render the charges of <lb/>
only evanescent existence. I think it exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly desirable, even for the sake of those <lb/>
people who might reasonably feel the strongest <lb/>
objections to it—I mean the English minority <lb/>
of Lower Canada, and the Catholic minority <lb/>
of Upper Canada—that it should be settled <lb/>
at once. So long as the question remains in <lb/>
its present state, there will be a constant agi<lb break="no"/>tation going on, and much injury may be <lb/>
done by the misrepresentations that will be <lb/>
indulged in, and the misapprehensions which <lb/>
will exist ; but if these people can be assured <lb/>
that the scheme provides a perfect remedy <lb/>
for any injustice that they might apprehend, <lb/>
they will immediately concur in it. As regards <lb/>
the people of Lower Canada of French ori<lb break="no"/>gin, and who are Roman Catholics, I have <lb/>
always heard it said in their favor, that a <lb/>
large degree of liberalism characterizes their <lb/>
conduct toward their Protestant neighbors. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) Lower Canada, I believe, was <lb/>
the first portion of British territory to give <lb/>
political freedom to the Jew. I believe that a <lb/>
person of this persuasion sat in the Lower <lb/>
Canada Legislature thirty years before the same <lb/>
privileges were accorded in Great Britain. <lb/>
People who charged the French Canadians <lb/>
with intolerance should remember this with <lb/>
some degree of favor. With regard to the <lb/>
people of British origin, over the whole <lb/>
Confederacy, I do not think it is at all <lb/>
necessary to defend them from any
charges<lb/>
of this kind. I do not think they will be in<lb break="no"/>clined to persecute the people of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada if they had it in their power ; but I ad<lb break="no"/>
          

            <pb n="433" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-23_Page_0433.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">433</fw>


mit that it is reasonable and just to
insert a <lb/>
provision in the scheme that will put it out of <lb/>
the power of any party to act unjustly. If <lb/>
the power that the central authority is to <lb/>
have—of vetoing the doings of the Local Leg<lb break="no"/>islature—is used, it will be ample, I think, to <lb/>
prevent anything of that kind. But the veto <lb/>
itself is objected to. It is objected
that the <lb/>
elected Legislature will be rendered powerless <lb/>
by the influence of the appointed Upper <lb/>
House exercised over them. Well, sir, under <lb/>
the British Constitution, in all British colon<lb break="no"/>ies, and in Great Britain itself,
there is a <lb/>
certain elasticity to be presumed. Every<lb break="no"/>thing is not provided for, because a great deal <lb/>
is trusted to the common sense of the people. <lb/>
I think it is quite fair and safe to assert that <lb/>
there is not the slightest danger that the <lb/>
Federal Parliament will perpetrate any injus<lb break="no"/>tice upon the local legislatures, because it <lb/>
would cause such a reaction as to compass <lb/>
the destruction of the power thus unjustly <lb/>
exercised. The veto power is necessary in <lb/>
order that the General Government may have <lb/>
a control over the proceedings of the local <lb/>
legislatures to a certain extent.
The want of <lb/>
this power was the great source of weakness
<lb/>
in the United States, and it is a want that <lb/>
will be remedied by an amendment in their <lb/>
Constitution very soon. So long as each <lb/>
state considered itself sovereign, whose acts <lb/>
and laws could not be called in question, it <lb/>
was quite clear that the central
authority was <lb/>
destitute of power to compel obedience to <lb/>
general laws. If each province were able to <lb/>
enact such laws as it pleased, everybody <lb/>
would be at the mercy of the local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures, and the General Legislature would be<lb break="no"/>come of little importance. It is contended <lb/>
that the power of the General
Legislature <lb/>
should be held in check by a veto power with <lb/>
reference to its own territory, resident in the <lb/>
local legislatures, respecting the application <lb/>
of general laws to their jurisdiction. All <lb/>
power, they say, comes from the people and <lb/>
ascends through them to their
representa<lb break="no"/>tives, and through the
representatives to the <lb/>
Crown. But it would never do to set the <lb/>
Local above the General
Government. The <lb/>
Central Parliament and Government must, of <lb/>
necessity, exercise the supreme
power, and <lb/>
the local governments will have the exercise <lb/>
of power corresponding to the duties they have <lb/>
to perform. The system is a new
and untried <lb/>
one, and may not work so harmoniously as we <lb/>
now anticipate, but there will always be power <lb/>
in the British Parliament and our own to rem<lb break="no"/>edy any defects that may be
discovered after <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
        
the system is in operation. Altogether, I
<lb/>
regard the scheme as a magnificent
one, and <lb/>
I look forward to the future with anticipa<lb break="no"/>tions of seeing a country and a government <lb/>
possessing great power and respectability, and <lb/>
of being, before I die, a citizen of an im<lb break="no"/>mense empire built up on our part of the <lb/>
North American continent, where the folds <lb/>
of the British flag will float in triumph over <lb/>
a people possessing freedom, happiness and <lb/>
prosperity equal to the people of any other na<lb break="no"/>tion on the earth. If there is anything that <lb/>
I have always felt anxious about in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, it is to have the British possessions put <lb/>
in such a position that we could safely
repose, <lb/>
without fear of danger from any quarter, <lb/>
under the banner which we believe after all <lb/>
covers the greatest amount of personal free<lb break="no"/>dom and the greatest amount of personal <lb/>
happiness that is to be found in the world. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) And when we look to the <lb/>
vast territory we have in the North-West ; <lb/>
when we know that the great rivers which flow <lb/>
through that territory, flow through immense <lb/>
beds of coal, and that the whole country is <lb/>
rich in mineral deposits of all kinds—petro<lb break="no"/>leum, copper, gold and iron ; that the land is <lb/>
teeming with resources of wealth calculated to <lb/>
build up an extensive and valuable commerce, <lb/>
and support a powerful nation ; that all this <lb/>
we can touch and seize upon the moment we <lb/>
are prepared to open up a way to
reach them <lb/>
and allow the settler to enter ; when we re<lb break="no"/>member this, I say, I think we can look for<lb break="no"/>ward with hope to a prodigious increase in <lb/>
our population and an immense development <lb/>
of strength and power. (Hear,
hear.) So <lb/>
far our people have had to contend with the <lb/>
usual difficulties common to the people of all <lb/>
new countries like ours ; but now Canada is <lb/>
beginning to assume a position of commer<lb break="no"/>cial importance, and in proportion as that <lb/>
importance increases we will be able to devote <lb/>
ourselves to the opening up and settlement <lb/>
of the interior, and to the development of a <lb/>
new nationality—to use the term that has <lb/>
been so sharply criticised—in that vast western <lb/>
country where there is hardly a white man <lb/>
living to-day. (Hear, hear.) I do not <lb/>
propose, sir, to follow the example that has <lb/>
been set of speaking four or five hours upon <lb/>
this subject. I proposed at the beginning <lb/>
briefly to give my own views in reference to <lb/>
the Confederation of these provinces, and then <lb/>
to leave the ground to other honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men. I am exceedingly desirous of seeing <lb/>
the debate proceed as rapidly as
possible ; <lb/>
and believing it will be necessary for us to <lb/>
           

            <pb n="434" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-23_Page_0434.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">434</fw>
         

speak briefly upon the question rather
than <lb/>
indulge in long set speeches, I determined to <lb/>
give an example in this respect and bring my <lb/>
remarks within reasonable bounds. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) I believe then, sir, in the first place, <lb/>
that Confederation is desirable ; in the second, <lb/>
that it is attainable ; and, in the third place, <lb/>
that it is the best thing we can get, and this <lb/>
last is perhaps the strongest reason of all for <lb/>
accepting it. It is quite clear that we must <lb/>
have a settlement of our difficulties
in some <lb/>
way, and I think the scheme proposed is a <lb/>
very favorable settlement of them. I think <lb/>
it is more than perhaps some of us expected <lb/>
at the time when the present Government was <lb/>
formed to bring about a settlement ; and I do <lb/>
think, sir, that it would be the greatest act <lb/>
of madness that western members of this <lb/>
House could perpetrate to vote against it. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) I am not, however,
afraid that <lb/>
it will be voted against by them. I believe <lb/>
that under it we have obtained representation <lb/>
by population, that we have obtained what we <lb/>
have long contended was justly due to us, that <lb/>
we have obtained our legitimate influence in <lb/>
framing the financial policy of the country, <lb/>
and that beyond this we have obtained the <lb/>
prospect of building up a great
British Union <lb/>
on this continent. We should, therefore, I <lb/>
think, in view of these great advantages, over<lb break="no"/>look those objections which may be regarded <lb/>
as antecedent to the scheme, and endeavor <lb/>
heartily to carry out the work successfully. I <lb/>
shall willingly yield my support to the scheme, <lb/>
and I believe it will be acceptable to the people <lb/>
I represent—not only to the people of the <lb/>
locality, but to those who surround me in <lb/>
Upper Canada. (Cheers.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>  <persName ref="pers:MORR1">MR. MORRIS</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, the <lb/>
member for Lambton has, I think, set a good <lb/>
example, and I shall endeavor if it be possible <lb/>
to follow it. I desire to state at the outset <lb/>
that this, as has been well observed by many <lb/>
who have spoken upon the subject, is no new <lb/>
question ; but that in one phase or another, <lb/>
as was very properly stated in the narrative <lb/>
given to the House by the honorable member <lb/>
for Montreal West, it has been before the <lb/>
people of this country from time
to time for <lb/>
many years past. It is not my intention to <lb/>
follow that honorable gentleman in his inter<lb break="no"/>esting narrative of the history of this question, <lb/>
but desire to ask the attention of the House<lb/>
to the fact that this is the third time that this<lb/>
question has been formally
brought before <lb/>
Parliament by the Government of this coun<lb break="no"/>try. The first occasion was, I believe, in <lb/>
1858, when the then Governor
General, in <lb/>
          

            <cb/>  
          
closing the session of Parliament for that<lb/>
year, used in the Speech from the Throne the<lb/>
following words :—" I propose, in the course <lb/>
of the recess, to communicate with Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Government and with the government <lb/>
of the sister colonies, on another matter of <lb/>
very great importance. I am desirous of in<lb break="no"/>viting them to discuss with us the principles <lb/>
on which a bond of a federal character uniting <lb/>
the provinces of British North America may,<lb/>
perhaps, hereafter be practicable." That <lb/>
formal statement was followed by the despatch<lb/>
which has been referred to frequently in this <lb/>
House and during this debate, and which
<lb/>
was made the basis of the motion laid before
<lb/>
the House last session by the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for South Oxford—which motion has had
<lb/>
the effect of causing present and, as I believe, <lb/>
future great results. (Hear, hear.) I be<lb break="no"/>lieve the appointment of the committee moved <lb/>
for by that honorable gentleman will be look<lb break="no"/>ed back to as an era in the history of this <lb/>
country. (Hear, hear.) Now, as to the <lb/>
second occasion on which this question was <lb/>
formally brought before the attention of the <lb/>
House and country, we have heard from those<lb/>
who object to this scheme, that the people of<lb/>
the country have been taken by surprise, that
<lb/>
they do not understand it, and that<lb/>
are not prepared to discuss it. I would ask, <lb/>
sir, in reference to that, if this present Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was not formed on the very basis and <lb/>
understanding that it would bring about a <lb/>
settlement of this question, and if the people <lb/>
of the country did not know this to be the <lb/>
fact ? I hold in my hand the basis upon <lb/>
which the Government was formed, in which <lb/>
the following is stated as the result of a long <lb/>
negotiation between the leading members of<lb/>
it :— <lb/>
            </p>

 North America to be united under a
general <lb/>
legislature based upon the Federal principle.</p></quote>



            <p>This, sir, was the pledge given to this
House <lb/>
and country by the present Government on <lb/>
its formation. It was pledged to
introduce the <lb/>
Federative system into the Government of <lb/>
Canada, with special provisions for the incor<lb break="no"/>poration into this Federation of the
Maritime <lb/>
Provinces, and it was also pledged to send <lb/>
delegates to those provinces and invite them <lb/>
to join us in this Federation.
(Hear, hear.) <lb/>
And yet we are told forsooth that these dele<lb break="no"/>gates, who were thus appointed in conformity <lb/>
with the pledge of the Government, were <lb/>
" a self-constituted junta,"—we were told that <lb/>
they had no authority for their action in the <lb/>
face of the distinct obligation resting upon the <lb/>
Government to send delegates to those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and to England with a view of bring<lb break="no"/>ing about this Confederation. No self-con<lb break="no"/>stituted junta were those delegates who framed <lb/>
these resolutions ; but they met in accordance <lb/>
with a pledge given by this Government, and <lb/>
must be held to have been called together with <lb/>
the sanction of the Parliament of Canada, <lb/>
because Parliament gave the Government, <lb/>
formed to effect the Federation,
its confi<lb break="no"/>dence. They met also with the sanction of <lb/>
the Imperial Government, as now appears <lb/>
from statements and despatches in possession <lb/>
of this House. (Hear, hear.) But coming <lb/>
now to the present aspect of the matter, I feel <lb/>
that this country has reason to be satisfied <lb/>
with a scheme of so practical a nature as that <lb/>
now under the consideration of the House. <lb/>
I believe that the plan of union proposed will <lb/>
be found to meet the exigencies of our local <lb/>
position, give latitude to local
development, <lb/>
and due protection to local interests, and yet <lb/>
secure that general control which is essentially <lb/>
necessary for the proper
government of a <lb/>
country placed under the dominion of the <lb/>
British Crown. (Hear, hear.) And while I <lb/>
thus look upon the plan, I desire to state em<lb break="no"/>phatically and clearly that it is no new prin<lb break="no"/>ciple that the people of this country and the <lb/>
members of this House are asked to give their <lb/>
sanction to. The question of colonial union, <lb/>
in one shape or another, is one that has en<lb break="no"/>gaged the attention of high intellects and able <lb/>
statesmen in England;  and I think I will be <lb/>
able to show to the House that the very prin<lb break="no"/>ciple we are now endeavoring to introduce as <lb/>
a principle of government in these British <lb/>
North American Provinces, is one that has <lb/>
received the sanction of eminent men in <lb/>
England, and more than that, the sanction of <lb/>
a solemn act of the Imperial Parliament. <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
          
 (Hear, hear.) I will go back a few years,
<lb/>
when the condition of the Australian colonies
<lb/>
rendered it necessary for the statesmen of <lb/>
Great Britain to endeavor to find a practical <lb/>
solution of the difficulty of governing those <lb/>
great and growing dependencies of the British <lb/>
Crown. What was the practical mode adopted <lb/>
when events made it necessary that they <lb/>
should form a new Constitution for the <lb/>
more perfect government of those colonies? <lb/>
Why, the Imperial Government revived an <lb/>
old committee of the Privy Council, called <lb/>
the " Committee on Trade and Foreign Plan<lb break="no"/>tations," and referred the question to it, call<lb break="no"/>ing in to its aid, as new members of the com<lb break="no"/>mittee, Lord CAMPBELL, then Chancellor of <lb/>
the Duchy of Lancaster, Sir JAMES STEPHEN <lb/>
and Sir EDWARD RYAN. The result of the <lb/>
deliberations of that committee was a report <lb/>
in which the eminent men who composed it <lb/>
recommended the formation of a general as<lb break="no"/>sembly, to which the control of the general <lb/>
affairs of the Australian colonies should be <lb/>
entrusted, with local governments having local <lb/>
jurisdiction and certain defined powers grant<lb break="no"/>ed to them. I hold in my hands a series of <lb/>
letters on the colonial policy of England, ad<lb break="no"/>dressed by Earl GREY to Lord JOHN RUS<lb break="no"/>SELL, which contain the report of the com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the Privy Council that I have re<lb break="no"/>ferred to, and I find that the plan there sug<lb break="no"/>gested is analogous to the one
we are now <lb/>
asked to give practical effect to in this coun<lb break="no"/>try. (Hear, hear.) The
proposition of the <lb/>
committee was that there should be a Gover<lb break="no"/>nor General to administer the
affairs of the <lb/>
Australian colonies, and that he should con<lb break="no"/>vene a body, to be called the General Assem<lb break="no"/>bly of Australia, on receiving a request to <lb/>
that effect from two or more of the Australian <lb/>
legislatures ; and it was recommended that <lb/>
this General Assembly, so convened, should <lb/>
have the power to make laws respecting the <lb/>
imposition of duties on imports and exports, <lb/>
the post office, the formation of roads, canals <lb/>
and railways, and a variety of other subjects. <lb/>
The advantages of this plan were so manifest, <lb/>
as uniting those colonies together and secur<lb break="no"/>ing for them a better and more satisfactory <lb/>
form of government than they had before en<lb break="no"/>joyed, that the report was at once adopted by <lb/>
the Privy Council, embodied in a bill and <lb/>
submitted to Parliament. The bill passed <lb/>
the House of Commons and reached the <lb/>
House of Lords ; but while before that body <lb/>
the two clauses which introduced into the <lb/>
government of the Australian colonies the <lb/>
same system that in effect it is proposed to <lb/>
           

            <pb n="436" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-23_Page_0436.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">436</fw>
         
introduce here were dropped, and why ?
Not <lb/>
because of any change of opinion on the part <lb/>
of the Government on the question, nor be<lb break="no"/>cause the House of Lords was opposed to the <lb/>
principle, but because it was found on exam<lb break="no"/>ination that they were liable to practical ob<lb break="no"/>jections, to obviate which amendments would <lb/>
have to be introduced which there were no <lb/>
means of arranging without further commu<lb break="no"/>nications with the colonies. The Imperial <lb/>
Government would not make these changes <lb/>
in the measure without the consent of the <lb/>
colonies, but Earl GREY by no means changed <lb/>
his mind in regard to the advantages to be <lb/>
derived from the plan proposed, as the follow<lb break="no"/>ing extract from one of his despatches, writ<lb break="no"/>ten in 1850, to the Governor of New South <lb/>
Wales, will show :— <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> I am not, however, the less persuaded
that <lb/>
the want of some such central authority to <lb/>
regulate matters of common importance to <lb/>
the Australian colonies will be felt, and <lb/>
probably at a very early period ; but when this <lb/>
want is so felt, it will of itself suggest the means <lb/>
by which it may be met. The several legislatures <lb/>
will, it is true, be unable at once to give the <lb/>
necessary authority to a General
Assembly, be<lb break="no"/>cause the legislative power of each is confined of <lb/>
necessity within its territorial limits ; but if two <lb/>
or more of these legislatures should find that <lb/>
there are objects of common interest for which it <lb/>
is expedient to create such an authority, they will <lb/>
have it in their power, if they can settle the terms <lb/>
of an arrangement for the purpose, to pass acts <lb/>
for giving effect to it, with clauses suspending <lb/>
their operation until Parliament shall have supplied <lb/>
the authority that is wanting. By such acts the <lb/>
extent and objects of the powers which they are <lb/>
prepared to delegate to such a body might be <lb/>
defined and limited with precision, and there can <lb/>
be little doubt that Parliament, when applied to <lb/>
in order to give effect to an arrangement so <lb/>
agreed upon, would readily consent to do so. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Some may say, Mr. SPEAKER, that this is <lb/>
very true, but that the British Government <lb/>
dropped the plan and did not proceed with it. <lb/>
I think I shall be prepared to meet that argu<lb break="no"/>ment, and show that it only rested in the plan <lb/>
to learn the wishes of the people of the colo<lb break="no"/>nies ; for you find it following the very same <lb/>
principle, reported upon favorably by the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee on Trade and Foreign Plantations, in <lb/>
the Constitution which was subsequently <lb/>
granted to the New Zealand provinces. In <lb/>
1852, the plan suggested by that committee, <lb/>
in regard to Australia, was carried into effect
<lb/>
in New Zealand, and it must be remembered <lb/>
that at that time the population of New Zea<lb break="no"/>land was very small, so small indeed that one <lb/>
cannot help contrasting the position of that <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         
country
with that of British North America <lb/>
at the present day ; but the statesmen of <lb/>
Great Britain looked into the future of the <lb/>
colony, and they decided that it would be <lb/>
advisable to confer on it powers analogous to <lb/>
those now sought for by us. The New Zea<lb break="no"/>land Constitutional Act created six provinces, <lb/>
with superintendents, provincial councils of <lb/>
nine appointed by the governor, and a general <lb/>
government of three estates. In the debate <lb/>
on that bill, Earl GREY said that this was the <lb/>
only form of government which could be con<lb break="no"/>ferred on a colony situated as that one was. <lb/>
He remarked :— <lb/>
            </p>
 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> It was impracticable and must for many
years <lb/>
continue to be so, for any general legislature to <lb/>
meet all the wants of so many separate settle<lb break="no"/>ments at a great distance from each other ; hence <lb/>
it seemed absolutely necessary to constitute pro<lb break="no"/>vincial legislatures on which a great portion of <lb/>
the public business must devolve. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> The very difficulty which was met with
there is <lb/>
the one we have to overcome here. It was found <lb/>
absolutely necessary to create in every province <lb/>
a Local Legislature, and in
addition one cen<lb break="no"/>tral power, to whom matters common to all <lb/>
might be referred. Earl GREY, in the course <lb/>
of the same debate, speaking of the import<lb break="no"/>ance of this arrangement, said : —" There <lb/>
were some subjects on which extensive incon<lb break="no"/>venience would arise, if uniformity of legisla<lb break="no"/>tion among the several provinces were not in<lb break="no"/>sured, which could only be accomplished by a <lb/>
General Legislature." And that, sir, is what <lb/>
this Government now asks us to adopt. They <lb/>
ask us to invite the Imperial Parliament to <lb/>
create for us provincial legislatures,
to <lb/>
whom shall be referred all local matters, and <lb/>
that we shall have a General Legislature for <lb/>
the care of those subjects of a general charac<lb break="no"/>ter which could not be so well looked after by <lb/>
the provincial legislatures. And I say, sir, that <lb/>
finding as we do that this is no new question, <lb/>
we can, therefore, understand why this measure <lb/>
met with such ready approval from the states<lb break="no"/>men of Britain and the high commendation of <lb/>
Her Majesty by her advisers. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
But, Mr. SPEAKER, I will now pass from the <lb/>
consideration of the history of this important <lb/>
movement—and I assure you that I feel the <lb/>
difficulty of addressing the House on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject, in consequence of the sense I entertain <lb/>
of the gravity of the question itself and the <lb/>
momentous character of the issues it involves. <lb/>
The subject, sir, is one of the very highest <lb/>
importance. The destinies of this great coun<lb break="no"/>try are bound up in it. (Hear, hear.) The <lb/>

 Upper House has already sanctioned the <lb/>
scheme, and I would take the opportunity of <lb/>
remarking that I do not think that the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of that House can be rightly
charged <lb/>
with not having given it that deliberate
con<lb break="no"/>sideration which its importance demands. I <lb/>
think that they have shown a very proper ex<lb break="no"/>ample in their discussion of the question,
and <lb/>
one that we may well follow. They debated
<lb/>
with leisure, deliberation, and a thorough ap<lb break="no"/>preciation of its gravity, day by day, during <lb/>
four weeks, and I therefore think that the <lb/>
members of the Upper House ought not to <lb/>
have been charged with " indecent haste." <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Who said so ? <lb/>

            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—I said it was <lb/>
unsuitable haste. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MORR1">Mr. MORRIS</persName>—I have somewhat of a re<lb break="no"/>cording memory, and I think the words he <lb/>
unfortunately used were " indecent haste." <lb/>
However, I have no intention of disputing <lb/>
with my honorable friend as to the particular <lb/>
words he used. I have only to express my <lb/>
opinion that the time which has been already <lb/>
spent on this question here and
elsewhere has <lb/>
not been lost. I think it is our duty to con<lb break="no"/>sider this subject in all its aspects, and be<lb break="no"/>lieving as I do that the scheme will be adopt<lb break="no"/>ed by this House, I feel the importance of a <lb/>
full and free discussion, in order that its mer<lb break="no"/>its may be put before the country. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, I desire now to state <lb/>
that I support the proposal at present under <lb/>
our consideration, because in my honest and <lb/>
deliberate judgment I believe that this union, <lb/>
if accomplished, is calculated in its practical <lb/>
effects to bind us more closely
to Britain than <lb/>
We could be bound by any other system. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANON1">A VOICE</persName>—It would put an end to the <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MORR1">MR. MORRIS</persName>—An honorable member <lb/>
says "it would put an end to the connection." <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Well, I would say to that honorable
gentle<lb break="no"/>man and this House, that in my opinion there <lb/>
are but two destinies before us. We have <lb/>
either to rise into strength and wealth and <lb/>
power by means of this union, under the shel<lb break="no"/>tering protection of Britain, or
we must be <lb/>
absorbed by the great power beside us. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) I believe that that is the only con<lb break="no"/>clusion we can arrive at. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANON1">A VOICE</persName>—But the people are against it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MORR1">MR. MORRIS</persName>—An honorable gentleman <lb/>
says the people are not in favor
of a Federal <lb/>
union. But we know on the contrary, that <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
  
 the people are in favor of the change.
When <lb/>
the public mind is excited against any mea<lb break="no"/>sure, is there not a means open to the people
<lb/>
to make known their opposition, and how is it <lb/>
that the table of this House is not covered <lb/>
with petitions against the scheme, if it is so <lb/>
unpopular as honorable gentlemen would have <lb/>
us believe ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANON1">AN HON. MEMBER</persName>—There are no peti<lb break="no"/>tions for it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MORR1">MR. MORRIS</persName>—An honorable gentleman <lb/>
says " there are no petitions for it." And why <lb/>
is it that there are not? Is it not because the <lb/>
Government was constituted on the basis of <lb/>
union ? (Hear, hear.) The people, through <lb/>
a vast majority of their representatives in this <lb/>
House, are in favor of it. If they are op<lb break="no"/>posed to it they have the remedy
in their own <lb/>
     
hands, they have the means of opposing,
but <lb/>
they do not oppose it because they feel that a <lb/>
change of some kind is absolutely essential, <lb/>
and they have confidence in the wisdom of <lb/>
those entrusted with the destiny of the country <lb/>
in this crisis of its history. But I say that <lb/>
the great reason why this scheme has taken <lb/>
the hold that it has done upon the public men <lb/>
of the province, is that they see in it an <lb/>
earnest desire to perpetuate British connec<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—It will turn out a <lb/>

the son of a prophet, but I am willing to <lb/>

(Hear, hear.) A fear has been expressed <lb/>
that the Confederation will lead to the sever<lb break="no"/>ance of those links which bind us to the <lb/>
Mother Country. But I believe it will be <lb/>
our own fault if the ties between us are <lb/>
broken. With entire freedom and the right <lb/>
of self-government in the fullest sense of the <lb/>
word, together with the great advantage of an <lb/>
improved position, and the strength and <lb/>
power of Great Britian to foster and protect <lb/>
us, why should we seek to change our con<lb break="no"/>nection, what object could we have to induce <lb/>
us to form other ties? (Hear, hear.) What <lb/>
have we to envy in the position of the neigh<lb break="no"/>boring country, burdened as it is with the <lb/>
heavy load of taxation arising from the cruel <lb/>
war raging there, that we should covet that <lb/>
flag? Why then should our coming together <lb/>
for the purpose of union weaken our position <lb/>
or diminish the tie that links us to Britain ? <lb/>
It will be for honorable gentlemen who do not <lb/>
believe that the union of these scattered colo<lb break="no"/>nies will give them strength, to prove that, <lb/>
       

            <pb n="438" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-23_Page_0438.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">438</fw>
         

     contrary to all precedent, union is not strength. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But I will state why this 
     <lb/>
     union is calculated to prolong our connection 
     <lb/>
     with Britain. It is well known that there 
     <lb/>
     has been an entire and radical change of late 
     <lb/>
     in the colonial policy of England. That policy 
     <lb/>
     has been to extend to us the utmost liberty in 
     <lb/>
     our relations to the Empire. What is after 
     <lb/>
     all the nature of the bond which links us to 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, apart from our allegiance and 
     <lb/>
     loyalty ? What is it but a Federative bond ? 
     <lb/>
     That is what links us to Britain , and I feel quite 
     <lb/>
     satisfied, in the words of an English publicist of 
     <lb/>
     some eminence, that " the new colonial policy 
     <lb/>
     is calculated to prolong the connection of the 
     <lb/>
     colonies with the Mother Country." I believe 
     <lb/>
     it will raise these provinces as part of the 
     <lb/>
     British Empire, and so secure to us the per<lb break="no"/>manency of British institutions, and bind us 
     <lb/>
     more closely to the Crown. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I believe it will, in the words of that far-seeing 
     <lb/>
     statesman, Lord DURHAM, "raise up to the 
     <lb/>
     North American colonist a nationality of his 
     <lb/>
     own by elevating those small and unimportant 
     <lb/>
     communities into a society having some objects 
     <lb/>
     of national importance, and give these inhab<lb break="no"/>itants a country which they will be unwilling 
     <lb/>
     to see absorbed into that of their powerful 
     <lb/>
     neighbors." And, sir, our neighbors so see it. 
     <lb/>
     Shortly after the visit of the Duke of NEW<lb break="no"/>CASTLE to this country, attention was directed 
     <lb/>
     to the question of the union of the colonies, 
     <lb/>
     not only in this country, but in England and 
     <lb/>
     in the United States. The New York <hi rendition="simple:italic">Courier 
     <lb/>
     and Inquirer</hi>, in an article published at that 
     <lb/>
     time, came to the conclusion " that the union 
     <lb/>
     would, in fact, be an argument for a continu<lb break="no"/>ance of the existing relations between the two 
     <lb/>
     countries as a matter of policy and gratitude, 
     <lb/>
     and that such a change of government could 
     <lb/>
     be met with no objection of any weight." 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I invite the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Chateauguay to that 
     <lb/>
     statement. But, Mr. SPEAKER, it is a sin<lb break="no"/>gular study, looking back over the history of 
     <lb/>
     the past, to see how this question has come 
     <lb/>
     up in the experience of the various colonies. 
     <lb/>
     Before the American revolution, BEN<lb break="no"/>JAMIN FRANKLIN suggested a plan for a 
     <lb/>
     Federation of the old colonies of Britain on 
     <lb/>
     this continent, which, he afterwards said, would, 
     <lb/>
     according to his deliberate opinion, have pre<lb break="no"/>vented the severance of the connection between 
     <lb/>
     the colonies and the Mother Country. I will 
     <lb/>
     quote a passage written by him after the 
     <lb/>
     revolution, in which he makes allusion to this 
     <lb/>
     project. He said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I proposed and drew up a plan for the union of 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     all the colonies under one government, so far as 
     <lb/>
     might be necessary for defence and other import<lb break="no"/>ant general purposes. By my plan, the General 
     <lb/>
     Government was to be administered by a Presi<lb break="no"/>dent-General, appointed and supported by the 
     <lb/>
     Crown, and a General Council, to be chosen by 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of the people of the several 
     <lb/>
     colonies, met in the respective assemblies. The 
     <lb/>
     plan was agreed to in Congress, but the assem<lb break="no"/>blies of the provinces did not adopt it, as they 
     <lb/>
     thought there was too much prerogative in it, 
     <lb/>
     and in England it was judged to have too much 
     <lb/>
     of the democratic. The different and contrary 
     <lb/>
     reasons of dislike to my plan made me suspect 
     <lb/>
     that it was really the true medium, and I am still 
     <lb/>
     of opinion it would have been happy for both 
     <lb/>
     sides if it had been adopted. The colonies so 
     <lb/>
     united would have been strong enough to have 
     <lb/>
     defended themselves ; there would then have 
     <lb/>
     been no need of troops from England ; of course 
     <lb/>
     the subsequent pretext for taxing America, and 
     <lb/>
     also the bloody contest it occasioned, would have 
     <lb/>
     been avoided.

            <p>
     It is singular that nearly a hundred years 
     <lb/>
     ago, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, looking at the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties then existing between the colonies, 
     <lb/>
     should have suggested a plan of union similar 
     <lb/>
     to that now proposed to us, and it is a strong 
     <lb/>
     proof of the wisdom of the plan now before 
     <lb/>
     this House, that seeing the difficulties under 
     <lb/>
     which the other colonies labored for want 
     <lb/>
     of a central power, just as we now see 
     <lb/>
     them, proposing this Confederation, he should 
     <lb/>
     have declared that if such a plan had been 
     <lb/>
     adopted then it would have prevented the 
     <lb/>
     severance of the British connection.

     views prevail in Britain. In 1858, when 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia was erected into a colony, 
     <lb/>
     it was found then that the Commons of Britain 
     <lb/>
     had no intention of surrendering the fair pos<lb break="no"/>sessions of Britain on this continent, and Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty was advised to say :—

     Britain look upon this great scheme as in<lb break="no"/>volving the severance of our connection with

     Country were its tendency, then I, for one, 
     <lb/>
    would not support it, nor would it be sup<lb break="no"/>ported by any of those honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>who so strongly advocate it. I am not 
     <lb/>afraid to say that any government which 
     <lb/>dared to bring down such a measure would be 
     <lb/>hurled from their places. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>But, Mr. SPEAKER, I have been led into the 
     <lb/>discussion of this question of connection with 
     <lb/>the Mother Country at much greater length 
     <lb/>than I had intended, by the suggestions of hon.  
     <lb/>members, and I will take the liberty of call<lb break="no"/>ing the attention of the House to a passage 
     <lb/>from a work I have already referred to, and 
     <lb/>in which we find an exposition of the policy 
     <lb/>which governed the administration of Lord 
     <lb/>JOHN RUSSELL. I find there an elaborate 
     <lb/>argument to prove that the colonies are an 
     <lb/>advantage to Britain, and that Britain of 
     <lb/>course is an advantage to the colonies ; and 
     <lb/>on the mere ground of material interest, if 
     <lb/>there were no other—if deeper and stronger 
     <lb/>ties did not exist as they do—I feel satisfied 
     <lb/>that this country would not be prepared to 
     <lb/>take the first step towards the severance of 
     <lb/>our connection with England, and the loss 
     <lb/>of that prestige and power which go with 
     <lb/>every British subject to every civilized part 
     <lb/>of the globe, enabling him to say, like the 
     <lb/>old Roman, " I am a British citizen." EARL 
     <lb/>GREY states that :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The possession of a number of steady and 
     <lb/>
     faithful allies, in various quarters of the globe, 
     <lb/>
     will surely be admitted to add greatly to the 
     <lb/>
     strength of any nation ; while no alliance be<lb break="no"/>tween independent states can be so close and 
     <lb/>
     intimate as the connection which unites the 
     <lb/>
     colonies to the United Kingdom as parts of the 
     <lb/>
     Great Britith Empire. Nor ought it to be for<lb break="no"/>gotten, that the power of a nation does not 
     <lb/>
     depend merely on the amount of physical force it 
     <lb/>
     can command, but rests, in no small degree, upon 
     <lb/>
     opinion and moral influence. In this respect 
     <lb/>
     British power would be diminished by the loss of 
     <lb/>
     our colonies, to a degree which it would be

     difficult to estimate.

            <p>
     To the latter [<hi rendition="simple:italic">i. e.</hi> the colonists] it is no doubt

     of far greater importance than to the former,

     that all the conditions are combined in the

     scheme now before us, that are considered 
     <lb/>
     necessary for the formation on a permanent

     basis of a Federative union. I hold in my

     band a book of some note on <hi rendition="simple:italic">Representa<lb break="no"/>tive Government</hi>, by JOHN STUART MILL, 
     <lb/>
     and I find that he lays down three condi<lb break="no"/>tions as applicable to the union of in<lb break="no"/>dependent states, and which, by parity of 
     <lb/>
     reasoning, are applicable to provinces which 
     <lb/>
     seek to have a closer alliance with each

     other, and also, thereby, a closer alliance 
     <lb/>
     with the Mother Country. The conditions

     the possession of a strong Central Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and local or municipal parliaments,

     such as are proposed for our adoption. I 
     <lb/>
     believe the scheme will be found in fact and 
     <lb/>
     in practice—by its combination of the better 
     <lb/>
     features of the American system with those 
     <lb/>
     of the British Constitution—to have very 
     <lb/>
     great practical advantages. I shall read an 
     <lb/>
     extract from an article in the London 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, written in 1858, hearing on this 
     <lb/>
     subject, and which brings very clearly into

     view the distinction between the system 
     <lb/>
     which has been preposed for our adoption, 
     <lb/>
     and that which has been adopted in the 
     <lb/>
     States. The great weakness of the American 
     <lb/>
     system has lain in the fact that the several 
     <lb/>
     states, on entering the union, claimed inde<lb break="no"/>pendent jurisdiction ; that they demitted to 
     <lb/>
     the Central Government certain powers, and 
     <lb/>
     that they claimed equal and sovereign 
     <lb/>
     powers with regard to everything not so 
     <lb/>
     delegated and demitted. The weaknesses 
     <lb/>
     and difficulties of that system have been 
     <lb/>
     avoided in the project now before us, and 
     <lb/>
     we have the central power with defined and 
     <lb/>
     sovereign powers, and the local parliaments 
     <lb/>
     with their defined and delegated powers, but 
     <lb/>
     subordinated to the central power. The

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>It is quite clear that the Federal Constitution

     the hon. gentleman knows the heart-burn<lb break="no"/>ings we have had in the past. I have not

     been in Parliament so long as that honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman. But I recollect, when I first 
     <lb/>
     took a seat in this House, the state of excite<lb break="no"/>ment which then prevailed, and which con<lb break="no"/>tinued, making government practically im<lb break="no"/>possible. For we had governments maintain<lb break="no"/>ing themselves session after session by 
     <lb/>
     majorities of one or two—shewing that it 
     <lb/>
     was impossible for any government to con<lb break="no"/>duct public affairs with that dignity and 
     <lb/>
     success with which a government ought to 
     <lb/>
     conduct them. But, as I have stated, I 
     <lb/>
     think the Conference has been exceedingly 
     <lb/>
     happy in the plan they have submitted for 
     <lb/>
     our adoption. A community of British free<lb break="no"/>men as we are, deliberately surveying our

     past as well as our present position, and look<lb break="no"/>ing forward to our future, we in effect resolve 
     <lb/>
     that we will adhere to the protection of the

     British Crown ; that we will tell the 
     <lb/>
     GOLDWIN SMITH school—these who are 
     <lb/>
     crying out for cutting off the colonies— 
     <lb/>
     that we will cling to the old Mother Land

     ourselves from that protection we have so 
     <lb/>
     long enjoyed ; but we desire, while remain<lb break="no"/>ing under that protection, to do all that 
     <lb/>
     lies in our wer for our self-defence, and 
     <lb/>
     for the development of all the great interests 
     <lb/>
     which Providence has committed to our 
     <lb/>
     trust ; and we seek at the hands of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Parliament such legislation as will enable 
     <lb/>
     us to accomplish these great ends for the 
     <lb/>
     whole of British America. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Why, what a domain do we possess! We 
     <lb/>
     have over three millions of square miles of 
     <lb/>
     territory—large enough, certainly, for the 
     <lb/>
     expansion of the races which inhabit this 
     <lb/>
     country; and our desire is, in the language 
     <lb/>
     of a late colonial minister—language which, 
     <lb/>
     I believe, well expresses the views and senti<lb break="no"/>ments of the people of all these provinces— 
     <lb/>
     we would approach the British people, the 
     <lb/>
     British Government, and our Sovereign, with 
     <lb/>
     this language : "We desire, by your aid, 
     <lb/>
     with your sanction and permission, to attempt 
     <lb/>
     to add another community of Christian free<lb break="no"/>men to those by which Great Britain confides 
     <lb/>
     the records of her Empire, not to pyramids 
     <lb/>
     and obelisks, but to states and communities, 
     <lb/>
     whose history will be written in her lan<lb break="no"/>guage." That was the language of the 
     <lb/>
     Colonial Secretary, Sir BULWER LYTTON, 
     <lb/>
     when he proposed and carried out the setting 
     <lb/>
     off of a new colony on the Pacific shore— 
     <lb/>
     language certainly which indicated a firm 
     <lb/>
     and sure reliance in the power and efficacy 
     <lb/>
     of British institutions—that these institu<lb break="no"/>tions would be found capable of all the 
     <lb/>
     expansion requisite to meet the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     of a new country, and of any body of British 
     <lb/>
     freeman to whom the care of these institu<lb break="no"/>tions maybe entrusted. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     I fear I have been tempted to forget the 
     <lb/>
     excellent example of my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from Lambton. (Cries of "No, no," "go 
     <lb/>
     on.") I desire very briefly to notice two or 
     <lb/>
     three immediate advantages which, in my 
     <lb/>
     judgment, would be derived from the 
     <lb/>
     consummation, under one central power 
     <lb/>
     with local municipal parliaments, of a union 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadas with the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Let us glance at what is their position, in 
     <lb/>
     relation to the great military power which 
     <lb/>
     is rising on the other side of the lines. Let 
     <lb/>
     us see what they are thinking of us there. 
     <lb/>
     One of their eminent statesmen suggested 
     <lb/>
     some years ago, that they should cultivate 
     <lb/>
     our acquaintance, while we were still 
     <lb/>
     "incurious of our destiny." But we have 
     <lb/>
     passed that state. We have become curious 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
          

     of our destiny, and are seeking, as far as we 
     <lb/>
     can, to place it on a sure and certain basis. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Here is the view taken of 
     <lb/>
     our position by an American writer :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     They have now no comprehensive power 
     <lb/>
     that embraces the interests of all—that acts 
     <lb/>
     on the prosperity of the seacoast and interior 
     <lb/>
     —of commerce and agriculture where they are 
     <lb/>
     seemingly rivals—that gives uniformity in tariffs 
     <lb/>
     and taxes, and the encouragement that shall be 
     <lb/>
     entrusted to the fishing, mining and other great 
     <lb/>
     interests. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That is a view of the position of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces to which I commend to the attention 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friends from Chateauguay and 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga. I ask, is it not a correct view ? 
     <lb/>
     Is not that the position in which we have 
     <lb/>
     long been ? And I believe the result of this 
     <lb/>
     union will be to do away with that state of 
     <lb/>
     things. (Hear, hear.) I believe that when 
     <lb/>
     these colonies are combined, acting in 
     <lb/>
     concert, and quickened and invigorated by a 
     <lb/>
     feeling of mutual dependence and interest, 
     <lb/>
     the tendency will be to increase their wealth 
     <lb/>
     and manufactures, and general strength. 
     <lb/>
     And, sir, I am satisfied one of the great 
     <lb/>
     advantages of this union will be found in this 
     <lb/>
     that we will be raised above our sectionalisms, 
     <lb/>
     and come to feel and to act as the citizens 
     <lb/>
     of a great country, with destinies committed 
     <lb/>
     to us such as may well evoke the energies of 
     <lb/>
     a great people. But I desire to point out 
     <lb/>
     another practical advantage which, I think, 
     <lb/>
     is of no mean or slight moment; and it 
     <lb/>
     is this :—Bound as we are to England, 
     <lb/>
     by the closest ties, and yet enjoying our own 
     <lb/>
     government, England is still compelled to 
     <lb/>
     act for us in all matters of an international 
     <lb/>
     nature. But, when we have for all these 
     <lb/>
     British provinces one General Government, 
     <lb/>
     able to take an oversight of the whole, and 
     <lb/>
     to attend to all their various interests, we 
     <lb/>
     will be able to represent to Britain on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of the whole, with a force and power 
     <lb/>
     we have never before been able to use, what 
     <lb/>
     these interests are ; we will be able to press 
     <lb/>
     them home on the attention of British 
     <lb/>
     statesmen in such a manner as will lead them 
     <lb/>
     to appreciate, and seek to protect those in<lb break="no"/>terests in their negotiations with foreign 
     <lb/>
     powers. I would allude, as an illustration 
     <lb/>
     of what I mean, to the Reciprocity Treaty, 
     <lb/>
     and I cannot refrain from reading a very 
     <lb/>
     striking extract from a report presented to 
     <lb/>
     the United States House of Representatives, 
     <lb/>
     in 1862, from the Committee of Commerce on 
     <lb/>
     the Reciprocity Treaty. I ask the attention

     of the House to this extract, as shewing how 
     <lb/>
     the United States have been able to take 
     <lb/>
     advantage of our isolated condition—our want 
     <lb/>
     of central power and authority—to gain for 
     <lb/>
     themselves advantages in the negotiation of 
     <lb/>
     that treaty, such as they could not have ob<lb break="no"/>tained or even sought, had we been in a 
     <lb/>
     position to present all the advantages, in 
     <lb/>
     negotiations with the United States, which 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the Maritime Provinces as a 
     <lb/>
     whole could present. Instead of the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can statesmen having to negotiate with the 
     <lb/>
     separate governments of separate provinces, 
     <lb/>
     they would have to negotiate with the com<lb break="no"/>bined interests of British North America. 
     <lb/>
     I read this extract as a very striking one, 
     <lb/>
     and as entitled, on account of the source 
     <lb/>
     from which it comes, to some weight. In 
     <lb/>
     the report I have referred to, the natural 
     <lb/>
     results of the treaty and of its abrogation 
     <lb/>
     are thus spoken of :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     A great and mutually beneficial increase in our 
     <lb/>
     commerce with Canada was the natural and pri<lb break="no"/>mary result of the treaty. Many causes of irrita<lb break="no"/>tion were removed, and a large accession to our 
     <lb/>
     trade was acquired, through the treaty, with the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces. Arguments founded upon 
     <lb/>
     the results of the treaty as a whole, with the vari<lb break="no"/>ous provinces. have a valid and incontrovertible 
     <lb/>
     application against the unconditional and complete 
     <lb/>
     abrogation of the treaty, so far as it refers to 
     <lb/>
    provinces against which no complaint is made. 
     <lb/>The isolated and disconnected condition of the 
     <lb/>various governments of these provinces to each 
     <lb/>other, and the absence of their real responsibility 
     <lb/>to any common centre, are little understood. No 
     <lb/>fault is found with the acts of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>Brunswick. These separate provinces and that 
     <lb/>of Canada have each a separate tariff and legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and neither of them is accountable to or 
     <lb/>for any other. An abrogation of the treaty, as a 
     <lb/>whole, would therefore be a breach of good faith 
     <lb/>towards the other provinces, even if it were ex<lb break="no"/>pedient to adopt such a course towards Canada, 
     <lb/>but no advantages gained by the treaty with the 
     <lb/>Maritime Provinces can be admitted as offsets in 
     <lb/>favor of Canada. Each province made its own 
     <lb/>bargain, and gave and received its separate equi<lb break="no"/>valent.

     (Hear, hear.) This is an instance of some 
     <lb/>
     moment, and I believe the same principles 
     <lb/>
     will be found to apply to all those ques<lb break="no"/>tions on which, in the future history of 
     <lb/>
     this Confederation, it will be found neces<lb break="no"/>sary to confer with foreign governments, 
     <lb/>
     through the Mother Country. No longer 
     <lb/>
     detached and isolated from each other, we 
     <lb/>
     will be able to present a combined front, 
     <lb/>
     and to urge the advantages which may 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
      

     be derived from the exhaustless fisheries of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces, as well as those 
     <lb/>
     afforded by Canada. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     defence question has been alluded to very 
     <lb/>
     frequently in this debate. I think there 
     <lb/>
     really cannot be a question that it would be 
     <lb/>
     for the advantage, not only of Britain, but of 
     <lb/>
     each one of these provinces, that on such 
     <lb/>
     subjects as the militia, and on all kindred 
     <lb/>
     questions, such as those relating to aliens, 
     <lb/>
     the observance of neutrality and like sub<lb break="no"/>jects, there should be a general and uniform 
     <lb/>
     action ; that, seeing the action of any one of 
     <lb/>
     the colonies might involve the parent state 
     <lb/>
     in war, there should not be separate and 
     <lb/>
     distinct action, but one uniform action, on 
     <lb/>
     all that class of national and international 
     <lb/>
     subjects, throughout the whole of the 
     <lb/>
     British Provinces. I cannot help thinking 
     <lb/>
     that in practice an immense advantage would 
     <lb/>
     be derived from the introduction of such a 
     <lb/>
     system. It is not my <hi rendition="simple:italic">forte</hi>, as that of some 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen, to speak with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     defence question. There are other hon. 
     <lb/>
     members who understand that subject 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly, and will no doubt deal with it in 
     <lb/>
     a satisfactory manner. But I cannot help 
     <lb/>
     thinking that a uniform system of militia 
     <lb/>
     and marine for British North America would 
     <lb/>
     be powerfully felt in the history of this con<lb break="no"/>tinent.

     will not at this late hour of the night, as I see 
     <lb/>
     the House is wearied—(cries of " No. no," 
     <lb/>
     "Go on.")—I will not quote any figures to

     shew the extent of intereolonial trade that will 
     <lb/>
     spring up with the Maritime Provinces and 
     <lb/>
     with the West India provinces. Some years

     ago there was, as mercantile men well know, 
     <lb/>
     aim-ge trade conducted with the West India 
     <lb/>
     Islands, which, from various circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     has almost entirely ceased. I believe that, 
     <lb/>
     when the provinces are united, not only will 
     <lb/>
     a large trade spring up in those agricultural 
     <lb/>
     and other products which are now su plied 
     <lb/>
     to the Lower Provinces from the nited 
     <lb/>
     States, but a trade will also be established 
     <lb/>
     with the West India Islands. Some time 
     <lb/>
     ago I took the trouble to look into the figures, 
     <lb/>
     and I was surprised to find how large a trade 
     <lb/>
     was conducted twenty-five years ago with 
     <lb/>
     those islands; and l believe that, by carry<lb break="no"/>ing out this union, we will have facilities

     for establishing such commercial relationsas

     <lb/>
     years as a Federalist, and I believe he is only 
     <lb/>
     sorry that we do not go a little faster. I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that when Confederation is accom<lb break="no"/>plished, he will be one of its most hearty 
     <lb/>
     supporters. (Hear, hear.) I would now, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, desire to quote a few words 
     <lb/>
     from a lecture delivered some years ago by 
     <lb/>
     Principal DAWSON, of Montreal, awell-knowu 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotian, and who is distinguished for 
     <lb/>
     his thorough acquaintance with the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. He says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Their progress in population and wealth is slow, 
     <lb/>
     in comparison with that of Western America, 
     <lb/>
     though equal to the average of that of the Amer<lb break="no"/>ican Union, and more rapid than that of the older 
     <lb/>
     states. Their agriculture is rapidly improving, 
     <lb/>
     manufacturing and mining enterprises are extend<lb break="no"/>ing themselves, and railways are being built to 
     <lb/>
     connect them with the more inland parts of the 
     <lb/>
     continent. Like Great Britain, they possess im<lb break="no"/>portant minerals in which the neighboring parts 
     <lb/>
     of the continent are deficient. and enjoy the ut<lb break="no"/>most facilities for commercial pursuits. Ultima<lb break="no"/>tely, therefore, they must have with the United 
     <lb/>
     States, Canada and the fur countries, the same 
     <lb/>
     commercial relations that Britain maintains with 
     <lb/>
     Western, central, and northern Europe. Above 
     <lb/>
     all, they form the great natural oceanic termina<lb break="no"/>tion of the great valley of the St. Lawrence; and 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
        

     although  its commerce has hitherto, by the skill 
     <lb/>
     and in ustry of its neighbours, been drawn across 
     <lb/>
     the natural barrier which Providence has placed 
     <lb/>
     between it and the seaports of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     it must ultimately take its natural channel; and 
     <lb/>
     then not only will the cities on the St. Lawrence 
     <lb/>
     be united by the strongest common interests, but 
     <lb/>
     they will be bound to Acadia by ties more close 
     <lb/>
     than any merely political union. The great 
     <lb/>
     thoroughfares to the rich lands and noble scenery 
     <lb/>
     of the west, and thence to the sea-breezes and 
     <lb/>
     saltwater of the Atlantic, and to the great seats 
     <lb/>
     of industry and art in the old world, will pass 
     <lb/>
     along the St. Lawrence, and through the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. The surplus agricultural produce of 
     <lb/>
     Canada will find its nearest consumers among the 
     <lb/>
     miners, shipwrights, mariners, and fishermen of 
     <lb/>
     Acadia;   and they will send back the treasures of 
     <lb/>
     their mines and of their sea. This ultimate fusion 
     <lb/>
     of all the populations extending along this great 
     <lb/>
     river, valley and estuary, and the establishment 
     <lb/>
     throughout its course of one of the principal 
     <lb/>
     streams of American commerce, seems in the na<lb break="no"/>ture of thin s inevitable; and there is already a 
     <lb/>
     large field or the profitable employment of lab<lb break="no"/>orers and capital in accelerating this desirable 
     <lb/>
     result. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Such, I believe. Mr. SPEAKER, will be found 
     <lb/>
     to be the results of the steps now being 
     <lb/>
     taken. (Hear, hear.) In conclusion, I 
     <lb/>
     would desire to call attention to the advan<lb break="no"/>tages we will enjoy in consequence of our 
     <lb/>
     being able to do something to secure the 
     <lb/>
     development of the immense tract of country 
     <lb/>
     lying beyond us—Central British North 
     <lb/>
     America, popularly known as the Great 
     <lb/>
     North West. If Canadians are to stand 
     <lb/>
     still and allow American energy and enter<lb break="no"/>prise to press on as it is doing towards that 
     <lb/>
     country, the inevitable result must be that 
     <lb/>
     that great section of territory will be taken 
     <lb/>
     possession of by the citizens of the neighbor<lb break="no"/>ing states. The question is one of great 
     <lb/>
     interest to the people of Canada. Years 
     <lb/>
     ago Canadian industry pushed its way up 
     <lb/>
     the valle of the Ottawa to the Great North 
     <lb/>
     West. In 1798 the North-West Company 
     <lb/>
     had in its employment not less than 12,000 
     <lb/>
     persons ; and there is no reason in the world 
     <lb/>
     why the trade which was then carried on 
     <lb/>
     should not be reëstablished between the 
     <lb/>
     North-West and Canada. No insuperable 
     <lb/>
     obstacles stand in the way. A practicable 
     <lb/>
     route exists which can be used by land and 
     <lb/>
     by water, and there is no reason why the 
     <lb/>
     necessary steps should not be taken to secure 
     <lb/>
     the development of the resources of that 
     <lb/>
     country and making them tributary to 
     <lb/>
     Canada. (Hear, hear.) I think it was a 
     <lb/>
     wise foresight on the part of the gentlemen 
     <lb/>

 who prepared the plan now before us, that <lb/> they aid
               this down as one of the principal <lb/> features of the scheme—that they regarded
               <lb/> the development of the North-West as <lb/> necessary for the security and the
               promotion <lb/> of the best interests of British North <lb/> America. (Hear, hear.)
               If the House will <lb/> bear with me, Mr. SPEAKER, I would ask <lb/> hon. members
               to consider for a moment the <lb/> extent of the territory there possessed. An
               <lb/> American writer, who estimates it at <lb/> 2,500,000 square miles, puts it in
               this <lb/> way :—<lb/>
            </p>
         
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> How large is that? It is fifteen and a half <lb/> times
               lar er than the State of California; about <lb/> thirty-eight times as large as the
               State of New <lb/> York; nearly twice as large as the thirty-one <lb/> States of
               the Union; and, if we omit the territory <lb/> of Nebraska, as large as all our

            <p> Between the settled portions of Canada and <lb/> the Red
               River country, there are areas of <lb/> arable land, ranging from 200,000 acres
               <lb/> downwards, with facilities for opening up <lb/> communication by land and
               water; and I <lb/> do not wonder that the late Sir GEORGE <lb/> SIMPSON, while
               making his celebrated <lb/> journey round the world, in passing from <lb/> Montreal
               to Red River, and thence overland <lb/> to the Pacific, should be struck with the
               <lb/> extraordinary advantages of this country, <lb/> and that on one occasion,
               when surveying <lb/> the magnificent expanse of inland lake and <lb/> river
               navigation, in the midst of a fertile <lb/> country, he should exclaim— <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

               does, the fertile shores <lb/> of two spacious lakes, with crowded steamboats <lb/>

            <p> (Applause) Sir GEORGE SIMPSON was <lb/> not a man likely
               to be carried away <lb/> by mere impulse; but viewing the prospect <lb/> before
               him, he could not refrain from <lb/> .breaking forth in the glowing language I
               <lb/> have quoted. Then glance for a moment <lb/> at the Saskatchewan, the
               Assiniboine and <lb/> the Red River country, with the Red River <lb/> settlement of
               10,000 people, forming the <lb/> nucleus for a future province—a nucleus <lb/>
               around which immigration could be drawn <lb/> so as to build up in that distant
               region a <lb/> powerful section of the Confederation. It <lb/> is a country which
               embraces 360,000 square <lb/> miles, and the Red River, Lake Winnipeg, <lb/> and
               the Saskatchewan afford a navigable <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         
water line of 1,400 miles. And what is the <lb/>
               character of the country? On this point I <lb/> would quote Professor HIND, who
               describes <lb/> the valley of the Red River and a large <lb/> portion of the
               country on its afiuent, the <lb/> Assiniboine, as "a paradise of fertility." <lb/>
               He could speak of it in no other terms <lb/> " than of astonishment and admiration."
               He <lb/> adds that as an agricultural country the <lb/> character of the soil could
               not be surpassed,
               <lb/> affirming in proof of this assertion :— <lb/>
            </p>
         
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> That all kinds of farm produce common in <lb/> Canada

               <hi rendition="simple:italic">Blodgett's Climatology</hi>, he will
               find it stated <lb/> as having been demonstrated that the <lb/> climate of the
               North-West coast, and of the <lb/> interior towards Lake Winnipeg, is quite the
               <lb/> reverse of that experienced in the same <lb/> latitude on the Atlantic, and
               is highly
               <lb/> favorable to occupation and settlement." <lb/> (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, I
               desire now <lb/> to place before the House the extent of the <lb/> territory we
               possess in the Atlantic and <lb/> Pacific Provinces. The Atlantic Provinces <lb/>
               comprise Canada East, with an area of <lb/> 201,989 square miles; Canada West, 148,<lb break="no"/>832; New Brunswick, 27,700; Nova Scotia, <lb/> 18,746 ; Prince Edward Island,
               2,134; <lb/> Newfoundland, 35,913—together 435,314 <lb/> square miles, to which add
               the territory of <lb/> Labrador, 5,000 miles, making a grand total <lb/> of 440,314 square miles, embracing a popu<lb break="no"/>lation of something like 4,000,000 of souls. <lb/> The Pacific Provinces are British
               Columbia, <lb/> containing 200,000 square miles, and Van<lb break="no"/>couver's Island,
               with 12,000 square miles; <lb/> and there is the territory of Hudson's Bay <lb/>
               (including Central British North America), <lb/> with 2,700,000 square miles. (Hear,
               hear.) <lb/> I desire now, sir, to thank the House for <lb/> the patience with
               which hon. members have <lb/> listened to my remarks. I rose at a late <lb/> hour
               in the evening, and seeing that the <lb/> House was wearied when I commenced, I
               <lb/> did not wish to prolong the debate. I have <lb/> thus shortened very much the
               remarks I <lb/> intended to offer, and have treated only <lb/> hurriedly and
               casually on many points which <lb/> might have engaged further attention under <lb/> other
               circumstances. I desire to express <lb/> my
               confident opinion, before closing, that <lb/>

     this great scheme is not one which ought to 
     <lb/>
     be factiously met. For if ever there was a 
     <lb/>
     plan submitted to any legislature which 
     <lb/>
     deserved tobe treated with an avoidance of 
     <lb/>
     party feeling, it is this. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     is evident that in the House there are a 
     <lb/>
     large majority in favor of the plan, and while 
     <lb/>
     it is their duty to concede to the minority— 
     <lb/>
     what is the right of the minority—the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of stating their objections to it, 
     <lb/>
     it is, on the other hand, an evidence of the 
     <lb/>
     strongest kind that the majority, in support<lb break="no"/>ing this measure, believe they are doing the 
     <lb/>
     best for their country, and that it is a measure 
     <lb/>
     which meets the popular sanction and ap<lb break="no"/>proval, when they avow by their own act 
     <lb/>
     their readiness to return to the people 
     <lb/>
     for their approval of the steps they have 
     <lb/>
     thought proper to take. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     is the duty of those who are in favor 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme—and I believe there are 
     <lb/>
     a very large majority who see in it 
     <lb/>
     advantages of the most substantial kind—I 
     <lb/>
     am firmly persuaded that it is a duty they 
     <lb/>
     owe to those who sent them to th's House, 
     <lb/>
     it is a duty they owe to the country, it is a 
     <lb/>
     duty they owe to the great empire of which 
     <lb/>
     we form a part, to bring this scheme to a 
     <lb/>
     speedy consummation. I am glad, sir, in 
     <lb/>
     taking a retrospect of the three eventful 
     <lb/>
     years during which I have had a seat in this 
     <lb/>
     House, to reflect that on the first occasion 
     <lb/>
     I had the honor of addressing the House, in 
     <lb/>
     1861, I declared myself in favor of an analo<lb break="no"/>gous scheme to that we are new discussing; 
     <lb/>
     that I then expressed myself in favor of a 
     <lb/>
     general government of the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces, with separate local 
     <lb/>
     legislatures, in the following terms, when

     to meet the question fairly and to come down

     with a measure satisfactory to the country. It 
     <lb/>
     might be that that measure would be one which 
     <lb/>
     would bring together the different provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British North America into a union, formed on 
     <lb/>
     such a basis as would give to the peeple of each

     province the right to manage their own internal

     affairs, while at the same time the whole should 
     <lb/>
     provide for the management of matters of common

     I have held this opinion ever since I have

     of this country, and I would beg to be

     allowed further to quote language I used in

     done hurriedly to-night, the extent of our

     <lb/>
     pro ed to be carried into effect, I spoke 
     <lb/>
     as follows, in a lecture on the Hudson Bay

     and Pacific territory, delivered in Montreal:

     and the Rocky Mountains, with a railway and a 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     and our inland and ocean channels of trade

     <lb/>
     if the people of these British Provinces are 
     <lb/>
     but true to themselves, and if the statesmen 
     <lb/>
     of Britain now set aright their part in this 
     <lb/>
     great crisis of our national history, this vision 
     <lb/>
     will be realized. We will have the pride to 
     <lb/>
     belong to a great country still attached to 
     <lb/>
     the Crown of Great Britain, but in which, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding, we shall have entire free<lb break="no"/>dom of action and the blessings of responsible 
     <lb/>

     self-government; and I am satisfied we will 
     <lb/>
     see as the results of this union all that we 
     <lb/>
     could possibly imagine as its fruits. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Thanking the House for their kind 
     <lb/>
     attention, I have only to say further, that I 
     <lb/>
     believe the plan under which we seek to ask 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament of Great Britain to legislate 
     <lb/>
     for us is a wise and judicious one, and which 
     <lb/>
     not only deserves, but which I am confident 
     <lb/>
     will receive, the hearty support of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives and of the people of this province, 
     <lb/>
     and to which I, for one, shall feel it my duty 
     <lb/>
     to give my warmest and most cordial sanction. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     MR. BURWELL, in resuming the debate 
     <lb/>
     upon Confederation, said-—Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     before allowing a measure of this importance 
     <lb/>
     to go through the House, I feel it my duty 
     <lb/>
     to ofler a few words upon it. The question 
     <lb/>
     of Federation is not a new one to my consti<lb break="no"/>tuents. Ever since the Reform Convention 
     <lb/>
     in Toronto, in 1859, they have been quite 
     <lb/>
     familiar with it. At the general election in 
     <lb/>
     1861, in an address to my constituents, I 
     <lb/>
     stated that in case we should not be able to 
     <lb/>
     get representation by population, I would 
     <lb/>
     be in favor of Federation of the two provin<lb break="no"/>ces of Canada, with a Local Government in 
     <lb/>
     each province and a Central Government to 
     <lb/>
     administer matters common to both, provi<lb break="no"/>sion to be made to admit the Eastern Provin<lb break="no"/>ces and the North-West territory, should they 
     <lb/>
     see fit to enter the union, of course with the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of Great Britain. And at the last 
     <lb/>
     general election in 1863, I addressed them 
     <lb/>
     in precisely the same language. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The agitation for constitutional 
     <lb/>
     changes had been so general and persistent 
     <lb/>
     for a length of time in Upper Canada, that 
     <lb/>
     it was impossible to all appearance to stave 
     <lb/>
     off much longer some action in reference to 
     <lb/>
     the difficulty. Efforts were made at different 
     <lb/>
     times to secure represention by popu<lb break="no"/>lation as a remedy, but without success. 
     <lb/>
     The nearest approach to a remedy for the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty under which Upper Canada labors, 
     <lb/>
     is, in my opinion, the resolutions of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Conference now before the House, 
     <lb/>
     and the question for consideration is whether 
     <lb/>
     they are acceptable to us and our people, or 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     not. The principle of Federation, in my view 
     <lb/>
     has been a great success on this continent 
     <lb/>
     I think that, if we look to the history of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, it cannot be denied that there 
     <lb/>
     as a principle of free government, it has 
     <lb/>
     been successful; and I doubt whether his<lb break="no"/>tory records a like example, under ordinary 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, of such great success and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. The present trouble in that 
     <lb/>
     country—the war now raging there—is not in 
     <lb/>
     my opinion attributable to the federative 
     <lb/>
     form of government adopted there. I a- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     tribute it to different causes altogether 
     <lb/>
     which might have existed, had it been. 
     <lb/>
     monarchical or a despotic government that 
     <lb/>
     prevailed. Slavery existed there and was 
     <lb/>
     the cause of the war. It was opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the age, and had to be eradicated 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) There were, no doubt, other 
     <lb/>
     causes which had some inffuence in bringing 
     <lb/>
     it about; such, for instance, as the desire of 
     <lb/>
     the North for a high protective tariff to en 
     <lb/>
     courage its domestic manufactures, and the 
     <lb/>
     opposing interest of the South in favor of 
     <lb/>
     free trade, so that, manufacturing nothing 
     <lb/>
     itself, it might have all the benefit of cheap 
     <lb/>
     importations. These, sir, I conceive were 
     <lb/>
     the two great causes of the difficulty in the 
     <lb/>
     United States. Now, in forming a Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government in these provinces, I think we 
     <lb/>
     should look for an example to a people who 
     <lb/>
     are similar to us in situation, habits and 
     <lb/>
     customs. I find that example in the people 
     <lb/>
     of the United States. (Hear, hear.) My 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from Lambton cited the 
     <lb/>
     example of a great many other countries 
     <lb/>
     but they were not not perhaps accus<lb break="no"/>tomed so much to free government as the 
     <lb/>
     United States; for it was not Federation 
     <lb/>
     that first gave them liberty, the old colonies 
     <lb/>
     of New England enjoying a large share of 
     <lb/>
     liberty long before the adoption of Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government by them. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     plan preposed by the Conference at Quebec 
     <lb/>
     is, in my opinion, too restrictive, as regards 
     <lb/>
     the power of the Local Legislatures. It 
     <lb/>
    gives too much power to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I am one of those, sir, who believes 
     <lb/>that the appointment of the deputy or 
     <lb/>lieutenant governors should not be in the 
     <lb/>gift of the General Government, but that 
     <lb/>they should be elected by the people 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I believe, too, that the 
     <lb/>members of the Legislative Council should 
     <lb/>be elected by the people. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>There is no element in this country— no. 
     <lb/>class in this country, nor do I think it 
     <lb/>possible to create a class—the counterpart of 
     <lb/>
