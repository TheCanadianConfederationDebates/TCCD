 <!--<p>
     fortunes of his country. He has long la<lb break="no"/>mented, like JEREMIAH, over the thought 
     <lb/>
     of the disasters which were overwhelming it. 
     <lb/>
     And at last, in 1858, enlightened by the in<lb break="no"/>telligence of his luminous friend the member 
     <lb/>
     for Chateauguay, he thought he had dis<lb break="no"/>covered in direct taxation the remedy for the 
     <lb/>
     evils which were bringing it to its grave. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But to-day he rejects a 
     <lb/>
     scheme which may save the country without 
     <lb/>
     its being necessary to have recourse to this 
     <lb/>
     extreme and objectionable remedy. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) If the scheme becomes law, not 
     <lb/>
     only shall we have a sufficient revenue 
     <lb/>
     to meet our local expenditure, but we 
     <lb/>
     shall also have a surplus with which, 
     <lb/>
     if we practise wise economy, to pay off 
     <lb/>
     by degrees the residue of the debt which 
     <lb/>
     will remain to us. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga tells us that Lower Canada will 
     <lb/>
     be burthened with a local debt of more than 
     <lb/>
     $4,500,000; but we have clear and palpable 
     <lb/>
     proof that the debt of Canada, deducting the 
     <lb/>
     part of the Sinking Fund which has been 
     <lb/>
     paid, amounts to only $67,500,000. Now 
     <lb/>
     our share of the Federal debt is established 
     <lb/>
     at $62,500,000. There will consequently 
     <lb/>
     remain less than $5,000,000 to be divided 
     <lb/>
     between the two Canadas, and all the argu<lb break="no"/>ments of the hon. member will not change 
     <lb/>
     so incontestable a fact as this. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We do not get these figures from the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance. They are given to us 
     <lb/>
     by a man who is perfectly independent of all 
     <lb/>
     Ministers and of all parties—a man whom I 
     <lb/>
     myself formerly reproached with being too 
     <lb/>
     much so; I allude to Mr. LANGTON, the 
     <lb/>
     Auditor of Accounts. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     do not yet know, it is true, how this debt of 
     <lb/>
     four millions and some hundred thousand 
     <lb/>
     dollars will be divided between the two 
     <lb/>
     Canadas, but we do know, without any possi<lb break="no"/>bility of doubt, that the local revenues will 
     <lb/>
     belong to the local governments, and 
     <lb/>
     that they will amply suffice for all their 
     <lb/>
     requirements. (Hear, hear.) The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga complains that Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada retains her public lands and what is 
     <lb/>
     owing to Government on those lands, and he 
     <lb/>
     maintains that Lower Canada ought to have 
     <lb/>
     her share of what those lands produce. But 
     <lb/>
     did those lands beleng to us before the 
     <lb/>
     union, and have we not our own public 
     <lb/>
     lands, together with the revenue accruing 
     <lb/>
     from them? Have we not more lands to 
     <lb/>
     settle than Upper Canada? Since the 
     <lb/>
     discovery of our gold and copper mines the 
     <lb/>
     amount produced by the sale of our public 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     lands has increased fivefold, whilst Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada has hardly any land left to sell. Let 
     <lb/>
     our mines be opened, and we shall find that 
     <lb/>
     we have no reason to envy Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Everything is well adjusted; 
     <lb/>
     for if we have a less considerable revenue 
     <lb/>
     than Upper Canada, our population is also less 
     <lb/>
     numerous. Upper Canada possesses a more 
     <lb/>
     considerable revenue, but one which must 
     <lb/>
     diminish with the decrease of the quantity of 
     <lb/>
     land to be sold, whilst we have a revenue 
     <lb/>
     which is gradually increasing. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member would no doubt hand over 
     <lb/>
     the public lands to the Confederation so as 
     <lb/>
     to be in accordance with his plan of 1859, 
     <lb/>
     as set forth in the Montreal manifesto; but 
     <lb/>
     I am certain that Lower Canada does not 
     <lb/>
     share his opinion. He talked to us also of 
     <lb/>
     marriage and divorce. He said: " Now, 
     <lb/>
     you will not vote directly for divorce, but 
     <lb/>
    you vote to establish divorce courts." Well! 
     <lb/>no one condemns divorce more than I do 
     <lb/>myself, and I am convinced that the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Hochelaga would accept it 
     <lb/>sooner than I would. But if no mention 
     <lb/>was made of divorce in the Constitution, 
     <lb/>if it was not assigned to the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, it would of necessity belong to the 
     <lb/>local parliaments as it belongs to our Legis<lb break="no"/>lature now, although there is not one word 
     <lb/>respecting it in the Union Act. For my 
     <lb/>part, I would rather see that power removed 
     <lb/>to a distance from us, since it must exist 
     <lb/>somewhere in spite of us. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>These reasonings on the question of marriage 
     <lb/>are extraordinary to a degree, coming from 
     <lb/>a man holding a position at the bar. They 
     <lb/>are so extraordinary, and so inconsistent 
     <lb/>with all logic and all law, that I shall not 
     <lb/>take the trouble of controverting them. The 
     <lb/>explanations of the Government have satis<lb break="no"/>fied me on that point. The legislative power 
     <lb/>of the Federal Parliament in relation to 
     <lb/>marriage will only be that which is conferred 
     <lb/>by the Constitution, notwithstanding the 
     <lb/>singular assertions of the honorable member.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName> said— 
     <lb/>
     Before the debate is resumed, I wish to say a 
     <lb/>
     few words. I would call the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House to the telegram received to-day—which 
     <lb/>
     is rather confused in its terms—with reference 
     <lb/>
     to a debate in the House of Lords on the 
     <lb/>
     subject of the defences of Canada. According 
     <lb/>
     to this telegram, "Earl DE GREY, Secretary of 
     <lb/>
     State for War, admitted the importance of the 
     <lb/>
     question, but regretted that any doubt should 
     <lb/>
     be expressed of the conciliatory intentions of 
     <lb/>
     the Americans. The Government would ask 
     <lb/>
     a vote of £50,000 for the Quebec defences, 
     <lb/>
     while the Canadians would undertake the de<lb break="no"/>fences of Montreal and westward." The 
     <lb/>
     amount, according to another statement, is 
     <lb/>
     £30,000. The figures are apparently a mis<lb break="no"/>take for £300,000. My object in rising was 
     <lb/>
     to state that so far as we could gather from 
     <lb/>
     this confused summary of the debate, the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government were about to ask a 
     <lb/>
     a certain amount for the defences of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     while the Canadians would undertake the 
     <lb/>
     defence of Montreal and the country west<lb break="no"/>ward. I may state it is quite true that 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government made a proposition 
     <lb/>
     some time ago to the effect that they were 
     <lb/>
     willing and prepared to recommend to Par<lb break="no"/>liament a vote for the defence of Quebec, as is 
     <lb/>
     here stated, provided this province undertook 
     <lb/>
     the defence of Montreal and points westward. 
     <lb/>
     Negotiations have been going on on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion between the Imperial Government and 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Government ever since, and I 
     <lb/>
     think that there is every reason to believe 
     <lb/>
     that these negotiations will result most favor<lb break="no"/>ably, and that arrangements will be made in a 
     <lb/>
     manner such as to secure the defence of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, both east and west—in a manner 
     <lb/>
     such as to ensure the fullest protection to the 
     <lb/>
     country, and as at the same time will not press 
     <lb/>
     unduly on the energies of the people. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Sir, these negotiations are still proceeding 
     <lb/>
     —they have not yet concluded—and it must 
     <lb/>
     be obvious to every honorable member who 
     <lb/>
     has read this short synopsis of the debate in 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Parliament, that it is of the 
     <lb/>
     greatest possible importance that Canada 
     <lb/>
     should not be unrepresented in England at 
     <lb/>
     the present time. (Cheers.) It must be 
     <lb/>
     evident to all that some of the leading mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Administration should be in 
     <lb/>
     England at this juncture, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     attending to Canadian interests, and of con<lb break="no"/>cluding these negotiations without any loss of 
     <lb/>
     time whatever. (Hear, hear.) It is desirable, 
     <lb/>
     as I stated yesterday, that the two questions 
     <lb/>
     of Federation and Defence should be discussed 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
    

     at the same moment, and that the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     should be taken of exactly ascertaining 
     <lb/>
     the position of British North America with 
     <lb/>
     respect to her degree of reliance on the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government in a political sense, as well 
     <lb/>
     as with regard to the question of defence. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, there should not be any loss of 
     <lb/>
     time whatever, and with that view the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would ask this House—as the discus<lb break="no"/>sion has already gone on to a considerable 
     <lb/>
     length, and a great many honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     have spoken on the subject—that it will offer 
     <lb/>
     no undue delay in coming to a conclusion in 
     <lb/>
     this matter. Of course the Government would 
     <lb/>
     not attempt to shut down the floodgates against 
     <lb/>
     all discussion; but they would merely ask 
     <lb/>
     and invite the House to consider the import<lb break="no"/>ance of as early a vote as the house can pro<lb break="no"/>perly allow to be taken upon this question. 
     <lb/>
     It is for the House to determine whether the 
     <lb/>
     Federation scheme which has been proposed 
     <lb/>
     by the Government and laid before the House 
     <lb/>
     is one which, with all its faults, should be 
     <lb/>
     adopted, or whether we shall be thrown upon 
     <lb/>
     an uncertain future. In order that the House 
     <lb/>
     may at once come to an understanding in the 
     <lb/>
     matter, I shall, as I stated yesterday, take 
     <lb/>
     every possible step known to parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     usage to get a vote as soon as it can con<lb break="no"/>veniently be got, and I have therefore now to 
     <lb/>
     move the previous question. (Ironical Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition cheers and counter cheering.) I move, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that the main question be now put. 
     <lb/>
     (More cheering.) Honorable gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite know very well that my making this 
     <lb/>
     motion does not in any way stop the debate. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The House will be gratified 
     <lb/>
     to hear, and will still have an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     hearing, from the honorable member from 
     <lb/>
     Chateauguay (Hon. Mr. HOLTON), who cries 
     <lb/>
     "Hear, hear," an expression of opinion 
     <lb/>
     whether this scheme is so objectionable that 
     <lb/>
     the House would be wise in rejecting it, with 
     <lb/>
     nothing now offered as a substitute, and no 
     <lb/>
     future to look to. It will afford us all great 
     <lb/>
     pleasure to hear the honorable gentleman say 
     <lb/>
     whether we should adept this scheme. There 
     <lb/>
     is an independent motion on the paper of my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from Peel (Hon. J. H. 
     <lb/>
     CAMERON). My motion does not interfere 
     <lb/>
     with that. But if the House should consider 
     <lb/>
     that this scheme ought to be adopted, my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend will then have an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of proposing his motion. (Hear, hear.) 
</p>

<p>
     THE SPEAKER—If honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     desire it, I will read the rule of the House as 
     <lb/>
     to the previous question. The 35th rule of 
     <lb/>
     the House is as follows:—" The previous 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="704" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0704.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">704</fw>
         

     question, until it is decided, shall preclude all 
     <lb/>
     amendments to the main question" —(ironical 
     <lb/>
     Opposition cheers)—" and shall be in the 
     <lb/>
     following word:—' That this question be now 
     <lb/>
     put.' It the previous question be resolved in 
     <lb/>
     the affirmative, the original question is put 
     <lb/>
     forthwith, without amendment or debate." 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. MR. CARTIER</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     second the motion. (Derisive Opposition 
     <lb/>
     cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">THE SPEAKER</persName>—The motion is that 
     <lb/>
     this question be now put. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I shall not on this 
     <lb/>
     occasion, sir, make any remarks as to the 
     <lb/>
     mode of proceeding adopted by the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West, further than this, 
     <lb/>
     that a friend, an honorable member of this 
     <lb/>
     House, intimated to me yesterday that this 
     <lb/>
     course was likely to be pursued by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in order to crowd this measure 
     <lb/>
     through the House. I scouted the idea. I 
     <lb/>
     thought it was impossible that a government, 
     <lb/>
     numbering in its ranks public men who have 
     <lb/>
     played a prominent part in the parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     history of this country for some years, could 
     <lb/>
     resort to so base a trick—(cheers and coun<lb break="no"/>ter cheers)— after having introduced this 
     <lb/>
     measure in the manner they have done—after 
     <lb/>
     having introduced it in a most unparliament<lb break="no"/>ary and unconstitutional manner—and seeing 
     <lb/>
     that amendments would be made to several 
     <lb/>
     of the propositions contained in the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions adopted by the Conference which assem<lb break="no"/>bled in Quebec, they shut off all opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to amend the measure by moving the previous 
     <lb/>
     question. (Hear, hear.) Why was it not 
     <lb/>
     stated by the Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West himself that we would be able to get 
     <lb/>
     at the sense of the House upon every one of 
     <lb/>
     the propositions, by moving amendments? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) In full confidence that that 
     <lb/>
     pledge would be kept, when my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend who sits near me told me he had reason 
     <lb/>
     to believe that this very course was in con<lb break="no"/>templation, I repeat I scouted the idea. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I shall not offer any further 
     <lb/>
     observations on this point at the present mo<lb break="no"/>ment, beyond remarking that if the object be 
     <lb/>
     to curtail debate, as the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     says it is—if his real motive be in truth to ar<lb break="no"/>rive at an early vote upon this question—his 
     <lb/>
     own statement shows how utterly futile his 
     <lb/>
     motion is to accomplish that end. It was 
     <lb/>
     not at all necessary that the honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman should have told us that we may 
     <lb/>
     discuss the previous question. We are now, 
     <lb/>
     by a compact which I presume will not be 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
     

     violated—although I do not know what at<lb break="no"/>tempt will be made next—we are practically 
     <lb/>
     in Committee of the Whole, with liberty to 
     <lb/>
     speak as often as we please on this question. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, the object stated by the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman cannot be attained, but another 
     <lb/>
     object can be and will be attained—they will 
     <lb/>
     take their followers, whom they have already 
     <lb/>
     led on to do things of which they will bitterly 
     <lb/>
     repent when they come face to face with 
     <lb/>
     their constituents, and drag them still 
     <lb/>
     further through the mire—(cheers and coun<lb break="no"/>ter cheers)—by depriving them of the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of putting on record their views, even 
     <lb/>
     in the inconvenient form of amendments, upon 
     <lb/>
     the various propositions which are proposed 
     <lb/>
     to be embodied in this Address to the Crown. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Sir, the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     says that the information received by tele<lb break="no"/>graph in reference to the defences renders it 
     <lb/>
     necessary that an early decision should be 
     <lb/>
     come to in the matter of Federation. But 
     <lb/>
     what has been the course of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite, throughout this debate, 
     <lb/>
     when the subject of the defences has been re<lb break="no"/>ferred to? When we have said—" Put us in 
     <lb/>
     possession of the necessary information to 
     <lb/>
     consider the subject of the defences, which 
     <lb/>
     must be discussed in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation," what has been the 
     <lb/>
     reply? Why, that there was no natural or 
     <lb/>
     necessary connection between the two sub<lb break="no"/>jects. (Hear, hear.) Thus, when the honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen were asked to bring down the 
     <lb/>
     information in regard to the defences, they 
     <lb/>
     have maintained that there is no connection 
     <lb/>
     between the two questions; but when they 
     <lb/>
     have a purpose to serve by so doing, they re<lb break="no"/>verse their position and say, "By all means 
     <lb/>
     rush this thing through with all possible speed, 
     <lb/>
     in order that the country may be placed in a po<lb break="no"/>sition of defence." I think, sir, we are entitled 
     <lb/>
     at this stage of the debate, and under these 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, to demand that all the infor<lb break="no"/>mation in possession of the Government in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the defences, should be laid before 
     <lb/>
     the House. I believe there is no better re<lb break="no"/>cognized parliamentary rule than this, that 
     <lb/>
     when a Minister of the Crown rises in his 
     <lb/>
     place in Parliament and refers to despatches 
     <lb/>
     on matters of public importance, these des<lb break="no"/>patches must be laid before the House. It 
     <lb/>
     is founded on the same rule which prevails in 
     <lb/>
     our courts, which requires that any paper re<lb break="no"/>ferred to in evidence or argument, in order 
     <lb/>
     to be of use, must be in the possession of the 
     <lb/>
     court. I should like to ask the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West the question—and I pause for 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="705" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0705.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">705</fw>
       

     an answer—whether it is the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     Government, before pressing this resolution 
     <lb/>
     to a vote, to place the House in possession of 
     <lb/>
     the information for which I am now seeking? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—It 
     <lb/>
     certainly is not, and for reasons of the best 
     <lb/>
     kind.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman says it certainly is not. And 
     <lb/>
     yet he asks us to give a vote, in view of 
     <lb/>
     information which he withholds, not mere<lb break="no"/>ly on the question of the defences, but of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation as well. If the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman had used the arguments for 
     <lb/>
     withholding information which he has 
     <lb/>
     put forth, if the proposition were simply 
     <lb/>
     a money vote to place the country in a 
     <lb/>
     state of defence, there might be some reason 
     <lb/>
     in it, but he is using them to induce us 
     <lb/>
     to vote for a political scheme embracing all 
     <lb/>
     sorts of things other than the question of 
     <lb/>
     defence. The position the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     now assumes is unconstitutional; but being 
     <lb/>
     unconstitutional, it is in perfect keeping with 
     <lb/>
     the whole course of this Administration 
     <lb/>
     since its formation in June last, when it 
     <lb/>
     initiated its existence by pledging the Crown, 
     <lb/>
     in a written document, not to exercise the 
     <lb/>
     prerogative of dissolution until another 
     <lb/>
     session of this Parliament should have been 
     <lb/>
     held. (Hear, hear.) I say that their course 
     <lb/>
     in this instance is in keeping with every 
     <lb/>
     step they have taken since their formation. 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, I have put one question to the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West, and I propose now, 
     <lb/>
     with the leave of my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     member for North Wellington, who is 
     <lb/>
     entitled to the floor, to put another question. 
     <lb/>
     He may answer it or not, as he thinks 
     <lb/>
     proper; but the country will draw its own 
     <lb/>
     inference from his reply. Yesterday, he 
     <lb/>
     stated that in consequence of the result of 
     <lb/>
     the New Brunswick elections, it had become 
     <lb/>
     tolerably apparent that this scheme had 
     <lb/>
     received its first check. In other words, he 
     <lb/>
     admitted plainly that the result of the New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick elections was adverse to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. I may add, that he knows very 
     <lb/>
     well a majority of the present Parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia is adverse to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—No! no! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I say, yes; and in 
     <lb/>
     the Island of Prince Edward, there is no 
     <lb/>
     probability whatever of the scheme being 
     <lb/>
     accepted. Well, notwithstanding this, he 
     <lb/>
     says that he shall press this measure to a 
     <lb/>
     vote. A. question was put yesterday, which 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     

     was answered; but there is some misap<lb break="no"/>prehension as to the purport of the answer, 
     <lb/>
     and I think it will be admitted to be a 
     <lb/>
     question in regard to which there should 
     <lb/>
     not be any misapprehension whatever.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—You could 
     <lb/>
     not understand it.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Well, I admit the 
     <lb/>
     obtuseness of my understanding. The 
     <lb/>
     question I desire to ask the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Government is this—Is it the intention of 
     <lb/>
     the Government to press for Imperial legis<lb break="no"/>lation, under the Address which they are 
     <lb/>
     now inviting the House to adopt, affecting 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces, or any of them, with<lb break="no"/>out the concurrence of those provinces? 
     <lb/>
     That is the question I desire to ask the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—It is 
     <lb/>
     not the intention of the Canadian Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to press the Imperial Government to 
     <lb/>
     pass any act whatever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Then clearly the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman was misunderstood yester<lb break="no"/>day. He then stated that it was of the 
     <lb/>
     highest possible importance this measure 
     <lb/>
     should pass without delay, in order that the 
     <lb/>
     Ministry might go home and consult with 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government in respect to the 
     <lb/>
     bill to be introduced to give effect to this 
     <lb/>
     Address.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —And that is correct.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RANK1">MR. RANKIN</persName>—The Government do not 
     <lb/>
     intend to "press" for Imperial legislation.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I do not want to 
     <lb/>
     quibble about mere words. What I want to 
     <lb/>
     know is—whether, in pursuance of this 
     <lb/>
     Address, hon. gentlemen intend to ask, or 
     <lb/>
     have any reason to expect that the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government—(Hon. Mr. BROWN—" Oh! 
     <lb/>
     oh!")—or have any reason to expect that 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government will legislate with<lb break="no"/>out the concurrence of the Lower Provinces? 
     <lb/>
     Whether, in point of fact, if the concurrence 
     <lb/>
     of the Lower Provinces be withheld from 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of the Conference, he has reason 
     <lb/>
     to believe that legislation can be had thereon? 
     <lb/>
     I desire to know, first, whether he intends to 
     <lb/>
     ask for such legislation; and, second, whether 
     <lb/>
     he thinks it can be had?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—I 
     <lb/>
     think the House, and even the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man himself, must see the unreasonableness 
     <lb/>
     of the question he asks, which is, whether 
     <lb/>
     I have any expectation that the British 
     <lb/>
     Government will enact some compulsory 
     <lb/>
     law against the will of the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>

vinces on the question of Federation. All 
     <lb/>
     that I can say is, that I have no better means 
     <lb/>
     of forming an opinion on the subject than the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman himself. What I stated 
     <lb/>
     yesterday I repeat to-day, that the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Government, knowing that the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the people of New Brunswick has been 
     <lb/>
     expressed against Federation, would em<lb break="no"/>brace the earliest opportunity of discuss<lb break="no"/>ing with the Imperial Government the 
     <lb/>
     position of British North America, especially 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the present state of affairs 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, containing a population of four- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     fifths of the people of British North America, 
     <lb/>
     in favor of Federation, as against New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, with a population of two hun<lb break="no"/>dred odd thousand against it. In discussing 
     <lb/>
     the question with Her Majesty's Imperial 
     <lb/>
     advisers, we shall probably enter into the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the whole matter; but 
     <lb/>
     what the nature of these discussions may be, 
     <lb/>
     or what they will lead to or will not lead to, 
     <lb/>
     I cannot possibly say. They may lead to 
     <lb/>
     conclusions, but what those conclusions may 
     <lb/>
     be no mortal man can tell. We cannot say 
     <lb/>
     to what conclusions the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment may come. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I am obliged to 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman for his courteous 
     <lb/>
     answer. I think it is, on the whole, a satis<lb break="no"/>factory answer, because the answer plainly 
     <lb/>
     implies this, that without the concurrence 
     <lb/>
     of the Lower Provinces this measure cannot 
     <lb/>
     go on. That is the plain implication. We 
     <lb/>
     know well that we shall not have the con<lb break="no"/>currence of the Lower Provinces, and there<lb break="no"/>fore it is absurd to ask this House to vote a 
     <lb/>
     measure which the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     themselves, as they have risen one after 
     <lb/>
     another in the course of this debate, have 
     <lb/>
     declared to be an imperfect measure—a 
     <lb/>
     measure of compromise—not such a measure 
     <lb/>
     as they, in many respects, desired and advo<lb break="no"/>cated, but a measure which they had con<lb break="no"/>curred in for the purpose of inducing the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces to become parties to it. 
     <lb/>
     Why, I ask, should this House be called 
     <lb/>
     upon to vote for the objectionable features 
     <lb/>
     of a scheme, when there is no longer any 
     <lb/>
     reason for such a vote—when it is admitted 
     <lb/>
     that the Lower Provinces, for whose sake 
     <lb/>
     these objectionable features were introduced, 
     <lb/>
     will not consent and cannot be coerced into 
     <lb/>
     it? (Hear, hear.) The Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council told the people of Toronto, at the 
     <lb/>
     banquet recently held there, that he was 
     <lb/>
     entirely opposed to the new constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council, and that he op<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
       
posed it in the Conference. We know also 
     <lb/>
     that that feature of the scheme is very objec<lb break="no"/>tionable to the whole of what might once 
     <lb/>
     have been called the Liberal party, but the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council has destroyed 
     <lb/>
     that party, and it is not, perhaps, right to 
     <lb/>
     speak of it as the Liberal party any longer— 
     <lb/>
     they are only now to be known as those who 
     <lb/>
     once ranged themselves together, in Upper 
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada, under the Liberal banner. 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. President of the Council stated, that 
     <lb/>
     as representing in the Conference the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party of Upper Canada—the Liberal party of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada having no representation in 
     <lb/>
     the Conference at all—as representing the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party of Upper Canada, the party 
     <lb/>
     from that section which is in a large ma<lb break="no"/>jority in this House, the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man stated that he was opposed to this 
     <lb/>
     feature of the scheme—a feature which is 
     <lb/>
     known to be as unpalatable to a large 
     <lb/>
     majority of this House as it is to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman himself. I merely mention this 
     <lb/>
     to illustrate my argument. Why should 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen, who were disposed to accept 
     <lb/>
     this scheme as a whole, notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     these objectionable features—who were dis<lb break="no"/>posed to accept it, on the grounds set forth 
     <lb/>
     by their leaders, as a measure of compromise 
     <lb/>
     —why, I ask, should they now be called 
     <lb/>
     upon to vote in opposition to their convic<lb break="no"/>tions, merely to gratify the <hi rendition="simple:italic">amour-propre</hi> 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentlemen on the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     benches, whose desire it is to carry through 
     <lb/>
     the House an Address which, by their own 
     <lb/>
     admission made to this House, must be of 
     <lb/>
     non-effect? (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—But 
     <lb/>
     that it will be the Constitution of this

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man boasts that it will be the Constitution of

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—

     What I meant was, of all British North

     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man said "of this country." The hon.

     <lb/>
     in procuring the concurrence of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces to the measure—that, if they 
     <lb/>
     cannot be brought into the scheme for re<lb break="no"/>constructing their Governments—they are 
     <lb/>
     going to ask the Imperial Government to

     found a Constitution for the two Canadas 
     <lb/>
     upon these resolutions.

            <fw type="num">707</fw>
          

     hon. gentleman has drawn erroneous in<lb break="no"/>ferences from what I stated. When I said 
     <lb/>
     I had no doubt that the resolutions now 
     <lb/>
     before the House would be the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     of this country, I meant to say I had no 
     <lb/>
     more doubt than that I stand here that it 
     <lb/>
     would be adopted not only by Canada, but 
     <lb/>
     by the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Ah! The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has "no doubt." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—You 
     <lb/>
     are trying to twist my words; but go on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I have not had 
     <lb/>
     the same training as the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     in the way of word twisting. I take his 
     <lb/>
     words in their plain and literal sense. He 
     <lb/>
     says he has no doubt that these resolutions 
     <lb/>
     will form the Constitution of this country. 
     <lb/>
     Then, sir, why do not honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     keep faith? Why does not the Hon. President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council, in an especial manner, keep 
     <lb/>
     faith with his party, by giving us the scheme 
     <lb/>
     which he pledged himself, in the event of 
     <lb/>
     such a contingency as this, should be 
     <lb/>
     brought down during this session of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment? The honorable gentleman does not 
     <lb/>
     find it convenient to answer. I confess I 
     <lb/>
     did not expect an answer; but nevertheless 
     <lb/>
     I thought it desirable to put the question to 
     <lb/>
     him. I, equally with other members of the 
     <lb/>
     House, can draw my inferences from his 
     <lb/>
     silence. He knows very well it is a viola<lb break="no"/>tion of the programme under which he 
     <lb/>
     entered the Government; and well he knows 
     <lb/>
     that it is a departure from the avowal which 
     <lb/>
     constituted, I will not say his justification, 
     <lb/>
     but his sole excuse for occupying the seat 
     <lb/>
     which he now fills. The question is now 
     <lb/>
     asked whether it is intended by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to go to England and ask the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament to establish a Constitution for 
     <lb/>
     this country, the principles of which have 
     <lb/>
     never been considered, because we are con<lb break="no"/>sidering now the scheme of Federation for 
     <lb/>
     the whole country ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—I 
     <lb/>
     stated that the first thing to be done by the 
     <lb/>
     Government, in the summer session, would 
     <lb/>
     be to submit a measure for fully carrying 
     <lb/>
     out the programme First, carry Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and when we met again we would 
     <lb/>
     bring in a scheme for the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments of Upper and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Yes, local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments. I am obliged to the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman for reminding me of the local 
     <lb/>
     governments; but I was speaking of the 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
       

     General Government of Canada. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I think it follows irresistibly from 
     <lb/>
     the admission of the hon. gentleman to-day, 
     <lb/>
     that it is their intention to seek a general 
     <lb/>
     Constitution for Canada under these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, without ever having submitted that 
     <lb/>
     question to the House. Well, sir, there is 
     <lb/>
     another reason perhaps for the course taken 
     <lb/>
     by hon. gentlemen yesterday and pursued 
     <lb/>
     to-day. It has always been a theory of my 
     <lb/>
     own—perhaps it has not yet been demon<lb break="no"/>strated by facts— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>— 
     <lb/>
     Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I say it has always 
     <lb/>
     been a theory of my own, and facts are 
     <lb/>
     rapidly demonstrating the truth of that 
     <lb/>
     theory, that this Government was formed in 
     <lb/>
     consequence of the emergencies of certain 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who were in office, and desired to 
     <lb/>
     retain ofiice, and of certain other gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who were out of office and who desired to 
     <lb/>
     come in. I believe that the whole constitu<lb break="no"/>tional difficulties, or alleged constitutional 
     <lb/>
     difficulties, of this country arose from the 
     <lb/>
     personal or rather the political emergencies 
     <lb/>
     into which certain hon. gentlemen found 
     <lb/>
     themselves, from causes to which I shall not 
     <lb/>
     now advert. (Hear, hear.) Well, sir, feeling 
     <lb/>
     that this scheme has failed—feeling that the 
     <lb/>
     pretext upon which they have held office 
     <lb/>
     for six or nine months is about to fail them, 
     <lb/>
     they devise other means, as a sort of lure to 
     <lb/>
     the country, whereby office may be kept for 
     <lb/>
     a further period. I admit the dexterity with 
     <lb/>
     which the thing is done—a dexterity for 
     <lb/>
     which the Hon. Attorney General West has 
     <lb/>
     long been famous in this country. His 
     <lb/>
     theory is: "Take care of to-day—when 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow comes we will see what can be 
     <lb/>
     done"—and by adhering to this maxim he 
     <lb/>
     has managed to lengthen out the term of his 
     <lb/>
     political existence. That, I believe, will be 
     <lb/>
     acknowledged to be the theory upon which 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman acts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—And 
     <lb/>
     a very sensible theory it is. (Laughter.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—A sensible theory 
     <lb/>
     no doubt it is. I am glad to hear that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman does not deny the fact; but 
     <lb/>
     while admitting that he has achieved a con<lb break="no"/>siderable measure of success in this way, 
     <lb/>
     whether, after all that success, he has earned 
     <lb/>
     the highest kind of reward of a public life— 
     <lb/>
     whether there is anybody who speaks or 
     <lb/>
     thinks of the hon. gentleman as a statesman, 
     <lb/>
     may perhaps be doubted. It is admitted 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="708" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0708.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">708</fw>
         

     that he is an adroit manager—his manage<lb break="no"/>ment being based on the theory of doing 
     <lb/>
     to-day what must be done to-day, and of 
     <lb/>
     leaving till to-morrow whatever can be de<lb break="no"/>ferred. I doubt, however, after all, whether, 
     <lb/>
     when the hon. gentleman comes to review his 
     <lb/>
     career, he will be satisfied that that sort of 
     <lb/>
     policy brings with it the highest rewards of 
     <lb/>
     public life.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—But while that 
     <lb/>
     has been his theory and his practice, and a 
     <lb/>
     certain degree of success has attended it, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to ask the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council whether he has heretofore acted upon 
     <lb/>
     that theory, and whether he can quite afford to 
     <lb/>
     act upon it now? Most of us remember— 
     <lb/>
     those of us who have been for a few years in 
     <lb/>
     public life in this country, must remember a 
     <lb/>
     very striking speech delivered by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for South Oxford (Honorable Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BROWN), in Toronto, in the session of 1856 
     <lb/>
     or 1857—he has delivered many striking 
     <lb/>
     speeches in his time, but this was one of the 
     <lb/>
     most striking—in which he described the 
     <lb/>
    path of the Hon. Attorney General West as 
     <lb/>being studded all along by the grave-stones 
     <lb/>of his slaughtered colleagues. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Well, there are not wanting those who think 
     <lb/>they descry in the not very remote distance, 
     <lb/>a yawning grave waiting for the noblest 
     <lb/>victim of them all. (Laughter) And I 
     <lb/>very much fear, that unless the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has the courage to assert his own ori<lb break="no"/>ginal strength—and he has great strength— 
     <lb/>and to discard the blandishments and the 
     <lb/>sweets of office, and to plant himself where 
     <lb/>he stood formerly, in the affections and con<lb break="no"/>fidence of the people of this country, as the 
     <lb/>foremost defender of the rights of the people, 
     <lb/>as the foremost champion of the privileges of 
     <lb/>a free Parliament—unless he hastens to do 
     <lb/>that, I very much fear that he too may fall 
     <lb/>a victim—as I have said, the noblest victim 
     <lb/>of them all—to the arts, if not the arms, of 
     <lb/>the fell destroyer. (Laughter.) I desire, 
     <lb/>as I am on my feet—and am not at all 
     <lb/>certain that I shall, under the new phase of 
     <lb/>things, trouble the House with any length<lb break="no"/>ened observations—I desire to say a few 
     <lb/>words on the merits of this question of 
     <lb/>defence. Of course I hold, as I resume 
     <lb/>every man in this country holds, that the 
     <lb/>people that will not defend themselves are 
     <lb/>unworthy of free institutions. I hold 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
          

     that we must defend ourselves against all 
     <lb/>
     aggressors, in the best way we can. I think 
     <lb/>
     the policy we have been pursuing for some 
     <lb/>
     years past, of enrolling our people and train<lb break="no"/>ing them to the use of arms and in military 
     <lb/>
     exercise, and in the instructing of officers 
     <lb/>
     who might lead them, should necessity re<lb break="no"/>quire—I think all that is sound policy. I 
     <lb/>
     would even go somewhat further in that 
     <lb/>
     direction than we have gone heretofore. But 
     <lb/>
     if honorable gentlemen propose that we 
     <lb/>
     should establish a standing army—that we 
     <lb/>
     should equip a navy—that we should go 
     <lb/>
     into a costly system of permanent fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions, they are proposing what is beyond 
     <lb/>
     the strength of the country—they are pro<lb break="no"/>posing what will speedily bring financial 
     <lb/>
     ruin on the country—and by bringing finan<lb break="no"/>cial ruin on the country, and by creating 
     <lb/>
     thereby dissatisfaction among the people, 
     <lb/>
     they will prepare the way to that very event 
     <lb/>
     which they profess so strongly to deprecate. 
     <lb/>
     I believe, if it has not that effect, it will 
     <lb/>
     certainly result in depopulating our country. 
     <lb/>
     Already the work of depopulation is going 
     <lb/>
     on.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Throughout the 
     <lb/>
     whole of the western counties of Canada, at 
     <lb/>
     the present moment, there is a greater 
     <lb/>
     amount of financial distress and of <hi rendition="simple:italic">malaise</hi> 
     <lb/>
     than I have known for twenty-five years. I 
     <lb/>
     challenge the honorable gentlemen around me 
     <lb/>
     to contradict the statement. And I say we 
     <lb/>
     are not in a position to stand very great ad<lb break="no"/>ditional burdens on our resources. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Then what is the condition of our 
     <lb/>
     finances? The honorable gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     presides over our finances did not venture 
     <lb/>
     the other day to dispute the statement I 
     <lb/>
     made, that every branch of the revenue was 
     <lb/>
     falling off, and that we had an inevitable 
     <lb/>
     deficit for this current year staring us in the 
     <lb/>
     face. Is it not so? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName>—The hon. gentleman

     may repeat his own statement, but he must

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName> —Do you say every

     branch of the revenue, with the exception

     you mention? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Yes.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName>—Then you will be 
     <lb/>
     shewn that it is not so, when you sit down. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Of course I shall 
     <lb/>
     be glad to hear it. That is the sort of in<lb break="no"/>formation we want before we give hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen a vote of credit, and allow them to go 
     <lb/>
     to England to do as they please for the next six 
     <lb/>
     months. It may be that the revenue has been 
     <lb/>
     brought up within the last few weeks from 
     <lb/>
     accidental causes. A rumor got abroad that 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Finance Minister intended to make 
     <lb/>
     a change in the duties, and in two or three 
     <lb/>
     of our large cities a rush was made to the 
     <lb/>
     bonding warehouses, in order to save the 
     <lb/>
     additional amount that would be exacted by 
     <lb/>
     the change in duties. This, no doubt, in<lb break="no"/>creased the receipts for the time being, and 
     <lb/>
     it is just possible that from that cause the 
     <lb/>
     revenue may have regained something of 
     <lb/>
     what it had lost during the earlier weeks of 
     <lb/>
     the present year. Then, too, the state of 
     <lb/>
     our securities in England—which was so 
     <lb/>
     much improved, according to the statement 
     <lb/>
     of the Hon. President of the Council, by the 
     <lb/>
     action of the Quebec Conference,—is now 
     <lb/>
     anything indeed but satisfactory. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that with the exception of the point they 
     <lb/>
     touched at one time in October, or early in 
     <lb/>
     November, and which they touched then for 
     <lb/>
     a very brief space—they are lower now and 
     <lb/>
     have been lower for a longer time than they 
     <lb/>
     have been at any period before since the 
     <lb/>
     union. I think, therefore, we are not in a 
     <lb/>
     position to impose heavy and unmeasured 
     <lb/>
     burdens upon our people, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     establishing a standing army, or for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of constructing permanent fortifications. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But I have said more than 
     <lb/>
    I intended when I rose, and shall no longer 
     <lb/>deprive my hon. friend from North Welling<lb break="no"/>ton (Dr. PARKER) of the floor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I shall detain the 
     <lb/>
     House but a very few minutes in replying 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. gentleman who has just taken 
     <lb/>
     his seat. As regards his statement that the 
     <lb/>
     revenue has fallen off to the extent of which 
     <lb/>
     he speaks, in every branch, it is entirely 
     <lb/>
     erroneous. It will be shewn when the pro<lb break="no"/>per time comes, when the House is asked to 
     <lb/>
     grant supplies, that the revenue is very far 
     <lb/>
    from being in the hopeless position which 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
     

     the hon. gentleman has stated. And I ap<lb break="no"/>prehend his assertion with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     condition of the province is as greatly exag<lb break="no"/>gerated as his other statement. It is very 
     <lb/>
     true that many portions of our country un<lb break="no"/>fortunately labor at this moment under 
     <lb/>
     considerable depression ; but no intelligent 
     <lb/>
     person, who considers the circumstances, will 
     <lb/>
     think that this is at all extraordinary. We 
     <lb/>
     are alongside a country engaged in a fearful 
     <lb/>
     war. Our commercial relations with that 
     <lb/>
     country, with which we usually have im<lb break="no"/>mense transactions, are very greatly dis<lb break="no"/>turbed. Then we have had short crops for 
     <lb/>
     several years, and our banks are all very 
     <lb/>
     properly under close-reefed topsails. These 
     <lb/>
     and other causes have contributed to produce 
     <lb/>
     the stagnation that now exists, and a general 
     <lb/>
     disposition to curtail business operations. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But with all this—notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the scarcity of money, and a good 
     <lb/>
     deal of embarrassment and suffering from its 
     <lb/>
     scarcity—I venture to affirm that the great 
     <lb/>
     branches of our national industry were never 
     <lb/>
     on a sounder basis; that business men have 
     <lb/>
     not for years owed less debt than at- this 
     <lb/>
     moment ; and when a better state of things 
     <lb/>
     sets in, the evils of which the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     speaks will not be found to have been very 
     <lb/>
     deep-seated. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is exceedingly anxious that I should 
     <lb/>
     fulfil the promises I made to the country at 
     <lb/>
     the time I entered this Administration. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman, I think, would show a 
     <lb/>
     little more discretion if he allowed me to 
     <lb/>
     judge for myself of the best way in which I 
     <lb/>
     should fulfil those promises. When, in the 
     <lb/>
     short space of six months, the Government 
     <lb/>
     have come down with a matured scheme, in<lb break="no"/>volving such important changes, and placed it 
     <lb/>
     before Parliament in the candid way in which 
     <lb/>
     they have submitted it, I think the country has 
     <lb/>
     no good cause to complain, either of time 
     <lb/>
     having been lost in the fulfilment of my 
     <lb/>
     promises, or in the manner of fulfilling them 
     <lb/>
    (Hear, hear.) And I think it ill-becomes 
     <lb/>the hon. gentleman—when he has heard it 
     <lb/>declared that, notwithstanding what has 
     <lb/>occurred in New Brunswick, we still adhere 
     <lb/>to the basis on which the Government was 
     <lb/>formed—that all we ask is time to ascertain 
     <lb/>how our scheme can best be carried into 
     <lb/>effect—and that in the brief period of a very 
     <lb/>few weeks we will be prepared to meet Par<lb break="no"/>liament again, and declare the result 
     <lb/>of our enquiries—I do say it ill becomes 
     <lb/>an honorable gentleman, professing to be 
     <lb/>in favor of constitutional changes, to get up 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">710</fw>
          

     here and endeavor to create an unfounded 
     <lb/>
     prejudice against those who are thus 
     <lb/>
     shewing in every way their determination to 
     <lb/>
     discharge fully and promptly their duty to 
     <lb/>
     the country. The honorable gentleman says 
     <lb/>
     I have broken up the Liberal party. He says 
     <lb/>
     there was a Liberal party in Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     and a Liberal party in Lower Canada, who 
     <lb/>
     were acting cordially together, and that I 
     <lb/>
     have destroyed the harmony which existed 
     <lb/>
     between them. I shall not enter into that 
     <lb/>
     discussion now. The time will come when 
     <lb/>
     it can be fully gone into without danger to 
     <lb/>
     public interests, and I promise the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to give him his answer. But I 
     <lb/>
     have this to state in the meantime to the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman, that I think it is not for 
     <lb/>
     him at least to throw such taunts across the 
     <lb/>
     table, when he recollects that in a speech he 
     <lb/>
     made in this House only last session, on the 
     <lb/>
     announcement of this Coalition, he stated 
     <lb/>
     that he could make no complaint as to the 
     <lb/>
     course I had taken ; that under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances I could only act as I had done. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) If he can find any act of mine in 
     <lb/>
     contradiction of the course I took then, he 
     <lb/>
     has a right to blame me. But so long as I 
     <lb/>
     am carrying out in good faith the pledges I 
     <lb/>
     gave to the country, to my supporters, and to 
     <lb/>
     this House, it is not from that honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman at all events that any charge against 
     <lb/>
     me should come. (Hear, hear.) The hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman says that the proposal for a 
     <lb/>
     union of all the colonies has failed. I totally 
     <lb/>
     deny it. (Hear, hear.) I am not prepared 
     <lb/>
     to admit—I do not believe—that the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of New Brunswick, when the sub<lb break="no"/>ject is fairly discussed in Parliament, and the 
     <lb/>
     proposition has been presented in all its lights, 
     <lb/>
     will reject it. When they do so, it will be 
     <lb/>
     time enough for the honorable gentleman to 
     <lb/>
     assert that the scheme has failed. Strange 
     <lb/>
     indeed would it have been had so large a 
     <lb/>
     scheme suffered no check in its progress—but 
     <lb/>
     stranger still would it be were the promoters 
     <lb/>
     of the measure to abandon it from such a 
     <lb/>
     check as this. (Cheers.) The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Chateauguay is mistaken also 
     <lb/>
     when he asserts that the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Nova Scotia Legislature are 
     <lb/>
     against this measure of Confederation.

     the point at which it is aimed, namely, to bring 
     <lb/>
     this debate to a speedy conclusion. He says 
     <lb/>
     it may cut off amendments, but that it will 
     <lb/>
     not stop debate. But that is an entire mis<lb break="no"/>take. It is the only mode by which the debate 
     <lb/>
     can speedily be brought to an end.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite want to stop the debate, besides 
     <lb/>
     stopping the amendments. That is the object.

     member for Hochelaga had waited till he had

     heard me out, he would have found I had no

     such meaning. With regard to the main 
     <lb/>
     proposition, honorable gentlemen may speak 
     <lb/>
     as long as they like. So long as the House 
     <lb/>
     does not come to the conclusion that the time

     has arrived for getting a vote upon that, they

     can prevent them. And, so far as I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned, I can assure the honorable member

     for Cornwall that I have no desire to prevent 
     <lb/>
     him or any one else from being heard to the 
     <lb/>
     fullest extent they desire. But, since the 
     <lb/>
     beginning of this debate, we have constantly 
     <lb/>
     seen incidental questions raised and the 
     <lb/>
     same members getting up night after night to 
     <lb/>
     make long speeches upon them and kill time, 
     <lb/>
     to a degree never witnessed before, I venture 
     <lb/>
     to assert, in this or in any other legislative 
     <lb/>
     body. And it is evident that if this motion 
     <lb/>
     were not put, we should have these debates

     continued on a variety of amendments, and

     that this discussion would be kept up to an 
     <lb/>
     extent which would utterly frustrate the

     prompt accomplishment of those great pur<lb break="no"/>poses for which this Government was formed.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:EVAN1">HON. MR. EVANTUREL</persName>—As one of the 
     <lb/>
     friends of the present Administration, I must 
     <lb/>
     say that I am surprised by the conduct of the 
     <lb/>
     Government and the extreme position in which 
     <lb/>
     they choose to place themselves. For my part, 
     <lb/>
     I am in favour of the principle of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and one of those who maintain that by 
     <lb/>
     means of that principle the rights and liber<lb break="no"/>ties of each of the contracting parties may be 
     <lb/>
     preserved; but, on the other hand, I am of 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and I do not disguise it from myself, 
     <lb/>
     that it may be so applied as to endanger and 
     <lb/>
     even destroy, or nearly so, the rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges of a state which is a party to this 
     <lb/>
    Confederation. Everything, therefore, depends 
     <lb/>on the conditions of the contract. As a friend 
     <lb/>of the Administration I can understand, as 
     <lb/>well as any one, that any Confederation and 
     <lb/>particularly such a one as this which is now 
     <lb/>laid before us, can only be brought about by 
     <lb/>means of a compromise; and, on this account, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER—and it is probably needless to 
     <lb/>proclaim it here—I am ready and disposed 
     <lb/>to go to as great a length as it is possible for 
     <lb/>any man to go. I am also one of those who, 
     <lb/>when we are called upon to unite, under the 
     <lb/>aegis of a strong government, the different 
     <lb/>provinces of British North America, and 
     <lb/>when I see that the general interest calls for 
     <lb/>such a union, will give my cordial support to 
     <lb/>all who seek to establish such a government. 
     <lb/>I shall always be prepared to meet them half<lb break="no"/>way; but when the question assumes a differ<lb break="no"/>ent shape, as it now does, and when, in con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the events announced to this 
     <lb/>House yesterday, the Constitution proposed to 
     <lb/>us seems to concern none but the provinces of 
     <lb/>Upper and Lower Canada, I say, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, that the compromise between the differ<lb break="no"/>ent provinces no longer existing, we are no 
     <lb/>longer called upon to be so generous. I say 
     <lb/>that if we admit that New Brunswick, by its 
     <lb/>recent repudiation, and Nova Scotia and Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island are no longer parties to the 
     <lb/>contracts agreed on between the provinces, 
     <lb/>and we have new to ask of England to 
     <lb/>modify the Constitution only in relation to 
     <lb/>the two Canadas, I say that the conditions 
     <lb/>are no longer the same as they concern us— 
     <lb/>(hear, hear) —and that I am on that account 
     <lb/>much less disposed to allow the Government 
     <lb/>to proceed to present in England, as the basis 
     <lb/>of our future Constitution, the resolutions 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
        

     which we have been compelled to accept in 
     <lb/>
     very unfavorable circumstances. I do not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate in saying that the position assumed 
     <lb/>
     by the Government is a very dangerous one 
     <lb/>
     for themselves, and for those who would glad<lb break="no"/>ly assist them to pass a good scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation. If I understand aright, the in<lb break="no"/>tention of the Government, in moving the 
     <lb/>
     previous question, is to place their friends in 
     <lb/>
     the awkward position of not being able to 
     <lb/>
     move any modification of the plan. In our 
     <lb/>
     altered position we are going, therefore, to 
     <lb/>
     say to England that we were obliged to sub<lb break="no"/>mit to such and such concessions in order to 
     <lb/>
     come to an understanding; that the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces have backed out of the bargain, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding these onerous concessions and 
     <lb/>
     the compromise which we were obliged to 
     <lb/>
     make, and which have not been accepted by 
     <lb/>
    the other parties; and that, in the face of all 
     <lb/>this, we come to pray that our Constitution 
     <lb/>may be altered so as to accord with those 
     <lb/>very same onerous conditions which we had 
     <lb/>accepted at the Quebec Conference. Why 
     <lb/>tie us down so strictly now? Why should 
     <lb/>we not avail ourselves of the retrogression of 
     <lb/>the provinces to make alterations in the 
     <lb/>scheme which will be less onerous for us? I 
     <lb/>think it my duty to declare that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, in acting as they have done, place their 
     <lb/>friends in a very awkward position. For my 
     <lb/>part, Mr. SPEAKER, I am strongly in favor 
     <lb/>of Confederation, and am ready to support the 
     <lb/>Government in their efforts to release the 
     <lb/>chariot of the state from the position in 
     <lb/>which it now lies; but I wish, on the other 
     <lb/>hand—and I think it is but bare justice to say 
     <lb/>it—I wish that Ministers should place us in 
     <lb/>such a position before the country, that I and 
     <lb/>all others may be able to say that we have 
     <lb/>done our best to improve the situation. This is 
     <lb/>why I so deeply regret that the Government 
     <lb/>have thought fit to take their present arbitrary 
     <lb/>attitude. (Hear, hear.) I acknowledge, with 
     <lb/>the Administration, that time is precious; 
     <lb/>but we ought not, in avoiding one danger, to 
     <lb/>risk falling into another. I acknowledge 
     <lb/>also that the course of events which has 
     <lb/>taken place within a few days gives reason 
     <lb/>to apprehend that British rule in the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of British North America may cease 
     <lb/>altogether in a few years. I admit all these 
     <lb/>dangers, Mr. SPEAKER; but on the other 
     <lb/>hand I do not conceal from myself that the 
     <lb/>extreme position in which we are placed does 
     <lb/>not tend to diminish them. On the contrary, I 
     <lb/>am greatly afraid that if public opinion be 
     <lb/>too deeply stirred by the imposition of a new 
     <lb/>

     Constitution, without liberty on our part to 
     <lb/>
     amend it, the danger will be increased rather 
     <lb/>
     than diminished. So far, Lower Canada has 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently showed, by the voice of her leaders, 
     <lb/>
     that she is prepared to make all possible con<lb break="no"/>cessions; but after that, would it be prudent 
     <lb/>
     to render her dissatisfied by denying us the 
     <lb/>
     right of modifying the proposed plan in some 
     <lb/>
     degree. We have been obliged, in order to 
     <lb/>
     satisfy the public mind, to allege, and truly, 
     <lb/>
     that the Ministry had been compelled to make 
     <lb/>
     some concessions to the provinces for the general 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction; but now that the contracting 
     <lb/>
     parties to the plan of Confederation retreat 
     <lb/>
     from their engagements, after having imposed 
     <lb/>
     on us compromises and exacted concessions, 
     <lb/>
     why should we, at a critical time like the 
     <lb/>
     present, proceed to submit our position to the 
     <lb/>
    Imperial Parliament, exactly as if the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces had been true to their pledges? I am 
     <lb/>of opinion, Mr. SPEAKER, that this is asking 
     <lb/>too much of us, and that as the Lower pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are evidently no longer in the mind to 
     <lb/>be united with us, we French-Canadians should 
     <lb/>be greatly in the wrong if we presented our 
     <lb/>case with the same conditions as we were led 
     <lb/>to accept, in compliance with the require<lb break="no"/>ments of the sister colonies. I think that 
     <lb/>both Upper and Lower Canada are now 
     <lb/>entitled to present themselves much more 
     <lb/>favorably before the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and that they may say—" These are 
     <lb/>concessions which we had made, it is true, for 
     <lb/>the sake of the common good; but the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces have now gone back from their 
     <lb/>engagements, and their present desire is 
     <lb/>either to remain independent or to enter the 
     <lb/>American Republic! We have done our duty, 
     <lb/>and we are still ready to remain faithful 
     <lb/>to our engagements, which we had entered 
     <lb/>into with the contracting parties; but as they 
     <lb/>gave us up, and the concessions which we 
     <lb/>made are not now held by them to be suffi<lb break="no"/>cient, we are come to plead our own cause 
     <lb/>before you, and to tell you that the interests 
     <lb/>of Lower Canada now require better guaran<lb break="no"/>tees than we had been obliged to accept from 
     <lb/>the Maritime Provinces, for the sake of com<lb break="no"/>ing to an amicable conclusion. We now come 
     <lb/>to request that England will be more favour<lb break="no"/>able to us, and relieve us from our difficulties 
     <lb/>by making constitutional changes less disad<lb break="no"/>vantageous to us." In such a case, I believe 
     <lb/>that the Imperial Government would not 
     <lb/>venture to impose a Constitution on us with<lb break="no"/>out our consent, but would be favourable to 
     <lb/>our wishes. That the French-Canadians are 
     <lb/>all loyal subjects of Her Britannic Majesty, 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
          

     no one will doubt; but it would be an act of 
     <lb/>
     folly on the part of English statesmen to 
     <lb/>
     impose on them a Constitution which they 
     <lb/>
     would reject or very strongly resist. I say 
     <lb/>
     this out of a feeling of loyalty, for I know 
     <lb/>
     that there are statesmen in England who 
     <lb/>
     understand that the loyalty of Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadians most depend on their being 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with their new Constitution. How 
     <lb/>
     would it benefit England to give us a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution which might suit her, as tending to 
     <lb/>
     perpetuate her rule in Lower Canada, but 
     <lb/>
     which would not be at the same time satis<lb break="no"/>factory to the majority in both Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada? A spirit of discontent 
     <lb/>
     would be soon aroused which would cool our 
     <lb/>
     zeal in defending our country. This is a 
     <lb/>
     self-evident truth, intelligible to all the world. 
     <lb/>
     I trust, therefore, Mr. SPEAKER, that if the 
     <lb/>
     measure of Confederation is passed, it will 
     <lb/>
     not be forced upon us, without the present 
     <lb/>
     House having an opportunity of weighing 
     <lb/>
     its merits, and amending it. I am pre<lb break="no"/>pared, I confess, to go as far as any man, 
     <lb/>
     and to make the greatest concessions, to extri<lb break="no"/>cate the country from its difficulties, and 
     <lb/>
     come to a good understanding, that we may 
     <lb/>
     make sure of a Confederation with the immense 
     <lb/>
     advantages which it might bring with it; but 
     <lb/>
     I am bound to confess, when am told, in 
     <lb/>
     presence of the events which have just passed, 
     <lb/>
     that we must submit to the conditions imposed 
     <lb/>
     on us by the contracting parties, who have, 
     <lb/>
     so soon after making it, refused to ratify it—I 
     <lb/>
     say that I think it wrong to tie down Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada absolutely to the first conditions. I 
     <lb/>
     wish the extreme position which the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment have taken up in the face of the country 
     <lb/>
     may be productive of the greatest amount of 
     <lb/>
     good to it; but, for my part, Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     cannot help thinking and confessing that I 
     <lb/>
     have very strong fears on that subject. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that in the present circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     the Government ought to have granted the 
     <lb/>
     fullest opportunity, both to Upper and to 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, to make such suggestions as 
     <lb/>
     they might think fit, and not to insist on the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of the scheme in its present form. 
     <lb/>
     By such a proceeding they would have afforded 
     <lb/>
     members who have amendments to move a 
     <lb/>
     fair and constitutional way of setting them<lb break="no"/>selves right in the opinion of their fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     countrymen, by recording them at least on the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Journals</hi> of the House. The position in which 
     <lb/>
     we are placed is tantamount in its effects to 
     <lb/>
     the cry of "all or nothing." But, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I have always been averse to such a 
     <lb/>
     system; and if we look back to our past 
     <lb/>

     history, we shall find that it has never pro<lb break="no"/>duced aught but lamentable dissension. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) What is the present cry of 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition as regards the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation? It is this: you refuse an appeal 
     <lb/>
     to the people; you most unjustly hurry on 
     <lb/>
     the debate; you deny us all opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     moving amendments to the plan, or recording 
     <lb/>
     them on the journals of the House; and you 
     <lb/>
     are bent on imposing on us, without our consent, 
     <lb/>
     a Constitution no detail of which is made known 
     <lb/>
     to us, and of the general tenor of which our 
     <lb/>
     knowledge is also very imperfect. Now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I beg to ask Ministers whether it 
     <lb/>
     would not be infinitely better for them to quiet 
     <lb/>
     all these apprehensions, and silence all com<lb break="no"/>plaints? Why should they hurry on the 
     <lb/>
     debate, I do not say unconstitutionally, but I 
     <lb/>
     do say with dangerous precipitancy? Why 
     <lb/>
     should they bar the moving of any amend<lb break="no"/>ment to the scheme, particularly as there 
     <lb/>
     is nothing pressing in the occasion, and as the 
     <lb/>
     aspect of the question is in many respects al<lb break="no"/>tered from what it was previous to these late 
     <lb/>
     events? I shall probably be told that I am 
     <lb/>
     wrong in saying there is nothing pressing in 
     <lb/>
     the occasion; that, on the contrary, events 
     <lb/>
     render the immediate passing of the measure 
     <lb/>
     absolutely necessary; that the defence of our 
     <lb/>
     frontier is a question which must be settled at 
     <lb/>
     once—that there is not a moment to be lost. 
     <lb/>
     Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I acknowledge, for my 
     <lb/>
     part, that if I vote in favor of the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, it is not out of a feeling of the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of setting about our defence; for 
     <lb/>
     hitherto I have never had a thought that the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the provinces afforded any 
     <lb/>
     better means of defending the frontier than 
     <lb/>
     that which we have at present—(hear, hear)— 
     <lb/>
     inasmuch as we have already all opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of combined action to the fullest extent under 
     <lb/>
     the protecting arm of England; but this seems 
     <lb/>
     not to have entered the minds of the authors 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme. But I go further than this, 
     <lb/>
     and assert that the discussion which is daily 
     <lb/>
     going on on the subject of the proposed consti<lb break="no"/>tutional changes is agitating the public mind 
     <lb/>
     very strongly. As at a former epoch of our 
     <lb/>
     history, such changes necessarily tend to dis<lb break="no"/>turb the minds of the many; and this very 
     <lb/>
     natural agitation is attended with its dangers, 
     <lb/>
     and affords another proof that constitutions are 
     <lb/>
     not the work of a day—that time, and even a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of time, is necessary to settle the 
     <lb/>
     foundation of the social and constitutional 
     <lb/>
     edifice of the best disposed of the nations. 
     <lb/>
     The present Constitution of Great Britain is a 
     <lb/>
     proof of this. That is certainly well established, 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
        

     but it has taken ages to bring it to what it now 
     <lb/>
     is. I say, then, that we should not be in too 
     <lb/>
     great a hurry, so as to raise discontent among 
     <lb/>
     the people, but that we ought to proceed with 
     <lb/>
     the more care and deliberation now that, as the 
     <lb/>
     Ministers themselves acknowledge, we are in 
     <lb/>
     imminent danger of war. If we are so liable 
     <lb/>
     to have war, I say that we are not in the 
     <lb/>
     best condition to undergo a sudden change of 
     <lb/>
     our Constitution, and that far from placing 
     <lb/>
     ourselves in a good attitude of defence to meet 
     <lb/>
     the imminent danger, we are perhaps weaken<lb break="no"/>ing our position, by acting too strongly or 
     <lb/>
     prematurely on public opinion. I say then 
     <lb/>
     again, that those who would force our repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives to accept the measure without 
     <lb/>
     amendments, for the bare reason that we must 
     <lb/>
     prepare to defend ourselves in arms without 
     <lb/>
     loss of time, are acting without justifiable or 
     <lb/>
     sufficient reason. I regret deeply that the 
     <lb/>
     previous question has been moved, so as to 
     <lb/>
     reduce the friends of the Government to the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of voting on the measure before us 
     <lb/>
     without being able to move any amendment, 
     <lb/>
     and that in the face of a total change of cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances. I pray for the forgiveness of 
     <lb/>
     the House for having spoken on the subject, 
     <lb/>
     but I considered it a duty to protest at once 
     <lb/>
     against the proceeding of the Government 
     <lb/>
     which I had not foreseen. I shall vote there<lb break="no"/>fore against the motion before us, because I 
     <lb/>
     am in favor of amending the scheme of the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, laying on the Government the 
     <lb/>
     whole responsibility for their conduct if they 
     <lb/>
     persist in denying us an opportunity of making 
     <lb/>
     some modifications in the present plan of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—I am glad 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. member for the county of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec has, with his customary candor, 
     <lb/>
     communicated to us his apprehensions. I 
     <lb/>
     have listened to him with great attention, 
     <lb/>
     and I am certain that there is no difference 
     <lb/>
     between his views and ours. We are per<lb break="no"/>fectly agreed. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     I knew perfectly well, Mr. SPEAKER, before 
     <lb/>
     I rose to give explanations to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for the county of Quebec and to 
     <lb/>
     the House, that the few words I have just 
     <lb/>
     uttered would excite the laughter of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition; for the moment these hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen see a member who is usually a 
     <lb/>
     supporter of the Government, rise in this 
     <lb/>
     House and speak with some degree of anima<lb break="no"/>tion on any measure of the Government, 
     <lb/>
     they are ready to conclude, from his 
     <lb/>
     animation, that the hon. member is opposed 
     <lb/>
     to the measure. I say again, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="714" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0714.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">714</fw>
     

     the Government is, in the present case, 
     <lb/>
     perfectly of the same mind as the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for the county of Quebec. If they 
     <lb/>
     now request that the House would hasten 
     <lb/>
     their decision on the grand question of a 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of all the British Provinces 
     <lb/>
     of this continent (not of the two Canadas, 
     <lb/>
     as the hon. member for the county of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     terms it), it is because they are desirous, as 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Attorney General for Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada observed yesterday, to despatch 
     <lb/>
     delegates to England, to lay before the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Parliament the resolutions adopted 
     <lb/>
     at the Conference. The Government wish 
     <lb/>
     to give effect to the compromise entered into 
     <lb/>
     between the Maritime Provinces and Canada, 
     <lb/>
     to enable the Imperial Government to offer 
     <lb/>
     their counsel to the governments of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, who have backed out from 
     <lb/>
     their agreement, and show them that the 
     <lb/>
     document to which they would have their 
     <lb/>
     sanction is a compromise. They would 
     <lb/>
     prove to Great Britain that if one of the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces, or all of them, refuse 
     <lb/>
     to carry out the terms of the compromise 
     <lb/>
     after their solemn engagement with the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government to observe it—if, in 
     <lb/>
     short, they have failed to fulfil the terms of 
     <lb/>
     the treaty—Canada has been true to them, 
     <lb/>
     and desires its fulfilment. The Constitution 
     <lb/>
     prayed for is not a Constitution for the two 
     <lb/>
     Canadas only, as the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Chateauguay said it was, putting a false 
     <lb/>
     construction on the explanations of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     colleague the Attorney General for Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, but, on the contrary, a Constitution 
     <lb/>
     for all British North America. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) If the Government now press the 
     <lb/>
     House for a decision, it is not to enable 
     <lb/>
     them to go to England and ask for a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution for the Canadas, under a pretext that 
     <lb/>
     the other contracting provinces have failed 
     <lb/>
     to fulfil the treaty into which they had entered. 
     <lb/>
     By no means, Mr. SPEAKER. I have always 
     <lb/>
     had the interests of Lower Canada at heart, 
     <lb/>
     and have guarded them more sedulously than 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Hochelaga and his 
     <lb/>
     partisans have ever done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">A MEMBER</persName>—A proof of that is your 
     <lb/>
     sending the seat of government to Ottawa! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Well, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, I do not hesitate to maintain 
     <lb/>
     that that question of the seat of government 
     <lb/>
     was decided favorably for Lower Canada. I 
     <lb/>
     have always maintained this, and I will 
     <lb/>
     maintain it always and against all comers. 
     <lb/>
     I now come to the observations of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for the county of Quebec. This is 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
    

     what the Government propose to do: We 
     <lb/>
     shall represent to the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     that Canada consented to compromises and 
     <lb/>
     sacrifices, and that the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     failed in the fulfilment of their part of the 
     <lb/>
     treaty at the last moment. We shall entreat 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government to offer their ad<lb break="no"/>vice to the governments of those provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and we entertain a hope that the influence 
     <lb/>
     which England necessarily exercises over 
     <lb/>
     those colonies will have the effect of inducing 
     <lb/>
     them to reflect on their proceeding with 
     <lb/>
     reference to us. I pray the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for the county of Quebec to lay 
     <lb/>
     aside his fears. I assure him that not a 
     <lb/>
     single member of the Government has the 
     <lb/>
     slightest intention of asking Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     to legislate on the Address which we are to 
     <lb/>
     present, and to pass a Constitution for the 
     <lb/>
     two Canadas. Our whole intention is to lay 
     <lb/>
     before the Government of the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try our position, as it now is, in consequence 
     <lb/>
     of the breaking of the treaty by the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces, in order that they 
     <lb/>
     may bring some pressure to bear on 
     <lb/>
     them to bring about the Federal union 
     <lb/>
     which was designed. Even though the 
     <lb/>
     legislatures of those provinces should rue 
     <lb/>
     the part they took in the plan of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, the adoption of it would be 
     <lb/>
     only a question of time; for probably within 
     <lb/>
     twelve months they will amend their deci<lb break="no"/>sion and accept the compromise. We say 
     <lb/>
     that as far as we are concerned, we can do 
     <lb/>
     neither more nor less than carry out the 
     <lb/>
     compromise ; that we are desirous of acquit<lb break="no"/>ting ourselves of the duty we owe to the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government, as they thought fit to 
     <lb/>
     sanction it in the despatch laid before this 
     <lb/>
     House, as well as by the honorable mention 
     <lb/>
     made of it in Her Most Gracious Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Speech from the Throne. It is of conse<lb break="no"/>quence, I say, that we should show the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government that Canada, which 
     <lb/>
     contains more than three-fourths of the 
     <lb/>
     population of all the provinces on this con<lb break="no"/>tinent, has not failed to fulfil her part in 
     <lb/>
     the compromise, but that the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces it is which have broken their 
     <lb/>
     sworn engagement, and that if the compro<lb break="no"/>mise is not to be carried into effect, English 
     <lb/>
     supremacy over the American colonies may 
     <lb/>
     at no distant day be endangered. We trust 
     <lb/>
     that all these considerations may have a 
     <lb/>
     salutary effect, that they will dissipate the 
     <lb/>
     unfounded apprehensions of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, and that hereafter the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, based on the compromise which we 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="715" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0715.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">715</fw>
     

     shall submit to the Imperial Government, 
     <lb/>
     will bear sway over the several English pro<lb break="no"/>vinces on this continent, united in one great 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. (Hear, hear.) I can assure 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for the county of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that the only purpose of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of which I am a member, in urging 
     <lb/>
     forward the adoption of the scheme submit<lb break="no"/>ted to the House, is to despatch it to England 
     <lb/>
     in order that the Imperial Parliament may 
     <lb/>
     merely sanction the letter of the measure. 
     <lb/>
     The Government never had a thought of 
     <lb/>
     taking the House and the people by surprise. 
     <lb/>
     If we were to go to England and pray for a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution different from that which is 
     <lb/>
     mentioned in the Address, we should be 
     <lb/>
     branded with disgrace, and deservedly so, 
     <lb/>
     and should render ourselves unworthy of the 
     <lb/>
     position which we now fill. These reasons 
     <lb/>
     are sufficient, I think, to shew that there is 
     <lb/>
     not so much difference between the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of the Government and that of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for the county of Quebec, as that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman supposes. We are agreed 
     <lb/>
     on the point to which he takes exception; 
     <lb/>
     and as he has declared that he would vote in 
     <lb/>
     favor of the new Constitution if the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces continued to be parties to it, I 
     <lb/>
     have reason to trust that he will do so, as the 
     <lb/>
     Government will be in no way bound to abide 
     <lb/>
     by that Constitution, unless the other con<lb break="no"/>tracting parties shall accept it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:POWE2">MR. POWELL</persName>—I must express my deep  
     <lb/>
    regret, Mr. SPEAKER, that the leader of 
     <lb/>the House should have been induced to 
     <lb/>submit to the House a motion of the 
     <lb/>character of that which you hold in your 
     <lb/>hands. (Hear, hear.) I distinctly avow 
     <lb/>myself a friend of the Administration, and 
     <lb/>as one anxious to assist them in carrying out 
     <lb/>the important scheme they have undertaken; 
     <lb/>and while according to them the fullest 
     <lb/>confidence, I must express my regret that 
     <lb/>their course in relation to this question, in 
     <lb/>this House, has certainly not been what I 
     <lb/>would have advised or been inclined to 
     <lb/>support. They selected their own mode, in 
     <lb/>the first place, as regards the manner in 
     <lb/>which this debate should be conducted, and 
     <lb/>from that mode they have departed. I did 
     <lb/>feel that when, as between the Opposition 
     <lb/>and the Government, there was something 
     <lb/>in the nature of a compact, that compact 
     <lb/>should be carried out. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>think the Opposition has its rights and 
     <lb/>privileges, and is especially entitled to have 
     <lb/>these respected by the Government, who have 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
     

     so powerful a majority at their back. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) When the Government departed 
     <lb/>
     from the understanding originally come to, 
     <lb/>
     as to the way in which the debate should be 
     <lb/>
     conducted, I believed that that departure 
     <lb/>
     was in the interests of the House and in the 
     <lb/>
     interests of the public. I do not hesitate 
     <lb/>
     to say it had my approbation, as far as my 
     <lb/>
     individual opinion was concerned. But, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding that it had my approbation, 
     <lb/>
     as tending to the convenience of the House 
     <lb/>
     and the advantage of the public, I did not 
     <lb/>
     feel that the Government were justified, so 
     <lb/>
     long as the Opposition were dissenting 
     <lb/>
     parties, in departing from the original 
     <lb/>
     understanding. That was my first ground 
     <lb/>
     of objection; and I think, in the present 
     <lb/>
     instance, the Government are taking a still 
     <lb/>
     more extraordinary course. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     whether a case can be found in the records 
     <lb/>
     of our own House, or of the English House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons, where the leader of the House 
     <lb/>
     has availed himself of technical rules to 
     <lb/>
     prevent a question being fairly presented.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:POWE2">MR. POWELL</persName>—I do not know if such a 
     <lb/>
     thing is usual, or if a precedent can be cited 
     <lb/>
     for it. All I can say is, that if a precedent 
     <lb/>
     can be cited, I regret extremely that such a 
     <lb/>
     course should be adopted on the present 
     <lb/>
     occasion. We are here engaged in the 
     <lb/>
     discussion of a great constitutional question, 
     <lb/>
     with regard to which the Administration 
     <lb/>
     have submitted to us the resolutions of the 
     <lb/>
     Conference—I do not say of self-constituted 
     <lb/>
     delegates, or that they acted without the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of the people—but certainly 
     <lb/>
     they have taken upon themselves a great 
     <lb/>
     responsibility, which I readily admit they 
     <lb/>
     have well fulfilled, and I am quite prepared 
     <lb/>
     to endorse their course, in the framing of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, from beginning to end. They 
     <lb/>
     first of all adopt those resolutions at the 
     <lb/>
     Conference, and they then come down to 
     <lb/>
     this House and say: " Accept them in their 
     <lb/>
     entirety, without amendment, without vari<lb break="no"/>ation, or the scheme falls to the ground." 
     <lb/>
     That may be all very well. It may be all 
     <lb/>
     very well to deny the right of an appeal to 
     <lb/>
     to the people. It may be all very well for 
     <lb/>
     us as a Legislature to arrogate to ourselves 
     <lb/>
     the right to change our whole constitutional 
     <lb/>
     system. That may be all very well. But, 
     <lb/>
     by this motion of the Hon. Attorney Gene<lb break="no"/>ral West, they stop any gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     dissent from their views from putting their

     opinions on record. (Hear, hear.) I think 
     <lb/>
     that is going a little too far, and it is as a 
     <lb/>
     friend of the Administration that I express 
     <lb/>
     that opinion.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:POWE2">MR. POWELL</persName>—Then he may take the

     other alternative. I think the House and

     the country have extended an enormous

     degree of consideration to this Government, 
     <lb/>
     but I tell the hon. gentlemen that if they 
     <lb/>
     continue the course they are now pursuing, 
     <lb/>
     a reaction will take place in the House and 
     <lb/>
     the country. (Hear, hear.) I hope that 
     <lb/>
     this House is not to drop down into being 
     <lb/>
     the mere echo of the Executive—so that we 
     <lb/>
     shall not have opinions of our own at all, or 
     <lb/>
     be allowed to offer any advice whatever to 
     <lb/>
     the Executive. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     accepts these remarks in a hostile spirit, he 
     <lb/>
     may do so. All I can say is that I do not 
     <lb/>
     mean them to be so received. But I con<lb break="no"/>sider the course taken by the Government 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon is a most extraordinary one. 
     <lb/>
     The reason assigned is, that hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite have been offering a factious oppo<lb break="no"/>sition, and that they intend to continue it 
     <lb/>
     by moving motion after motion. But even 
     <lb/>
     it they do, I ask, can that involve above a 
     <lb/>
     couple of weeks more of discussion? And 
     <lb/>
     I say that it is not for the credit or the 
     <lb/>
     character of the Government, that to shorten 
     <lb/>
     the discussion they should take such a 
     <lb/>
     course as this. I believe they have under<lb break="no"/>taken the great work they have in hand in 
     <lb/>
     a most patriotic spirit. I believe that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend—though he rejects my advice- 
     <lb/>
     is animated in the course he is taking by a 
     <lb/>
     purely patriotic spirit. But, while I believe 
     <lb/>
     that, I think he ought to accord to me the 
     <lb/>
     right of expressing my opinion as to the 
     <lb/>
     mode in which this debate should be con<lb break="no"/>ducted. I do not know whether the friends 
     <lb/>
     of the Administration are to be gagged as 
     <lb/>
     well as its opponents—(laughter)—whether 
     <lb/>
     it is intended that we shall all be prevented 
     <lb/>
     from expressing our views. But I do trust the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the Government will withdraw this 
     <lb/>
     motion— (hear, hear)— which is unworthy 
     <lb/>
     of him, when  he has in hand this grand and 
     <lb/>
     magnificent project. He has all the advan<lb break="no"/>tages he can wish on his side, and I would 
     <lb/>
     advise him to avail himself of those advan<lb break="no"/>tages, and not to give—by pursuing a course 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
        

     that is certainly unusual, extraordinary, and 
     <lb/>
     unprecedented—the enemies of this great 
     <lb/>
     scheme the opportunity of saying that it was 
     <lb/>
     forced down the throats of this Legislature 
     <lb/>
     and of the people of this country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I believe that he has the people at 
     <lb/>
     his back—that they endorse his scheme— 
     <lb/>
     that they are fully with him—and that the 
     <lb/>
     large majority of this House truly represent 
     <lb/>
     the feelings and wishes of the people in 
     <lb/>
     endorsing the scheme. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     say, therefore, that he can well afford to be 
     <lb/>
     magnanimous and liberal to the Opposition— 
     <lb/>
     who are feeble in numbers, though energetic 
     <lb/>
     in the stand they take—and that he can carry 
     <lb/>
     out this scheme without having to call to his 
     <lb/>
     aid the technical rules of the House. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.)

     <lb/>
     will throw any impediment in the way of the

     <lb/>
     course I know that it can be moved; but if a

     gentleman would have adopted the policy 
     <lb/>
     which he has become a party to, unless he had 
     <lb/>
     been urged on to it by his colleagues in the 
     <lb/>
     Government. I am very well aware that 
     <lb/>
     those who are in the habit of talking most 
     <lb/>
     loudly of the rights and liberties of the people, 
     <lb/>
     when they find themselves in places of posi<lb break="no"/>tion and power, may frequently forget those 
     <lb/>
     rights. (Hear, hear.) 1 am quite satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that if the Honorable President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     had been in opposition just now, we would 
     <lb/>
     have heard the course that is now adopted by 
     <lb/>
     the Government called the grossest tyranny 
     <lb/>
     and worst kind of outrage that could have 
     <lb/>
     been perpetrated upon a free Parliament such 
     <lb/>
     as ours. (Hear, hear.) And not only would 
     <lb/>
     we have heard such language on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     this House, but through that engine in 
     <lb/>
     Toronto which he moves with so much power, 
     <lb/>
     we should have had it sent throughout the 
     <lb/>
     whole country. There would not have been 
     <lb/>
     a man who voted for it who would not have 
     <lb/>
     been held up as the greatest foe to the rights 
     <lb/>
     and liberties of the people that could be 
     <lb/>
     imagined. (Hear, hear.) And now we find 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman endeavoring to stifle, not 
     <lb/>
     exactly the discussion of the question, for we 
     <lb/>
     cannot be deprived of the right of  speech, but 
     <lb/>
     to stifle the expression of the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     House with reference to the merits of this 
     <lb/>
     scheme in the only way it could be effective 
     <lb/>
     and valuable, and in a proper parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     manner. The motion now made prevents our 
     <lb/>
     taking the sense of the House as to whether 
     <lb/>
      some modification of the scheme might not 
     <lb/>
     be adopted, or some other plan of union agreed 
     <lb/>
     upon that would prove more advantageous. 
     <lb/>
     I have given notice of an amendment that I 
     <lb/>
     intended proposing in favor of a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union of the provinces, with provisions that 
     <lb/>
     the laws, the language, and the religion of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada should not be interfered with; 
     <lb/>
     that no legislation should take place for that 
     <lb/>
     section, unless that legislation was originated 
     <lb/>
     by a member from Lower Canada, and should 
     <lb/>
     not become law unless carried by a majority 
     <lb/>
     of the representatives from that section of the 
     <lb/>
     country. I propose those provisions in order 
     <lb/>
     that the rights of Lower Canadians might 
     <lb/>
     be fully protected, and that their institu<lb break="no"/>tions should not be in danger of destruc<lb break="no"/>tion, and that they might have no opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of saying that a change of this kind was 
     <lb/>
     desired for their injury rather than for their 
     <lb/>
     benefit, as well as for the best interests of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces at large. I had intended to take 
     <lb/>
     the sense of the House upon this proposition, 
     <lb/>
     mainly tor the reason that a  legislative union 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
        

     would be more economical and more stable. 
     <lb/>
     The commissioners who were sent out to 
     <lb/>
     Canada by the Imperial Government to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain what defences were required, and 
     <lb/>
     what they would cost, reported that £1,300,<lb break="no"/>000 sterling would be suflicient for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose. I find the local governments to be 
     <lb/>
     created under this Federal scheme are to 
     <lb/>
     receive for their working expenses no less a 
     <lb/>
     sum than $3,981,914; so that in two years, 
     <lb/>
     if the expenses of these local governments 
     <lb/>
     were saved to the country, they would amount 
     <lb/>
     to a suflicient sum to construct all the defences 
     <lb/>
     that are said to be necessary for the protection 
     <lb/>
     of the country against attack from any 
     <lb/>
     quarter. But we are not to have the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity, it seems, of takin the sense of this 
     <lb/>
     House as to whether that would be better 
     <lb/>
     than the scheme submitted for our adoption. 
     <lb/>
     And we are also prevented from ascertaining 
     <lb/>
     whether the people of Canada approve of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme or not. It would seem that the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Attorney General West, for whose 
     <lb/>
     ability I entertain a very high degree of 
     <lb/>
     respect, has forgotten the conservative cha<lb break="no"/>racter that he has heretofore so nobly main<lb break="no"/>tained upon the floor of this House, and in 
     <lb/>
     forgetting that character, that he has also 
     <lb/>
     forgotten the rights and liberties of the people. 
     <lb/>
     I am not surprised that those rights and 
     <lb/>
     liberties should have been forgotten and 
     <lb/>
     trampled upon by the Honorable President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council and the Honorable Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary. They have been too loud-mouthed 
     <lb/>
     in their pretended championship of those 
     <lb/>
     rights in times past to render them above 
     <lb/>
     suspicion of forsaking them now; but I am 
     <lb/>
     surprised that the Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West should go with them in stifling the 
     <lb/>
     voice of the people. (Hear, hear.) And 
     <lb/>
     I am very sorry to hear it stated that members 
     <lb/>
     of the Government are to go to England, 
     <lb/>
     there to appear carrying as it were from 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country to the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government, opinions favorable to Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. Now in truth they will not do so. 
     <lb/>
     They cannot do so in point of fact, because 
     <lb/>
     they have not taken the sense of the peeple, 
     <lb/>
     and have refused even to allow Parliament to 
     <lb/>
     say whether or not the scheme shall be referred 
     <lb/>
     to the people, or whether some other scheme 
     <lb/>
     would not be more acceptable, and much 
     <lb/>
     better in every way, than the one now under 
     <lb/>
     consideration. They find that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces are strongly opposed to 
     <lb/>
     the scheme, and yet they propose to go home 
     <lb/>
     and ask the Imperial Government to carry out 
     <lb/>
     the measure, though they well know it cannot 
     <lb/>
   

            <pb n="718" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0718.jpg"/>

     be enforced upon the people of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. If the great urgency which they 
     <lb/>
     profess to see for the carrying out of this 
     <lb/>
     scheme arises from a desire to have the 
     <lb/>
     defences made secure, why do not they ask 
     <lb/>
     Parliament for power to place the country in a 
     <lb/>
     proper position of defence? Why do not they 
     <lb/>
     ask for that if it is so urgently demanded, 
     <lb/>
     and leave this great Confederation question 
     <lb/>
     in abeyance until the people in all parts of the 
     <lb/>
     country have had fair opportunity of under<lb break="no"/>standing it in every point of view. They 
     <lb/>
     have not yet had that opportunity, and I 
     <lb/>
     think the honorable gentlemen on the Trea<lb break="no"/>sury benches, in depriving them of that 
     <lb/>
     opportunity, and especially in doing it in the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which they are now doing, have 
     <lb/>
     taken a course which will redound to their 
     <lb/>
     own and to the country's disadvantage. The 
     <lb/>
     people only require to be awakened to the 
     <lb/>
     course that is being pursued, to understand 
     <lb/>
     that these opinions and views are to be dis<lb break="no"/>regarded, or are of no consequence, to call forth 
     <lb/>
     that sentence of condemnation which will 
     <lb/>
     hurl honorable gentlemen on the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     benches from place and power, and cause 
     <lb/>
     names honored in the past, to sink into dis<lb break="no"/>honored oblivion. If the proper steps had 
     <lb/>
     been taken, gentlemen from Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     would never have been able to say that repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population could not be safely 
     <lb/>
     given to Upper Canada, and would have no 
     <lb/>
     grounds for fearing that their rights would not 
     <lb/>
     be protected, and that therefore they must 
     <lb/>
     reject it. If they refused to grant represent<lb break="no"/>ation according to population when full pro<lb break="no"/>vision is offered them for the protection of their 
     <lb/>
     institutions, it would be without other reason 
     <lb/>
     than that of the sulky woman or the spoiled 
     <lb/>
     child, and I do not believe that the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the people of Lower Canada are made 
     <lb/>
     up of that kind of stuff. They only wish to be 
     <lb/>
     assured that their rights are not to be inter<lb break="no"/>fered with. If they desired more, let them 
     <lb/>
     reflect that the hon. member for Montmorency 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. CAUCHON) in addressing the House 
     <lb/>
     the other evening, instanced the position in 
     <lb/>
     which the English House of Lords stood when 
     <lb/>
     the country was in danger of being plunged 
     <lb/>
     into a revolution by their resistance to a just 
     <lb/>
     popular demand. He gave us to understand 
     <lb/>
     that that body might have been swept away 
     <lb/>
     before the indignation of the people, if it had 
     <lb/>
     not yielded to the pressure and allowed the 
     <lb/>
     Reform Bill to pass. If that was the case in 
     <lb/>
     reference to so strong and highly respected a 
     <lb/>
     body as the English House of Lords, let them 
     <lb/>
     reflect upon what might be the result of 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     resisting a legislative union and forcing a 
     <lb/>
     scheme so expensive as the present one, so full 
     <lb/>
     of elements of contention and dissolution, 
     <lb/>
     upon the people of Canada. If the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, comparatively few in numbers, 
     <lb/>
     with the Government to aid them, continue to 
     <lb/>
     persist in refusing to give the people of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada that which is their right, and which 
     <lb/>
     can do no wrong to any other portion of the 
     <lb/>
     country, perhaps they will find that the people 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces will take the same stand that 
     <lb/>
     endangered the House of Lords, in England, 
     <lb/>
     and the same results follow, and then it will be 
     <lb/>
     too late to ask or offer terms. The Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West ought not to have 
     <lb/>
     allowed a free expression of the views of the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House to be stifled in the 
     <lb/>
     way that it is now being done. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ought to have allowed the amendment to 
     <lb/>
     be put respecting which I have given notice, 
     <lb/>
     and also that providing for taking the sense of 
     <lb/>
     the people. Perhaps it was thought that the 
     <lb/>
    motion to be made b the honorable member 
     <lb/>for Peel (Hon. Mr. CAMERON) would answer 
     <lb/>the purpose as well; but it cannot do so, be<lb break="no"/>cause it is not to be preposed until after this 
     <lb/>scheme has been carried. That amendment, 
     <lb/>to be of any service to the purpose I had in 
     <lb/>view, ought to be made before these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions are voted upon. After the House has 
     <lb/>expressed itself in favor of the resolutions, 
     <lb/>the representatives become leaders to the 
     <lb/>people. They should lead us, but we should 
     <lb/>then be leading them by seeming to pro<lb break="no"/>nounce our opinion on the subject before<lb break="no"/>hand in favor of Federal union, although 
     <lb/>I am satisfied that a majority, or at all events 
     <lb/>a very respectable minority of this House, is 
     <lb/>not in favor of the scheme now presented, and 
     <lb/>most of the honorable gentlemen who have 
     <lb/>spoken have declared a preference for legis<lb break="no"/>lative union. If the scheme is forced through 
     <lb/>the House under this motion for the previous 
     <lb/>question, no amendments being allowed to be 
     <lb/>placed on record, it will not appear to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial authorities that there is that great 
     <lb/>amount of dissatisfaction with the scheme 
     <lb/>which is well known to exist, nor will it appear 
     <lb/>to them that any other scheme might have 
     <lb/>proved more satisfactory to the people, giving, 
     <lb/>in their opinion, greater stability of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, economy in management, and a means of 
     <lb/>maintaining our connection with the British 
     <lb/>Crown by better and stronger bonds, than is 
     <lb/>likely to be the case with a Federal Government. 
     <lb/>For these reasons Mr. SPEAKER, I repeat that 
     <lb/>I sincere] regret that the Honorable Attorney 
     <lb/>General West has beenled to make the motion 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MCDO8">HON. MR. McDOUGALL</persName>—I am not sur<lb break="no"/>prised, Mr. SPEAKER, that honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men who are opposed to the policy of the 
     <lb/>Government on this question, and desirous of 
     <lb/>overthrowing it, should feel a little disappoint<lb break="no"/>ment at the course that has been announced 
     <lb/>to-day. But I cannot understand how hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen who are friendly to that

     <lb/>at this stage of the discussion, find fault with 
     <lb/>the course of proceeding which we have felt it 
     <lb/>our duty to propose. Sir, we have been dis<lb break="no"/>cussing this question now for nearly four

     <lb/>on the part of honorable gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>to go on with it. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:MCDO8">HON. MR. MCDOUGALL</persName>—The honora<lb break="no"/>ble gentleman says "No," but the fact is that

     as early as half-past nine o'clock, because no 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman was ready or inclined to 
     <lb/>
     speak against the measure.

     <lb/>
     himself moved the adjournment at an early 
     <lb/>
     hour, because his friends were not ready to 
     <lb/>
     go on with the discussion, and hon. members 
     <lb/>
     who were in favor of the scheme have several 
     <lb/>
     times been obliged to speak, when they were 
     <lb/>
     not disposed to do so, in order to fill up the 
     <lb/>
     time and drag the discussion along. Well, 
     <lb/>
     sir, the Honorable Attorney General West 
     <lb/>
     stated to the House yesterday, in such terms 
     <lb/>
     that no one could have misunderstood him, 
     <lb/>
     that the Government felt it to be their duty 
     <lb/>
     to avail themselves of every parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     expedient for the purpose of ascertaining the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of this House upon the question as 
     <lb/>
     promptly as possible. To-day the announce<lb break="no"/>ment has been repeated, and good and suffi<lb break="no"/>cient reasons given for the adoption of this 
     <lb/>
     policy. The hon. members for Carleton and 
     <lb/>
     for North Ontario complain that there has 
     <lb/>
     been a departure from the usual practice of 
     <lb/>
     this House in making this motion, and charge 
     <lb/>
     us with stifling discussion; but these honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen surely do not need to be in<lb break="no"/>formed that this motion does not stop the 
     <lb/>
     debate. The House can discuss the " pre<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
   

     vious question " to any extent. Strictly, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, honorable members are limited to 
     <lb/>
     giving reasons why the question should not 
     <lb/>
     now be put, but among those reasons are all 
     <lb/>
     the arguments yet to be adduced, pro and can-, 
     <lb/>
     on the main motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:POWE2">MR. POWELL</persName>—Then what good will it do ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCDO8">HON. MR. McDOUGALL</persName>—The good it 
     <lb/>
     will do is this: it will prevent factious and 
     <lb/>
     irrelevant amendments, and enable us to get 
     <lb/>
     a decisive expression of the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     House upon the real question before it. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is all very well for the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for North Ontario to 
     <lb/>
     tell us that he wishes to propose his scheme 
     <lb/>
     of a legislative union, with local legislation 
     <lb/>
     controlled by the members of each province; 
     <lb/>
     but sir, it happens that he occupies a seat on 
     <lb/>
     that side of the House, and not on this. It 
     <lb/>
     is the duty of the Government, who are re<lb break="no"/>sponsible to Parliament and to the people, to 
     <lb/>
     propose their measures, and if the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman can convince the House that those 
     <lb/>
     measures are not adapted to the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     and interests of the country, we shall be 
     <lb/>
     obliged to leave this side of the House, and 
     <lb/>
     then the honorable gentleman from North 
     <lb/>
     Ontario can come over here and submit his 
     <lb/>
     scheme to Parliament. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     as we are here, and have taken it upon us to 
     <lb/>
     submit these resolutions, we are determined 
     <lb/>
     to obtain as early as possible (without, how<lb break="no"/>ever, preventing any honorable member from 
     <lb/>
     expressing his views upon them) a vote of 
     <lb/>
     this House. The outcry raised by gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite against the propositions of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to facilitate the discussion by giving 
     <lb/>
     the whole time of the House to it, roves 
     <lb/>
     that delay is their real object. If they have 
     <lb/>
     any arguments to offer against the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     they have had ample opportunity to present 
     <lb/>
     them. They have thought proper to talk of 
     <lb/>
     everything but the merits or demerits of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme itself, until the patience of this House, 
     <lb/>
     and I think also of the country, is exhausted. 
     <lb/>
     I am happy to believe that a very consider<lb break="no"/>able majority of the members of this House 
     <lb/>
     are ready and willing to vote yea on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and they ought not to be any longer de<lb break="no"/>tained from doing so, especially in view of 
     <lb/>
     circumstances that have arisen on this as well 
     <lb/>
     as on the other side of the Atlantic, to which 
     <lb/>
     my colleague the Hon. Attorney General has 
     <lb/>
     already directed the attention of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:EVAN1">HON. MR. EVANTUREL</persName>—I understood 
     <lb/>
     that the Government had stated that the 
     <lb/>
     question of Confederation was an open one. 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="720" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0720.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">720</fw>
  

     I never understood that they had stated that 
     <lb/>
     amendments could not be proposed. It was 
     <lb/>
     to be treated not as a party question, but 
     <lb/>
     the fullest latitude was to be allowed, as if 
     <lb/>
     in committee of the whole; but now the 
     <lb/>
     Government shuts down upon friends as well 
     <lb/>
     as opponents. I think their course most illog<lb break="no"/>ical, and I would like to have the Hon. Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary explain it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCDO8">HON. MR. McDOUGALL</persName>—I apprehend 
     <lb/>
     there are few honorable gentlemen in the 
     <lb/>
     House whose impressions on the subject are 
     <lb/>
     similar to those of the honorable gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It was fully understood by the 
     <lb/>
     House that the scheme was brought before 
     <lb/>
     Parliament as the result of the Conference of 
     <lb/>
     all the colonial governments, and as a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment measure. I think, sir, it was further 
     <lb/>
     distinctly stated that being in the nature of a 
     <lb/>
     treaty, it was absurd to suppose that it would 
     <lb/>
     be competent for any of the legislatures to amend 
     <lb/>
     the scheme, because the moment the door is 
     <lb/>
     thrown open to amendments in one legislature, 
     <lb/>
     the same privilege would be claimed by each 
     <lb/>
     of the others. What kind of a scheme would 
     <lb/>
     it be after each legislature had tinkered it to 
     <lb/>
     suit its own views, and what length of time 
     <lb/>
     does the honorable gentleman think it would 
     <lb/>
     take to arrive at a common agreement if that 
     <lb/>
     course were pursued? In the very nature 
     <lb/>
     of things, whether this is the best or the worst 
     <lb/>
     scheme that could have been devised, we can<lb break="no"/>not get around the fact that it is of the nature 
     <lb/>
     of a treaty, and, therefore, must be voted upon 
     <lb/>
     by a simple yea and nay. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     is in that view that the Government have sub<lb break="no"/>mitted it to this House, and it is upon that 
     <lb/>
     view that the verdict of this House must be 
     <lb/>
     pronounced. As I have already stated, the 
     <lb/>
     determination to which the Government has 
     <lb/>
     come is to press the main motion, pure and 
     <lb/>
     simple, upon the attention of the House, and 
     <lb/>
     to use every legitimate parliamentary means 
     <lb/>
     to get a decision, and by that decision we are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to stand or fall. I hope there will 
     <lb/>
    be no misunderstanding on the part of honor<lb break="no"/>able members. It is not the intention of the 
     <lb/>Government, in any manner, to deprive hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen of the opportunity—the 
     <lb/>fullest opportunity—of expressing their views 
     <lb/>on this scheme. But what we do intend to 
     <lb/>prevent, if we can, is the attempt to divert the 
     <lb/>attention of the House from the resolutions of 
     <lb/>the Conference to propositions like that of the 
     <lb/>honorable member for North Ontario, who 
     <lb/>desires to submit another and a totally differ<lb break="no"/>ent scheme, which he knows well must be re<lb break="no"/>jected by every member of the proposed Con<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
      
federation. This proposition must be dis<lb break="no"/>cussed, if discussed at all, in some other way 
     <lb/>
     than as an amendment to, or substitute for, the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of the Quebec Conference.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—I think, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that the large majority of the members 
     <lb/>
     of this House will agree with me that the 
     <lb/>
     proposition made by the leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to prevent amendments being sub<lb break="no"/>mitted by moving " the previous question," 
     <lb/>
     has taken us all by surprise. I think this 
     <lb/>
     House should hold this step to be a gross 
     <lb/>
     breach of the understanding which was en<lb break="no"/>tered into at the time it was agreed that 
     <lb/>
     the House should be considered as in com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the whole, with you, sir, in the 
     <lb/>
     chair. For it was then fully understood that 
     <lb/>
     though no amendment would be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     be adopted, if the Government could prevent 
     <lb/>
     it, yet there would be no objection to their 
     <lb/>
     being moved in the ordinary way. It was 
     <lb/>
     therefore understood that this House was, 
     <lb/>
     for all practical purposes, in Committee of the 
     <lb/>
     Whole, and as " the previous question" could 
     <lb/>
     not be moved in Committee of the Whole, it 
     <lb/>
     was consequently out of order to move it 
     <lb/>
     now. I would ask hon. gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches, if they did not solemnly 
     <lb/>
     enter into a compact of that nature with this 
     <lb/>
     House? If they committed an error in de<lb break="no"/>ciding to retain the SPEAKER in the chair on 
     <lb/>
     the conditions referred to, they are now taking 
     <lb/>
     advantage of their own wrong. Sir, the Op<lb break="no"/>position proper have abstained from placing 
     <lb/>
     on the paper any notice of amendments. 
     <lb/>
     They found that several amendments which 
     <lb/>
     embraced their views were to be moved by 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who were friendly to the Admin<lb break="no"/>istration. Those gentlemen could not sup<lb break="no"/>pose for a moment that their motions were 
     <lb/>
     to be choked off, whatever might be the 
     <lb/>
     intention of the Government in relation to 
     <lb/>
     similar amendments if proposed from this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House. But " the previous ques<lb break="no"/>tion," thus moved, applies ruthlessly to friends 
     <lb/>
     and foes. To quote the language of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Carleton :—" It is 
     <lb/>
     now quite clear that they (the Government) 
     <lb/>
     are going to put the same gag on their 
     <lb/>
     friends that they devised for their opponents." 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Let us enquire who are those 
     <lb/>
     who compose the Administration, and who, 
     <lb/>
     after violating their solemn agreement, now 
     <lb/>
     venture to trample upon the rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges of the representatives of the people 
     <lb/>
     in this House? I need only remark that 
     <lb/>
     nine members of this Government, and who 
     <lb/>
     were in the Administration before the Coali<lb break="no"/>

tion was formed, had a vote of want of confi<lb break="no"/>dence recorded against them by this same 
     <lb/>
     House, for acts of malfeasance, which 
     <lb/>
     must be fresh in the memory of honorable 
     <lb/>
     members, since which time they have 
     <lb/>
     evaded an appeal to the country in order to 
     <lb/>
     test whether their new and strange combina<lb break="no"/>tion would be ratified by the people. And 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen who have hatched up a 
     <lb/>
     coalition, by inviting three members of the 
     <lb/>
     then Opposition to join them on the most 
     <lb/>
     monstrous terms ever known in any country, 
     <lb/>
     are at this moment proposingtoask this House 
     <lb/>
     for a vote of credit, and for plonipotentiary 
     <lb/>
     powers to authorise them in England to speak 
     <lb/>
     for the people of Canada. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     West York (Hon. Mr. HOWLAND) stands in 
     <lb/>
     a different position from his two reform col<lb break="no"/>leagues. He came generously to the aid of 
     <lb/>
     his friends who first joined the Coalition, but 
     <lb/>
     he stipulated that he must first go to his 
     <lb/>
     constituents. On a reference to his speech 
     <lb/>
     at the hustings, it will be found he said in 
     <lb/>
     effect, that the scheme of Confederation was 
     <lb/>
     now before the country—that he knew no 
     <lb/>
     more about it than they did themselves, and 
     <lb/>
     that he must say there were features in the 
     <lb/>
     scheme which he did not like. I acquit him 
     <lb/>
     of being in the same category with hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have been voted down by 
     <lb/>
     this House, because he has obtained by his 
     <lb/>
     election <hi rendition="simple:italic">a quasi</hi> authority to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     grave subject. But what have the others 
     <lb/>
     attempted to do, Mr. SPEAKER ? How dif<lb break="no"/>ferent is their conduct and their practice 
     <lb/>
     to-day from what they promised would be 
     <lb/>
     their conduct towards the House at the com<lb break="no"/>mencement of the debate! And how widely 
     <lb/>
     have they strayed from the programme laid 
     <lb/>
     down at the time the Coalition was formed l I 
     <lb/>
     shall read for the information of the House 
     <lb/>
     what were the views of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     South Oxford in 1864, when he stampeded 
     <lb/>
     himself, and took with him a large portion

     Mr. BROWN asked what the Government pro<lb break="no"/>posed as a remedy for the injustice complained of

     The honorable member (Hon. Sir.E. P. TACHÉ) 
     <lb/>
     here gave a history of the several changes until 
     <lb/>
     the MACDONALD-DORION Administration died, as 
     <lb/>
     he stated, of absolute weakness, falling under the 
     <lb/>
     weight they were unable to carry. Their suc<lb break="no"/>cessors (the TACHÉ)-MACDONALD Government) were 
     <lb/>
     not more successful, and being defeated, were 
     <lb/>
     thinking of appealing to the country, which they 
     <lb/>
     might have done with more or less success, gain<lb break="no"/>ing a constituency here and perhaps losing another 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere. They had assumed the charge of affairs 
     <lb/>
     with an understanding that they would have a right 
     <lb/>
     to this appeal, and while they were consulting 
     <lb/>
     about it, they received an intimation trom the 
     <lb/>
     real chief of the Opposition (Mr. BROWN ), through 
     <lb/>
     one of their own friends, to the effect that he was 
     <lb/>
     desirous of making overtures to them with the 
     <lb/>
     view of seeking to accommodate the difficulties. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable gentleman and some of his friends 
     <lb/>
     then came into contact with the leaders of the 
     <lb/>
     Government, and it was agreed between them to 
     <lb/>
     try to dense a scheme which would put an end to 
     <lb/>
     the misunderstandings, and at the same time secure 
     <lb/>
     for Canada and the other provinces a position 
     <lb/>
     which would ensure their future satety, and pro<lb break="no"/>cure them the respect and confidence of other na<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
        

     tions. They arranged a large scheme and a 
     <lb/>
     smaller one. If the larger failed, then they were 
     <lb/>
    to fall back upon the minor, which provided  for 
     <lb/>a Federation of the two sections of the province. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Here is a recent declaration by the Pre<lb break="no"/>mier that they had arranged a large scheme 
     <lb/>
     and a smaller one. Is it not important to us 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada to know what the nature 
     <lb/>
     of the latter scheme is? Assuredly, it is not 
     <lb/>
     too much to ask that the little scheme should 
     <lb/>
     be left with us, while they run away to Dow<lb break="no"/>ning-street with the large one. We might 
     <lb/>
     be profitably employed in the meantime in 
     <lb/>
     digesting the various details which promise 
     <lb/>
     so much solace and contentment, and which 
     <lb/>
     for ever is to settle all sectional dificulties 
     <lb/>
     between Upper and Lower Canada. I hope 
     <lb/>
     the supporters of the Administration will 
     <lb/>
     insist at once upon the smaller bantling being 
     <lb/>
     left with us,—this House agreeing to pay 
     <lb/>
     all expense of its care and protection during 
     <lb/>
     their absence. (Hear, hear, and langhter.) 
     <lb/>
     Instead, therefore, of fulfilling their pro<lb break="no"/>mise they boldly propose to their reform 
     <lb/>
     followers the scheme which the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford had declared to be prema<lb break="no"/>ture, and which six months ago he insisted 
     <lb/>
     must be postponed to a remote period. It is 
     <lb/>
     scarcely possible to find words  suficiently 
     <lb/>
     strong to characterize in proper terms so fla<lb break="no"/>grant a breach of a compact as the one which 
     <lb/>
     I have been describing. It was of course 
     <lb/>
     well known, last summer, that the several 
     <lb/>
     legislatures of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and Prince Edward Island had contemplated 
     <lb/>
     a legislative union of their provinces, and a 
     <lb/>
     resolution was passed by each body author<lb break="no"/>izing delegates to be appointed from their 
     <lb/>
     respective governments to meet for that 
     <lb/>
     object. Charlottetown having been selected 
     <lb/>
     as the place of meeting, the several delegates 
     <lb/>
     assembled there. Instead of permitting that 
     <lb/>
     Convention quietly to arrange a scheme such 
     <lb/>
     as was contemplated by their legislatures, and 
     <lb/>
     permit reasonable time for its promulgation, 
     <lb/>
     or a declaration of its failure to be made, the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the Treasury benches be<lb break="no"/>thought themselves of a plan by which to 
     <lb/>
     scatter the Charlottetown delegates, caring 
     <lb/>
     nothing for the disappointment which such 
     <lb/>
     an attack must have necessarily created among 
     <lb/>
     the people of the sister provinces. I blush 
     <lb/>
     think that a fearful responsibility attaches 
     <lb/>
     to this Government for their interference 
     <lb/>
     with an arrangement which was to make the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces one people. But not 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with their visit to Charlottetown 
     <lb/>
     and breaking up the scheme which was

     being discussed there, they now coolly ask 
     <lb/>
     us to give them authority to proceed to Dow<lb break="no"/>ning-street to report the utter failure of their 
     <lb/>
     own grand scheme, which, as I remarked in 
     <lb/>
     a former debate, they yet hope to manufacture 
     <lb/>
     into a live constitution for these distracted 
     <lb/>
     provinces, through Downing-street influence. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is well known that our finan<lb break="no"/>cial condition is truly alarming, and instead of 
     <lb/>
     proceeding with the legislation of the several 
     <lb/>
     measures now before the House, and submit<lb break="no"/>ting, according to custom, the Budget, so that 
     <lb/>
     the real condition of our affairs may be fully 
     <lb/>
     exhibited to the people, the gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the Treasury benches have suddenly come to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion, not only to withhold this im<lb break="no"/>portant information, but, forsooth, we are 
     <lb/>
     asked to pass a vote of credit to be accounted 
     <lb/>
     for at the next session. A prorogation is 
     <lb/>
     shortly to follow, and the country will be left 
     <lb/>
     in a state of uncertainty as to its future, un<lb break="no"/>til it shall please these gentlemen to return 
     <lb/>
     from their mission. When we consider the 
     <lb/>
     effect which the blandishments of the Trea<lb break="no"/>sury benches but too frequently produce 
     <lb/>
     upon members sent to this House to carry 
     <lb/>
     out certain avowed principles and measures ; 
     <lb/>
     when we see the class to which I allude vio<lb break="no"/>lating the promises made to their consti<lb break="no"/>tuents and going over "body and bones" to 
     <lb/>
     a Government they were elected specially to 
     <lb/>
     oppose, we need not be astonished shortly to 
     <lb/>
     learn that influences and blandishments in 
     <lb/>
     higher quarters will have the like effect on 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen opposite when abroad, who will 
     <lb/>
     ever be ready to find a plausible excuse for 
     <lb/>
     any gross betrayal of the trusts reposed in 
     <lb/>
     them by pliant and subservient followers. 
     <lb/>
     The avowed object for the immediate proro<lb break="no"/>gation of the session is the imminent danger 
     <lb/>
     which threatens this province, and yet we 
     <lb/>
     are kept in the dark as to the real cause for 
     <lb/>
     alarm. We are told, however, that a large 
     <lb/>
     outlay, but the amount is not stated, is to be 
     <lb/>
     devoted to fortifying certain portions of 
     <lb/>
     Canada by the Home Government ; and that 
     <lb/>
     we are to be asked to contribute an unknown 
     <lb/>
     sum of money towards the same object. But 
     <lb/>
     when we ask for more definite information, 
     <lb/>
     we are met by the assurance that it would 
     <lb/>
     not be for the public interest to afford further 
     <lb/>
     information just now. We are told to wait 
     <lb/>
     patiently and to be content with the fact that 
     <lb/>
     certain gentlemen on the Treasury benches 
     <lb/>
     are to proceed to England with the view of 
     <lb/>
     arranging the amount to be appropriated by 
     <lb/>
     Canada for its defence, an towards the 
     <lb/>
     maintenance of a more effective militia or<lb break="no"/>
            

            <cb/>
        
ganisation then we have heretofore been 
     <lb/>
     called upon to make. I maintain, sir, that 
     <lb/>
     the understanding in respect to such contri<lb break="no"/>butions could be as well arrived at by means 
     <lb/>
     of dispatches and correspondence between 
     <lb/>
     this Government and the Colonial Office. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I protest against the transfer<lb break="no"/>ence of the negotiations on these matters to 
     <lb/>
     Downing-street, before we obtain some more 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory replies to the questions we have 
     <lb/>
     addressed to the gentlemen on the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     benches. The representatives of a people  
     <lb/>
     overburdened with heavy taxes, have a 
     <lb/>
     right to insist on knowing the limit beyond 
     <lb/>
     which the gentlemen on the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     benches should not consent to make this 
     <lb/>
     province liable. We know that it is a diffi<lb break="no"/>cult matter to obtain money in England at 
     <lb/>
     present, and we are not even informed of the 
     <lb/>
     terms on which the Finance Minister is now 
     <lb/>
     borrowing. We have had no information 
     <lb/>
     upon this question. We are kept in igno<lb break="no"/>rance of the position in which we are to be 
     <lb/>
     placed. Now, I think that the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country should be to vote what 
     <lb/>
     they think they can bear, and no more. There 
     <lb/>
     is no member of this House, there is no man 
     <lb/>
     in this country, I believe, who is unwilling 
     <lb/>
     to give his quota of taxes for the work of 
     <lb/>
     defence ; but there must be a limit to every<lb break="no"/>thing. (Hear, hear.) The principle laid 
     <lb/>
     down by three of the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the Treasury Benches whom I now see 
     <lb/>
     on the other side of the House, when with 
     <lb/>
     myself they were members of a former admi<lb break="no"/>nistration, is as sound now as it was then ; 
     <lb/>
     and if the force of the American army two 
     <lb/>
     years ago was not such as to induce us to 
     <lb/>
     recommend, by way of guarding against dan<lb break="no"/>ger from that quarter, large outlays for 
     <lb/>
     defence, I do not see why my old colleagues 
     <lb/>
     should now consent to entertain a proposal 
     <lb/>
     involving an enormous sum of money at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. Now, I shall read extracts 
     <lb/>
     from a Minute of Council, dated 28th October 
     <lb/>
     1862, in reply to the Duke of NEWCASTLE's

     Mr. SPEAKER, I ask this House, if the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen on the Treasury benches 
     <lb/>
     have made any proposals to the Home Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, whether we are not entitled to know 
     <lb/>
     what they are? I say that we ought not to 
     <lb/>
     leave this House till we have advised them 
     <lb/>
     in this matter—till the opinion of this 
     <lb/>
     House, representing the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country, has been elicited. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We are the persons who ought to advise 
     <lb/>
     them in this matter; and without seeking 
     <lb/>
     that advice, they are taking a step in ad<lb break="no"/>vance of their legitimate duty. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The Duke of NEWCASTLE asked us in the same 
     <lb/>
    despatch to place the money required for 
     <lb/>increased military organization in Canada 
     <lb/>beyond the domain of Parliament! Such a 
     <lb/>proposal was met in fitting terms, becom<lb break="no"/>ing a people enjoying British freedom. 
     <lb/>We could not submit it to Parliament, and 
     <lb/>we did not. It was said in the same despatch 
     <lb/>that the credit of the country was endangered 
     <lb/>in the markets of Europe, and that if we were 
     <lb/>willing to show that we were prepared to 
     <lb/>defend ourselves, if we went to this vast 
     <lb/>outlay, we would materially assist in the 
     <lb/>maintenance of our credit abroad. Our 
     <lb/>reply to that was, that—

     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> said—With the con<lb break="no"/>sent of my hon. friend from Cornwall, I de<lb break="no"/>sire, before the debate is renewed, to call the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the Hon. Attorney General West 
     <lb/>
     to the matter of the previous question which 
     <lb/>
     he has moved—to recall to his recollection 
     <lb/>
     the statements that were made when the 
     <lb/>
     agreement was come to that this debate 
     <lb/>
     should be conducted in all respects as if the 
     <lb/>
     House were in Committee of the Whole, 
     <lb/>
     and to appeal to his sense of justice to adhere 
     <lb/>
     to the letter and spirit of that agreement. 
     <lb/>
     It will be remembered that, on behalf of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen sitting on this side of the House, 
     <lb/>
     I objected very strongly to the proposition 
     <lb/>
     to consider these resolutions as a single re<lb break="no"/>solution, and insisted that they were of a 
     <lb/>
     nature that required them to be considered 
     <lb/>
     in Committee of the Whole House. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the Government objected to 
     <lb/>
     that on this ground. He said that the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions were a treaty—I do not think the 
     <lb/>
     position sound, but I am not combating that 
     <lb/>
     just now—and that the Government were 
     <lb/>
     bound to bring all their influence to bear to 
     <lb/>
     pass them in their entirety ; and in reply 
     <lb/>
     to some objection made by myself, he said 
     <lb/>
    hon. gentlemen would have no dificulty in 
     <lb/>putting their views upon record by amend<lb break="no"/>ments moved to the scheme. I thought at 
     <lb/>the time that that was placing us at a very 
     <lb/>great disadvantage, and that we.were entitled 
     <lb/>to have the propositions considered separately 
     <lb/>and a vote taken, yea or nay, on the several 
     <lb/>resolutions ; but I was overruled and the 
     <lb/>agreement was come to, which you, sir, de<lb break="no"/>clared, rising in your place, to be that the 
     <lb/>debate should be conducted in all respects 
     <lb/>as in Committee of the Whole. Well, I have 
     <lb/>two thin to urge—first, that in Committee 
     <lb/>of the Whole the previous question cannot be 
     <lb/>moved ; and second, that a distinct assurance  
     <lb/>was given by the Government that amend<lb break="no"/>ments could be moved to the resolution. 
     <lb/>These are the very words of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man as giyen in the oflicial report, which 
     <lb/>has been this moment put into my hands :—

     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—I 
     <lb/>
     will, Mr. SPEAKER, on reflection, make a 
     <lb/>
    few remarks in answer to the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man. He speaks as if it was a great 
     <lb/>concession to the majority of this House 
     <lb/>and to the Government that the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment was made at the opening of the debate. 
     <lb/>Why, sir, it was no concession whatever to 
     <lb/>the Government or to the majority of the 
     <lb/>House. (Hear, hear.) Acting on behalf 
     <lb/>of the Government, and with the full 
     <lb/>approbation of my colleagues, I made a 
     <lb/>motion that an Address should be presented 
     <lb/>to Her Majesty, praying Her sanction to the 
     <lb/>resolutions adopted at the Quebec Conference. 
     <lb/>That motion was quite parliamentary in its 
     <lb/>character, and there was no parliamentary 
     <lb/>reason whatever why it should be considered 
     <lb/>in Committee of the Whole. The hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman could not, by any rule known to 
     <lb/>

     parliamentary practice, force us to go into 
     <lb/>
     committee or require us to discuss any one 
     <lb/>
     of these resolutions by itself. It was then 
     <lb/>
     quite open to me, according to the usage 
     <lb/>
     of the House, to make a motion for 
     <lb/>
     an Address to Her Majesty for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose stated, and it was not as a favor to 
     <lb/>
     the Government that the arrangement 
     <lb/>
     was made to discuss it as if the House 
     <lb/>
     were in Committee of the Whole. On the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, it was a concession of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to the minority in the House ; for I 
     <lb/>
     stated, of my own mere motion, that although 
     <lb/>
     I had a right to proceed in the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     manner with the Speaker in the chair, and to 
     <lb/>
     restrict honorable gentlemen to a single 
     <lb/>
     speech in accordance with the rules that 
     <lb/>
     govern debate—that although this was my 
     <lb/>
     undoubted right according to parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     practice, yet, for the purpose of allowing 
     <lb/>
     the fullest and freest discussion, I suggested 
     <lb/>
     that the same rule should obtain as if the 
     <lb/>
     House were in Committee of the Whole, when 
     <lb/>
     every member could speak twenty times if 
     <lb/>
     he felt so disposed, and present his views 
     <lb/>
     fully on all the points of the scheme. That 
     <lb/>
     was the proposition made by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ; it was a fair, liberal, even generous 
     <lb/>
     one. But how were we met by honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite? We were ready to 
     <lb/>
     proceed with the discussion at once, and to 
     <lb/>
     present the subject to the House without 
     <lb/>
     delay. But it was stated that that would 
     <lb/>
     be unfair—that the members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should first make a statement, and 
     <lb/>
     allow it to go to the House and country, 
     <lb/>
     so that neither should be taken by sur<lb break="no"/>prise in a matter of so much importance, 
     <lb/>
     and that honorable gentlemen might have 
     <lb/>
     the fullest information upon which to 
     <lb/>
     make up their minds. We did make our 
     <lb/>
     statement, and when asked for a week's 
     <lb/>
     delay in order that these speeches might be 
     <lb/>
     fully considered, we consented to it. Sup<lb break="no"/>posing that after this postponement the 
     <lb/>
     debate would go on at once, we gave hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposed to the scheme a whole 
     <lb/>
     week to consider our remarks, to prepare 
     <lb/>
     themselves for debate, to work out objections 
     <lb/>
     to our arguments, and pick out all the flaws 
     <lb/>
     they could find in the scheme itself. We 
     <lb/>
     did this because we thought it fair, and be<lb break="no"/>cause we believed hon. gentlemen were sin<lb break="no"/>cere in their professed desire to have the 
     <lb/>
     fullest information upon the subject. Well, 
     <lb/>
     the debate began, it has gone on now for 
     <lb/>
     three weeks since that postponement, and 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
      

     as my hon. colleague the Hon. Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary has said, it has dragged on 
     <lb/>
     wearily, with no prospect of an early ter<lb break="no"/>mination. And how have we been met 
     <lb/>
     by hon. gentlemen opposite ? Has it 
     <lb/>
     been in the same spirit that actuated the 
     <lb/>
     Government throughout the debate? We 
     <lb/>
     asked them to come forward, and honestly 
     <lb/>
     and fairly, in the presence of the House and 
     <lb/>
     country, to discuss the scheme ; but instead 
     <lb/>
     of so doing, they have deliberately triiled 
     <lb/>
     with the question and wasted the time of the 
     <lb/>
     House. (Hear, hear.)

     <lb/>
     it ; and if he should deny it, his character

     as a man of honor and candor would sink in 
     <lb/>
     the estimation of this House. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I say it distinctly that this was the plot of 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite, to delay the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of this subject. Their policy was 
     <lb/>
     to wait, like MICAWBER, for "something to 
     <lb/>
     turn up," to see what would happen favor<lb break="no"/>able to them in New Brunswick, to learn 
     <lb/>
     what would be done in Nova Scotia, and to 
     <lb/>
     embrace every pretext of delay that pre<lb break="no"/>sented itself. The hon. gentleman was 
     <lb/>
     playing, deliberately playing, a trick. He 
     <lb/>
     talked about a base trick having been played 
     <lb/>
     upon the Opposition, but was it not a base 
     <lb/>
     trick in him not to discuss this question, but 
     <lb/>
     to put it off upon every possible excuse, to in<lb break="no"/>terrupt hon. gentlemen when they discussed 
     <lb/>
     it, making inuendoes, suggesting motives for 
     <lb/>
     delay, trying to disparage the scheme and 
     <lb/>
     ourselves in the estimation of the House and 
     <lb/>
     country, and getting others to say what he 
     <lb/>
     would not dare to say himself. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     That was the plan of the hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     He complains of not being able to more an 
     <lb/>
     amendment, but the Opposition attempted to 
     <lb/>
     move none. It was friends of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment who ofi'ered the only amendments yet 
     <lb/>
     presented. The policy of the Opposition was 
     <lb/>
     just this—they wished to s nd the whole 
     <lb/>
      of March and the best part of April in the 
     <lb/>
     general discussion upon my motion ; and 
     <lb/>
     then, when they could do nothing more ; and 
     <lb/>
     nauseate the House and disgust the country 
     <lb/>
     with the subject, when they had wearied the 
     <lb/>
     members and made the reporters sick with 
     <lb/>
     their talk—(laughter)—they were to spend 
     <lb/>
     the remainder of April, all May and June, 
     <lb/>
     and run the debate well into summer, upon 
     <lb/>
     the amendments they intended to propose.

     one after another. (Hear, hear, and laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) It is because these honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men have not endeavored honestly and can<lb break="no"/>didly to discuss the question, but have 
     <lb/>
     played the game of prolonging the debate 
     <lb/>
     to midsummer and preventing the House 
     <lb/>
     coming to a final decision upon it, that the 
     <lb/>
     Government have taken the step now pro<lb break="no"/>posed, and have said to these hon. gentlemen: 
     <lb/>
     " Here, you have had a month to move amend<lb break="no"/>ments and make speeches. You have been 
     <lb/>
     allowed to sit here discussing the question 
     <lb/>
     every night during that time, and sometimes 
     <lb/>
     till one or two o'clock in the morning. You 
     <lb/>
     have not fairly discussed the scheme, nor 
     <lb/>
     moved any amendments to it. You appear, 
     <lb/>
     on the contrary, determined to obstruct the 
     <lb/>
     measure by every means in your power. You 
     <lb/>
     have deliberately laid a plot to throw it back 
     <lb/>
     with the view of defeating it in this under<lb break="no"/>hand manner. We are not going to allow 
     <lb/>
     that, nor should be worthy of the position 
     <lb/>
     we hold as a Government if we did allow it ;" 
     <lb/>
     and, sir. I should be unworthy of the char<lb break="no"/>acter the hon. gentleman (Hon. Mr. HOLTON) 
     <lb/>
     gives me of being a good parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     strategist, if I allowed this plot of preventing 
     <lb/>
     the House coming to a vote to succeed.

     (Hear, hear.) Now, in resorting to mea<lb break="no"/>sures to prevent the success of this game 
     <lb/>
     played by the Opposition, we have not taken 
     <lb/>
    hon. gentlemen opposite or the House by 
     <lb/>surprise. We gave them from the middle 
     <lb/>of winter almost to the beginning of spring, 
     <lb/>and the opening of navigation, to discuss 
     <lb/>the question and propose amendments ; and 
     <lb/>when we saw they were determined to waste 
     <lb/>the time of the House and country indefi<lb break="no"/>nitely, I came down yesterday and, on behalf 
     <lb/>of the Government and with the full appro<lb break="no"/>bation of my colleagues, stated fairly and 
     <lb/>frankly that it was of the greatest conse<lb break="no"/>quence, the utmost consequence, to the best 
     <lb/>interests of this country, that this question 
     <lb/>should not be allowed to drag on before 
     <lb/>Parliament, but that a vote should be taken 
     <lb/>without delay, in order that we might be 
     <lb/>able to tell the sister provinces and inform 
     <lb/>Her Majesty that the contract we made with 
     <lb/>them, the arrangement we entered into 
     <lb/>with the governments of those provinces, 
     <lb/>had met the full approbation and consent 
     <lb/>Of the Parliament and people of Canada. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) And I gave fair notice 
     <lb/>that the Government considered the recent 
     <lb/>political events in New Brunswick, and the 
     <lb/>state of afi'aira in that province, called not 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     only for action, but prompt action by this 
     <lb/>
     House ; and that every proper and legitimate 
     <lb/>
     means known to parliamentary practice 
     <lb/>
     would be taken by the Government for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of getting this House to come to a 
     <lb/>
     full and final decision upon the question. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We have never taken hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen by surprise. On the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     we have allowed them every latitude in this 
     <lb/>
     debate, and have given them fair notice all 
     <lb/>
     through of what we intended to do. But 
     <lb/>
     how have we been met by them ? Have we 
     <lb/>
     been met in the same spirit of frankness and 
     <lb/>
     sincerity? No—and I say it without hesita<lb break="no"/>tion, we have been met throughout in a 
     <lb/>
     spirit of obstruction and hostility ; and, 
     <lb/>
     instead of discussing the question fairly on 
     <lb/>
     its merits, hon. gentlemen opposite are 
     <lb/>
     dragging on the debate slowly for months, 
     <lb/>
     in order to tire out the patience of the 
     <lb/>
     House and country. (Hear, hear.) I ask 
     <lb/>
     the House whether they will permit 
     <lb/>
     such a shabby, such a miserable game 
     <lb/>
     to be played successfully? Will they 
     <lb/>
    allow a question so closely identified with 
     <lb/>the best interests of Canada to be thrown 
     <lb/>across the floor of the House like a battle<lb break="no"/>dore between the hon. members for Corn<lb break="no"/>wall and Chateauguay? Will they allow 
     <lb/>these hon. gentlemen to trifle with it, not so 
     <lb/>much because they are opposed to the 
     <lb/>scheme itself or disapprove of its general 
     <lb/>principles, as because of those by whom it is 
     <lb/>presented for the adoption of the House. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Sir, there has been some 
     <lb/>little misapprehension as to the effect of the 
     <lb/>motion I have proposed to the House, which 
     <lb/>it is as well should be removed. It has 
     <lb/>simply and only this effect—that it does not 
     <lb/>prevent hon. members expressing their 
     <lb/>views fully and freely upon the subject, but 
     <lb/>calls upon every hon gentleman to give— if 
     <lb/>I may use an Americanism—a straight and 
     <lb/>square vote upon the question, and to state 
     <lb/>plainly whether or not he approves of the 
     <lb/>scheme of Confederation as a whole. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) As I stated when I opened this 
     <lb/>debate upon my motion, and as has been 
     <lb/>over and over again stated by several of my 
     <lb/>colleagues, we agreed with the governments 
     <lb/>of the sister provinces upon a future Con<lb break="no"/>stitution for the whole of British North 
     <lb/>America, and we ask this House to approve 
     <lb/>or disapprove of that Constitution. We told 
     <lb/>the House that we had made this treaty 
     <lb/>with the sanction of Her Majesty and of the 
     <lb/>Imperial Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—No ; 
     <lb/>
     we told the House that we had the previous 
     <lb/>
     sanction of Her Majesty and of Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     representative to our meeting. The Confer<lb break="no"/>ence met and sat under this authority, and 
     <lb/>
     we worked out a scheme for the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces. That scheme may be a 
     <lb/>
     good or it may be a bad one ; but whether it 
     <lb/>
     be good or bad, we have a right to ask this 
     <lb/>
     House to approve or disapprove of it, to accept 
     <lb/>
     or reject it. We had the sanction of Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty and the Imperial Government to our 
     <lb/>
     meeting—because this House knows that the 
     <lb/>
     union of these colonies is a matter of great 
     <lb/>
     Imperial as well as of great local interest— 
     <lb/>
     and under that sanction we have worked out 
     <lb/>
     a Constitution and made a bargain with the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces. We have pledged ourselves 
     <lb/>
     as a Government to come down to the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Parliament and say—" Here is a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution which we have agreed upon for the 
     <lb/>
     future government of these provinces. We 
     <lb/>
     have agreed to submit it to this House, just 
     <lb/>
     as the governments of the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     have agreed to submit it to their respective 
     <lb/>
     legislatures. We have a right to ask the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House whether in their judg<lb break="no"/>ment it is a scheme that, with all the faults 
     <lb/>
     and imperfections it may have, ought to be 
     <lb/>
     entered into by the Parliament of this coun<lb break="no"/>try. We exercise this right, and ask you to 
     <lb/>
     declare by your votes, yes or no, whether we 
     <lb/>
     were right in framing this measure, and 
     <lb/>
     whether it is such an one as ought to be 
     <lb/>
     adopted by this House." (Hear, hear.) This, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, is the position of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ; and what though amendments should 
     <lb/>
     be carried—what though the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     which the honorable member for North On<lb break="no"/>tario has given notice should succeed, and the 
     <lb/>
     House should declare in favor of a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     instead of a Federal union (supposing the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman did present and carry 
     <lb/>
     such a motion)—what good could it possibly 
     <lb/>
     do ? The contract that we entered into with 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces would be broken; this 
     <lb/>
     Legislature would be violating the solemn 
     <lb/>
     engagement under which we are to the other 
     <lb/>
     colonies, and we would have a Constitution 
     <lb/>
     drawn up which none of the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     would adopt. We know that they would 
     <lb/>
     reject it—we know that Lower Canada would 
     <lb/>
     go as one man against it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Well, the other

     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—At 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
        

     all events the governments of the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces will submit the question to their legis<lb break="no"/>latures and take their opinion upon it, and 
     <lb/>
     we have a right to ask this House—"Do you 
     <lb/>
     or do you not approve of it ? If you disap<lb break="no"/>prove of the scheme altogether because of its 
     <lb/>
     general principles, why vote it out. If you 
     <lb/>
     think that it ought to be a Legislative and not 
     <lb/>
     a Federal union, why vote it out. If you think 
     <lb/>
     it wrong to create a life peerage instead 
     <lb/>
     of an elective Legislative Council, why vote 
     <lb/>
     it out. Vote it out for any or all of these 
     <lb/>
     reasons if you like ; but give us at once an 
     <lb/>
     honest, candid and fair vote one way or the 
     <lb/>
     other, and let the sister colonies know without 
     <lb/>
     delay whether you approve of the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment or not." (Hear, hear.) And, sir, 
     <lb/>
     amendments are a mere matter of folly and 
     <lb/>
     absurdity. (Hear, hear, and ironical cheers 
     <lb/>
     from the Opposition.) Honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite cry "Hear, hear." I do not of 
     <lb/>
     course speak of the merits of any proposition 
     <lb/>
     in amendment for a legislative union, or an 
     <lb/>
     elective Legislative Council, or for any other 
     <lb/>
     change in the provisions of the scheme ; but I 
     <lb/>
     state this in all earnestness, that for all prac<lb break="no"/>tical purposes the carrying of any amendment 
     <lb/>
     to this scheme is merely to lose the only 
     <lb/> 
     chance of union we can ever hope to have
     <lb/>
     with the Lower Provinces for the sake of 
     <lb/>
     some fancied superior Constitution which we 
     <lb/>
     cannot get any of the colonies to agree to. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) All we ask this House to do 
     <lb/>
     is what the other branch of the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     has already candidly done, to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     matter fairly and honestly upon its merits, 
     <lb/>
     and then to come to a vote upon it. Those 
     <lb/>
     who think the Constitution likely to place 
     <lb/>
     the country in a worse position than now 
     <lb/>
     occupies, will vote against it. Those who 
     <lb/>
     think, on the other hand, that it is may 
     <lb/>
     proximation at any rate to what is right, 
     <lb/>
     that it will bring the colonies together into 
     <lb/>
     closer communication, that it will form the 
     <lb/>
     basis of a powerful and enduring alliance with 
     <lb/>
     England, will vote for it with all its faults 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Now, as to the consequences 
     <lb/>
     of this motion which I have proposed, this 
     <lb/>
     House ought to know that not a single speech 
     <lb/>
     can be cut off or shorn of its dimensions by it, 
     <lb/>
     and that every honorable gentleman can dis<lb break="no"/>cuss the question of Confederation, giving, as 
     <lb/>
     fully as he desires, the reasons why he will 
     <lb/>
     vote for or against the scheme proposed. All 
     <lb/>
     the motion will do, all the Government wish 
     <lb/>
     to do, is to keep the question before the 
     <lb/>
     House; and the honorable member for North 
     <lb/>
     Ontario can speak as well to it as if he had 
     <lb/>

     his amendment in his hand, and can, as he 
     <lb/>
     usually does, make as able a speech as if there 
     <lb/>
     were half-a-dozen amendments proposed to it. 
     <lb/>
     The whole scheme, in fact, is as much in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the House, and as fully before it and 
     <lb/>
     open to discussion, as it was on the day I 
     <lb/>
     moved its adoption. All this motion will do 
     <lb/>
     is to prevent honorable gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     playing the trick which I have spoken of— 
     <lb/>
     drawing the discussion away from the main 
     <lb/>
     question before the House, getting up debates 
     <lb/>
     upon the powers of the General Government 
     <lb/>
     and of the local governments, upon an 
     <lb/>
     elective or an appointed Legislative Council, 
     <lb/>
     and upon all sorts of side issues upon which 
     <lb/>
     the changes would be rung night after night 
     <lb/>
     and week after week, through the spring and 
     <lb/>
     summer, till the House became weary with 
     <lb/>
     the surfeit of talk, and the country disgusted. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) That, sir, is the aim and 
     <lb/>
     object of honorable gentlemen opposite, but I 
     <lb/>
     hope this House will not be so foolish as to 
     <lb/>
     fall into the trap they have laid, and I know 
     <lb/>
     honorable members are fully aware of the 
     <lb/>
     designs of these honorable gentlemen. They 
     <lb/>
     cannot complain that they have not had an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of moving amendments. They 
     <lb/>
     have had three weeks to do it, and they have 
     <lb/>
     not yet moved one or given notice of one. 
     <lb/>
     Then, sir, what will be the consequences, on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand, if the previous question is not 
     <lb/>
     carried? If it is rejected, and the main 
     <lb/>
     question is not put, Confederation is defeated. 
     <lb/>
     And I will at once inform the House that to 
     <lb/>
     vote that the main question be not put, will 
     <lb/>
     throw Confederation over forever, and forever 
     <lb/>
     destroy the last hopes of a friendly junction 
     <lb/>
     between the colonies of British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica. (Hear, hear.)

     not yet expressed themselves upon it. If any 
     <lb/>
     of them appear now to be hostile to it, that 
     <lb/>
     feeling may disappear when it is fully ex<lb break="no"/>plained to them. Even the Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral PALMER, of Prince Edward Island, may 
     <lb/>
    himself become convinced of its desirability, 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     and vote for it. We cannot say how those legis<lb break="no"/>latures will vote, but what we repose to do 
     <lb/>
     is to lay our action before the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and ask it to exercise its influence 
     <lb/>
     with the other colonies in securing the pas<lb break="no"/>sage of the scheme. And I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that if the Mother Country gives friendly ad<lb break="no"/>vice to the sister colonies in that kindly spirit 
     <lb/>
     in which she always gives it, if she points out 
     <lb/>
     that in her view this scheme is calculated to 
     <lb/>
     serve, not onl our interests, but the general 
     <lb/>
     interests, welfare and prosperity of the Em<lb break="no"/>pire, I am quite satisfied that the people of 
     <lb/>
     those colonies, whatever may be their local 
     <lb/>
     feelings, will listen at all events with respect, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps with conviction, to the advice so 
     <lb/>
     given by the Imperial Government. I have 
     <lb/>
     no doubt, indeed I am satisfied, that if the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government gives that advice, it will 
     <lb/>
     be in the spirit of kindness and maternal love 
     <lb/>
     and forbearance, and that if England points 
     <lb/>
     out what is due to ourselves as well as to the 
     <lb/>
     Empire, and shows what she, in her exper<lb break="no"/>ience and wisdom, believes to be best for the 
     <lb/>
     future interests of British North America, 
     <lb/>
     her advice will be accepted in the spirit in 
     <lb/>
     which it is offered, and sooner or later with 
     <lb/>
     conviction. (Cheers.) For all these reasons 
     <lb/>
     I think the members of the Government 
     <lb/>
     would be wanting in their duty in this great 
     <lb/>
     strait, this great emergency in our affairs, if 
     <lb/>
     they did not press for the decision of this

     <lb/>
     Why, there is the question of defence, which

     be of the most pressing importance, that re<lb break="no"/>quires immediate attention and demands that

     obstructing and delaying the debate on this 
     <lb/>
     scheme. (Hear, hear.) When I say that 
     <lb/>
     there is an intimate connection between these 
     <lb/>
     two questions of defence and Confederation, I 
     <lb/>
     mean this : that the progress of recent events 
     <lb/>
     —events which have occurred since the com<lb break="no"/>mencement of this debate—has increased the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of immediate action, both with re<lb break="no"/>gard to defence and to this scheme. Honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen Opposite havebeen in the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment—they have been behind the scenes— 
     <lb/>
     and they know that the question of the de<lb break="no"/>fence of British North America is of great 
     <lb/>
     and pressing importance, and they know that 
     <lb/>
     the question of the defence of Canada cannot 
     <lb/>
     be separated from it. And honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men avo been informed, and will find by the 
     <lb/>
     scheme itself, that the subject was considered 
     <lb/>
     by the Conference, and that it was arranged 
     <lb/>
     that there should be one organized system 
     <lb/>
     of defence for the whole of the provinces and 
     <lb/>
     at the cost of the whole. Well, it is now of 
     <lb/>
     the greatest importance that some members 
     <lb/>
     of the Government should go home imme<lb break="no"/>diately, in order that England may know what 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of Canada is upon this question of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, as well as upon the question of 
     <lb/>
     defence. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Is that 
     <lb/>
     what you want them to go for ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—Yes. 
     <lb/>
     The season is fast approaching when it will be 
     <lb/>
     necessary to commence these works—the only 
     <lb/>
     season during which they can be carried out 
     <lb/>
     at all ; and that man is not true to his country, 
     <lb/>
     that man is not a true patriot, who, for the 
     <lb/>
     sake of a petty parliamentary triumph, for the 
     <lb/>
     sake of a little party annoyance—for the con<lb break="no"/>duct of the Opposition amounts to nothing 
     <lb/>
     more—would endeavor to postpone some defi<lb break="no"/>nite arrangement on this important question 
     <lb/>
     of defence. (Hear, hear.) Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     this opposition is either one or the other of 
     <lb/>
     two things—it is either for the sake of party 
     <lb/>
     annoyance, or it is a deliberate desire to pre<lb break="no"/>vent anything being done to defend ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     in order that we may easily fall a prey to an<lb break="no"/>nexation. (Cheers.) I do not like to believe 
     <lb/>
     that honorable gentlemen opposite entertain 
     <lb/>
     any wish to become connected with the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring republic, and therefore I am 
     <lb/>
     forced to the conviction that they are actuated 
     <lb/>
     by the miserable motive of gaining a little 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary or party success. There are 
     <lb/>
     only two alternatives of belief, and one or the 
     <lb/>
     other of them must be correct. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I believe the honorable member for Chateau<lb break="no"/>guay is in his heart strongly in favor of a 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
        

     Federal union of these colonies ; but because 
     <lb/>
     it is proposed by honorable gentlemen on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House, he cannot and will not 
     <lb/>
     support it. (Hear, hear.) So long as my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend the Hon. Finance Minister sits 
     <lb/>
     here on these benches, so long as MORDECAI 
     <lb/>
     sits at the King's gate—(laughter)—and so 
     <lb/>
     long as the honorable gentleman sits on the 
     <lb/>
     opposite instead of this side of the House, so 
     <lb/>
     long will he find fault and object. Hit high 
     <lb/>
     or hit low, like the flogged soldier, nothing 
     <lb/>
     will please him. (Renewed laughter.) But 
     <lb/>
     I believe the House will not sanction such 
     <lb/>
     pitiful conduct as honorable gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite exhibit. I believe we will have a 
     <lb/>
     large, an overwhelming majority, to sustain us 
     <lb/>
     in the course we have adopted ; and that we 
     <lb/>
     should be highly blameable were we to exhaust 
     <lb/>
     the patience not only of ourselves, but. of our 
     <lb/>
     supporters, by allowing this conduct to be 
     <lb/>
     pursued much longer unchecked. These, sir, 
     <lb/>
     are my answers to the questions of the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Chateauguay. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I have the satis<lb break="no"/>faction of having provoked from the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman altogether the best speech he has 
     <lb/>
     delivered during this debate. So much I 
     <lb/>
     freely admit, and I think his own followers 
     <lb/>
     will confess that this is the first time he has 
     <lb/>
     spoken with anything like his usual spirit 
     <lb/>
     and force during the whole debate. This 
     <lb/>
     was perhaps inevitable, because in his other 
     <lb/>
     speech, and notably in his introductory 
     <lb/>
     speech, he labored under the consciousness 
     <lb/>
     that the scheme was at variance with his 
     <lb/>
     own antecedents, and was not approved of by 
     <lb/>
     anybody. We had, therefore, at that time 
     <lb/>
     none of that vivacity, none of that strength 
     <lb/>
     of declamation, none of that humor with 
     <lb/>
     which his brief speech this evening has 
     <lb/>
     overflown. But, sir, to return to the point 
     <lb/>
     to which I called your attention when you 
     <lb/>
     resumed the chair. To that point the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has not been pleased to speak. 
     <lb/>
     He has gone off on all sorts of subjects He 
     <lb/>
     has said he will not hold himself bound by 
     <lb/>
     the arrangements which he himself entered 
     <lb/>
     into at the opening of the debate. He 
     <lb/>
     says he does not consider himself so 
     <lb/>
     bound ; and I must be allowed to say a word 
     <lb/>
     or two in reference to his excuse for his de<lb break="no"/>parture from that agreement. He says that 
     <lb/>
     I and other hon. gentlemen on this side 
     <lb/>
     have been instrumental in wasting the time 
     <lb/>
     of the House. Emphatically I deny that 
     <lb/>
     statement. (Hear, hear.) That we did re<lb break="no"/>sist the unfair attempts on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the House to change the order of the debate 
     <lb/>

       <fw type="num">731</fw>


     which was deliberately established, whereby 
     <lb/>
     the debate was to be resumed every evening 
     <lb/>
     at half-past seven, I do not deny. I frankly 
     <lb/>
     admit it, and claim that we were justified in 
     <lb/>
     so doing ; at all events I am prepared to 
     <lb/>
     take the responsibility of having contributed 
     <lb/>
     my share to that result. But as to the 
     <lb/>
     debate on the main motion, I defy the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General to indicate one hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man on this side who has wasted a single mo<lb break="no"/>ment of the time of the House—who has spoken 
     <lb/>
     beside the question—and who has spoken 
     <lb/>
     in order to postpone the question and to 
     <lb/>
     protract the debate. And for proof of this 
     <lb/>
     assertion, I venture to say that when we get 
     <lb/>
     the extended reports of this debate, it will 
     <lb/>
     be found that the space occupied by the 
     <lb/>
     speeches of honorable gentlemen who support 
     <lb/>
     this measure is at least twice that which is 
     <lb/>
     occupied by the speeches of hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on this side of the House. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—That's 
     <lb/>
     just the complaint made on this side, that 
     <lb/>
     you will not speak. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON MR. HOLTON—Oh, we are wasting 
     <lb/>
     time by not speaking—that's the charge! 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) It is quite obvious that the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman's leader would never 
     <lb/>
     have made a blunder of that kind. We 
     <lb/>
     have wasted the time of the House by not 
     <lb/>
     speaking ! Well, sir, it is a very novel way 
     <lb/>
     of talking against time, by holding our 
     <lb/>
     tongues! (Laughter.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I am not going into the general debate. I 
     <lb/>
     shall not proceed with this matter further. 
     <lb/>
      I rose for the purpose of appealing to the 
     <lb/>
     sense of justice and common fairness of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen. That appeal has been disre<lb break="no"/>garded. They adhere to that unfair step of 
     <lb/>
     theirs, and of course we must meet it as we 
     <lb/>
     can. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName> — Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, the hon. gentleman found fault 
     <lb/>
     with what I stated just now. But what I 
     <lb/>
     said was quite correct ; and that is, that we 
     <lb/>
     wanted to give as free scope to the debate 
     <lb/>
     as could be afiorded on both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     House. When, however, hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the other side had their opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     speak, they were never ready ; and we all 
     <lb/>
     remember that on two occasions they actually 
     <lb/>
     moved the adjournment of the House, one 
     <lb/>
     night at nine o'clock, and again, when the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Brome (Mr. DUNKIN) was 
     <lb/>
     unable to continue his speech, at ten o'clock. 
     <lb/>
     Some hon. gentlemen on this side had 
     <lb/>
     promised to speak, and I well recollect that 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
         

     the hon. member for Lincoln (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>GIVERIN) had to come to their relief, and 
     <lb/>
     filled up the space in the debate, in order to 
     <lb/>
     give the opportunity to the Opposition of 
     <lb/>
     being ready on the following day. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—I cannot allow the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General West to run away 
     <lb/>
     from the question by one of those "artful 
     <lb/>
     dodges," for which he is so well known in 
     <lb/>
     this House and the country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The question put to him by my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend the member for Chateauguay (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. HOLTON) was, whether he did not agree 
     <lb/>
     to the debate being continued on certain 
     <lb/>
     terms, and in such a way as that full oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity should be given to hon. members to 
     <lb/>
     move their amendments. It is very well for 
     <lb/>
     the Attorney General West to say that that 
     <lb/>
     arrangement was made, not for the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     the House, not for the advantage of the 
     <lb/>
     public, not for the convenience of honorable 
     <lb/>
     members, but out of mere courtesy by the 
     <lb/>
     Government. Sir, the proposition was his 
     <lb/>
     own. The hon. gentleman himself came to 
     <lb/>
     the House and stated the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     the debate should be conducted, actually 
     <lb/>
     proposing that the rule which prevented 
     <lb/>
     honorable members speaking more than once 
     <lb/>
     on the same question, with the Speaker 
     <lb/>
     in the chair, should be suspended, in 
     <lb/>
     order that every member should have the 
     <lb/>
     same freedom of discussion as though we 
     <lb/>
     were in Committee of the Whole. That was 
     <lb/>
     the proposition ofthe Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West himself, thinking it the most proper 
     <lb/>
     way to conduct the course ff the debate. 
     <lb/>
     He went further, and stated it as his opinion 
     <lb/>
     that after the debate commenced, it should 
     <lb/>
     go on each day after half-past seven, leaving 
     <lb/>
     the afternoon sitting for the other business 
     <lb/>
     of the House. This was another of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman's voluntary statements. Then, 
     <lb/>
     going on, what do we find ? We find the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West, immediately after, 
     <lb/>
     in answer to my hon. friend on my right 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. J. S. MACDONALD), saying :—

     not suggested for a moment that the vote should

     adjourned, if deemed necessary, to allow time for

     the expression of public opinion. There were

     130 members, and almost every member would

     members on the floor of the House were to

     Atty. Gen. West said that we should have 
     <lb/>
     all the advantages, and more, too, than if we 
     <lb/>
     went into committee. He promised that 
     <lb/>
     we should be allowed to express our views 
     <lb/>
     as often as we pleased, while we would have 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of greater order being kept, with 
     <lb/>
     the Speaker in the chair, than would be 
     <lb/>
     possible in Committee of the Whole. We 
     <lb/>
     relied upon this agreement being kept, and 
     <lb/>
     believed that not only would members be 
     <lb/>
     allowed to express their views without 
     <lb/>
     check, but that the public would have time 
     <lb/>
     to hold meetings and petition. We there<lb break="no"/>fore consented at once to the eight days' 
     <lb/>
     adjournment, which was suggested by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Peel (Hon. J. H. 
     <lb/>
     CAMERON), and which was considered by 
     <lb/>
     all a most reasonable proposition. Well, the 
     <lb/>
     Government took eight days to send their 
     <lb/>
     speeches to the country, and four days after 
     <lb/>
     the debate was resumed, we find the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Montreal Centre (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. ROSE) putting a notice on the paper to 
     <lb/>
     do away with the solemn agreement which 
     <lb/>
     was entered into on the floor of Parliament 
     <lb/>
     between the honorable members on the min<lb break="no"/>isterial side and the minority in opposition. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The honorable gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the Treasury benches closed the exposition 
     <lb/>
     of their case on the 8th of February. On 
     <lb/>
     the 16th the debate was resumed, and on 
     <lb/>
     the 21st—Saturday and Sunday intervening 
     <lb/>
     —just two nights' debating having taken 
     <lb/>
     place in the meantime—the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Montreal Centre went to every mem<lb break="no"/>ber to get a round robin signed for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of breaking a solemn agreement, which 
     <lb/>
    had been entered into in good faith, between 
     <lb/>the Government and the minority. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Having failed, after two nights' dis<lb break="no"/>cussion, to carry the resolution of which he 
     <lb/>had given notice—after, I say, the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Montreal Centre had been 
     <lb/>foiled in his attempt to carry that motion- 
     <lb break="yes"/>the Hon. Atty. Gen. West put a notice on 
     <lb/>the paper to the same effect, thereby assum<lb break="no"/>ing the responsibility of all that had been done 
     <lb/>in this respect by the honorable member for 
     <lb/>Montreal Centre. And in the absence of the 
     <lb/>Hon. Atty. Gen. West, the Hon. Atty. Gen. 
     <lb/>East moved that resolution for breaking the 
     <lb/>agreement which he and his colleagues had 
     <lb/>solemnly entered into. (Hear, hear.) And, 
     <lb/>sir, not only did they attempt to break this 
     <lb/>agreement, so as to prevent discussion on 
     <lb/>the part of the minority, and to stifle the 
     <lb/>expression of public opinion, which  was 
     <lb/>

     manifesting itself at public meetings, which 
     <lb/>
     were being held everywhere throughout the 
     <lb/>
     country, and making itself known to this 
     <lb/>
     House through the right of petition ; but we 
     <lb/>
     now find the hon. gentlemen taking advan<lb break="no"/>tage of every rule and technicality known 
     <lb/>
     to parliamentary practice to accomplish the 
     <lb/>
     same object. (Hear, hear.) And, forsooth, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman rises in his place and 
     <lb/>
     attempts to justify himself by calling the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition a factious opposition, and by 
     <lb/>
     charging it with wasting the time of the 
     <lb/>
     House. They are anxious to strangle the 
     <lb/>
     discussion after five or six days' debate, 
     <lb/>
     when more time had been employed by hon. 
     <lb/>
     members on that side than by hon. members 
     <lb/>
     on our side, having already succeeded in 
     <lb/>
     forcing on the discussion at half-past three 
     <lb/>
     in the afternoon, instead of half-past seven, 
     <lb/>
     according to the agreement. And now, sir, 
     <lb/>
     we are witnessing the extraordinary spec<lb break="no"/>tacle of a Government moving the " previous 
     <lb/>
     question" to their own motion. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     Well, indeed, might the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Carleton (Mr. POWELL) ask if there could 
     <lb/>
     be found a precedent for such a course ! 
     <lb/>
     Hon. gentlemen who can accomplish such a 
     <lb/>
     thing as the " double shuffle" can never 
     <lb/>
     be much embarrassed for the want of a 
     <lb/>
     precedent. They who have so long, by 
     <lb/>
     means of parliamentary tricks, succeeded in 
     <lb/>
     maintaining their position, are now inventing 
     <lb/>
     a new dodge in order to choke off discussion 
     <lb/>
     on this question. Already, sir, have we 
     <lb/>
     seen, on one celebrated occasion—in the 
     <lb/>
     Corrigan case—the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West rising in his place and moving a 
     <lb/>
     resolution, and afterwards inviting his own 
     <lb/>
     followers to vote against it. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     And now, following a similar course, he is 
     <lb/>
     proposing the " previous question," the 
     <lb/>
     object of which is, in ordinary parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     practice, to prevent a vote being taken on 
     <lb/>
     the main proposition. Whenever an hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman does not want to vote in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the question before the House, and dares 
     <lb/>
     not vote against it, he moves or gets a 
     <lb/>
     friend to move the " previous question," 
     <lb/>
     which is that the question he now put, and 
     <lb/>
     votes against it. (Hear, hear.) Such is 
     <lb/>
     the invariable practice in England, where 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary usage is better known than in 
     <lb/>
     this country, and we here find a govern<lb break="no"/>ment resorting to a similar dodge in reference 
     <lb/>
     to a measure of their own, and the most 
     <lb/>
     important measure that was ever brought 
     <lb/>
     before the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—And a 
     <lb/>
     strong government, too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Yes, and a strong 
     <lb/>
     government, as my honorable friend says— 
     <lb/>
     a government which boasts of having an 
     <lb/>
     immense majority, and of having the power 
     <lb/>
     to carry such measures as it pleases. It is 
     <lb/>
     such a government as this, I say, which is 
     <lb/>
     dragging its supporters still deeper through 
     <lb/>
     the mire—which is saying to them : " You 
     <lb/>
     shall vote for the scheme without putting 
     <lb/>
     your views on record, and without giving 
     <lb/>
     the people an opportunity of expressing their 
     <lb/>
     opinion in the usual constitutional manner." 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But what do they gain by 
     <lb/>
     such a course ? They acknowledge it will 
     <lb/>
     not stop discussion. And thus they will not 
     <lb/>
     gain a single hour or a single minute in point 
     <lb/>
     of time. But this they will gain—if their 
     <lb/>
     supporters are blind enough to follow them 
     <lb/>
     —those who are pledged to their constituents 
     <lb/>not to vote for the scheme without first 
     <lb/>submitting it to the people, will be forced 
     <lb/>into eating up all the promises that they 
     <lb/>have made while in the presence of their 
     <lb/>constituents. It may be possible that they 
     <lb/>will find some who will thus, following the 
     <lb/>example shown them by the Government, 
     <lb/>give the denial to their solemn promises, 
     <lb/>and turn their backs on the pledges they 
     <lb/>have given—they may find, I say, a few 
     <lb/>of their followers doing this ; but I shall 
     <lb/>be much mistaken if the majority of the 
     <lb/>members of this House who have gone 
     <lb/>to public meetings in the country—who 
     <lb/>have met their constituents face to face, and 
     <lb/>who have faithfully pledged themselves to 
     <lb/>vote for an appeal to the people, will be 
     <lb/>dragged, as the honorable gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>other side attempt to drag them, into doing 
     <lb/>that which their own consciences and their 
     <lb/>promises to their constituents alike forbid. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) It will be discreditable to 
     <lb/>this House, should honorable members be 
     <lb/>found in such a position—if, by a mere 
     <lb/>dodge of this kind, Ministers themselves can 
     <lb/>not only break their own promises, but 
     <lb/>compel their supporters to break their pro<lb break="no"/>mises as well. I hope, for the honor of this 
     <lb/>House and the country, there will not be 
     <lb/>found one of those who have promised to 
     <lb/>vote for an appeal to the people, recording 
     <lb/>his vote for the question now before the 
     <lb/>Chair. Let it be clearly understood, that 
     <lb/>every honorable member who votes for the 
     <lb/>previous question declares against any 
     <lb/>amendment being moved to the main motion, 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="734" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0734.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">734</fw>

     against any expression of opinion on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the members of this House being 
     <lb/>
     placed on record. In voting, too, for the 
     <lb/>
     " previous question," he also votes to con<lb break="no"/>done the breach of faith of which honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen have been guilty towards this 
     <lb/>
     House. And, sir, honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     must have sunk very low in the estimation 
     <lb/>
     of their own friends, when two or three of 
     <lb/>
     their warmest supporters have to rise, one 
     <lb/>
     after the other, to charge them, as was done 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon, with a breach of faith, and 
     <lb/>
     with not having kept their promises to this 
     <lb/>
     House and to the country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     In my opinion, the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     would have shown a little more dignity and 
     <lb/>
     self-respect had they not thus exposed them<lb break="no"/>selves to the taunts of their own friends. 
     <lb/>
     But I cannot believe that the House will 
     <lb/>
     consent to be led away by the dexterous man<lb break="no"/>agement of the Hon. Attorney General West 
     <lb/>
     —by the fictitious indignation which he is 
     <lb/>
     always ready to summon to his assistance, 
     <lb/>
     and with which he has burst upon the House 
     <lb/>
     to-day. In respect to the factiousness of 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition, I repeat that I never wit<lb break="no"/>nessed in this House such a spectacle as 
     <lb/>
     that which has just been displayed by hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the other side. Never, in my 
     <lb/>
     life, did I hear a strong government rising 
     <lb/>
     in its place, and upon a question of this mag<lb break="no"/>nitude, involving the dearest interests of 
     <lb/>
     the country, exclaiming—" You shall accept 
     <lb/>
     the scheme as a whole ; you shall not even 
     <lb/>
     have the opportunity of moving a single 
     <lb/>
     amendment." The honorable gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     sir, treated as an absurd proposition that of 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for North Ontario 
     <lb/>
     —which is also the desire of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces—for a legislative union, with 
     <lb/>
     guarantees for the laws, language and reli<lb break="no"/>gion of the inhabitants of Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     instead of a Federal union. But, sir, is it 
     <lb/>
     not the case that a great many members of 
     <lb/>
     this House, nay, some in the Administration, 
     <lb/>
     would prefer that to the proposed scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Federation ? Is it not also the case that in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, Hon. Mr. HOWE has set his face 
     <lb/>
     against Federation, and is a strong advocate 
     <lb/>
     of legislative union, which the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite treat as an absurdity. 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, whether it is an absurdity or not, 
     <lb/>
     every honorable member of this House ought 
     <lb/>
     to have an opportunity to put his views on 
     <lb/>
     record, and of saying—" I want a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union, and not a Federation ; I want an 
     <lb/>
     elective, and not a nominative Council." 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
     

     (Hear, Hear.) Sir, the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men say that a legislative union is an 
     <lb/>
     absurdity, that an appeal to the people on 
     <lb/>
     this question is also an absurdity ; but this 
     <lb/>
     is only in keeping with their whole course of 
     <lb/>
     conduct, which is to treat the peeple of this 
     <lb/>
     country with contempt, and altogether to 
     <lb/>
     disregard the wishes of their representatives 
     <lb/>
     in Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Not only do 
     <lb/>
     they treat this side with contempt, but they 
     <lb/>
     treat with even greater contempt their own 
     <lb/>
     friends, whom they are trying to coerce into 
     <lb/>
     approval of their unconstitutional course of 
     <lb/>
     conduct. (Cheers)

     which, if followed, would most assuredly

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Whatever other steps may be taken for the im<lb break="no"/>proved organization of the militia, it appears to

    Her Majesty's Government to be of essential 
     <lb/>importance that its administration and the supply

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Another suggestion embraced in His Grace's 
     <lb/>
     despatch is well calculated to excite surprise. 
     <lb/>
     Your Excellency's advisers allude to that portion 
     <lb/>
     of the despatch in which His Grace proposes to 
     <lb/>
     remove the control of funds required for militia 
     <lb/>
     purposes from the domain of Parliament. His 
     <lb/>
     Grace is evidently aware that the proposition 
     <lb/>
     wears the aspect of " an interference with the privi<lb break="no"/>leges of the representatives of the people," and it 
     <lb/>
     is certain that any measure liable to this construc<lb break="no"/>tion never will be, and ought not to be enter<lb break="no"/>tained by a people inheriting the freedom gua<lb break="no"/>ranteed by British institutions. The Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament guards with jealous care the means of 
     <lb/>
     maintaining the military and naval forces of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire. Its appropriations are annually voted. 
     <lb/>
     and not the most powerful minister has dared to 
     <lb/>
     propose to the House of Commons the abandon<lb break="no"/>ment of its controlling power for a period of five

     years. If the disturbing action " of ordinary 
     <lb/>
     politics" is a reason for removing the final direc<lb break="no"/>tion of military preparations from Parliament, it 
     <lb/>
     is in every sense as applicable in England as in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. What the case of Commons would 
     <lb/>
     not under any circumstances of danger entertain, 
     <lb/>
     is not likely to be entertained by the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. Whatever evils are incident to repre<lb break="no"/>sentative institutions, the peOple of a British pro<lb break="no"/>vince will not forget that the are trivial in 
     <lb/>
     comparison with those which are inseparable from

     arbitrary authority. Popular liberties are only

     safe when the action of the people retains and

     guides the policy of those who are invested with 
     <lb/>
     the power of directing the affairs of the country. 
     <lb/>
     They are safe against military despotism, wielded

     I will now quote one more extract from the

     <lb/>
     the opinion that any alliance of this character 
     <lb/>
     cannot at present be entertained. An Interco<lb break="no"/>lonial Railway seems to be the first step towards 
     <lb/>
     any more intimate relations between the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces than those which now 
     <lb/>
     exist. The construction even of this work is by 
     <lb/>
     no means certain; although this Government, 
     <lb/>
     looking at it mainly as a means of defence, has 
     <lb/>
     entertained the preliminaries, in common with 
     <lb/>
     delegates from the provinces of Nova Scotia and 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick. It is premature, just now, to 
     <lb/>
     speculate upon the possible political consequences 
     <lb/>
     which may never be consummated. Certain it is, 
     <lb/>
     however, that the re can be no closer intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     union of any kind until increased facilities for in<lb break="no"/>tercommunication are provided; and equally 
     <lb/>
     certain that the provinces, supposing them to be 
     <lb/>
     hereafter united, will never contribute to an 
     <lb/>
     expensive system of defence unless it be subject 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
        

     to their own control. Speaking for Canada, 
     <lb/>
     Your Excellency's advisers are sure that this pro<lb break="no"/>vince will continue to claim the exclusive right 
     <lb/>
     of directing the expenditure of the public 
     <lb/>
     moneys.

            <p>
     Sir, these were the replies to the various 
     <lb/>
     propositions submitted by His Grace in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to our contributions towards the defence 
     <lb/>
     of this country, and to the means for supply<lb break="no"/>ing the same. If different ground is now 
     <lb/>
     taken by honorable gentlemen on the Trea<lb break="no"/>sury benches, it seems to me that they 
     <lb/>
     abandon the rights which belong to a free 
     <lb/>
     people—the right of controlling the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of our own money, the denial of which 
     <lb/>
     caused the revolt of the American colonies 
     <lb/>
     in 1776. In the observations I have made 
     <lb/>
     on the question of defence, and the willing<lb break="no"/>ness of the people of this country to contri<lb break="no"/>bute their share, I wish to be understood 
     <lb/>
     that the proportion asked of us shall be 
     <lb/>
     according to our ability. What I say is 
     <lb/>
     that in the condition in which the country 
     <lb/>
     is at this moment, it would be idle for us to 
     <lb/>
     undertake an outlay which would hopelessly 
     <lb/>
     embarrass our exchequer. To organize a 
     <lb/>
     large force in connection with the outlay for 
     <lb/>
     fortifications, would require a large number 
     <lb/>
     of men, who would be withdrawn from the 
     <lb/>
     industry of the country—and, that industry 
     <lb/>
     being heavily taxed, without any return being 
     <lb/>
     expected ;—and the soil refusing perhaps to 
     <lb/>
     be as prolific as in other years, most serious 
     <lb/>
     embarrassments would overtake us in the 
     <lb/>
     attempt to defend ourselves in a war which  
     <lb/>
     we had done nothing to provoke. And, 
     <lb/>
     having no knowledge of the Imperial policy 
     <lb/>
     which might bring about such a war, I say 
     <lb/>
     it becomes the people of this country, before 
     <lb/>
     they undertake a large outlay for defence or 
     <lb/>
     military organisation, to consider what por<lb break="no"/>tion we can bear of the burdens sought to be 
     <lb/>
     imposed upon us. (Hear, hear.) I say 
     <lb/>
     nothing of the sensational style of speaking 
     <lb/>
     which the Attorney General West gets up 
     <lb/>
     about other topics, in order to get away from 
     <lb/>
     the point raised by my honorable friend from 
     <lb/>
     Chateauguay, who stated the case in a way 
     <lb/>
     that any one who desired might have met it 
     <lb/>
     fairly. When a plain answer is wanted to a 
     <lb/>
     pointed question, honorable gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site invariably fly off to something else. I 
     <lb/>
     will not allude to the debate which incident<lb break="no"/>ally followed aftcr the recess this evening, 
     <lb/>
     and before I resumed my observations a 
     <lb/>
     little while ago, farther than to make a 
     <lb/>
     remark on the statement of the Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West, that I sneered at the question 
     <lb/>
 

            <pb n="736" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0736.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">736</fw>

     of defence. The honorable gentleman stopped 
     <lb/>
     there, and I do not know what he in<lb break="no"/>tended to add. I suppose it was to be the 
     <lb/>
     same courteous and elegant language which 
     <lb/>
     he addressed to my honorable friend the 
     <lb/>
     member for Chateauguay—language which, 
     <lb/>
     as regards its audacity and vituperative 
     <lb/>
     character, no other member of this House 
     <lb/>
     would condescend to use. Complaints from 
     <lb/>
     this side of the conduct of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment generally, the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     meets by getting up in a dreadful fury, 
     <lb/>
     and singling out honorable gentlemen on this 
     <lb/>
     side for personal attack. Such conduct, I 
     <lb/>
     think. is unworthy of the leader of this 
     <lb/>
     House. (Hear, hear.) I deny that I have 
     <lb/>
     ever sneered at the defence question. During 
     <lb/>
     my life, it has been more than a sentiment 
     <lb/>
     with me—it has been a principle that this 
     <lb/>
     country should be defended. I know it is a 
     <lb/>
     duty we owe to the Empire, as a self-gov<lb break="no"/>erning colony, to contribute a fair proportion 
     <lb/>
     of our means for defence. And I am sure I 
     <lb/>
     speak the sentiments of every honorable 
     <lb/>
     member on this side, when I say that we are 
     <lb/>
     prepared, to the extent of our resources, to 
     <lb/>
     contribute all we can for that object. But it 
     <lb/>
     is not only that we are called upon to con<lb break="no"/>tribute means for our defence ; we shall be 
     <lb/>
     called upon also, in the time of danger, to 
     <lb/>
     contribute men, to shed the best blood of the 
     <lb/>
     country, to see our fields devastated, our 
     <lb/>
     towns destroyed, our trade and commerce 
     <lb/>
     ruined. All these are consequences of a 
     <lb/>
     state of war, which must necessarily fall 
     <lb/>
     upon us, in the event of that calamity arising. 
     <lb/>
     We have all that to consider, and we have 
     <lb/>
     the consciousness also that, without a very 
     <lb/>
     large amount of Imperial aid, it would be 
     <lb/>
     impossible for us for a long time to resist an 
     <lb/>
     invasion of this country. But, while taking 
     <lb/>
     this ground, let us not be led away by this 
     <lb/>
     buncombe talk of loyalty—by the dragging 
     <lb/>
     in of the name ot the Sovereign and the 
     <lb/>
     name of the Governor General by hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite. To over-awe and whip in 
     <lb/>
     their supporters, they say to them that they 
     <lb/>
     must do what they bid them, because the 
     <lb/>
     Queen has said this, and the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General has said that, and they constantly 
     <lb/>
     refer to " loyalty." For my own part, I never 
     <lb/>
     invoke the aid of that term—for I always 
     <lb/>
     take it for granted that men are loyal, until 
     <lb/>
     they prove by word or deed that they are 
     <lb/>
     disloyal. (Hear, hear.) The imputations 
     <lb/>
     cast on our loyalty are a gratuitous insult 
     <lb/>
     offered to true Britons, who have proved in 
     <lb/>
     times past, and are ready to prove again, 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
       

     their loyalty and their valour—men, whose 
     <lb/>
     attachment to the soil on which they were 
     <lb/>
     born makes them still more anxious to keep 
     <lb/>
     their hearths and firesides free from the 
     <lb/>
     pollution of the invader. Those who 
     <lb/>
     have come here only yesterday cannot feel 
     <lb/>
     the strength of the ties which bind us 
     <lb/>
     to our native land ; and yet they have 
     <lb/>
     the audacity to charge us with being an<lb break="no"/>nexationists. So far from submitting to 
     <lb/>
     this imputation, I charge the gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the Treasury benches, by the course of legis<lb break="no"/>lation they have introduced—by the sudden 
     <lb/>
     manner in which they have changed their 
     <lb/>
     tactics, and proceeded to organise a Constitu 
     <lb/>
     tion which familiarises the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country more to American institutions that 
     <lb/>
     anything ever done here before—I charge 
     <lb/>
     them with having done much, to hasten 
     <lb/>
     annexation. I put it to honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     whether the outside talk of annexation is not 
     <lb/>
     assuming a very alarming aspect. (Ironical 
     <lb/>
     cries of " Hear ! hear" from the Ministerial 
     <lb/>
     benches.) Yes, and I charge honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen with the fatal consequence of 
     <lb/>
     placing the issue before the English public, 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country, and the 
     <lb/>
     people of the United States—that either this 
     <lb/>
     self-made, unauthorised Constitution must be 
     <lb/>
     supported, or else the rejection of it will be 
     <lb/>
     tantamount to annexation, and consequently 
     <lb/>
     that we are annexationists at heart who do not 
     <lb/>
     approve of this measure. We, who raise our 
     <lb/>
     voices honestly against the scheme, being 
     <lb/>
     desirous really to perpetuate our connection 
     <lb/>
     with the Mother Country, and to defend this 
     <lb/>
     province with the means we have, are to be 
     <lb/>
     stigmatised as annexationists by the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Agriculture, who sends it forth to the 
     <lb/>
     world, that there are annexationists not only 
     <lb/>
     here but down in the Lower Provinces. He, 
     <lb/>
     forsooth, is the man of all others to talk about 
     <lb/>
     loyalty ! I have listened with disgust—(oh ! 
     <lb/>
     oh !)—with disgust, at the assumption with 
     <lb/>
     which the honorable gentleman passes judg<lb break="no"/>ment on those who will be found standing 
     <lb/>
     by the British flag when he will be nowhere. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Yes ; I can scarcely restrain 
     <lb/>
     my anger when I hear that honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man reading us a lecture on loyalty. It is 
     <lb/>
     " Satan reproving sin." When he gets into 
     <lb/>
     a government with a number of super- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     loyal gentleman, he forsooth must stigmatise 
     <lb/>
     as disloyal every one who will not go just 
     <lb/>
     his own way.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—I was led 
     <lb/>
     into this digression in consequence of the 
     <lb/>
     taunts and imputations cast upon us this 
     <lb/>
     evening by the leader of the House. We 
     <lb/>
     were obliged to him for saying, in his 
     <lb/>
     speech at the opening of this debate, that we 
     <lb/>
     are all loyal in this country; and yet the At<lb break="no"/>torney General East in his speech made on 
     <lb/>
     the following day, said there were annexation<lb break="no"/>ists here—there were the JOHN DOUGALL 
     <lb/>
     party and the extreme democratic party. It 
     <lb/>
     is not for me to reconcile the statements of the 
     <lb/>
     two honorable gentlemen. One says there 
     <lb/>
     are no annexationists, the other says there are. 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. Attorney General East spoke of 
     <lb/>
     an annexation sentiment in Montreal. Whe<lb break="no"/>ther he is.right or not, we know that that 
     <lb/>
     city became notorious for its annexation 
     <lb/>
     proclivities at a former time. With regard 
     <lb/>
     to the prosperity of the country, and its con<lb break="no"/>dition at this present time, I have some 
     <lb/>
     observations to make, and will leave the 
     <lb/>
     House to deduce there from how far the 
     <lb/>
     Administration will be justifiable in asking 
     <lb/>
     from this House authority to make the out<lb break="no"/>lay which they may propose for purposes 
     <lb/>
     of defence. I have said that the cry of 
     <lb/>
     annexation has arisen from the attempt 
     <lb/>
     made by honorable gentlemen opposite to 
     <lb/>
     shape our Constitution after the American 
     <lb/>
     model. And there is nothing more natural 
     <lb/>
     than, when the commerce of the country is 
     <lb/>
     at a stand-still, when indebtedness presses 
     <lb/>
     hard and heavy upon the farmers and 
     <lb/>
     mechanics as well as merchants, and all 
     <lb/>
     branches of trade are depressed—nothing is 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
           

     more natural than that people should look 
     <lb/>
     somewhere for relief. This leads me to state 
     <lb/>
     that the desire for change—which it is said 
     <lb/>
     this proposed scheme is intended to meet— 
     <lb/>
     has not been produced so much by any sec<lb break="no"/>tional difficulties, as by the embarrassments 
     <lb/>
     which have overtaken the country. Make 
     <lb/>
     the institutions of this country analogous, 
     <lb/>
     except in some very trifling instances of dif<lb break="no"/>ference, to those of the United States, and 
     <lb/>
     let us feel that our commerce is too limited, 
     <lb/>
     and embarrassments have overtaken us 
     <lb/>
     —and the result will be that the policy of 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen opposite with regard to 
     <lb/>
     this question will make people look to the 
     <lb/>
     States, in spite of themselves. I wish to 
     <lb/>
     shew that the state of the country ten years 
     <lb/>
     ago was much more prosperous than it is 
     <lb/>
     now. The condition in which we found our<lb break="no"/>selves in 1852 and 1853 justified us to a great 
     <lb/>
     extent in going into a large indebtedness for 
     <lb/>
     the Grand Trunk. And probably the healthy 
     <lb/>
     condition of the farming interest and of every 
     <lb/>
     branch of trade at that time, justified to some 
     <lb/>
     extent the enactment of the Municipal Loan 
     <lb/>
     Fund Act, which enabled municipalities to 
     <lb/>
     borrow money for all sorts of improvements. 
     <lb/>
     Having referred to the state of prosperity 
     <lb/>
     which then prevailed, I shall next allude to 
     <lb/>
     the cause, which, in my judgment, more 
     <lb/>
     than anything else contributed to produce 
     <lb/>
     the disastrous difficulties which have since 
     <lb/>
     overtaken the country. I first quote from the 
     <lb/>
     despatch of Lord ELGIN in 1852, to show 
     <lb/>
     what was our condition about that period, when

     <lb/>
     satisfaction the uniform testimony which they bear

     to the prosperity of the country and the content<lb break="no"/>ment of the inhabitants. Reports which reach 
     <lb/>
     me from other parts of the province speak on 
     <lb/>
     this point the same language. Canada has enjoyed 
     <lb/>
     seasons of prosperity before, but it is doubtful 
     <lb/>
     whether any previous period in the history of the 
     <lb/>
     colony can be cited at which there was so entire 
     <lb/>
     an absence of those bitter personal and party 
     <lb/>
     animosities which divert attention from material 
     <lb/>
     interests, and prevent co—operation for the public 
     <lb/>
     good.

     I could quote also from the essays written 
     <lb/>
     at that time by the member for South Lanark 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. MORRIS), the Solicitor General East 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN), and the late JOHN 
     <lb/>
     SHERIDAN HOGAN, to shew the unprece<lb break="no"/>dented progress which was being made by 
     <lb/>
     Canada at that time. And what was the 
     <lb/>
     first thing to mar that prosperity? I wish to 
     <lb/>
     call the attention of honorable gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     the fact, that the first step in bringing about 
     <lb/>
     the embarrassment we are now laboring 
     <lb/>
     under, was the repeal of the Usury laws. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place, the bill of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for South Oxford (Hon. Mr. BROWN) 
     <lb/>
     in 1853, took away the penalty attached to 
     <lb/>
     lending money at usurious rates. Money was 
     <lb/>
     then got freely—farmers and others borrowed 
     <lb/>
     heavily—and we commenced our downward 
     <lb/>
     career. Afterwards all restrictions on the 
     <lb/>
     lending of money were taken off. At first 
     <lb/>
     people could get money at six per cent., but 
     <lb/>
     afterwards capital came in from abroad, and 
     <lb/>
     the country was flooded with money, but at 
     <lb/>
     unlimited interest. I appeal to honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, who represent the farming por<lb break="no"/>tions Of Upper Canada—I appeal to honor<lb break="no"/>able members for Lower Canada, if they 
     <lb/>
     can rise in their places and say that the 
     <lb/>
     condition of this country at present is not 
     <lb/>
     deplorable ; that there is not an amount of 
     <lb/>
     private indebtedness which is frightful to con<lb break="no"/>template ? And why is this ? It is because 
     <lb/>
     so many are borrowing money on account of 
     <lb/>
     the facility of obtaining it at high rates ; 
     <lb/>
     then, getting embarrassed, they borrow for 
     <lb/>
     three or four years more at 15 or 20 per 
     <lb/>
     cent ; next they have to borrow at 30 or 40 
     <lb/>
     per cent, and finally are stripped of their 
     <lb/>
     property and ruined.

     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—Well, I have to 
     <lb/>
     say for one, that while there is a considerable 
     <lb/>
     amount Of money borrowed in the part of the 
     <lb/>
     country which I represent myself, there is 
     <lb/>
     an amount of accumulated wealth there 
     <lb/>
     tenfold what it was at the time the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has referred to ; and there is not 
     <lb/>
     anything like that amount borrowed now 
     <lb/>
     that there was at that time. (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STIR1">MR. STIRTON</persName>.—I have no hesitation in 
     <lb/>
     endorsing that statement, as applicable also 
     <lb/>
     to the part of the country which I represent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—And I should 
     <lb/>
     have added that money can be borrowed at 
     <lb/>
     lower rates now than at the time referred 
     <lb/>
     to.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Well, it 
     <lb/>
     appears that I have the testimony of two 
     <lb/>
    honorable gentlemen against me. As regards  
     <lb/>the statement of my honorable friend who 
     <lb/>comes from the Oil Springs, we can easily 
     <lb/>understand why money has flowed in there, 
     <lb/>where they sell a hundred acres for a million 
     <lb/>of dollars—and why, at the time his section 
     <lb/>of country has become rich, other parts of the 
     <lb/>country may remain poor. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>At the time the usury laws were repealed, 
     <lb/>I had the honor, Mr. SPEAKER, to be in the 
     <lb/>seat which you now occupy, and I had 
     <lb/>therefore no opportunity of urging my oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to the bill then brought before the 
     <lb/>House by the honorable member for South 
     <lb/>Oxford (Hon. Mr. BROWN) with all that 
     <lb/>energy and earnestness which characterises 
     <lb/>that honorable gentleman. But whenever 
     <lb/>the attempt was subsequently made to restore 
     <lb/>the usury laws, or to reimpose the restric<lb break="no"/>tions on the rate of interest, my vote will 
     <lb/>always be found to have been with those who 
     <lb/>were opposed to what is called free trade in 
     <lb/>money, and to-day I feel more satisfied than 
     <lb/>ever that it is the repeal of the usury laws 
     <lb/>which has brought about a large amount of 
     <lb/>the depression and the difficulties under 
     <lb/>which the country now suffers. It is true 
     <lb/>that for two or three years after the repeal 
     <lb/>of the usury laws, the country was pros<lb break="no"/>perous. Property was valued at enormous 
     <lb/>rates ; large amounts were borrowed 
     <lb/>the Municipal Loan Fund, and were spent 
     <lb/>on local improvements generally, yielding no 
     <lb/>return whatever. Then there were large 
     <lb/>sums borrowed from the different moneyed 
     <lb/>corporations that came into the country— 
     <lb/>such as the Canada Loan and Credit Com<lb break="no"/>pany—the Trust and Loan Company— and 
     <lb/>the various insurance companies that are 
     <lb/>daily investing their surplus funds in valu<lb break="no"/>

     able property in this country. Where does 
     <lb/>
     that money go ? It does not remain here. It 
     <lb/>
     is drained off in the dividends of the banks, 
     <lb/>
     and of the various companies that are lending 
     <lb/>
     at usurious rates of interest. It is going 
     <lb/>
     out of the country. And what do we get in 
     <lb/>
     return ? More facilities for borrowing. 
     <lb/>
     And I ask honorable gentlemen from Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada—I do not know how far this is applic<lb break="no"/>able to Lower Canada—whether it is not 
     <lb/>
     true that an immense number of our youth, 
     <lb/>
     now in the armies of the United States, have 
     <lb/>
     gone away because the properties held by 
     <lb/>
     their fathers are so heavily mortgaged that 
     <lb/>
     they had no hope of retrieving them. 
     <lb/>
     Speaking for my own section, I can say that 
     <lb/>
     there is scarcely a young man who can now 
     <lb/>
     look forward, as was the rule ten or twelve 
     <lb/>
     years ago, to succeeding his father in the 
     <lb/>
     family homestead. I say then that this gene<lb break="no"/>rally depressed state of the country, without 
     <lb/>
     any prospect of relief, causes a large amount 
     <lb/>
     of uneasiness in the public mind. And there 
     <lb/>
     is no doubt that a good deal of the feeling 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the scheme which honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman take credit for, is influenced by the 
     <lb/>
     desire to look for some change, as a relief 
     <lb/>
     from the depression under which we labour. 
     <lb/>
     And I am not without authority for the state<lb break="no"/>ment I am now making. I shall read from an 
     <lb/>
     article published only a day or two ago by 
     <lb/>
     one, whose name I am sure is well known to 
     <lb/>
     the commercial community generally—who 
     <lb/>
     has contributed more than any one else to 
     <lb/>
     the statistics of our trade and commerce by 
     <lb/>
     his labors in Toronto, and subsequently in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal—I allude to the Editor of the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Trade Review</hi>. I shall read from that article, 
     <lb/>
     and shall then ask the House to say whether 
     <lb/>
     I have been exaggerating. I am now speaking 
     <lb/>
     more of the condition of our farmers, and 
     <lb/>
     those who have been induced to borrow on 
     <lb/>
     account of the facilities afforded for getting 
     <lb/>
     money ; I shall come presently to speak of 
     <lb/>
     the trade and commerce of the country, and 
     <lb/>
     shall prove from the same source that the 
     <lb/>
     statistics of our trade shew both to be in a 
     <lb/>
     deplorable condition. I do this to show that 
     <lb/>
     we should not blindly incur an immense 
     <lb/>
     liability in the matter of defence, when we 
     <lb/>
     have no means of meeting the outlay that 
     <lb/>
     may be imposed upon us. When the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General (Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN) and 
     <lb/>
     the member for St. John's (Mr. BOUBASSA) 
     <lb/>
     had a race every year to see who would be 
     <lb/>
     foremost in bringing in his bill to reduce the 
     <lb/>
     rate of interest, the member for South Oxford 
     <lb/>
    (Hon. Mr. BROWN) of course insisted on the 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
        

     maintenance of his pet scheme, which, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, has done more harm to the country 
     <lb/>
     than anything else. I regret that the 
     <lb/>
     House should have agreed so far with the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman in maintaining that 
     <lb/>
     policy. As I said before, in a country like 
     <lb/>
     this, where our wealth is in our lands, where 
     <lb/>
     we own but little money—when our crops 
     <lb/>
     fail, how can we meet the extravagant 
     <lb/>
     demands made upon us by those from whom 
     <lb/>
     we borrow ? But I will proceed to read what 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Trade Review</hi> of February last says of 
     <lb/>
     our present laws on the subject of usury :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The framers of these laws evidently intended  
     <lb/>
     them, we think, to protect the trader and the 
     <lb/>
     farmer from the extortions of money lenders, 
     <lb/>
     and, as such, they may have been suited for the 
     <lb/>
    time, when banking was solely in the hands of 
     <lb/>one or two corporations, which, of course, were 
     <lb/>monopolists. But competition has now fairly 
     <lb/>effaced all possibility of oppression from such a 
     <lb/>source. These laws, in fact, instead of guarding 
     <lb/>the interests they were intended to protect, only 
     <lb/>serve to drive their representatives into the ene<lb break="no"/>my's quarters, and leave them at the mercy of the 
     <lb/>oppressor. Mercantile paper, which our banks 
     <lb/>are not willing to discount at seven per cent., is 
     <lb/>handed by the needy trader—who is in want of 
     <lb/>money to meet the pressing demands of some 
     <lb/>creditor, or to retire some notes falling due—to a 
     <lb/>broker, by whom, perhaps, after getting a bond 
     <lb/>over part of the trader's property, the paper is 
     <lb/>discounted at a rate more nearly assimilated to 
     <lb/>that at which respectable bankers are selling 
     <lb/>" current fund" drafts upon New York (say fifty 
     <lb/>per cent. discount) than a fair rate for commercial 
     <lb/>paper. This is the kind of protection our usury 
     <lb/>laws afford. Rather a rude nurse, we should call 
     <lb/>them, for our undeveloped "resources, and our 
     <lb/>infant manufactures."

     one of the consequences of free trade in

            <p>
     A very general degree of anxiety is apparent 
     <lb/>
     among mercantile men as to the prospects of a 
     <lb/>
     healthy trade during the coming season. There 
     <lb/>
     are so many unfavourable circumstances combi<lb break="no"/>ning to affect our commerce, that this anxiety is 
     <lb/>
     by no means without a cause. Excessive importa<lb break="no"/>tions last year, implying large internal and foreign 
     <lb/>
     indebtedness ; decreased exports, equally implying 
     <lb/>
     inabi ity to readily reduce this indebtedness, are 
     <lb/>
     facts that in themselves are sufficient to create a 
     <lb/>
     marked change in the immediate condition of 
     <lb/>
     trade. There can be no doubt but that the grain 
     <lb/>
     crop throughout Western Canada falls short of 
     <lb/>
     even diminished expectation, the fine sleighing of 
     <lb/>
     the past two months having failed to induce deli<lb break="no"/>veries to any large extent by farmers. Taking 
     <lb/>
     into account, however, that throu bout the au<lb break="no"/>tumn the deliveries were insignificant, it was 
     <lb/>
     generally anticipated that during the winter the 
     <lb/>
     amount of produce to be brought out would be 
     <lb/>
     very large. But unfortunately, notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     a continuance of excellent roads, a very great 
     <lb/>
     pressure for money, and a fair demand at mode<lb break="no"/>rate rates, at no point in all the province have 
     <lb/>
     the receipts yet reached those of previous years. 
     <lb/>
    The only inference is, that the crop is not only a
     <lb/>short one, but that the money being realised for 
     <lb/>it falls far short of general expectation. The 
     <lb/>result must be to materially lessen the debt-paying 
     <lb/>power of the people, and render them less likely 
     <lb/>to make new purchases. Not only will this be 
     <lb/>the internal effect, but when it is understood that 
     <lb/>one section of the province will require for con<lb break="no"/>sumption very nearly all the surplus produce of 
     <lb/>the other. the difficulty to discharge foreign in<lb break="no"/>debtedness is intensified."

            <p> MR. SPEAKER, I again quote from the

     <lb/>

     Another cause for anxiety is the general con<lb break="no"/>dition in which the retail trade of the country is 
     <lb/>
     found. The numerous failures that are daily 
     <lb/>
     occurring, and the wretched dividends which real 
     <lb/>
     estates are likely to pay, indicate a condition of 
     <lb/>
     things not at all desirable. Not only is there 
     <lb/>
     constantly apparent a manifest lack of capacity, 
     <lb/>
     but, as we remarked last week, a degree of ras<lb break="no"/>cality is being developed, which cannot fail to be  
     <lb/>highy injurious to general confidence. We do 
     <lb/>not now propose to enumerate the causes for 
     <lb/>these frequent casualties, or point out the policy 
     <lb/>of trade that has induced them : it is sufficient to 
     <lb/>say, that recent events make it more than usually 
     <lb/>incumbent upon importers to scan their credits  
     <lb/>very closely ; to lessen large amounts in few 
     <lb/>hands ; and to use every legitimate precaution for 
     <lb/>safety rather than profit. We need hardly another 
     <lb/>cause to account or the anxiety of merchants as 
     <lb/>to the future. But another cause we have in the 
     <lb/>restricted policy which the banks will of necessity 
     <lb/>be compelled to pursue. All that we have been 
     <lb/>attempting to describe will act with far greater 
     <lb/>force upon the banks than upon individuals. A 
     <lb/>small movement of produce implies an equally 
     <lb/>small circulation of bills ; any lack of confidence 
     <lb/>in the retail trade will hasten the policy which 
     <lb/>has been for some time evident, viz., the con<lb break="no"/>traction into large cities of the means of the  
     <lb/>leading institutions. Even in the ordinary con<lb break="no"/>dition of affairs, the banks would not do other 
     <lb/>than contract in a year of short crops and low 
     <lb/>prices. But another cause for contraction will be 
     <lb/>the contemplated withdrawal of Southern gold  
     <lb/>now in deposit. The passage of the Alien Bill 
     <lb/>may have one of two effects,—1st, it may cause  
     <lb/>the withdrawal of a considerable sum of gold held 
     <lb/>by the banks ; or 2nd, it will certainly necessitate 
     <lb/>preparation for such a withdrawal, should it even 
     <lb/>never take place. Either consequence implies a 
     <lb/>conversion into bullion of some property not now 
     <lb/>in that shape. The banks now unitedly hold five 
     <lb/>and a half millions of dollars in gold, against which 
     <lb/>there is a circulation of notes of over nine mil<lb break="no"/>lions. This proportion will doubtless be main<lb break="no"/>tained, and any considerable drafts for deposits 
     <lb/>will be met by bills of exchange on England, the 
     <lb/>banks either using their credit there, which they  
     <lb/>can do with interest at five per cent., or they can  
     <lb/>sell the securities in which their foreign deposits  
     <lb/>are invested.

     Sir, there is the future, drawn only last 
     <lb/>
     month, of the condition of Upper Canada— 
     <lb/>
     short crops and nothing to export, and 
     <lb/>
     nothing staring us in the face but actual 
     <lb/>
     distress and actual want. Then, if that is 
     <lb/>
     imminent, does it not behove us to regard 
     <lb/>
     closely the conduct of the gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches?  We ought to admonish 
     <lb/>
     them not to go heedlessly and needlessly 
     <lb/>

     into extravagance which this country cannot 
     <lb/>
     bear. (Hear, hear.) The effect of this 
     <lb/>
     legislation, the unhinging of the public 
     <lb/>
     mind, and the high expectations formed of 
     <lb/>
     the advantages which are to result from the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of this scheme of a new Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion—all these things have contributed to 
     <lb/>
     make the people unhappy and to drive the 
     <lb/>
     population out of the country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I put it to the House, whether the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the Treasury benches have not 
     <lb/>
     given, as the main excuse for pressing 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation scheme, the imminent 
     <lb/>
     danger which surrounds us. Does the 
     <lb/>
     emigrant choose that country where 
     <lb/>
     he cannot profitably invest his capital ; where 
     <lb/>
     he cannot find profitable employment on his 
     <lb/>
     arrival, nor lands in convenient situations, 
     <lb/>
     which he can convert to immediate use, 
     <lb/>
     where extravagance has been induced by 
     <lb/>
     the facilities afforded for borrowing and for 
     <lb/>
     wild speculations ; and above all, where he 
     <lb/>
     expects to be called upon to perform mili<lb break="no"/>tary duties in the face of a powerful enemy 
     <lb/>
     immediately on the berders of his new 
     <lb/>
     home? I think that if, in the face of all 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances, the gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches pledge themselves to an 
     <lb/>
     excessive outlay, we ought to be told now 
     <lb/>
     what are the prospects in store for the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada. (Hear, hear.) But, sir, 
     <lb/>
     they are silent on that point. We know 
     <lb/>
     this, however, from past experience—we 
     <lb/>
     know that it will be impossible for us to 
     <lb/>
     regulate the conducto f the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the Treasury benches, when they 
     <lb/>
     get to Downing-street, surrounded by the 
     <lb/>
     influences which will meet them there. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     We have occasion for alarm. We remember 
     <lb/>
     that when Hon.Mr. HINCKS went to England 
     <lb/>
     in 1854, notwithstanding we had voted 
     <lb/>
     one million eight hund sterling in 1852 
     <lb/>
     for the Grand Trunk, he returned to 
     <lb/>
     Canada just in time to call Parliament 
     <lb/>
     within a day of the prescribed period ap<lb break="no"/>pointed for its meeting, and proposed, as 
     <lb/>
     the important measure for that session, 
     <lb/>
     £900,000 stg. additional ; and this vote was 
     <lb/>
     forced through Parliament during the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing session, when it transpired, for the 
     <lb/>
     first time, that the agreement to advance 
     <lb/>
     this sum out of the public exchequer had 
     <lb/>
     been entered into by Mr. HINCKS and Lord 
     <lb/>
     ELGIN whilst in London. We are now 
     <lb/>
     called upon to give these gentlemen a vote 
     <lb/>
      of credit ; to give them the control of a 
     <lb/>
    large sum of money, to spend as they think 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
            

     proper ; to allow them to betake themselves 
     <lb/>
     to England to bind us to an agreement for 
     <lb/>
     all time to come. (Hear, hear.) We see, 
     <lb/>
     sir, day after day, as I have said before, 
     <lb/>
     how gentlemen come to this House and dis<lb break="no"/>regard the pledges they have made their 
     <lb/>
     constituents. Once in their places here, 
     <lb/>
     they forget the vows by which they ob<lb break="no"/>tained them. I could give a long list, in 
     <lb/>
     my experience of a quarter of a century in 
     <lb/>
     this House, of members who have betrayed 
     <lb/>
     the confidence reposed in them by the 
     <lb/>
     people who elected them. (Hear, hear.) Is 
     <lb/>
     it vain to appeal to members now to control 
     <lb/>
     the power the Government are asking from 
     <lb/>
     us, after we have protested against this sort 
     <lb/>
     of thing year after year ; when we are re<lb break="no"/>fused those explanations which should be 
     <lb/>
     given to this House ; when the country is 
     <lb/>
     deeply embarrassed, I fear, beyond redemp<lb break="no"/>tion ? (Hear, hear.) I have to apologise to 
     <lb/>
     the House for the length of time during which 
     <lb/>
     I have occupied its attention. But I hope 
     <lb/>
     the House will believe this, that I am not 
     <lb/>
     actuated by any factious motives in this 
     <lb/>
     matter. (Hear, hear.) I stand here as one 
     <lb/>
     who has no vote of his to recall ; as one who 
     <lb/>
     has always maintained that, under our Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, as it is, prosperity and enjoyment 
     <lb/>
     might be secured, with all their concomitants, 
     <lb/>
     were we free from demagogueism, which 
     <lb/>
     has produced a very large proportion of the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties by which we are surrounded. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I think I have demonstrated 
     <lb/>
     that there is suficient cause for alarm to 
     <lb/>
     make us anxious for the future. For all 
     <lb/>
     we know, we may find ourselves in a very 
     <lb/>
     awkward predicament when the question 
     <lb/>
     turns upon Confederation or annexation. I 
     <lb/>
     sincerely regret to notice the prevalence of 
     <lb/>
     this tone of annexation, and I say that, since 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentlemen opposite got on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches, this tone has been much 
     <lb/>
     more decided on this question than ever 
     <lb/>
     before. (Hear, hear. Sir, I need only 
     <lb/>
     refer to the declaration of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     Premier in the other House, who stated the 
     <lb/>
     other day that we were on an inclined plane 
     <lb/>
     towards annexation, but which the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation scheme was calculated to arrest. I 
     <lb/>
     regret also, as much as any one, the position 
     <lb/>
     in which we are placed, and that, with such 
     <lb/>
     a large population, we are, like mendicants, 
     <lb/>
     knocking at the door of the Lower Prov<lb break="no"/>inces, imploring them against their will to 
     <lb/>
     step in to save ns, forsooth, from destruc<lb break="no"/>tion. (Hear.) It is no wonder that the 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="742" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0742.jpg"/>

     people there refuse to cast their lot with 
     <lb/>
     ours, after hearing the opinion the honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen on the Treasury benches 
     <lb/>
     have so frequently expressed of each other. 
     <lb/>
     And what will be the consequence if an attempt 
     <lb/>
     is made to coerce them ? Why, they will be 
     <lb/>
     like the damsel who is forced to marry against 
     <lb/>
     her will, and who will, in the end, be most 
     <lb/>
     likely to elope with some one else. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, and laughter.) With the tricks which 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen on the Treasury benches know 
     <lb/>
     so well to play, we will only hasten the day 
     <lb/>
     when the Lower Provinces will perhaps en<lb break="no"/>deavor to withdraw from the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try and seek another alliance. I resume my 
     <lb/>
     seat, sir, regretting the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     the Government have tried to stifle the full 
     <lb/>
     and free discussion of this great question. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COWA1">MR. COWAN</persName>—I cannot agree altogether, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, with the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Cornwall as to the causes which led to 
     <lb/>
     the prosperity of this country from 1854 to 
     <lb/>
     1858, nor yet with the picture he draws of 
     <lb/>
     our present circumstances. That hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman attributes our prosperity to the repeal 
     <lb/>
     of the Usury laws. I do not doubt but that 
     <lb/>
     the repeat of the Usury laws had some effect, 
     <lb/>
     but there were other causes which had much 
     <lb/>
     more to do in producing that prosperity 
     <lb/>
     than the repeal of the Usury laws. In the 
     <lb/>
     first place we imported money by the million 
     <lb/>
     to build our railways, and in the second 
     <lb/>
     place, not only had we abundant harvests, 
     <lb/>
     but short crops in other countries gave 
     <lb/>
     us fabulous prices for everything we raised. 
     <lb/>
     Instead of eighty or ninety cents, wheat was 
     <lb/>
     worth two dollars a bushel and upwards, 
     <lb/>
     with millers scouring the country with teams 
     <lb/>
     to carry it from the barn to the mill. Such 
     <lb/>
     a tide of prosperity, Mr. SPEAKER, never set 
     <lb/>
     in on any country ; the result was that it 
     <lb/>
     unhinged the sober calculation of almost 
     <lb/>
     everybody, and we ran into debt individually, 
     <lb/>
     municipally, and provincially, as if pay-day 
     <lb/>
     had never been to come. Well-to-do farm<lb break="no"/>ers, with perhaps a thousand dollars or two 
     <lb/>
     in their pocket, thought they might purchase 
     <lb/>
     an adjoining farm, but it was well if they 
     <lb/>
     escaped with the loss of the money paid 
     <lb/>
     down. In many instances the homestead 
     <lb/>
     was sacrificed ere the new farm was paid for, 
     <lb/>
     while houses planned and built then have 
     <lb/>
     not yet received their furniture. But, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, if our prosperity was unprece<lb break="no"/>dented, so were our reverses. The commer<lb break="no"/>cial crisis of 1858 came on us when we were 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
          

     almost without a crop. The disastrous frost 
     <lb/>
     of the 11th of June destroyed the one-half, 
     <lb/>
     if not three-fourths, of the fall wheat— 
     <lb/>
     Spring wheat—all except the Fife sort, then 
     <lb/>
     but sown—was so blighted as in many 
     <lb/>
     instances not to be worth the cutting. And 
     <lb/>
     many a farmer was not only destitute of 
     <lb/>
     potatoes to eat, but had even to purchase his 
     <lb/>
     next year's seed. The only article from 
     <lb/>
     which numerous farmers got any return was 
     <lb/>
     surplus stock, which that season brought 
     <lb/>
     fair prices—lean as well as fat—in the 
     <lb/>
     American markets. But these reverses were 
     <lb/>
     not without a salutary effect. All speculation 
     <lb/>
     was instantly stopped. Farmers began to 
     <lb/>
     practice anew frugality and economy, and 
     <lb/>
     turned their attention to rearing stock as well 
     <lb/>
     as cereals. The consequence is that the 
     <lb/>
     country has in a great measure recovered 
     <lb/>
     from the shock of 1858, and, notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     rather short crops and comparatively low 
     <lb/>
     prices, I cannot help thinking that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Cornwall takes altogether too 
     <lb/>
     gloomy a view of the state of the country. 
     <lb/>
     But though I cannot coincide with the 
     <lb/>
     gloomy views of the member ior Cornwall, 
     <lb/>
     neither can I accept the bright prospect of 
     <lb/>
     the member for South Wellington, as being 
     <lb/>
     descriptive of the agricultural interest, 
     <lb/>
     generally, throughout the province. It is 
     <lb/>
     all very well for my hon. friend, who resides 
     <lb/>
     in one of the most fertile counties in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and whose farmers devote their attention to 
     <lb/>
     rearing stock—stock second to none in the 
     <lb/>
     province—to talk of agricultural prosperity. 
     <lb/>
     But in less favored sections it cannot be 
     <lb/>
     denied that there is much individual 
     <lb/>
     suffering, caused by the midge and the 
     <lb/>
     unprecedented drought of last summer.

     <persName ref="pers:LAFR1">HON. MR. LAFRAMBOISE</persName> said—Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, when, a few nights ago, I had the 
     <lb/>
     honor to assert in this House that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would adopt every means to cause 
     <lb/>
     their scheme of Confederation to be passed 
     <lb/>
     without amendment, and would have recourse 
     <lb/>
     to motions of the nature of that which is 
     <lb/>
     engaging our attention at the present time, I 
     <lb/>
     certainly did not expect that my prediction  
     <lb/>
     would be so soon accomplished, and I ac<lb break="no"/>knowledge that I did not believe that it was 
     <lb/>
     so well founded as it has proved to be. What 
     <lb/>
     do we see, Mr. SPEAKER? We see an ex<lb break="no"/>ample of the most deplorably restrictive ac<lb break="no"/>tion which can possibly be displayed by a 
     <lb/>
     government. After delivering, to satiety, 
     <lb/>
     speeches lasting several hours, speeches to

     which we have listened with the greatest pos<lb break="no"/>sible attention, the Administration, alarmed 
     <lb/>
     at the agitation which is arising everywhere 
     <lb/>
     throughout Lower Canada, and dreading re<lb break="no"/>action, takes every means to prevent discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and to cause the House to vote without 
     <lb/>
     allowing it an opportunity of proposing amend<lb break="no"/>ments to the informal scheme which it is de<lb break="no"/>sirous of imposing upon the country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Among those who were witnesses of 
     <lb/>
     the unworthy behavior of some of the hon<lb break="no"/>orable Ministers, who now sit on the opposite 
     <lb/>
     side of the House, at the time of the cele<lb break="no"/>brated "Double Shuffle" of 1858 ; among 
     <lb/>
     those who saw those men record an oath at 
     <lb/>
     ten o'clock at night which they violated the 
     <lb/>
     very next day—among those, I say, the breach 
     <lb/>
     of faith, of which the Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral West has just given so sad an example 
     <lb/>
     to this House, will excite no surprise, for 
     <lb/>
     those gentlemen have long accustomed us to 
     <lb/>
     such unworthy actions on the part of a Min<lb break="no"/>istry which has lost all sense of honor and of 
     <lb/>
     the respect which they owe to the House. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is evident, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     that the Government is afraid of amendments 
     <lb/>
     which might be proposed by the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     to their scheme, and of the vote which would 
     <lb/>
     be taken on those amendments; discussion 
     <lb/>
     alarms them, and the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     for Lower Canada dreads nothing so much 
     <lb/>
    as an appeal to the people, notwithstanding. 
     <lb/>that he would appear to hold in contempt the 
     <lb/>protests which come to us in the shape of 
     <lb/>petitions from all the counties in the district 
     <lb/>of Montreal. (Hear, hear.) Yes, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, these numerous petitions prove to us that 
     <lb/>several honorable members of this House do 
     <lb/>not represent here the opinion of their con<lb break="no"/>stituents in respect of the new Constitution 
     <lb/>which it is wished to impose upon us. There 
     <lb/>are representatives here who are ready to vote 
     <lb/>in favor of the scheme of Confederation in 
     <lb/>spite of earnest protestations from the coun<lb break="no"/>ties for which they were elected. I shall con<lb break="no"/>tent myself with mentioning a single one—I 
     <lb/>allude to the honorable member for St. Hya<lb break="no"/>cinthe. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, that honorable 
     <lb/>member has declared that he will vote against 
     <lb/>the appeal to the people, and in favor of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, notwithstanding that out of two 
     <lb/>thousand inhabitants whom he represents, or 
     <lb/>rather does not represent, in this House, 
     <lb/>seventeen hundred have formally enjoined

     <lb/>
     now going on in Lower Canada alarms the 
     <lb/>
     Ministry, and that if the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     representatives obey the popular voice, and do 
     <lb/>
     not disregard it as some of them appear dis<lb break="no"/>posed to do, they will vote against the motion 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     or Upper Canada; for if those honorable 
     <lb/>
     members support this motion, they will simply 
     <lb/>
     declare that they do not wish for amendments 
     <lb/>
     to the scheme, that they are opposed to an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people and to any alteration  
     <lb/>
     whatever of the scheme. The other night 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Montmorency de<lb break="no"/>clared in this House that this signified nothing; 
     <lb/>
     that a representative was not bound to respect 
     <lb/>
     the wishes of his constituents, and that we 
     <lb/>
     were at perfect liberty to vote as we might 
     <lb/>
     think fit on any measure whatsoever, and espe<lb break="no"/>cially on the scheme of Confederation. At all 
     <lb/>
     events, Mr. SPEAKER, I shall venture to hold 
     <lb/>
     a different opinion from that of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member, and I say that every man who shews 
     <lb/>
     a proper respect for his position in this House 
     <lb/>
     cannot vote contrary to the expressed wishes 
     <lb/>
     of his constituents; it is a doctrine which was 
     <lb/>
     never called in question until the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Montmorency considered that he 
     <lb/>
     might cast a doubt upon the correctness of it. 
     <lb/>
     Well, a fact that none will venture to deny is, 
     <lb/>
     that several members promised their consti<lb break="no"/>tuents that they would vote in favor of an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people ; and, by compelling them 
     <lb/>
     to-day to accept the motion of the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General for Upper Canada, every 
     <lb/>
     chance of their doing so is taken away. 
     <lb/>
     Placed as the are in this dilemma, the mem<lb break="no"/>bers who made that promise, and who at the 
     <lb/>
     same time are in favor of the Government, 
     <lb/>
     ought not to hesitate as to the course to be 
     <lb/>
     pursued ; they ought to throw out this motion, 
     <lb/>
     for, if it should be adopted, Confederation will 
     <lb/>
     at once become an accomplished fact, and the 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people will have to be given up. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The Honorable Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General for Lower Canada has reproached the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition with pressing the adjournment of 
     <lb/>
     the House at ten, and half-past ten o'clock at 
     <lb/>
     night ; but let him remember that he himself 
     <lb/>
     pressed an adjournment at the same hour, in 
     <lb/>
    order to give his colleague, the honorable 
     <lb/>

     member for Dorchester, an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     speaking on the following evening. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—I moved 
     <lb/>
     the adjournment at a later hour of the even<lb break="no"/>ing; the clock on your side marked a later 
     <lb/>
     hour than half-past ten. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAFR1">Hon. Mr. LAFRAMBOISE</persName>—Well, I can 
     <lb/>
     say that the Ministerial clock shewed the hour 
     <lb/>
     which I have mentioned, and the two clocks 
     <lb/>
     generally agree, better than we agree our<lb break="no"/>selves. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) In con<lb break="no"/>clusion, Mr. SPEAKER, I have no hesitation 
     <lb/>
     in saying that our parliamentary history shews 
     <lb/>
     no precedent for so unworthy a proceeding as 
     <lb/>
     the present. I say that it is the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     Government to send their measure to England 
     <lb/>
     to receive the Imperial sanction before the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country have had time to judge 
     <lb/>
     of it, and before their representatives have 
     <lb/>
     had an opportunity of amending it in any 
     <lb/>
     way whatever. This measure, or this new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, after it shall have so received 
     <lb/>
     the sanction of the Imperial Government, will 
     <lb/>
     have to be accepted by Lower Canada, whether 
     <lb/>
      it suits her or not. (Hear,. hear.) Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I venture to hope that greater in<lb break="no"/>dependence will be exhibited by our Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadian representatives than our Ministers 
     <lb/>
     are willing to believe will be exhibited, and 
     <lb/>
     that our Lower Canadian members will not 
     <lb/>
     consent to allow themselves to be so led by 
     <lb/>
     the nose by their leaders. We were promised, 
     <lb/>
     at the commencement of this debate, that all 
     <lb/>
     the members should have an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     expressing their views on the scheme, and of 
     <lb/>
     making amendments to it, should they think 
     <lb/>
    proper to do so; and now, treading all their 
     <lb/>promises under foot, the Ministry thus lays 
     <lb/>its ultimatum before us: you must adopt the 
     <lb/>scheme which we submit to you, without 
     <lb/>attempting to change a single iota. For my 
     <lb/>part, Mr. SPEAKER, I consider that I should 
     <lb/>be failing in the performance of my duty as a 
     <lb/>representative if I did not record my protest 
     <lb/>against such conduct, and such scandalous 
     <lb/>neglect of all the principles of responsible 
     <lb/>government. (Applause.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I very much re<lb break="no"/>gret that I find it necessary to detain the 
     <lb/>House, even for a few moments, for a second 
     <lb/>time on the same day, on the same subject; 
     <lb/>but I desire to repel, in the strongest manner, 
     <lb/>the insinuation that the Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral West has cast on those hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>who are opposed to the Confederation scheme 
     <lb/>—the charge that we are either actuated by 
     <lb/>feelings tending towards the annexation of 
     <lb/>Canada to the neighboring republic, or else 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     that we desire to offer factions opposition, and 
     <lb/>
     that we have no good motive in seeking for 
     <lb/>
     delay with reference to the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     this question. Now, speaking for myself, I 
     <lb/>
     must say that I do not believe that there is 
     <lb/>
     an honorable gentleman on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House, or even within the length and breadth 
     <lb/>
     of British North America, who would less de<lb break="no"/>sire to see any change in the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     relations existing between these provinces and 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country than myself. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) In my opposition to the scheme I am 
     <lb/>
     actuated by a feeling, that adopting it in the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which it is now proposed to be 
     <lb/>
     done will tend more to drive us towards that 
     <lb/>
     annexation, which is held up as such a bug<lb break="no"/>bear, than anything that could he done by 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen on the Treasury benches 
     <lb/>
     in half a century, if our Constitution were al<lb break="no"/>lowed to remain as it is. (Hear, hear.) Then, 
     <lb/>
     as to our being called obstructionists, I would 
     <lb/>
     call your attention, Mr. SPEAKER, to the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances surrounding this debate. In the 
     <lb/>
     first instance, as has been represented by 
     <lb/>
     several honorable members, it was proposed 
     <lb/>
     that the matter should be considered as if in 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole; but for purposes of 
     <lb/>
    preserving order and convenience for transact<lb break="no"/>ing other business, that the Speaker should 
     <lb/>remain in the chair. Though the Hon. 
     <lb/>Attorney General West does not consider that 
     <lb/>proposition in the same light as it was under<lb break="no"/>stood on this side of the House, and by myself, 
     <lb/>yet I am satisfied that the intention of hon. 
     <lb/>gentlemen in proposing it, was that the debate 
     <lb/>should go on in same free and unrestrained 
     <lb/>manner, due order being preserved, as if the 
     <lb/>Speaker was not in the chair. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Hon. gentlemen on the Treasury benches 
     <lb/>then proposed that they should have the 
     <lb/>opportunity of laying the scheme before the 
     <lb/>House and the country in as full and care<lb break="no"/>ful a manner as they pleased—that they were to 
     <lb/>take their own time to do this, and were to be 
     <lb/>allowed to speak without any interruption. 
     <lb/>That privilege was accorded to them most 
     <lb/>heartily and cordially by the Opposition. 
     <lb/>There was no interruption whatever from this 
     <lb/>side of the House during the whole of their 
     <lb/>five long speeches. (Hear, hear.) But the 
     <lb/>very moment they had accomplished  their 
     <lb/>object, and we desired to have exactly  the 
     <lb/>same opportunity—that of laying our views 
     <lb/>before the House and the country in the same 
     <lb/>manner, and letting them follow the speeches 
     <lb/>of the honorable gentlemen on the Treasury 
     <lb/>benches in proper order—they objected in the 
     <lb/>most arbitrary manner. The Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="745" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0745.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">745</fw>
          

     General East claimed the right to reply at 
     <lb/>
     once to every speech delivered on this side of 
     <lb/>
     the House. (Hear, hear.) Then again a 
     <lb/>
     motion was made by the Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral West that until disposed of, the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of this question should be taken 
     <lb/>
     up every evening at half-past seven o'clock, 
     <lb/>
     and that was at once concurred in on our 
     <lb/>
    part. In a very short time afterwards it was 
     <lb/>proposed, and the proposition was endorsed 
     <lb/>and pressed by the Government, that this 
     <lb/>solemn agreement should be broken up, and 
     <lb/>the whole business of the country on the floor 
     <lb/>of this House suspended until the debate 
     <lb/>should be brought to a close. In reference to 
     <lb/>that, I did oppose the course pursued, because 
     <lb/>I did not think it was for the interest of the 
     <lb/>country, or that it would facilitate the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of this House. We find that several 
     <lb/>days were occupied in discussing whether that 
     <lb/>resolution should be adopted from day to 
     <lb/>day or not. Who is responsible for that 
     <lb/>discussion and delay ? Was it hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>on this side of the House, who desired to 
     <lb/> carry out the arrangement proposed by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment themselves, or was it the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the Treasury benches, who sought to 
     <lb/>break up the agreement that had been entered 
     <lb/>into, of which they themselves were the 
     <lb/>authors ? (Hear, hear.) I have also, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, in this connection, to make my 
     <lb/>acknowledgments to the Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral West for the very elegant compliment he 
     <lb/>paid the honorable member for Peel and my<lb break="no"/>self, in characterising us as the " shanghais " 
     <lb/>from their, the Ministerial side of the House 
     <lb/>(hear, hear, and laughter)—but though he 
     <lb/>did give us the credit of being the only ones 
     <lb/>that had laid eggs that amounted to anything, 
     <lb/>the others being all addled, he might have re<lb break="no"/>flected a little, and in doing so have found 
     <lb/>that the that these " shanghais " had 
     <lb/>laid will produce birds that in all probability 
     <lb/>will cut the combs of honorable gentlemen on 
     <lb/>that side of the House. (Laughter.) The 
     <lb/>hot haste with which those honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men are proceeding with this measure is fos<lb break="no"/>tering and providing that heat that will 
     <lb/>bring into vitality and life those very eggs 
     <lb/>that they referred to; and when the country 
     <lb/>understands the character of the brood which 
     <lb/>is produced by those eggs, honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men will find that they have been counting 
     <lb/>without their host in hatching them. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.)<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName>—Counting their chickens 
     <lb/>
     before they are hatched. (Laughter.) 
            </p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—Exactly; count<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
         
ing the chickens before they are hatched. 
     <lb/>
     Honorable gentlemen parade before this House 
     <lb/>
     an indefinable something that they are careful 
     <lb/>
     to keep in the background, which they seem 
     <lb/>
     to intimate, if they were only to divulge, 
     <lb/>
     would bring almost every member of the 
     <lb/>
     House around to their view of the question 
     <lb/>
     at once.  Mr. SPEAKER, if there is any in<lb break="no"/>formation of that kind in their possession, we 
     <lb/>
     should know what it is. (Hear, hear.) If 
     <lb/>
     we have a herculean labor before us to meet 
     <lb/>
     some approaching difficulty, this House should 
     <lb/>
     know what that labor and that difficulty is, 
     <lb/>
     that we may prepare to meet it as speedily 
     <lb/>
     and as bravely as possible. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I do not find that the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     are making any preparations for meeting the 
     <lb/>
     lack of defence under which they say the 
     <lb/>
     country exists, between the present time and 
     <lb/>
     the assembling of this House in the summer. 
     <lb/>
     And yet they bring the matter up to frighten 
     <lb/>
     the House into submission to their views. 
     <lb/>
     They have a puppet from which, by keeping 
     <lb/>
     it sufficiently behind the screens, they throw 
     <lb/>
     a distorted shadow upon the wall and tell us 
     <lb/>
     to look at the giant; but when the shadow is 
     <lb/>
     traced to its origin, it will be found, I appre<lb break="no"/>hend, to be nothing but a puppet after all. 
     <lb/>
     If they were to come out boldly and give this 
     <lb/>
     House all the information of which they boast 
     <lb/>
     the possession, I am very much mistaken if 
     <lb/>
     the mystery would not turn out to be a mere 
     <lb/>
     scarecrow. They make a great cackling about 
     <lb/>
     the hawk, and then when the whole brood of 
     <lb/>
     chickens is gathered under their wings, it turns 
     <lb/>
     out that the source of their pretended fright 
     <lb/>
     is nothing but a harmless dove after all. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) Honorable gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches are constantly endeavoring 
     <lb/>to lead us to suppose that there is imminent 
     <lb/>danger of a war with the United States, and 
     <lb/>yet each honorable member, as he rises, de<lb break="no"/>clares that for himself he has no apprehension 
     <lb/>of anything of that kind. They  ought to 
     <lb/>consider that if there is any ground for ap<lb break="no"/>prehension, if there is any danger of the 
     <lb/>United States attacking Canada and getting 
     <lb/>into a war with England, such a war will be 
     <lb/>upon us almost immediately. When the nation 
     <lb/>emerges from the strife in which it is at 
     <lb/>present engaged, they will have learned a costly 
     <lb/>lesson of the horrors of war and the financial 
     <lb/>burdens it imposes; and I am satisfied that 
     <lb/>so intelligent a people as they are universally 
     <lb/>admitted to be, will not rush into a contest 
     <lb/>with a power like that of England, unless they  
     <lb/>do so while smarting under wrongs they im<lb break="no"/>agine they have suffered at the hands of Eng<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="746" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0746.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">746</fw>
       

     land in connection with the war in which 
     <lb/>
     they are now engaged. After they have had 
     <lb/>
     time to reflect and to sit down and count the 
     <lb/>
     cost of the strife through which they will 
     <lb/>
     have passed, in treasure and blood and intel<lb break="no"/>lect, and their national wounds have had time 
     <lb/>
     to stiffen, there will be little danger of their 
     <lb/>
     again rushing into another similarly disastrous 
     <lb/>
     contest. I heard a gentleman describing this 
     <lb/>
     matter a short time ago, by an illustration which 
     <lb/>
     I will here repeat. His position was that the 
     <lb/>
     respective probabilities of a war with the 
     <lb/>
     United States, at an early or a remote period, 
     <lb/>
     might be learned from what is often seen 
     <lb/>
     when two men have been engaged in a round 
     <lb/>
     of fisticuffs. They pummell and bruise each 
     <lb/>
     other in the most shocking manner; and while 
     <lb/>
     the wounds they have received at each other's 
     <lb/>
     hands are fresh, while their blood is up, and 
     <lb/>
     while they are smarting under their injuries, 
     <lb/>
     if a bystander interferes with either of them, 
     <lb/>
     even sometimes by a little wholesome, well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     meant advice, the wounded man will be ready 
     <lb/>
     to pitch into him at once, almost without 
     <lb/>
     thought of the odds that may exist against 
     <lb/>
     him. But after such an individual cools off 
     <lb/>
     and his wounds become stiff and sore, and he 
     <lb/>
     gets time for reflection, he has no desire what<lb break="no"/>ever to enter into a contest. And so, I appre<lb break="no"/>hend, will it be with our neighbors on the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the line. When they get cooled 
     <lb/>
     down after the present contest, return to their 
     <lb/>
     almost desolated homes again, and see the 
     <lb/>
     vacancies that have been caused, and when 
     <lb/>
     their leaders count up the millions upon 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars that their present war will 
     <lb/>
     have cost them, and the claims that will 
     <lb/>
     be made upon them for compensation, war 
     <lb/>
     losses, and numerous other matters, they will 
     <lb/>
     feel a very great aversion to entering upon 
     <lb/>
     hostilities which will bring down upon them 
     <lb/>
     the whole power of England. Therefore I 
     <lb/>
     hold that if we are going to expend money in 
     <lb/>
     defences, it ought to be done without a day's 
     <lb/>
     unnecessary delay. And yet hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     propose to delay submitting a measure for 
     <lb/>
     the consideration of the House until another 
     <lb/>
     session. They will prorogue this session 
     <lb/>
     without making any appropriation for de<lb break="no"/>fence, and go home to England to push 
     <lb/>
     through a scheme which there is now no 
     <lb/>
     object in hurrying forward. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Hon. gentlemen on this side of the House 
     <lb/>
     are not actuated in their opposition to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme by any desire to occupy the place of 
     <lb/>
     any one of the hon. gentlemen on the Trea<lb break="no"/>sury benches, but their object is to protect 
     <lb/>
     the interests of the people, on whose behalf 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     they have been sent to this House, and on 
     <lb/>
     their behalf to see that we have a government 
     <lb/>
     carried on upon economical principles, so that 
     <lb/>
     the peole may be led to respect and sustain 
     <lb/>
     it. (Hear, hear.) But if we have a govern<lb break="no"/>ment that is extravagant in their ideas, how 
     <lb/>
     can we expect the people to respect that 
     <lb/>
     government? And what is there so well cal<lb break="no"/>culated to place this country on the inclined 
     <lb/>
     plane to slide into the American Union—so 
     <lb/>
     graphically described by the head of the 
     <lb/>
    Government in the Upper House—as extrav<lb break="no"/>agance on the part of our Government? If 
     <lb/>we have to spend the sum that the commis<lb break="no"/>sion has recommended in erecting works of 
     <lb/>defence, and then provide corresponding forces 
     <lb/>of men and equipments, the expense will be 
     <lb/>monstrous. And yet, forsooth, because we 
     <lb/>ask for information, and object to the coersion 
     <lb/>they have attempted, they charge us with 
     <lb/>being obstructionists. Do they mean to say 
     <lb/>that it is factious conduct for the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people to demand that they 
     <lb/>be consulted before their very Constitution is 
     <lb/>trampled upon and another forced upon them? 
     <lb/>Canada is by far the most numerously popu<lb break="no"/>lated, most wealthy a d most important of 
     <lb/>all the colonies to be affected by the change, 
     <lb/>and yet the people of this province are the 
     <lb/>only people that are to have no opportunity 
     <lb/>of saying whether the change is acceptable or 
     <lb/>not, nor are their representatives in Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to have even the opportunity of moving 
     <lb/>a single amendment to it. (Hear, hear.) If 
     <lb/>opposition to that kind of thing entitles me 
     <lb/>to the epithet of obstructionist, then I glory 
     <lb/>in the name of an obstructionist. (Applause.) 
     <lb/>I shall vote against the motion that has been  
     <lb/>made by my hon. friend the Hon. Atty. Gen. 
     <lb/>West, and again express my sincere regret 
     <lb/>that he should have been induced to bring in  
     <lb/>such a motion, calculated, as it is, to stifle 
     <lb/>the proper and ordinary expression <choice><sic>o</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> this 
     <lb/>House. To tell us that we may discuss the  
     <lb/>question as much as we please is most gratu 
     <lb/>itous, and is nothing but a sham, alongside of 
     <lb/>the fact that the motion shuts us off from  
     <lb/>bringing forward any amendments, or placing 
     <lb/>our views upon the subject upon the records 
     <lb/>of the House. How often have hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men on that side of the House told us that if 
     <lb/>we were not prepared to accept the measure, 
     <lb/>we ought to prepared to propose a better 
     <lb/>one? But no sooner do we give notice of 
     <lb/>what we consider a better one, than we are 
     <lb/>virtually gagged, and told that we shall not  
     <lb/>have the opportunity of even proposing then 
     <lb/>to the House. If that is the way that a free

     <lb/>
     soon find out that they are on the wrong 
     <lb/>
     track; and when Parliament is again sum<lb break="no"/>moned, they will be met by a voice from the 
     <lb/>
     people that will show them that they have 
     <lb/>
     adopted a course that will consign names that 
     <lb/>
     have heretofore been honorable, to political 
     <lb/>
     oblivion, on account of this outrage upon the 
     <lb/>rights and liberties of a free people, and it<lb/>will be an oblivion that will be richly mer<lb break="no"/>ited. (Loud Cheers.)<lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName> said :—The resolu<lb break="no"/>tions under debate, involving as they do an 
     <lb/>
     entire change in the Constitution of this 
     <lb/>
     country, I regard as of greater importance 
     <lb/>
     than any question that has been debated 
     <lb/>
     before this House since the union. So 
     <lb/>
     sweeping a change seldom takes place except 
     <lb/>
     after war or insurrection. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But we have had neither war nor insurrec<lb break="no"/>tion—(hear)—we have enjoyed a very long 
     <lb/>
     season of peace and quietness, and at no 
     <lb/>
     time has there been an agitation among the 
     <lb/>
     people for such a change as that now pro<lb break="no"/>posed. I believe this scheme to have been 
     <lb/>
     undertaken mainly because the leaders of 
     <lb/>
     the two political parties saw that they had 
     <lb/>
     no hope left of continuing in office on the 
     <lb/>
     one hand, or getting into office on the other, 
     <lb/>
     while they fought against each other. I 
     <lb/>
     have heard it asserted in this House and 
     <lb/>
     out of this House, that so grave had become 
     <lb/>
     the position of public affairs, that all gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had become impossible, and that 
     <lb/>the gravity of the occasion required that 
     <lb/>men of all parties should unite to find a 
     <lb/>solution of existing difficulties. I hope this 
     <lb/>was not a mere pretence, put forward by 
     <lb/>men in office to continue in office, and by men 
     <lb/>out of office to get into office. It is a fact 
     <lb/>well known, that so long as either party 
     <lb/>could govern without the assistance of the 
     <lb/>other, no advance was made toward a union 
     <lb/>between the leaders. The changing of two 
     <lb/>or three votes in this House would have 
     <lb/>indefinitely postponed the scheme now under 
     <lb/>consideration. That there was no necessity 
     <lb/>occasioned by a dead-lock in carrying on the 
     <lb/>Government must be apparent, when we con<lb break="no"/>sider that political parties, by a little forbear<lb break="no"/>ance, would have avoided the dead-lock. 
     <lb/>Surely, if parties could unite as they did in 
     <lb/>June last, they could have united to prevent 
     <lb/>the difliculty complained of, and have put 
     <lb/>off the evil day perhaps forever, without 
     <lb/>entering upon a scheme to subvert the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. If a dead-lock existed, it ought 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
          

     to be attributed rather to the contention of 
     <lb/>
     parties than to any defect in our form of 
     <lb/>
     government. (Hear, hear.) The union be<lb break="no"/>tween the Cauadas took place in 1840; 
     <lb/>
     for some time afterwards each section was 
     <lb/>
     represented in the united Legislature by 
     <lb/>
     forty-two members. Upper Canada at the 
     <lb/>
     time of the union had a population of 
     <lb/>
     486,000, and Lower Canada 661,000. After 
     <lb/>
     the union took place, from 1844 to 1848, 
     <lb/>
     the majority of the Government was a very 
     <lb/>
     narrow one. The Government was kept in 
     <lb/>
     power by two or three votes; yet during 
     <lb/>
     these years there was not a suggestion in 
     <lb/>
     favor of a change of Constitution for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of increasing the majority. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The same number of members con<lb break="no"/>tinued to represent each section of the 
     <lb/>
     province until 1854, when the number from 
     <lb/>
     each section was increased to sixty-five, and 
     <lb/>
     has continued so to the present time. From 
     <lb/>
     the year 1854 until the present time, there 
     <lb/>
     has existed among the people of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada a strong agitation in favor of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation according to population. That 
     <lb/>
     principle was agitated by the Reform party 
     <lb/>
     at every election. It was the principal 
     <lb/>
     political topic, and members were required 
     <lb/>
     to pledge themselves to maintain it under 
     <lb/>
     all circumstances upon the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House. And not only was the Reform party 
     <lb/>
     committed to that principle, but many Con<lb break="no"/>servatives were forced to declare themselves 
     <lb/>
     in favor of it. In 1858 some of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Government sent an offical 
     <lb/>
     letter to England, in which the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     of the country were graphically referred to, 
     <lb/>
     and the agitation was characterized as being 
     <lb/>
    fraught with great danger to the peaceful 
     <lb/>and harmonious working of our constitutional 
     <lb/>system, and consequently detrimental to the 
     <lb/>progress of the province. This document 
     <lb/>was laid before Parliament in February, 
     <lb/>1859, and in November of the same year 
     <lb/>the Toronto Convention met, where the 
     <lb/>Reform party was represented by about 570 
     <lb/>prominent gentlemen from all parts of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada. At that meeting the griev<lb break="no"/>ances of which Upper Canada complained 
     <lb/>were discussed in an able manner by gentle<lb break="no"/>men fully acquainted with them, and capable 
     <lb/>of setting them forth. Although the project 
     <lb/>of a Federal union of the provinces had been 
     <lb/>brought before Parliament and the country 
     <lb/>in February, and the Convention met in 
     <lb/>November, and ample time was given for its 
     <lb/>agitation, we find that the Convention did 
     <lb/>

     not consider that it afforded a proper remedy 
     <lb/>
     for the evils that existed in Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The resolutions passed by that Convention 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the grievances of Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     the proper remedy for them, were as follow :—

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     <lb/>
     to realize the anticipations of its promoters, has 
     <lb/>
     resulted in a heavy public debt, burdensome taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. great political abuses. and universal dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction through Upper Canada, and it is the

     <lb/>
     with advantage to the people.

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     So much for the grievances.

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     No. 5.—Resolved, That in the opinion of this 
     <lb/>
    assembly the best practical remedy for the evils 
     <lb/>now encountered in the government of Canada, 
     <lb/>is to be found in the formation of two or more 
     <lb/>local governments, to which shall be committed 
     <lb/>the control of all matters of a local and sectional 
     <lb/>character, and some joint authority charged with 
     <lb/>such matters as are necessary, common to both 
     <lb/>sections of the province.

            </p></quote>

            <p>Such was the remedy. The 4th resolution 
     <lb/>shows that the Federation of the provinces 
     <lb/>was not entertained as a remedy for the 
     <lb/>evils complained of by the Convention, for 
     <lb/>it resolved :—

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     That without entering on the discussion 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     opinion that the delay which must occur in ob<lb break="no"/>taining the sanction of the Lower Provinces to 
     <lb/>
     a Federal union of all the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Colonies, places that measure beyond con<lb break="no"/>sideration as a remedy for present evils.

            </p></quote>


            <p>
     Now, if it had been the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Upper Canada. as represented in 
     <lb/>
     that Convention, that a Federal union with 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces would prove a remedy 
     <lb/>
     for the grievances they were laboring under, 
     <lb/>
     they would have taken it into consideration. 
     <lb/>
     Either it did not suit the leaders of the Re<lb break="no"/>form party at that time to take up that plan 
     <lb/>
     as it was brought forward by men opposed 
     <lb/>
     to them. or else they did not believed it the 
     <lb/>
     true remedy. If they had believed it the 
     <lb/>
     proper remedy, there was nothing to prevent 
     <lb/>
     them uniting with the Government to carry 
     <lb/>
     it out, with the cooperation of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces. The only drawback to the adop<lb break="no"/>tion of the scheme was the fact that its pro<lb break="no"/>posers were in office and likely to remain 
     <lb/>
     there. That to my mind is the only reason 
     <lb/>
     which can now be alleged for not taking it 
     <lb/>
     it up at that time. One ef the reasons 
     <lb/>
     assigned for calling that Convention together 
     <lb/>
     was. that although the population of Upper 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
        

     Canada was much larger than that of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and was constantly increasing, yet 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada found itself without power in 
     <lb/>
     the administration of the affairs of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince, (Hear, hear.) Another principal 
     <lb/>
     grievance under which Upper Canada labored 
     <lb/>
     was the unjust levying and distribution of the 
     <lb/>
     public moneys. It was contended that seventy 
     <lb/>
     per cent. of the annual taxation was collected 
     <lb/>
     from Upper Canada, and only thirty per 
     <lb/>
     cent. from Lower Canada ; on the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, when the money came to be expended, 
     <lb/>
     for every dollar that was expended in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, a dollar was also expended in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. And that appears to have been the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of prominent members of both poli<lb break="no"/>tical parties ; representation by population 
     <lb/>
     was demanded by the people of the western 
     <lb/>
     section as a cure for that state of things. 
     <lb/>
     They considered that if they were repre<lb break="no"/>sented in this House according to numbers, 
     <lb/>
     they would be able to prevent the unjust 
     <lb/>
     distribution of the public revenues of the 
     <lb/>
     province. Now, the great measure before 
     <lb/>
     this House has been considered by some as 
     <lb/>
     designed to create a nation, by others as a 
     <lb/>
     means of increasing largely the material and 
     <lb/>
     commercial interests of the country. I can<lb break="no"/>not see that the Federation of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     has anything of a national phase in it. For 
     <lb/>
     those who are dissatisfied with remaining as 
     <lb/>
     colonists of Great Britain, it may be very 
     <lb/>
     well to look forward to the creation of a 
     <lb/>
     nationality or state of national existence. 
     <lb/>
     When you speak of national existence, you 
     <lb/>
     speak of independence; and so long as we 
     <lb/>
     are colonists of Great Britain we can have 
     <lb/>
     no national existence. (Hear, hear.) In 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick this question has been treat<lb break="no"/>ed purely as a question of material interest 
     <lb/>
     to the people. — (Hear, hear.) In a work 
     <lb/>
     recently published by the Hon. Mr. CAU<lb break="no"/>CHON, I find the following statement of the 
     <lb/>
     way in which the question is treated in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick. The honorable gentleman says, 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     The only point for them to consider in making 
     <lb/>
     a selection would be the material question of 
     <lb/>
     profit or loss; more or less of trade, more or less 
     <lb/>
     of taxes. The truth of this is clearly shown by 
     <lb/>
     the project of Confederation itself, in which it 
     <lb/>
     will be seen that the exceptions affect only Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and in the speeches made by Mr. TILLEY, 
     <lb/>
     in New Brunswick, in which he states frankly and 
     <lb/>
     unequivocally, that with that province there can 
     <lb/>
     be but one paramount question in the discussion 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme, namely. that of pecuniary interest. 
     <lb/>
     Will New Brunswick, under the union, pay more 
     <lb/>
     or less, receive more or less; will the taxes im<lb break="no"/>

     posed, under the union, be more or less than they 
     <lb/>
     now are? The question has been thus received 
     <lb/>
     by the press and public men of that province, 
     <lb/>
     and they have so discussed it, with a view to ac<lb break="no"/>cept or reject it. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     To my mind, that is the way in which the 
     <lb/>
     question ought to be treated in this province. 
     <lb/>
     As a national matter it ought not to be con<lb break="no"/>sidered at all. The true question is, whether 
     <lb/>
     the people of this province will be called 
     <lb/>
     upon to pay more or less taxes, and enjoy 
     <lb/>
     more or less prosperity. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     agitation in connection with representation 
     <lb/>
     by population has continued during the past 
     <lb/>
     ten years. Going back to the time of the 
     <lb/>
     defeat of the CARTIER-MACDONALD Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, we find that that Administra<lb break="no"/>tion had considered it an open question. 
     <lb/>
     The MACDONALD-SICOTTE Administration, 
     <lb/>
     which succeeded, resolved to treat it as a 
     <lb/>
     close question. They agreed to leave it in 
     <lb/>
     abeyance, but I never understood that their 
     <lb/>
     supporters from Upper Canada agreed to 
     <lb/>
     abandon it. It was stated distinctly at the time 
     <lb/>
     of the formation of that Government, that any 
     <lb/>
     abandonment of the question was a matter 
     <lb/>
     altogether with the Government, and was not 
     <lb/>
     binding upon their supporters. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     That government adopted what was called 
     <lb/>
     the double-majority principle, but I never 
     <lb/>
     understood that a majority of their supporters 
     <lb/>
     from Upper Canada agreed to accept it as a 
     <lb/>
     basis, or a means of securing the settlement 
     <lb/>
     of the grievances of Upper Canada. What 
     <lb/>
     the Upper Canada Reform party agreed to 
     <lb/>
     was, that as there was great corruption and 
     <lb/>
     extravagance in the administration of the 
     <lb/>
     finances of this country, for the sake of 
     <lb/>
     securing administrative reform they would 
     <lb/>
     allow the question of representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation to remain in abeyance for a time. 
     <lb/>
     However, the double majority principle 
     <lb/>
     would not work. (Hear, hear.) The MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD-SICOTTE Government were defeated, 
     <lb/>
     and the MACDONALD-DORION Government 
     <lb/>
     was formed. They treated the question in 
     <lb/>
     the same way as the CARTIER-MACDONALD 
     <lb/>
     did—left it an open question. While that 
     <lb/>
     government continued in office, there was no 
     <lb/>
     special agitation for representation according 
     <lb/>
     to population, although in the House it was 
     <lb/>
     very generally supported by members from

     Upper Canada. That government resigned, 
     <lb/>
     a new government was formed, and, during 
     <lb/>
     the period of that new government's exist<lb break="no"/>ence, the hon. member for South Oxford had

     his committee appointed to take into consid<lb break="no"/>

     eration the representation question. That 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     consideration for a long time. They made 
     <lb/>
     a report the same day the Government was 
     <lb/>
     defeated, but came to no conclusion what<lb break="no"/>ever, except in the general statement that 
     <lb/>
     most of its members looked in the direction 
     <lb/>
     of a Federal Government. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     This government was defeated on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the $100,000 paid to the city of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal. That vote took place on the 14th 
     <lb/>

     There was never a vote aimed more distinctly 
     <lb/>
     than that at the Honorable the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance; it was declared by a majority of 
     <lb/>
     this House that he was the means of the loss 
     <lb/>
     of this $100,000 to the country. The majo<lb break="no"/>rity voted in that way, and affirmed that 
     <lb/>
     resolution. The moment it was passed a 
     <lb/>
     Ministerial crisis occurred, and it was under<lb break="no"/>stood that the Ministry had the sanction of 
     <lb/>
     the Governor General to dissolve the House ; 
     <lb/>
     within a few days, some of the very men who 
     <lb/>
     condemned the Minister of Finance were 
     <lb/>
     willing to overlook his offence, to treat the 
     <lb/>
     vote of the House as of no consequence 
     <lb/>
     whatever, and to become colleagues of that 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman in the Government. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) Thus the present Coalition was 
     <lb/>
     formed with its policy of Confederation. I 
     <lb/>
     believe that the agitation for representation 
     <lb/>
     by population had been less active for three 
     <lb/>
     years preceding the foruation of that gov<lb break="no"/>ernment than at any time during the last 
     <lb/>
     ten years ; but the mere fact of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment being defeated seemed to be a suflicient 
     <lb/>
     excuse for these honorable gentlemen to join 
     <lb/>
     men to whom they had been opposed for 
     <lb/>
     years, and to come down to this House with 
     <lb/>
     a proposal for a Confederation of the provin<lb break="no"/>ces. For my own part, I am not opposed 
     <lb/>
     to a Confederation of these provinces, on a 
     <lb/>
     proper basis, although I would rather have 
     <lb/>
     seen a legislative union of them preferred. 
     <lb/>
     I have no sympathy with those members in 
     <lb/>
     their opposition to the scheme, who, while 
     <lb/>
     opposing it, are equally opposed to legisla<lb break="no"/>tive union and representation by population. 
     <lb/>
     I think, from the increase of population in 
     <lb/>

     Upper Canada, that some change is neces<lb break="no"/>sary; and I cannot understand how hon. 
     <lb/>
     members, who are opposed to this scheme 
     <lb/>
     and also to a legislative union, and to any 
     <lb/>
     change in representation, can expect sym<lb break="no"/>pathy from Upper Canadian members. It 
     <lb/>
     is not the principle of the scheme that I 
     <lb/>
     object to. My objections I will state. Part 
     <lb/>
     of the new Constitution proposes the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Intercolonial Railway. 
     <lb/>
     Now, when that question was first brought 
     <lb/>
     up in 1862, I was opposed to it. When 
     <lb/>
     it was first announced as the intention 
     <lb/>
     of the MACDONALD—SICOTTE Government 
     <lb/>
    to undertake the building of that road, 
     <lb/>I expressed myself as decidedly in opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to it, on the very first opportunity that 
     <lb/>offered, and I have never since seen any 
     <lb/>reason to change the position I then took. 
     <lb/>In connection with this subject, I beg leave 
     <lb/>to cite the opinions of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>South Oxford, as then expressed. I do not 
     <lb/>do so in order to show that he has changed 
     <lb/>his mind with regard to this road, for I 
     <lb/>believe he does not conceal the fact himself. 
     <lb/>I make this citation to show not only what 
     <lb/>his views were, but what were the views, I 
     <lb/>believe, of the majority of the peeple of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada at that time, views which in 
     <lb/>my opinion they still entertain. It is stated 
     <lb/>that the road ought to be built becauuse 
     <lb/>it is necessary for the military defence 
     <lb/>of the country. It is stated that it ought 
     <lb/>to follow the longest route, because the 
     <lb/>shorter one will bring it too near the 
     <lb/>boundary line of the State of Maine. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) When it is considered that 
     <lb/>this road will unite with the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>at Rivièra du Loup, and that the Grand 
     <lb/>Trunk is at places within twenty-six miles 
     <lb/>of the boundary of Maine, I think that 
     <lb/>the amount it will contribute to the military 
     <lb/>defence is of very little value. It is ridiculous 
     <lb/>to suppose that the Americans would not be 
     <lb/>able to cut a railway only twenty-six miles 
     <lb/>from their territory. If we are not strong 
     <lb/>enough to hold and protect the road which 
     <lb/>runs through Maine, the Intercolonial would 
     <lb/>be of very little importance or use. The 
     <lb/>opinion expressed in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> about this 
     <lb/>railway as a work of military defence was 
     <lb/>this—I quote from the issue of the 18th 
     <lb/>September, 1862 :—

     not be worth much, we are prepared to adduce 
     <lb/>
     corroborative testimony in its support.

     On the whole we are inclined to think that

     until our military frontier is rectified, the con<lb break="no"/>struction of a railway between St. John and the 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence would, as far as military operations

     are concerned, be money thrown away. If the

     That was the Opinion, I believe. of the

     majority of the people of Upper Canada at 
     <lb/>
     that time, that as a military defence this 
     <lb/>
     road would be completely useless. But we 
     <lb/>
     find that the proposition to build the road 
     <lb/>
     is inserted in one of these resolutions, the

     68th, in the following terms :—

     According to these resolutions the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Intercolonial Railway is 
     <lb/>
     made a part of the Constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     country, and the road will have to be built. 
     <lb/>
     On the other hand the enlargement of the

     <lb/>
     whether the finances of the country will

     permit of the performance of these works. 
     <lb/>
     Now, the opening up of the North-West is 
     <lb/>
     a subject that has engaged the serious atten<lb break="no"/>tion of many people in Upper Canada. By 
     <lb/>
     a large majority of the population it is con<lb break="no"/>sidered as most important for the intrest of

     of this country that that territory should be

     The whole country is more or less adapted to

     in the month of August over the greater part of

     that country. We had to wade as it were knee

     an oxen as fat as any I ever found on the best

<p>
     Well, sir, we find that some of these articles 
     <lb/>
     have been taxed to an amount equal to one— 
     <lb/>
     half their value. The person who buys and 
     <lb/>
     pays 50 per cent. duty, gets in fact in value 
     <lb/>
     only one-half of the money paid. With the 
     <lb/>
     duty derived from these articles it is proposed 
     <lb/>
     by this scheme to do, what? Why to spend 
     <lb/>
     $20,000,000 on this railway, and that money 
     <lb/>
     will have to be raised some way or other out 
     <lb/>
     of the earnings of the people. I will cite 
     <lb/>
     another extract from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> with respect 
     <lb/>
     to the paying or supposed paying qualities of 
     <lb/>
     this road. On the 23rd of September, 1862, 
     <lb/>
     it said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The scheme of the Government for the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Intercolonial Railway opens an 
     <lb/>
     account that never will be closed; every storm of 
     <lb/>
     snow in the inhospitable regions below Riviere 
     <lb/>
     du Loup will lay a new burden on the people of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada. The tax-payers will watch the 
     <lb/>
    passenger travel and freight traffic with the live<lb break="no"/>liest interest, as indicating the extent of the de<lb break="no"/>mands upon them for the year. The road will be 
     <lb/>run with a perfect consciousness that there is a 
     <lb/>prompt paymaster behind. With all the care that 
     <lb/>public companies can employ, the expenditures 
     <lb/>upon the small items connected with the running 
     <lb/>of a railroad is above all things difficult to con<lb break="no"/>trol ; but what sums will be spent when it is the 
     <lb/>Government that will manage and the people of 
     <lb/>the province that will pay? It was bad enough 
     <lb/>when they consented that Canada should pay five- 
     <lb break="yes"/>twelfths of the expenditure, when in fact it will 
     <lb/>not receive one-twelfth of the benefit. Who can 
     <lb/>fail to see the hand of the Grand Trunk in 
     <lb/>this? It is the dream of many persons in Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia that this Halifax and Quebec Railway will 
     <lb/>draw to their harbor the trade of the West, but it 
     <lb/>is a dream and nothing more. No passenger, no 
     <lb/>shipper of freight, will ever think of going or 
     <lb/>sending to Halifax when he can find shipping at 
     <lb/>Quebec or Portland. He will not add the cost of 
     <lb/>seven hundred miles of railroad to the expenses of 
     <lb/>transit to benefit the people of Halifax. As to 
     <lb/>freight, the thing is not to be spoken of. Neither 
     <lb/>freight nor passengers would such a line draw 
     <lb/>from any point higher than Riviere du Loup. 
     <lb/>There is a refreshing coolness in the demand that 
     <lb/>Canada shall pay for the construction of a road 
     <lb/>which is professedly designed to draw away trade 
     <lb/>from its great estuary. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Is that not equally the case now as then? 
     <lb/>
     Who can fail to see the hand of the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk in this Confcderation scheme ?— 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) Again, with 
     <lb/>
     respect to this Intercolonial Railway, I find 
     <lb/>
     the following language used in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> on 
     <lb/>
     the 26th September, 1662 :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     With Upper Canada decidedly opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, and Lower Canada divided, we are happy 
     <lb/>
     to say that we do not see any great danger of 
     <lb/>
     hasty action. We are only astonished that the 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
    

         
     Ministry should have committed themselves to a 
     <lb/>
     scheme which finds so little support in any part 
     <lb/>
     of the province. The Lower Province delegates 
     <lb/>
     humbugged them beautifully. It is evident that 
     <lb/>
     Blue Nose is a sharp fellow. He is rubbed bright 
     <lb/>
     on his rocks. We shall have to be careful in our 
     <lb/>
     dealings with him. If Lower Canada is afraid of 
     <lb/>
     him because he is British, we must learn to watch 
     <lb/>
     him because he is not very rich but very keen and 
     <lb/>
     shrewd.

            <p>
     Well, it was supposed when the members 
     <lb/>
     of the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government 
     <lb/>
     were dealing with these men in 1862, that 
     <lb/>
     they were humbugged beautifully, but when 
     <lb/>
     we got the best men in the country, the 
     <lb/>
     ablest and most talented men, to deal with 
     <lb/>
     them, what kind of bargain did they make 
     <lb/>
     with these shrewd blue noses ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Why, instead of Canada paying what was 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, the Lower Provinces made a much 
     <lb/>
     more favorable bargain with the cleverest 
     <lb/>
     men we have. (Hear, hear.) I contend, sir, 
     <lb/>
     that this scheme, at one jump, proposes to 
     <lb/>
     increase the public debt twenty millions of 
     <lb/>
     dollars. And another thing stated is, that 
     <lb/>
     a sum necessary for the purpose will be 
     <lb/>
     expended for the defence of the country; 
     <lb/>
     and if we are to place any reliance upon the 
     <lb/>
     report of Col. JERVOIS, the sum of about six 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars will have to be expended 
     <lb/>
     upon the defences. From the reports which 
     <lb/>
     reached us to-day by telegraph, it appears 
     <lb/>
     that the Imperial Government will expend 
     <lb/>
     for our defence only the sum of £50,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     is mistaken. The Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West distinctly stated to-day that there was 
     <lb/>
     an error in the telegraphic report of the 
     <lb/>
     debate in the Imperial Parliament, and it is 
     <lb/>
     highly indecorous for the hon. gentleman to 
     <lb/>
     repeat these statements after they have been 
     <lb/>
     shown to be erroneous. And I am now in 
     <lb/>
     a position to state, that we have had an 
     <lb/>
     answer to a telegram sent specially to New 
     <lb/>
     York to ascertain the fact from the London 
     <lb/>
     papers, that the sum asked for by the Impe<lb break="no"/>rial Government for the defences of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     was £200,000, not £50,000 as stated by the 
     <lb/>

     member makes charges, he ought to have 
     <lb/>
     ascertained that this telegram had been 
     <lb/>
     brought to my notice. I took the statement 
     <lb/>
     as it appeared in the published telegraphic 
     <lb/>
     reports. He has no right to charge me with 
     <lb/>

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—It was not to that

     <lb/>
     gentleman all through his speech has repeat<lb break="no"/>ed things which my colleagues as well as 
     <lb/>
     myself have repeatedly declared, from per<lb break="no"/>sonal knowledge, to be incorrect.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—If the papers

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>— The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     will see from the reports that that amount is 
     <lb/>
     intended simply for works at Quebec. The 
     <lb/>
     proportion to be contributed for the defences 
     <lb/>
     at Montreal and westward is not stated, nor 
     <lb/>
     yet settled.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—I have been told for 
     <lb/>
     the first time that the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     will contribute anything towards the western 
     <lb/>
     defences ; for the telegraphic reports say 
     <lb/>
     that, if they undertake to fortify Quebec, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government will have to undertake 
     <lb/>
     the works at Montreal and westward. Now, 
     <lb/>
     we are told that this scheme has reference 
     <lb/>
     both to local government and local defence, 
     <lb/>
     and as the cost of defensive works is stated 
     <lb/>
     by Col. JERVOIS to be six millions, I suppose 
     <lb/>
     we will have to pay that too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—The cost may be a 
     <lb/>
     great deal more than six millions, possibly. 
     <lb/>
     We can say nothing at present as to the cost. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—A great deal more. 
     <lb/>
     Then immense sums of money are to melt 
     <lb/>
     away like snow upon these works, and, in 
     <lb/>
     fact, there will be no limit to the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture. (Hear, hear.) However, passing on 
     <lb/>
     from this point, I would like to ask, if Con<lb break="no"/>federation is carried, in what position will 
     <lb/>
     the country stand in respect to the public 
     <lb/>
     debt ? It appears that the population of the 
     <lb/>
     various provinces, in 1861, was as follows :—

            <p>
     If Confederation takes place, these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces will be indebted as follows: the 
     <lb/>
     public debt of Canada, according to the 
     <lb/>
     Public Accounts, amounts to $67,263,000 ; 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia is to be allowed to increase its 
     <lb/>
     debt to $8,000,000 ; New Brunswick will be 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
          

     allowed to increase its debt to $7,000,000 ; 
     <lb/>
     the debt of Prince Edward Island is $240,<lb break="no"/>000 ; and the debt of Newfoundland, $946,<lb break="no"/>000, making, if the provinces are united, a 
     <lb/>
     grand total of $83,000,000 as the debt of 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Government. It may be said 
     <lb/>
     with respect to Canada, that she is going 
     <lb/>
     into the Confederation with a debt of only 
     <lb/>
     $62,500,000 ; although that may be true, 
     <lb/>
     she will nevertheless owe the whole amount 
     <lb/>
     I have stated, which, if not paid by the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government, will have to be paid 
     <lb/>
     by the Governments of Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada.

     <lb/>
     and that there are assets to meet it, which 
     <lb/>
     assets will be made over to the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments. The reason it was taken from the 
     <lb/>
     $67,263,000 was because it was due upon 
     <lb/>
     local account, and because there were local 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     but if it is done in the way of a bonus to be

     paid on the completion of the road, and on 
     <lb/>
     security being given that the road shall be 
     <lb/>
     kept open for a certain term of years, it will 
     <lb/>
     cost nothing like the sum mentioned by my

            <p>

     of my honorable friend (Hon. J. S. MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD) had a proposition before it some<lb break="no"/>what similar to this, and which was to build 
     <lb/>
     a railway; but it was not said by what means. 
     <lb/>
     You, however, have bound yourself to build 
     <lb/>
     a railway, and if you do not find a company 
     <lb/>
     to construct it, you will have to build it and 
     <lb/>
     keep it open at your own cost. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Not exactly ; and 
     <lb/>
     there is already a proposal to build a large 
     <lb/>
     portion of the line. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>-I think the course 
     <lb/>
     which the debate has taken shows the 
     <lb/>
     absolute necessity that the Government 
     <lb/>
     should have brought down a statement of 
     <lb/>
     the expense of this road, so that members 
     <lb/>
     might have been able to form some opinion 
     <lb/>
     in regard to its cost. They might have 
     <lb/>
     called upon the engineer who surveyed 
     <lb/>
     the route to make some approximation 
     <lb/>
     of the probable outlay. When, in the 
     <lb/>
     absence of such information, I rise in my 
     <lb/>
     place and say that according to the best 
     <lb/>
     data at my command, it will cost $20,000,<lb break="no"/>000, I am met by the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council protesting against my making such 
     <lb/>
     a statement. But when I ask my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend if he has not stated that it will cost 
     <lb/>
     $16,000,000 or $18,000,000, he replies that 
     <lb/>
     he might have said it would cost $15,000,000. 
     <lb/>
     So that, according to my hon. friend himself, 
     <lb/>
     it is safe to assume that for the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway, the debt will be increased by 
     <lb/>
     $15,000,000. This; then, is one of the new 
     <lb/>
     debts the new Government will be called 
     <lb/>
     upon immediately to contract. Then another 
     <lb/>
     debt will be required for the defences of the 
     <lb/>
    country. I put this sum down at $6,000,000. 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="755" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0755.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">755</fw>



     But the Hon. President of the Council says it 
     <lb/>
     is impossible to say what the defences will 
     <lb/>
     cost, and they may cost a great deal more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR.  BROWN</persName>—The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     should state more carefully what I said. I 
     <lb/>
     did not speak of this country simply, but of 
     <lb/>
     the whole defences—those to be undertaken 
     <lb/>
     by the Imperial Government as well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—I refer to the forti<lb break="no"/>fications required for Quebec, Montreal, 
     <lb/>
     Kingston, Toronto and Hamilton. It is 
     <lb/>
     impossible for us to form any estimate of 
     <lb/>
     what defences may be required in St. John 
     <lb/>
     and Halifax, and other portions of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces. But certainly the sum 
     <lb/>
     which will be required for the defences and 
     <lb/>
     for the armament of those defences in Canada 
     <lb/>
     will not be less than $6,000,000. Add this 
     <lb/>
     and the sum required for the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway to the debt already existing, and 
     <lb/>
     it will be found that, almost at the outset 
     <lb/>
     of its career, the Federation would labor 
     <lb/>
     under pressure of a debt amounting to 
     <lb/>
     about $110,000,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Oh ! no, no.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—The fact is undeni<lb break="no"/>able. Almost from the first day of its exis<lb break="no"/>tence, the new Government will be called 
     <lb/>
      upon to pay interest, on account of public 
     <lb/>
     debt, to the amount of $3,809,668 for 
     <lb/>
     Canada ; $750,000 for Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, and $59,333 for Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Prince Edward Island ; then there is, 
     <lb/>
     over and above the subsidy of eighty cents 
     <lb/>
     per head, the sum of $115,200 to be paid 
     <lb/>
     yearly to Newfoundland, and $88 900 to be 
     <lb/>
     paid annually to Prince Edward Island. To 
     <lb/>
     this must be added the interest on the out<lb break="no"/>lay for the Intercolonial Railway. It has 
     <lb/>
     been stated that money for this purpose can 
     <lb/>
     be borrowed at three and a half per cent., 
     <lb/>
     but there is nothing to show that the ar<lb break="no"/>rangement proposed to be entered into by 
     <lb/>
     the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government, some 
     <lb/>
     two or three years ago, in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     borrowing of money at three and a half per 
     <lb/>
     cent., can now be carried out. We have no 
     <lb/>
     reason to believe that the proposed Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government will be able to borrow money 
     <lb/>
     on the same favorable terms ; and, if the 
     <lb/>
     interest charged is at the rate of five per 
     <lb/>
     cent., there will be nearly $1,000,000 to be 
     <lb/>
     paid annually as interest on the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
    Railway debt alone.

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The population of Newfoundland being 130,000,

     all wrong in his figures, but that is really 
     <lb/>
     not the point. When he says that the 
     <lb/>
     interest will be increased, he should also state 
     <lb/>
     what we are to get back in the shape of 
     <lb/>
     customs duties from the Lower Provinces.

     What is the use of giving one side and not

     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—I think that any 
     <lb/>
     person who will seriously contemplate this 
     <lb/>
     proposition of the Government, must come 
     <lb/>
     to the conclusion that this Confederation

     scheme  is nothing more or less than a scheme 
     <lb/>
     to construct the Intercolonial Railway. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) If it was not necessary for 
     <lb/>
     some parties that that road should be 
     <lb/>
     constructed, we should have had no Con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme. Another objection, to 
     <lb/>
     my mind, on the face of these resolutions, 
     <lb/>
     has reference to the subsidy of 80 cents per 
     <lb/>
     head. The 64th resolution provides that 
     <lb/>
     the General Government shall pay 80 cents. 
     <lb/>
     per head of the population of 1861 to the 
     <lb/>
     several provinces for local purposes :—

            <p>
     I think it will be admitted by every member 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
       

     from Upper Canada, that if the people of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada had representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation, they would have no desire to change 
     <lb/>
     the present system of government. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) We in Upper Canada contend that 
     <lb/>
     we pay seventy per cent. of the taxation, 
     <lb/>
     while Lower Canada pays only thirty per 
     <lb/>
     cent. Now, what will be the effect of the 
     <lb/>
     64th resolution? Under that resolution, 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada will receive a subsidy of 
     <lb/>
     $1,116,000, and on the principle which has 
     <lb/>
     always been contended for in Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     the preportion of that sum which Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada will pay, as a member of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation, will be thirty per cent., or say 
     <lb/>
     $335,000, while Upper Canada will pay 
     <lb/>
     seventy per cent., or $781,000. We have 
     <lb/>
     been paying the larger proportion of the 
     <lb/>
     taxation, and Lower Canada the smaller 
     <lb/>
     proportion, and the object of going into this 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is, that the local governments 
     <lb/>
     should have the management of their own 
     <lb/>
     local affairs, and that we should raise the 
     <lb/>
     money necessary for our own local purposes, 
     <lb/>
     while Lower Canada should raise the money 
     <lb/>
     necessary for her local purposes. But in 
     <lb/>
     this instance, the General Government will 
     <lb/>
     collect that money in Upper Canada in the 
     <lb/>
     large proportion which I have just stated ; 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, Lower Canada will get a 
     <lb/>
     subsidy of $888,000. Upper Canada, as 
     <lb/>
     a member of the Confederation, will pay 
     <lb/>
     $621,000, of that sum, according to the 
     <lb/>
     admitted ratio in which she contributes to 
     <lb/>
     the public exchequer, and Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     will pay 30 per cent., or $267,000.

     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Of course, so far as 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada and Lower Canada are con<lb break="no"/>cerned. But the hon. gentleman must see 
     <lb/>
     that by the introduction of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces into the union, an entire change 
     <lb/>
     is made in the relations between Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. There will not only be a 
     <lb/>
     change in the way in which the taxes con<lb break="no"/>tributed by the people reach the treasury, 
     <lb/>
     but an immense change also in the way in 
     <lb/>
     which those moneys will be distributed, 
     <lb/>
     and by both Upper Canada will profit. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     admits that the principle is correct, and,

     unless as affected by altered circumstances, it 
     <lb/>
     will bring out the result I have stated.

            </p>

     the circumstances will be. The honorable

     gentleman should take up the whole of the

     financial arrangements of the scheme. It is 
     <lb/>
     not fair to take up a mere portion of them. 
     <lb/>
     If he had looked at the commercial tables of

     all the provinces, he would have seen that his

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—What I say is this, 
     <lb/>
     that if, instead of paying all the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments this subsidy of 80 cents per head, 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada had been left to collect from 
     <lb/>
     her own people her $1,116,000, and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada to collect from her people the $888,000 
     <lb/>
     which she is to receive, that would have been 
     <lb/>
     what we have been contending for in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—No doubt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—Well, we have always 
     <lb/>
     contended that we were willing to collect the 
     <lb/>
     moneys required for our own local purposes in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, and that Lower Canada should 
     <lb/>
     do the same. We are entitled, according to 
     <lb/>
      that principle, to $286,000 more than we 
     <lb/>
     shall receive ; and the proposed arrangement, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, I say is unjust ; otherwise we have 
     <lb/>
     been contending for what was incorrect for 
     <lb/>
     the last ten years. It should have been made 
     <lb/>
     part of the scheme, that whatever Upper 
     <lb/>
      Canada required for her local expenditure 
     <lb/>
     should be obtained by taxes levied on her 
     <lb/>
     people, and that whatever Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     required for the like purposes should be levied 
     <lb/>
     in the same way. But that is not the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     so that we gain nothing with regard to our 
     <lb/>
     paying more than we receive, which has been 
     <lb/>
     our complaint hitherto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I am surprised that 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend should go so far. I 
     <lb/>
     agree with him so far as my own judgment is 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

      concerned, that it would have been a desirable 
     <lb/>
     arrangement if we could have got each pro<lb break="no"/>vince to collect, by direct taxation, the moneys 
     <lb/>
     it required to meet its own local expenditure. 
     <lb/>
     But the honorable gentleman must not say 
     <lb/>
     that because we have not got that length, we 
     <lb/>
     leave the matter exactly as it was. There is 
     <lb/>
     a very great change, and the proposed system 
     <lb/>
     is much more just than that existing hitherto. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—But will the hon.

    gentleman not say that it would have been 
     <lb/>desirable that these sums, instead of being 
     <lb/>collected by the General Government, should 
     <lb/>have been collected by each province ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Certainly ; that was 
     <lb/>
     what I contended for. But we had not the 
     <lb/>
     making of the whole of the bargain ; and 
     <lb/>
     surely the honorable gentleman cannot contend 
     <lb/>
     that because we did not get everything our 
     <lb/>
     own way, we should therefore give up the 
     <lb/>
     whole scheme. I apprehend, however, it will 
     <lb/>
     be found, if this scheme goes into operation, 
     <lb/>
     that the burdens on the people of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada will be very different from what they 
     <lb/>
     have been in times past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—Well, the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman admits that Upper Canada will 
     <lb/>
     not get in this scheme all he contended for, 
     <lb/>
     and I say that if this scheme goes into oper<lb break="no"/>ation, the position of Upper Canada will be 
     <lb/>
     no better than it was before. I give this as 
     <lb/>
     a glaring instance—there are others which 
     <lb/>
     cannot so readily be detected—of the way in 
     <lb/>
     which the just claims and interests of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada have been overlooked. I do not see 
     <lb/>
     how honorable gentlemen will be able to an<lb break="no"/>swer the charges brought against them by 
     <lb/>
     their constituents, that they have deliberately 
     <lb/>
     agreed, that for all time to come there shall 
     <lb/>
     be that advantage of one section over the 
     <lb/>
     other. If Upper Canada is to get no more 
     <lb/>
     benefit from the Confederation than I can 
     <lb/>
     find in these resolutions, I am at a loss to see 
     <lb/>
     how she is benefited by them. The expense 
     <lb/>
     of an Intercolonial Railway is to be saddled 
     <lb/>
     on her farmers and her people generally— 
     <lb/>
     they are to pay the larger portion of that 
     <lb/>
     expense, and that, so far as I can see, is to 
     <lb/>
     be the grand effect of this scheme. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Another objection I have to the pro<lb break="no"/>ject relates to the proposition with reference 
     <lb/>
     to the Constitution of the Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil. I say it is a retrograde step to do away 
     <lb/>
     with the elective principle in the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council— (hear, hear)—and a step that will 
     <lb/>
    be very unpalatable to the people of Upper 
     <lb/>Canada. I do not see why the large province 
     <lb/>

     of Canada, containing a population of two 
     <lb/>
     and a half millions, should have been obliged 
     <lb/>
     at the Conference to give up a point involv<lb break="no"/>ing so important a principle, to the small 
     <lb/>
     provinces containing a population of only 
     <lb/>
     800,000. (Hear, hear.) I say take those 
     <lb/>
     resolutions from first to last—there are seven<lb break="no"/>ty—two of them—let any man read them, and 
     <lb/>
     he cannot fail to come to the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that from the first to the seventy-second, it 
     <lb/>
     is concession after concession on the part of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada to those Lower Provinces.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">MR. SCATCHERD</persName>—What I say is, that 
     <lb/>
     I cannot see why this large province should 
     <lb/>
     have been overruled at that Conference with 
     <lb/>
     reference to this question of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council. What did it matter to New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick if the people of Upper Canada desire to 
     <lb/>
     have their legislative councillors elected ? 
     <lb/>
     If New Brunswick desires to have hers nom<lb break="no"/>inated by the Crown, let it be so; but why 
     <lb/>
     prevent Upper Canada from having hers 
     <lb/>
     elected by the people ? (Hear, hear.) Then 
     <lb/>
     the 43rd resolution I consider objection<lb break="no"/>able. The first clause of that resolution 
     <lb/>
     authorizes New Brunswick to impose du<lb break="no"/>ties on the export of timber, logs, masts, 
     <lb/>
     spars, deals, and sawed lumber. If this In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway is constructed, it will 
     <lb/>
     have very little passenger traffic during a 
     <lb/>
     large portion of the year, and I suppose it 
     <lb/>
     will do a large business in freight. Like other 
     <lb/>
     railways, it will be the means of conveying a 
     <lb/>
     large quantity of timber to the seaboard. It 
     <lb/>
     appears to me that any one interested in the 
     <lb/>
     timber business of this country must see that 
     <lb/>
     every stick of timber that will go on the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway from Canada into New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick will be liable to this export duty. 
     <lb/>
     I ask the Honorable President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     if that will not be the fact ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—There will be a dif<lb break="no"/>ference as regards that. This was the way in 
     <lb/>
     which this arrangement arose. For myself, I 
     <lb/>
     regret it should be put in that shape, for I am 
     <lb/>
     opposed to all export duties. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Of course it was arranged that the Local Gov<lb break="no"/>ernments should have the lands, mines, min<lb break="no"/>erals and Crown timber of their respective 
     <lb/>
     provinces. From our Crown timber here we 
     <lb/>
     receive a large revenue in the shape of stump<lb break="no"/>age, which is to go to Upper and Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada respectively for their local purposes. But 
     <lb/>
     the New Brunswick delegates Said—" We do 
     <lb/>
     not levy a stumpage duty on our Crown tim<lb break="no"/>ber as you do; we find it better to levy it 
     <lb/>
     in the shape of an export duty "—and we com<lb break="no"/>plied with their desire that they should have 
     <lb/>
     their local revenue in that shape as an offset 
     <lb/>
     to our stumpage duty.

     <persName ref="pers:MCKE2">MR. McKELLAR</persName>—I think the question 
     <lb/>
     raised on this point by the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for West Middlesex is hardly worth discuss<lb break="no"/>ing, because timber from Canada will never 
     <lb/>
     be carried over the Intercolonial road. It 
     <lb/>
     does not pay to carry it over our own roads, 
     <lb/>

     from South Oxford has not come to the

     point, which is this, that it is not right for 
     <lb/>
     the people of New Brunswick to charge this 
     <lb/>
     duty on timber. What right have they to 
     <lb/>
     levy an export duty on our timber ? Yet

     however, that the meaning of that resolution

     is clearly as I have stated it. This scheme is

     objectionable on the face of it, because it will

     province, and not only that, but it will be a 
     <lb/>
    piece of corruption from the time of the turn<lb break="no"/>ing of the first shovelful of earth. All the 
     <lb/>officers of the road will be appointed by the 
     <lb/>Government, and it will be an everlasting 
     <lb/>expense. It could not have been better ex<lb break="no"/>pressed than it was by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>South Oxford in his own paper, that every 
     <lb/>storm of snow would be watched with the 
     <lb/>liveliest anxiety by the people of Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. (Hear, hear.) I know it is said that 
     <lb/>the Government will open up the North—West 
     <lb/>when the state of the finances permit ; but 
     <lb/>how much better would it be to have the 
     <lb/>money taken, which is to be appropriated for 
     <lb/>this unprofitable railway, and expended at 
     <lb/>once in opening up that territory ? It is 
     <lb/>doubtful whether there is any land in that 
     <lb/>part of the country through which the rail<lb break="no"/>way is to pass, fit for cultivation. Then, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the view taken by my honorable 
     <lb/>friend from South Oxford, the only products 
     <lb/>shipped on it will be those grown east of 
     <lb/>Rivière du Loup. (Hear, hear.) The pay<lb break="no"/>ment of subsidies from the General to the 
     <lb/>Local Governments, the doing away with the 
     <lb/>elective principle in the Legislative Council, 
     <lb/>and the construction of the lntercolonial 
     <lb/>Railway, are to my mind grave objections to 
     <lb/>the Confederation. I consider that such a 
     <lb/>measure ought not to become law until it has 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
         

     been submitted to and pronounced upon by 
     <lb/>
     the people. (Hear, hear.) Yet it is the de<lb break="no"/>clared intention of the Government not to sub<lb break="no"/>mit it to the people for their opinion. Now, 
     <lb/>
     I think the Government are not keeping faith 
     <lb/>
     with the people in this respect. At a dinner 
     <lb/>
     in Toronto, in November last, the honorable

     Hon. Mr. BROWN—A friend asks if the scheme

     is to go into operation without being submitted

     to the people. That is a matter for the different

     measure shall or shall not be sent especially to

     How different is that declaration from the

     every means to carry the scheme through

     without submitting it to the people! (Hear,

     found to be one which protected local interests,

     <lb/>
     them in a way to do honor to the race from which 
     <lb/>

     There is the express declaration of two 
     <lb/>
     Ministers of the Crown that this measure, 
     <lb/>
     before it would become law, should be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the people. (Hear, hear.) Now, 
     <lb/>
     is the course indicated that which has been 
     <lb/>
     adopted? Is the scheme to be submitted to 
     <lb/>
     the people ? No ; they bring down the scheme 
     <lb/>
     and say that it must be passed in its entirety, 
     <lb/>
     and so far from submitting it to the people, 
     <lb/>
     they move the previous question to prevent 
     <lb/>
     the possibility of an amendment to that effect 
     <lb/>
     being put. Some members who have pre<lb break="no"/>ceded me contended that it would be un<lb break="no"/>constitutional to submit it to the people, and 
     <lb/>
     they cited cases in support of their argument. 
     <lb/>
     But in those cases, Parliament had full 
     <lb/>
     power to dispose of the question then before

     it; this Parliament has no power to dispose 
     <lb/>
     finally of this question. The British Par<lb break="no"/>liament can act with or without the consent of 
     <lb/>
     this Parliament ; therefore, it appears to me 
     <lb/>
     that the cases cited are not applicable to our 
     <lb/>
     case, and I maintain that submitting the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions to the people would prevent irritation 
     <lb/>
     hereafter. (Hear.) How can it be pretended 
     <lb/>
     that if the measure is not passed now, the 
     <lb/>
     time will never occur again ? So far as 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada is concerned, I think she might 
     <lb/>
     hope to obtain such a scheme as this at any 
     <lb/>
     time—( hear, hear)—and I am willing to take 
     <lb/>
      the responsibility of voting against this Con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme. (Hear, hear.)

     <lb/>
     vote on this question, I desire plainly to 
     <lb/>
     state the position which I occupy in regard 
     <lb/>
     to it. I desire to say that I am in favor of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. (Hear, hear.) The first reso<lb break="no"/>lution which was proposed at the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Conference and agreed upon, namely, that 
     <lb/>
     a Confederation of all the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Provinces, on principles just to all, 
     <lb/>
     was desirable, I have no hesitation in saying, 
     <lb/>
     meets with my entire approval. We have 
     <lb/>
     been told that the Conference at Quebec 
     <lb/>
     exhibited one of the grandest spectacles 
     <lb/>
     which the world ever beheld. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I may be wrong, but I fail to see it 
     <lb/>
     in that light. I am prepared to award 
     <lb/>
     to honorable gentlemen all the sincerity 
     <lb/>
     in meeting together to settle the sec<lb break="no"/>tional difficulties of this country to which 
     <lb/>
     they can possibly lay claim, and it is a matter 
     <lb/>
     of great regret to me that I find myself 
     <lb/>
     to-night compelled to record my vote against 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen with whom it has been my 
     <lb/>
     pleasure to be associated ever since I entered 
     <lb/>
     political life. But, sir, it is with me a matter 
     <lb/>
     of conscientious conviction, and I am bound, 
     <lb/>
     whatever the consequences may be, to follow 
     <lb/>
     those convictions. (Hear, hear.) Now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I think that hon. gentlemen, in 
     <lb/>
     bringing this scheme down and saying that 
     <lb/>
     we must take it just as it is without making 
     <lb/>
     any amendment to it whatever, are asking 
     <lb/>
     too much. (Hear, hear.) That is assuming 
     <lb/>
     the document is perfect in every particular, 
     <lb/>
     or as nearly so as possible. If we are to 
     <lb/>
     undertake the discussion of this question, and 
     <lb/>
     yet not be allowed to alter it in any single 
     <lb/>
     particular so as to adapt it to the <choice><sic>circum<lb break="no"/>tances</sic><corr>circumstances</corr></choice> of the province, I really cannot 
     <lb/>
     conceive for what purpose this House has 
     <lb/>
     been called together. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
      

     have heard a good deal said about the lead<lb break="no"/>ing Opposition members in all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     having received invitations to enter the 
     <lb/>
     Conference for the free discussion of the 
     <lb/>
     question, but I would ask, sir, on what 
     <lb/>
     occasion the Opposition of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     were invited by the Government to take 
     <lb/>
     part in that Conference? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I understood the hon. member for Mont<lb break="no"/>real Centre (Hon. Mr. ROSE) to say, that 
     <lb/>
     although he did not agree with some of the 
     <lb/>
     minute details, yet rather than jeopardise 
     <lb/>
     the adoption of the whole scheme, he was 
     <lb/>
     prepared to vote for it just as it stands. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I would ask if the question of our 
     <lb/>
     School law is a minute detail ? I would ask 
     <lb/>
     if the appropriation of the debt between 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada is a minute detail ? 
     <lb/>
     I would ask if the question of the defences 
     <lb/>
     of the country is a minute detail ? And yet 
     <lb/>
     we are asked to vote for this measure without 
     <lb/>
     having these particulars laid before us for 
     <lb/>
     our consideration. (Hear, hear.) It is better, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman says, that we should vote 
     <lb/>
     upon it in ignorance of these things, and 
     <lb/>
     leave the result, if wrong, to be righted by 
     <lb/>
     future legislators. Well, the member may 
     <lb/>
     vote in ignorance if he prefers to do things 
     <lb/>
     in that way, but as I am constituted (it 
     <lb/>
     may be a fault of mine), I cannot do that. 
     <lb/>
     I will never record a vote in this House 
     <lb/>
     unless I know, or have tried my utmost 
     <lb/>
     to know what I am doing. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. Minister of Finance, in the very 
     <lb/>
     able speech which he delivered at Sherbrooke, 
     <lb/>alluded to the great difficulties which sur<lb break="no"/>rounded the School question. He intimated  
     <lb/>that the question was one of such magnitude, 
     <lb/>that a great deal of time was required for its 
     <lb/>consideration, and then invited the coöper<lb break="no"/>ation of all intelligent men to the solution 
     <lb/>of that difficulty. If then the smaller ques<lb break="no"/>tion is of so much importance, why should 
     <lb/>the larger one be forced upon this House 
     <lb/>with such haste ? Does it require less time 
     <lb/>for consideration than the smaller one to 
     <lb/>which I have alluded ? It seems to me very 
     <lb/>much like building a house first, and after 
     <lb/>it is built proceeding to examine the founda<lb break="no"/>tions. The hon. gentleman spoke of the 
     <lb/>improvement which this scheme had already 
     <lb/>secured in the value of our securities in En<lb break="no"/>gland. Now, it does not require much thought 
     <lb/>to discover that it is an easy matter to affect 
     <lb/>the stock exchange either favorably or unfa<lb break="no"/>vorably. Securities go up to-day and down 
     <lb/>to-morrow. A man in business may get an

     endorser which may for a short time improve 
     <lb/>
     his credit ; so we seek to improve our credit 
     <lb/>
     by an alliance with the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, there are other and far better 
     <lb/>
     ways of improving our credit, the very best 
     <lb/>
     of which is living within our means, bring<lb break="no"/>ing our expenditure within our income, and 
     <lb/>
     establishing our financial operations on a 
     <lb/>
     sound and healthy basis. Rest assured, the 
     <lb/>
     monied men of England will attach much 
     <lb/>
     greater importance to such a course than 
     <lb/>
     any alliance we can possibly make with other 
     <lb/>
      provinces, for the purpose of improving our 
     <lb/>
    credit. (Hear, hear.) Well, sir, we are 
     <lb/>told that this great scheme is to settle all 
     <lb/>our sectional difficulties. I may perhaps be 
     <lb/>very dull of comprehension, but I must con<lb break="no"/>fess that I cannot see that. We have difficul<lb break="no"/>ties among ourselves, as scenes that have tran<lb break="no"/>spired on the floor of this House have fully 
     <lb/>proved, and we seek to settle those difficulties 
     <lb/>by forming a union with provinces that are 
     <lb/>at loggerheads among themselves.   (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Now, sir, we have long contended in 
     <lb/>Upper Canada for a just representation in 
     <lb/>Parliament, and we are told that, because we 
     <lb/>are going to get seventeen more members than 
     <lb/>Lower Canada in the Federal Legislature, 
     <lb/>all the difficulties for the settlement of 
     <lb/>which representation according to popula<lb break="no"/>tion was sought, are to be thereby remedied. 
     <lb/>I cannot see that that result will follow, 
     <lb/>because in the Upper House there is still 
     <lb/>to be an equality of votes, and I quote now 
     <lb/>from the pamphlet written by the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>CAUCHON to show that he is of Opinion 
     <lb/>that any advantage which we gain in the 
     <lb/>Lower House will be completely paralyzed 
     <lb/>in the Upper Chamber. He says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The Constitution of 1840 only stipulated for 
     <lb/>
     equality in the Lower House. Let us suppose 
     <lb/>
     that the majority of the Legislative Counci had 
     <lb/>
     chosen to adopt a project of law which would 
     <lb/>
     have been hostile to the interests of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada ; as Upper and Lower Canada were 
     <lb/>
     equally represented in the Lower House, the bill 
     <lb/>
     adopted by the Upper House would have been 
     <lb/>
     certainly thrown out, and it is by the Lower 
     <lb/>
     House alone that we have, up to this time, been 
     <lb/>
     able to protect and save our institutions, taking 
     <lb/>
     into account also the good-will shown to us by 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadian representatives of English des<lb break="no"/>cent. Why has the Legislative Assembly always 
     <lb/>
     been the battlefield with respect to the struggle 
     <lb/>
     that has been going on for the last fourteen years 
     <lb/>
     between Upper an Lower Canada on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of representation by population ? It is 
     <lb/>
     because there alone equality has existed, and 
     <lb/>
     there alone could be found the means of solving 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
        

     the constitutional problem. If then, instead of 
     <lb/>
     the present Constitution, we substitute local 
     <lb/>
     legislatures, and over them the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, we shall see in that case precisely the 
     <lb/>
     inverse of that which we have always observed 
     <lb/>
     in our present legislature, that is to say, that on 
     <lb/>
     the occurrence of any local misunderstanding, the 
     <lb/>
     struggle will be carried from the Lower House 
     <lb/>
     to the Legislative Council, and precisely fo the 
     <lb/>
     reasons that we have adduced. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER, we have here, in the 
     <lb/>
     language of one of the most, determined 
     <lb/>
     opponents of the principle of representation 
     <lb/>
     according to population, very good reasons 
     <lb/>
     given for coming to the conclusion that the 
     <lb/>
     granting of increased representation in the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Legislature will amount to nothing, 
     <lb/>
     while the same just principle is denied in 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of the Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     I hope I may be incorrect, but I am of 
     <lb/>
     opinion that if this scheme goes into opera<lb break="no"/>tion, we shall witness the difficulty alluded 
     <lb/>
     to on the floor of the Confederate Legislature 
     <lb/>
     in less than six months after its organization. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And the unfair representation 
     <lb/>
     which Upper Canada will have in the Upper 
     <lb/>
     Chamber must exist throughout all time. 
     <lb/>
     Nor will she  be able to add even one 
     <lb/>
     member, no matter how great may be the 
     <lb/>
     preponderance of her population over other 
     <lb/>
     parts of the Confederacy And this equality 
     <lb/>
     of votes between Upper Canada and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada will act, as Mr. CAUCHON tells his 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadian friends, as a perfect counter<lb break="no"/>poise to the legislation of the Lower House. 
     <lb/>
     In connection with this subject, there is 
     <lb/>
     another feature of the scheme which is 
     <lb/>
     painful to contemplate, in which we are, I 
     <lb/>
     think, about to advance backwards. The quali<lb break="no"/>fication of a Legislative Councillor is now 
     <lb/>
     $8,000 ; but it is proposed to reduce it to 
     <lb/>
     $4,000, which I regard as retrogressive. 
     <lb/>
     And in the case of Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     and Newfoundland, the qualification may be 
     <lb/>
     personal property as well as real estate—in 
     <lb/>
     other words, the legislative councillors from 
     <lb/>
     those provinces may be peddlers of jewelry 
     <lb/>
     or any other commodity, whose stock in trade 
     <lb/>
     may be burned up while they are attending 
     <lb/>
     a session, rendering them unable longer to 
     <lb/>
     qualify. (Hear, hear.) But there is a much 
     <lb/>
     worse feature than that : it will have 
     <lb/>
     the effect of introducing into the Upper 
     <lb/>
     Chamber a class of needy adventurers who in 
     <lb/>
     a crisis may be approached without very 
     <lb/>
     much difficulty, and who might plead their 
     <lb/>
     own circumstances as an ample apology in 
     <lb/>
     quieting their consciences for the votes they 
     <lb/>

     might give. Now, Mr. SPEAKER, I object 
     <lb/>
     further to this scheme on the ground of the 
     <lb/>
     cumbrous and expensive machinery of the 
     <lb/>
     local governments. I know it has been 
     <lb/>
     asserted that it will not cost the country any 
     <lb/>
     more than under the present system, and I 
     <lb/>
     will entirely give up my position if any hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman can prove to me that a man will 
     <lb/>
     not go behind who doubles or even increases 
     <lb/>
     the number of his employés without at the 
     <lb/>
     same time increasing the capital and extent 
     <lb/>
     of his business. I see in this scheme the 
     <lb/>
     introduction and increase—the rapid increase 
     <lb/>
     —of a large number of consumers, without 
     <lb/>
     correspondingly increasing the producers of 
     <lb/>
     the country. If I err in this I err in good 
     <lb/>
     company, for I quote the words of the Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State for the Colonies, Mr. CARDWELL, 
     <lb/>
     who says on this point :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     A very important part of this subject is the 
     <lb/>
     expense whic may attend the working of the 
     <lb/>
     Central and the Local Governments. Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Government cannot but express the 
     <lb/>
     earnest hope that the arrangements which may be 
     <lb/>
     adopted in this respect may not be of such a 
     <lb/>
     nature as to increase, at least in any considerable 
     <lb/>
     degree, the whole expenditure, or to make any 
     <lb/>
     material addition to the taxation and thereby 
     <lb/>
     retard the internal industry or tend to impose 
     <lb/>
     new burdens on the commerce of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Now, sir, I object as a western man 
     <lb/>
     (and I will be pardoned if I allude to the 
     <lb/>
     sectional question) to the great injustice 
     <lb/>
     which will be done to the people of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada in the heavy burdens which she 
     <lb/>
     will have to bear in the carrying on of the 
     <lb/>
     General Government. In the able speech 
     <lb/>
     delivered by the Hon. the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance at Sherbrooke, he said that when 
     <lb/>
     the population of Canada should reach five 
     <lb/>
     millions (a larger papulation than that of 
     <lb/>
     the proposed Confederation at present), the 
     <lb/>
     revenue which would be derived for public 
     <lb/>
     purposes would not be a farthing more than 
     <lb/>
     now. One hon. gentleman has said in this 
     <lb/>
     House that it is as cheap to govern three 
     <lb/>
     millions as five millions of people. That may 
     <lb/>
     be true, but one million of money will not 
     <lb/>
     go as far as five millions in making those 
     <lb/>
     local improvements which Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     would require, and to which the people of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada would be justly and fairly 
     <lb/>
     entitled. Then I object further to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, because while Upper Canada will 
     <lb/>
     contribute the largest amount to the general 
     <lb/>
     revenue, she will also have to bear the heavy 
     <lb/>
     share of defensive and other public works in 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/></p>
     

            <cb/>
      
<p>
     (Hear, hear.) I object further to the in<lb break="no"/>definite  postponement of the opening up of 
     <lb/>
     the North-West, the settlement of the valleys 
     <lb/>
     of the Saskatchewan and the improvement 
     <lb/>
     of our canal system. (Hear, hear.) There 
     <lb/>
     is a very marked difference in the phraseo<lb break="no"/>logy of two of the clauses of this scheme 
     <lb/>
     which must strike any one reading them is 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary. The one declares that the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway <hi rendition="simple:italic">shall</hi> be built. There 
     <lb/>
     can be no <hi rendition="simple:italic">mistake</hi> about that, nor is there 
     <lb/>
     any possibility of doubt. The language is 
     <lb/>
     definite—it is to be built immediately. 
     <lb/>
    (Hear, hear.) The other clause (69) reads 
     <lb/>thus :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     (Hear, hear.) This certainly is the most

     <lb/>
     work. However, we are told that this is 
     <lb/>
     a mistake, and that the opening up of the 
     <lb/>
     North-West will go on simultaneously with 
     <lb/>
     the construction of the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way; but we find Hon. Mr. TILLEY asserting 
     <lb/>
     in the Lower Provinces that there was so 
     <lb/>
     serious intention of going on with this work 
     <lb/>
     at present, and that a large sum was to be 
     <lb/>
     spent at once in New Brunswick in improv<lb break="no"/>ing its defences. If I may be allowed to give an 
     <lb/>
     illustration of the uncertain and evasive cha<lb break="no"/>racter of this provision of the scheme, I wo;;

     I have here before me. It refers to

     New-Brunswick will say: " Oh we cannot 
     <lb/>
     on with this work until the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway is completed, and New Brunswick

     Nova Scotia will say : " When the finances

     them, " Oh, we don't know what it means." 
     <lb/>
     (Langhter.) I object to this scheme, air, on

     account of the burdens it proposes to place 
     <lb/>
     this country in the shape of defence. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We have had glowing accounts 
     <lb/>
     from the Hon. Minister of Agriculture and 
     <lb/>
     farmers about the territory that will belong to 
     <lb/>
     this Confederation. We are told that it will 
     <lb/>
     extend for four thousand miles from ocean 
     <lb/>
     ocean ; and will it be believed that we in 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada, with a population 
     <lb/>
     less than that of the city of London, will be 
     <lb/>
     called upon to defend such a frontier—a 
     <lb/>
     territory, we are told. as great as the conti<lb break="no"/>nent of Europe? (Hear, hear.) The thing 
     <lb/>
    was an anomaly that no country in the world 
     <lb/>
     consents except our own. I regard this 
     <lb/>
     condition of territory by Confederation as a 
     <lb/>
     source of weakness instead of strength ; and 
     <lb/>
     of my mind the casting of the burden of 
     <lb/>
     defence upon this country is like investing a 
     <lb/>
     sovereign with all the outward semblance of 
     <lb/>
     loyalty, and giving him a dollar per day to 
     <lb/>
     keep up the dignity of his court, or like 
     <lb/>
     expecting the engine of one of the small 
     <lb/>
     ferry steamers which ply on the river here 
     <lb/>
     Point Lévis, to propel the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Great Eastern</hi> 
     <lb/>
     across the Atlantic. (Hear, hear.) Sir, I am 
     <lb/>
     unmindful of the fostering care of the 
     <lb/>
     British Island over all its colonies. I am 
     <lb/>
     unmindful of all that England has done 
     <lb/>
     guard and protect her colonies through<lb break="no"/>out
     the world, and to <choice><sic>develope</sic><corr>develop</corr></choice> their re<lb break="no"/>sources. But when we see by the telegraphic

     ask that if the Imperial Government will 
     <lb/>
     appropriate only this sum, where, at such a 
     <lb/>
     period of imminent danger as the present is 
     <lb/>
     said to be, and with every point of the fron<lb break="no"/>tier perfectly defenceless, is the money to 
     <lb/>
     come from to place all parts of the province 
     <lb/>
     in a position to resist aggression, and who 
     <lb/>
     is to provide it? The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Lambton, the other night, in alluding to the 
     <lb/>
     ability of this country to raise and maintain 
     <lb/>
     a standing army for our protection, instanced 
     <lb/>
     the case of Denmark, which he said was able 
     <lb/>
     to support an army of 20,000 men. I certain<lb break="no"/>ly thought the allusion a most unhappy one, 
     <lb/>
     and one would have imagined that the recent  
     <lb/>
     history of that country would have prevented 
     <lb/>
     its being made. (Hear, hear.) But in regard 
     <lb/>
     to all the features in this scheme objec<lb break="no"/>tionable to Upper Canada, and adverse to 
     <lb/>

     its interest, Upper Canadian members in this 
     <lb/>
     House say, "Oh, let us have Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and we will make all these things right by 
     <lb/>
     subsequent legislation."  Well, I say to every 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canadian that if he goes into this 
     <lb/>
     treaty with a view of violating its letter and 
     <lb/>
     spirit subsequently, he is unfaithful to the 
     <lb/>
     duty he owes to Upper Canada as well as 
     <lb/>
     to Lower Canada and the sister provinces. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I do not desire to enter into 
     <lb/>
     a treaty with the object of escaping its obli<lb break="no"/>gations at some future time ; and it is because 
     <lb/>
     I wish to do what is right, that I point out 
     <lb/>
     those things in the scheme that I believe to 
     <lb/>
     be wrong, and which, unless they are modi<lb break="no"/>fied, I cannot support by my vote. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It would be a breach of faith on the 
     <lb/>
     part of Upper Canada in a few years after 
     <lb/>
     this to say,  "We want an increased repre<lb break="no"/>sentation; we want a larger amount for our 
     <lb/>
     local purposes," when with their eyes open, 
     <lb/>
     her representatives accepted the document 
     <lb/>
     now before the House, and with a clear 
     <lb/>
     apprehension of what they were doing, made 
     <lb/>
     themselves parties to this treaty. Why, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, is it that Lower Canada has so 
     <lb/>
     long resisted the cry for an increased repre<lb break="no"/>sentation to the western section of the 
     <lb/>
     province? Simply because the treaty of 1840 
     <lb/>
     granted to both sections equality on the floor 
     <lb/>
     of this House. (Hear, hear.) I regret ex<lb break="no"/>ceedingly that the Government intend to 
     <lb/>
     force this measure upon the people without 
     <lb/>
     appealing to them on the question, and 
     <lb/>
     knowing whether it meets with their approval 
     <lb/>
     or not. (Hear, hear.) In that same speech of 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Minister of Finance to which I have 
     <lb/>
     already made allusion, one of his strongest 
     <lb/>
     points was this, that the Union Act of 1840 
     <lb/>
     was forced on the people of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     without their consent. (Hear.) Yet, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, what do we find ? We find the 
     <lb/>
     intelligent and enterprising people of New- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Brunswick have rejected this measure, and 
     <lb/>
     that it is not favored either by the people of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island or Nova Scotia. 
     <lb/>
     We find, further, petitions coming in every 
     <lb/>
     day against the measure from all parts of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. (Hear, hear.) And yet, in 
     <lb/>
      the face of all this opposition, the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment presume to force the measure upon 
     <lb/>
     the country. But then we are told that the 
     <lb/>
     rejection of the scheme by New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island will 
     <lb/>
     make no difference, although they were 
     <lb/>
     treated with here on equal terms, Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island having the same vote in the 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
         

     Conference as Upper or Lower Canada ; they 
     <lb/>
     assisted in framing these articles, and it was 
     <lb/>
     to conciliate them that all these concessions 
     <lb/>
     were made. We are told that this is a 
     <lb/>
     document of concessions ; but I declare that 
     <lb/>
     I have failed to sec any concessions whatever 
     <lb/>
     that have been made to Upper Canada ; they 
     <lb/>
     were all made to the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I repeat that the delegates who met in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec as the representatives of provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and who had equal weight in the <choice><sic>Con<lb break="no"/>ferenc</sic><corr>Conference</corr></choice> with Canada, are now to be treated 
     <lb/>
     as if they were of no account ; that if the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada, representing three-fourths 
     <lb/>
     of the whole population, decide upon it, 
     <lb/>
     it will be carried through. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Then we are told that the danger of war 
     <lb/>
     is very imminent. I fail to see that. The 
     <lb/>
     Government brought in an Alien Bill, 
     <lb/>
     and a large majority in the House voted 
     <lb/>
     for it, because they believed it necessary, 
     <lb/>
     at the time, to secure the peace of the 
     <lb/>
     country ; and in like manner they will be 
     <lb/>
     supported by this House in any measure 
     <lb/>
     which may be required for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     adding to our security. But I ask, sir, if 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions were carried to-night, how 
     <lb/>
     much they would add to our peace and 
     <lb/>
     security ? What increased facilities of com<lb break="no"/>munication would they give us with the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, until it was possible to 
     <lb/>
     build the Intercolonial Railway ? Very many 
     <lb/>
     years must necessarily elapse before that 
     <lb/>
     work could be completed ; meanwhile, the 
     <lb/>
     whole question of union could be discussed ; 
     <lb/>
     objections could be considered, and the people 
     <lb/>
     could be consulted. Thus, without hastily 
     <lb/>
     pressing on a measure which might eventuate 
     <lb/>
     in disappointment and misery, a sound and 
     <lb/>
     judicious measure might be devised, which 
     <lb/>
     would meet with the approval of the country, 
     <lb/>
     and whose principles might be perpetuated 
     <lb/>
     with the happiest results. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—That's a 
     <lb/>
     fact! (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD3">MR. JOHN MACDONALD</persName>—Perhaps I 
     <lb/>
     differ with many in regard to the subject of 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway. I am willing that 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway should be built, 
     <lb/>
     and I am willing that it should be built 
     <lb/>
     at once. I will go farther than that, 
     <lb/>
     and say I am willing that this Parliament 
     <lb/>
     should grant as the share of this country an 
     <lb/>
     amount sufficient to justify sound commercial 
     <lb/>
     men in taking up that work, which I look 
     <lb/>
     upon in the light of a great commercial 
     <lb/>
     undertaking. That is the idea that I hold 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="765" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-07_Page_0765.jpg"/>

     in regard to the Intercolonial Railway. We 
     <lb/>
     should then know how much the road would 
     <lb/>
     cost, and how much money we had to spend, 
     <lb/>
     and by placing it under the management of 
     <lb/>
     sound, judicious commercial men, the best 
     <lb/>
     possible guarantee would be afforded us of its 
     <lb/>
     being properly worked.(Hear, hear.) I do not, 
     <lb/>
     for my part, underrate the difficulties which 
     <lb/>
     beset the hon. gentlemen who now occupy 
     <lb/>
     the Treasury benches. However much others 
     <lb/>
     may be ready to charge hon. gentlemen with 
     <lb/>
     having lost confidence in them, I am free to 
     <lb/>
     admit that my confidence in hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     with whom I have hitherto worked, is as 
     <lb/>
     strong as ever it was. But sir, no matter 
     <lb/>
     whether that confidence were strong or feeble, 
     <lb/>
     I must vote on this question as I conscien<lb break="no"/>tiously believe it is my duty to vote. That 
     <lb/>
     course I have ever followed since I have had 
     <lb/>
     the honor of a seat in this House, and that 
     <lb/>
     course I intend to pursue so long as I conti<lb break="no"/>nue in public life. Far be it from me to 
     <lb/>
     withhold from honorable gentlemen that full 
     <lb/>
     measure of credit to which they are justly 
     <lb/>
     entitled. I believe that they were perfectly 
     <lb/>
     sincere in thus coming together to endeavour 
     <lb/>
     to bring about a solution of our constitutional 
     <lb/>
     difficulties, and I hope they may be succesful 
     <lb/>
     in their efforts in that direction. And if in 
     <lb/>
     the end they shall accomplish that great 
     <lb/>
     object—if they shall succeed in banishing 
     <lb/>
     strife and discord from the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House, and in bringing to our shores an 
     <lb/>
     increased mesure of commercial prosperity, 
     <lb/>
     no man will be more willing to acknowledge 
     <lb/>
     his error than I shall, and no one will be 
     <lb/>
     more ready to join in giving them that full 
     <lb/>
     measure of a nation's gratitude to which 
     <lb/>
     under those circumstances they will he so 
     <lb/>
     fully and fairly entitled. (Cheers).

     <persName ref="pers:MCKE2">MR. McKELLAR</persName>—It is very late in the 
     <lb/>
     evening, and I do not intend to speak at any 
     <lb/>
     great length. However, I think it is proper, 
     <lb/>
     in the interests of a considerable portion of 
     <lb/>
     the people of Upper Canada, that I should call 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the House to this fact, that a 
     <lb/>
     few weeks ago a very large and influential 
     <lb/>
     meeting of the citizens of Toronto was held 
     <lb/>
     in that city, most of them, I believe, being 
     <lb/>
     the constituents of the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who has just addressed us, and to which 
     <lb/>
     meeting that honorable gentleman was invited 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of discussing that very mea<lb break="no"/>sure. He did not, however, think proper to 
     <lb/>
     attend ; but I myself was there ; and I think 
     <lb/>
     he has treated his constituents not with that 
     <lb/>
     courtesy and attention which they had a right 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
        

     to expect at his hands. (Hear, hear.) Why, 
     <lb/>
     sir, did he not attend that meeting, and throw 
     <lb/>
     on it that flood of light which he has shed 
     <lb/>
     abroad amongst us this evening ? (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     Well, in the metropolis of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     where many of the most influential men of 
     <lb/>
     that section of the province were assembled, 
     <lb/>
     on a motion being made for what the honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman now contends, an appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the people—that this measure should be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the popular vote before being dis<lb break="no"/>posed of by this House—at a public meeting, 
     <lb/>
     I say, in the metropolis of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     where there were hundreds of the leading men 
     <lb/>
     assembled, not a seconder could be found. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I say we must hold that hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman responsible for not going to 
     <lb/>
     that meeting and enlightening his constituents 
     <lb/>
     upon this very important subject. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">AN HON. MEMBER</persName>—Did you do so with 
     <lb/>
     your constituents ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCKE2">MR. McKELLAR</persName>—Yes, the question was 
     <lb/>
     fully discussed by them. The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who sits in the Upper House as the 
     <lb/>
     representative of the two counties of Essex 
     <lb/>
     and Kent was elected by acclamation. And 
     <lb/>
     why ? Because this Coalition had taken 
     <lb/>
     place, and this scheme of Federation was in 
     <lb/>
     progress, and that honorable gentleman came 
     <lb/>
     out, openly and above board, and declared 
     <lb/>
     in his speeches and in his address that he was 
     <lb/>
     prepared to do what he did the other day in 
     <lb/>
     the Upper House, vote for every paragraph of 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions. (Hear, hear.) The hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Toronto (Mr. JOHN MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD), however, did not venture to go 
     <lb/>
     near his constituents, although they were 
     <lb/>
     assembled within some two hundred yards of 
     <lb/>
     where he resides ; and in the face of that he 
     <lb/>
     comes here and tells us we must have an appeal 
     <lb/>
     to the people. If ever a subject was brought 
     <lb/>
     under the attention of this House, which met 
     <lb/>
     the almost unanimous approval of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the country, it is the scheme now under 
     <lb/>
     discussion. (Cheers and counter cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     We have been told that because the press of 
     <lb/>
     the country support the scheme nearly with<lb break="no"/>out exception, the press has been subsidized, 
     <lb/>
     and yet, up to this moment, they have not 
     <lb/>
     been able to point to a single case in proof of 
     <lb/>
     their assertion. It is paying the conductors 
     <lb/>
     of the press of Canada a very poor compliment 
     <lb/>
     to say that they could be bought, even were 
     <lb/>
     such a thing to be attempted. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The press of this country—the unbought 
     <lb/>
     press of the country—from one end to the 
     <lb/>
     other, are in favor of the scheme. We have  
     <lb/>

     (Laughter.) Almost without exception, the

     answer some objections which were made by

     the honorable member for Toronto, and he 
     <lb/>
     appears indisposed to speak this evening.— 
     <lb/>
    Well, the honorable gentleman may speak at 
     <lb/>another time. It is only half-past twelve, and 
     <lb/>we may very well sit till two—(oh, oh)—so 
     <lb/>there is plenty of time. And as we know 
     <lb/>very well that the honorable gentlemen be<lb break="no"/>longing to the Opposition are desirous of dis<lb break="no"/>cussing this question at greater length, we 
     <lb/>are willing to listen to what they have to say.

     too much to ask us to sit here after twelve, 
     <lb/>
     night after night. At no time have I ever

     I may or may not desire to trespass upon the

     <lb/>
     close. In case I do not address the House 
     <lb/>
     again, I desire to take this opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     saying that I am entirely in favor of the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions, and that I shall support them cor<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
          
dially, and oppose any amendments which 
     <lb/>
    may be offered to them ; and, in taking that 
     <lb/>course, I am confident that I am doing that 
     <lb/>which will be endorsed almost unanimously 
     <lb/>by my constituents, and which will commend 
     <lb/>itself to at least three-fourths of the people 
     <lb/>of Upper Canada. If I believed that this 
     <lb/>measure was opposed to the wishes of the 
     <lb/>people of Canada, I would be the last man to 
     <lb/>press for a vote upon it until it had been sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to them; but believing, from the clear<lb break="no"/>est evidence, that the scheme meets with the 
     <lb/>almost unanimous approval of the country, I 
     <lb/>think the sooner we bring it into operation 
     <lb/>the better. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD3">MR. JOHN MACDONALD</persName>—I may per<lb break="no"/>haps be allowed to state in explanation, that 
     <lb/>
     the good people of Kent are doubtless favored 
     <lb/>
     with a representative of much clearer views 
     <lb/>
     and sounder judgment than he who repre<lb break="no"/>sents the unfortunate people of Toronto. 
     <lb/>
     But I would just say to that hon. gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     that if he will only look after the interests of 
     <lb/>
     his own constituents, I will try to look after 
     <lb/>
     the interests of mine. There is this difference 
     <lb/>
     between the hon. gentleman and myself, 
     <lb/>
     that when the scheme was first announced, 
     <lb/>
     he took the whole thing down at once, whilst 
     <lb/>
     I thought it too weighty to be thus hastily 
     <lb/>
     disposed of, and required time for reflection. 
     <lb/>
     And the debates which have taken place in 
     <lb/>
     this House—the diversity of opinion amongst 
     <lb/>
     Ministers themselves as to several points of  
     <lb/>
     the scheme—convince me that so far from 
     <lb/>
     its being understood by every man, woman 
     <lb/>
     and child in Upper Canada, as the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Kent stated, and as he would 
     <lb/>
     fain have us believe, it is far from being 
     <lb/>
     understood in the country. I am persuaded 
     <lb/>
     that the course I took was right. I can 
     <lb/>
     only say that, if the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     leaves this House with skirts as clean as I 
     <lb/>
     intend mine shall be when I retire from 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, he will have no cause to reproach 
     <lb/>
     himself for anything he has done during his 
     <lb/>
     political career. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOWL1">HON. MR. HOWLAND</persName>—I desire to say a 
     <lb/>
     few words in reply to what fell from my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend the member for Cornwall 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. J. S. MACDONALD), so that no mis<lb break="no"/>conception should exist on the part of the  
     <lb/>
     members of this House in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     course I thought proper to pursue when I 
     <lb/>
     went before my constituents, after having 
     <lb/>
     accepted the office which I have now the 
     <lb/>
     honor to hold in the Government. From the  
     <lb/>
     honorable  gentleman's remarks,  I  think it 
     <lb/>
     would be inferred that I had accepted office 
     <lb/>

     subject to conditions, and had left it to 
     <lb/>
     be understood that amendments would be 
     <lb/>
     made to the scheme now before the House. 
     <lb/>
     At least such is my impression from what 
     <lb/>
     fell from my honorable friend. I feel ex<lb break="no"/>tremely obliged to the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     for the kind manner in which he has spoken 
     <lb/>
     of me, and I can assure him in return that I 
     <lb/>
     value his opinion and friendship most highly ; 
     <lb/>
      at the same time, it is proper that I should 
     <lb/>
     say a word or two in reference to what he has 
     <lb/>
     stated, in order that no misconception may 
     <lb/>
     possibly exist on the subject. I placed before 
     <lb/>
     my constituents, fairly and fully, my views on 
     <lb/>
     this important question. I indicated to them 
     <lb/>
     that there were some parts of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     which, if I had been a delegate to the Con<lb break="no"/>vention, I should have opposed and en<lb break="no"/>deavored to modify. At the same time, I 
     <lb/>
     stated that we had to accept it as it was, it 
     <lb/>
     being in the nature of a treaty, or reject it.

     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—I am sure

     my honorable friend will not accuse me of a 
     <lb/>
     desire wilfully to misrepresent his position 
     <lb/>
     in reference to this matter. What I meant 
     <lb/>
     to say, if I did not say it, was this, 
     <lb/>
     that the scheme, as a whole, is not such as 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Postmaster General desires—that 
     <lb/>
     he himself told his constituents that he enter<lb break="no"/>tained objections to it ; and on that I argued 
     <lb/>
     that if the scheme was so bad as to be unsatis<lb break="no"/>factory to the members of the Government 
     <lb/>
     themselves, it was not fair to deny to the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition, to whom it was still more dis<lb break="no"/>tasteful, the opportunity of placing on record

     their objections to it. (Hear, hear.)

     The honorable gentleman said—Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, I shall simply say, with respect to this 
     <lb/>
     motion, that we are asked to adopt conclu<lb break="no"/>sions come to by the Conference of delegates 
     <lb/>
     which met in Quebec in October last. It is only 
     <lb/>
     right and proper—it is only fair and reason<lb break="no"/>able—that we, should be placed in possession 
     <lb/>
     of the data upon which these conclusions are 
     <lb/>
     founded. If we are a free British Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, worthy of our position as the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of British freemen, we will insist on 
     <lb/>
     being placed in possession of all the informa<lb break="no"/>tion upon which these resolutions were found<lb break="no"/>ed. I think there can be no reasonable answer 
     <lb/>
     to oppose to this request, and I feel that I 
     <lb/>
     should be doing injustice to the House if I 
     <lb/>
     detained it for one moment longer with any 
     <lb/>
     argument upon the subject. (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—The time men<lb break="no"/>tioned is too short. It would be necessary 
     <lb/>
     to adjourn the debate for two months at least, 
     <lb/>
     in order to get the information here sought. 
     <lb/>
     But there are serious omissions in the reso<lb break="no"/>lution. The honorable gentleman ought to 
     <lb/>
     have asked for the number of engines and 
     <lb/>
     cars proposed to be employed on the railway, 
     <lb/>
     and the amount of traffic which is expected 
     <lb/>
     to be carried backwards and forwards in the 
     <lb/>
     course of a year. (Laughter.) The whole 
     <lb/>
     thing to my mind is ridiculous. (Hear,  hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—I am sur<lb break="no"/>prised, sir, that the honorable member for Cha<lb break="no"/>teauguay should have proposed such a motion 
     <lb/>
     in amendment as this—a motion which has no 
     <lb/>
     affinity whatever to the question under con<lb break="no"/>sideration. In my opinion things should be 
     <lb/>
     called by their right names, and I have not 
     <lb/>
     the least hesitation in saying that this motion, 
     <lb/>
     from the irrelevant matter it contains, is en<lb break="no"/>tirely irregular—that it is, in fact, an absur<lb break="no"/>dity. (Hear, hear.)

     way in which we can make a motion for get<lb break="no"/>ting information from the Government.  The

     amendment proposes that the debate shall be

     to bring down the information which they 
     <lb/>
     had before them during the Conference at 
     <lb/>
     which the resolutions in favor of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion were originated. It cannot be denied 
     <lb/>
     that when the Hon. Finance Minister and his 
     <lb/>
     colleagues agreed that $150,000 should be 
     <lb/>
     paid for the unoccupied lands in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     they must have had some information before 
     <lb/>
     them as to the value of those lands, and whether 
     <lb/>
     they consisted of one acre or a million. There 
     <lb/>
     is no doubt that when they agreed upon what 
     <lb/>
     part of the public debt of Canada should 
     <lb/>
     form part of the debt of the Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     they had a statement laid before them upon 
     <lb/>
     which that agreement was based. If I re<lb break="no"/>collect aright, I saw in the newspapers a state<lb break="no"/>ment that the Conference had adjourned for 
     <lb/>
     a day or two in order to allow the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Ministers of the several provinces to make 
     <lb/>
     up and bring before the Conference a state<lb break="no"/>ment respecting the debts and financial po<lb break="no"/>sitions of the several provinces. Well, this 
     <lb/>
     is all we want to obtain. We want the same 
     <lb/>
     information that the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     had before them when they agreed to those 
     <lb/>
     resolutions in conference. We do not sup<lb break="no"/>pose that they went into the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     these matters without any information before 
     <lb/>
     them. We do not suppose that they merely 
     <lb/>
     guessed that the debt of Canada was $62, 
     <lb/>
     500,000, and guessed in the same way at 
     <lb/>
     the debts of the other provinces. We want 
     <lb/>
     the same opportunity of understanding these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions and of coming to a correct de<lb break="no"/>cision upon them, that the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men themselves enjoyed. We do not want 
     <lb/>
     an hour's delay more than is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     necessary to bring down the information 
     <lb/>
     and enable us to apply it in judging of 
     <lb/>
     the merits of the scheme. (Hear.) Honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen say it will require months to 
     <lb/>
     get the information. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Lambton (Mr. A. MACKENZIE) seems to 
     <lb/>
     be very much afraid to have the information 
     <lb/>
     brought down, lest it would result in the scheme 
     <lb/>
     not being carried. He ought to remember 
     <lb/>
     that we have not the confidence in the Hon<lb break="no"/>orable Attorney General East, nor yet in the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Finance Minister, that he has. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) He has known those gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     for a long time, and the House has had fre<lb break="no"/>quent opportunities, during past sessions, of 
     <lb/>
     observing the amount of confidence he has 
     <lb/>
     always reposed in them. He had a wonderful 
     <lb/>
     amount of confidence in the Honorable Fin<lb break="no"/>ance Minister at the close of last session, when 
     <lb/>
     he voted for the motion respecting the $100,<lb break="no"/>000 handed over to the city of Montreal for 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
         

     the payment of a Grand Trunk railway lia<lb break="no"/>bility. But he will pardon us and exercise a 
     <lb/>
     little patience with us if we, who have never 
     <lb/>
     had that confidence in the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Sherbrooke since he has been Finance Min<lb break="no"/>ister, desire to have a little information before 
     <lb/>
     we vote for the extravagant scheme which he 
     <lb/>
     has brought before us. We want information 
     <lb/>
     mainly respecting the finances, the Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway, and the Crown lands of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and we have no other way of 
     <lb/>
     placing our demand in a shape to be recorded, 
     <lb/>
     since the previous question has been moved, 
     <lb/>
     than by moving for it in amendment to the

     The question being again put on Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General CARTIER's motion, 
            </p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I hold in my hand an amendment which will 
     <lb/>
     exactly suit the ruling of the Chair, as it re<lb break="no"/>lates only to the time to which the debate 
     <lb/>
     shall be adjourned. The very unfair and ar<lb break="no"/>bitrary course which the Government has un<lb break="no"/>fortunately seen fit to pursue, has prevented 
     <lb/>
     the honorable members of this House from 
     <lb/>
     moving any amendments to the scheme pro<lb break="no"/>posed for its adoption ; but I for one am 
     <lb/>
     most desirous, in accordance with the almost 
     <lb/>
     universal wish of the people of the district of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal, to have the question tested whether 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of the people shall be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     be heard before a final decision is come to by 
     <lb/>
     this House. I find that in nineteen French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian counties in that district, resolutions 
     <lb/>
     have been passed in favor of that course, and 
     <lb/>
     petitions have been signed by from fifteen to 
     <lb/>
     twenty thousand inhabitants, asking that no 
     <lb/>
     such scheme be adopted without submit<lb break="no"/>ting it to a vote of the people. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Sir, I think it would have been far 
     <lb/>
     more dignified on thé part of the Government, 
     <lb/>
     and more respectful towards the country, to 
     <lb/>
     have allowed the scheme—which, in their 
     <lb/>
     opinion, will create such prosperity that 
     <lb/>
     everybody will be in ecstacies over it, but 
     <lb/>
     which, in our opinion, will bring on this 
     <lb/>
     country such a state of dissatisfaction as will 
     <lb/>
     perhaps engender some other feeling than 
     <lb/>
     that of union with the Lower Provinces—to 
     <lb/>
     be voted upon by those who are most deeply 
     <lb/>
     interested in it, the people of Canada. But 
     <lb/>
     they have chosen to gag us, in so much that we 
     <lb/>
     have no other course left but to move amend<lb break="no"/>ments to the motion for adjourning the de<lb break="no"/>bate, and that we are determined to avail our<lb break="no"/>selves of. My motion in amendment is :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     That the debate on this resolution, involving 
     <lb/>
     as it does fundamental changes in the political 
     <lb/>
     institutions and in the political relations of this 
     <lb/>
     province, changes which were not in the contem<lb break="no"/>plation of the people at the last general election, 
     <lb/>
     ought, in the opinion of this House, to be adjourned 
     <lb/>
     for one month, or until such time as the people 
     <lb/>
     of this province shall have an opportunity of con<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
        
stitutionally pronouncing their opinions thereon, 
     <lb/>
     by an appeal to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     I do not fix the time arbitrarily in which the 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people shall be made. If hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen are anxious to have the scheme 
     <lb/>
     carried at an early day, they can bring on an 
     <lb/>
     election at once, or they may take their own 
     <lb/>
     time. Let them dissolve the House to-mor<lb break="no"/>row. We are ready for it at any time. The 
     <lb/>
     conduct of the Government in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     procedure of the House upon the great 
     <lb/>
     question they submitted to it, is as disgrace<lb break="no"/>ful as it is derogatory to the dignity of this 
     <lb/>
     House. After coming to a solemn agree<lb break="no"/>ment with the House that the discussion 
     <lb/>
    should go on as if in Committee of the 
     <lb/>Whole, and that consequently amendments 
     <lb/>might be moved, they now distrust the favor<lb break="no"/>able feeling which they told us at the outset 
     <lb/>existed among the people, and now they will 
     <lb/>not allow us to place amendments to the 
     <lb/>scheme in the Speaker's hands. They fear 
     <lb/>to have the question discussed and understood 
     <lb/>among the people. They are wise in their 
     <lb/>generation. They have just beheld the Hon. 
     <lb/>Mr. TILLEY—for ten years past at the head of 
     <lb/>the Government of New Brunswick, and a 
     <lb/>most deservedly popular gentleman—though 
     <lb/>uniting with his own strength that of the 
     <lb/>leaders of the Opposition, swept away 
     <lb/>by the people. (Hear, hear.) Well may 
     <lb/>they tremble for the fate of their scheme 
     <lb/>among the people of Canada. But they do 
     <lb/>not content themselves with simply refusing 
     <lb/>an appeal to the people. They go further 
     <lb/>and refuse the members of this House the op<lb break="no"/>portunity of placing their views before the 
     <lb/>House and country. We are ready to go to 
     <lb/>our constituents at once upon the question, 
     <lb/>and if they say that the scheme is a desira<lb break="no"/>ble one, I for one am prepared to bow 
     <lb/>to the will of the majority. But, sir, 
     <lb/>to bow to a self-constituted delegation— 
     <lb/>an association of honorable gentlemen who 
     <lb/>were never authorised, either by the Par 
     <lb/>liament or people of this province, to meet 
     <lb/>together along with gentlemen from other 
     <lb/>provinces, and concoct a new Constitution for 
     <lb/>the government of the people, and then to 
     <lb/>come to this House and say to it, " You must 
     <lb/>accept this new Constitution in all its details, 
     <lb/>making no change or amendment, nor even 
     <lb/>having the privilege of proposing any amend<lb break="no"/>ments so as to have them placed on the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Jour<lb break="no"/>nals</hi> of this House "—I say the demand that 
     <lb/>we should bow in meek and humble submis<lb break="no"/>sion to that sort of treatment at the hands of 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">770</fw>
         

     the gentlemen on the Treasury benches, is 
     <lb/>
     most monstrous. (Hear, hear.) I cannot 
     <lb/>
     say that under other circumstances, such an 
     <lb/>
     appeal as has just been made from the decision 
     <lb/>
     of the Chair would have been taken, but in 
     <lb/>
     this instance there was no other course left 
     <lb/>
     to the minority to show that they had de<lb break="no"/>manded most important information in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the scheme under discussion. Whe<lb break="no"/>ther it be until a direct appeal can be had to 
     <lb/>
     the people by a general election, or by petitions, 
     <lb/>
     I say the gravity of the question calls for de<lb break="no"/>lay. Never has such extraordinary action 
     <lb/>
     been taken by any government, whether weak 
     <lb/>
     or strong, as has been taken by honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—The Government 
     <lb/>
     having endeavored to checkmate the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to their scheme in the tyrannical way in 
     <lb/>
     which they have done, I think it is only fair 
     <lb/>
     to defeat their object and to stalemate them, 
     <lb/>
     because in point of fact it will amount to that 
     <lb/>
     if we succeed in this motion. I think honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen will admit that in this great 
     <lb/>
     and momentous change which is going to take 
     <lb/>
     place, the people who sent us here are as 
     <lb/>
    deeply interested as we are. They sent us 
     <lb/>here to make laws under the Constitution as 
     <lb/>established, not to overturn the Constitution ; 
     <lb/>and before such a violent change of Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion is made as will, undoubtedly, plunge us 
     <lb/>into most serious expenses, there ought to be 
     <lb/>given them an opportunity of saying whether 
     <lb/>or not they concur in the change proposed. 
     <lb/>It is for this reason I second the resolution in 
     <lb/>amendment, and I hope we shall have for it 
     <lb/>the support of those honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>who, though supporters of the Government, 
     <lb/>have expressed such marked dissent from the 
     <lb/>policy of shutting off amendments by mov<lb break="no"/>ing the previous question.

     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName> said—With 
     <lb/>
     reference to this motion, I have to raise the 
     <lb/>
     same point of order that I brought against 
     <lb/>
     the other one. I beg to say at the out<lb break="no"/>set that the statement that there is to 
     <lb/>
     be no other opportunity of bringing for<lb break="no"/>ward a motion in favor of submitting the 
     <lb/>
     scheme to the people, is all clap-trap. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Peel has given a 
     <lb/>
     notice of a motion on that subject, as a sub<lb break="no"/>stantial proposition on which every hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman will have an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     recording his vote in a regular way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The honorable gentleman then went on to 
     <lb/>
     discuss the point of order, giving several 
     <lb/>
     reasons for considering it irregular. The dis<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
         
cussion of the points raised was also taken 
     <lb/>
     part in by Hon. Messrs. GALT, HOLTON, 
     <lb/>
     DORION, J. S. MACDONALD, and Mr. MORRIS] 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">THE SPEAKER</persName> ruled the motion out 
     <lb/>
     of order. He said that the practice in such 
     <lb/>
     cases appeared to be for the Speaker to 
     <lb/>
     eliminate from such motions all that was 
     <lb/>
     irregular, and if the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     who prepared the motion consented to that, 
     <lb/>
     to put it to the House as it then stood. If 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member would not consent, why 
     <lb/>
     the motion fell to the ground. If the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Hochelaga would consent, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, to his eliminating from the motion 
     <lb/>
     all but that which referred to the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment, he (the Speaker) would put it to the 
     <lb/>
     House. If not, he would be obliged to rule 
     <lb/>
     it out of order.

     MR. CHAMBERS said—The position of 
     <lb/>
     the speaker who comes towards the last in a 
     <lb/>
     debate is, if disadvantageous in some respects, 
     <lb/>
     at least advantageous in others. If from 
     <lb/>
     the ability of gentlemen who have preceded 
     <lb/>
     him, and from their logical and argument<lb break="no"/>ative powers, most that could have been said 
     <lb/>
     has been said—if, from the ample store of 
     <lb/>
     knowledge they possess, numerous ideas 
     <lb/>
     have been advanced, and logical conclusions 
     <lb/>
     drawn therefrom, there is at least this advan<lb break="no"/>tage to their successors in the debate, that 
     <lb/>
     they have the benefit of those conclusions, 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of those ideas and of that 
     <lb/>
     knowledge. And although a subsequent 
     <lb/>
     speaker may be unable to advance new 
     <lb/>
     theories, or even adduce new arguments, he 
     <lb/>
     can at least compare the opinions and the 
     <lb/>
     views of those who have preceded him. I may 
     <lb/>
     state in the outset that 1 had hoped, at the 
     <lb/>
     commencement of this debate, to have heard 
     <lb/>
     it announced that this Legislature would be 
     <lb/>
     allowed the privilege of amending such of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions submitted as they might, upon 
     <lb/>
     earnest and careful examination, have deemed 
     <lb/>
     necessary. I had hoped, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
     <lb/>
     some latitude would be allowed to this Legis<lb break="no"/>lature in suggesting improvements and
